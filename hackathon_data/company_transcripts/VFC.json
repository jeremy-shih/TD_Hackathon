Welcome to the VF Corporation Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019ll turn the conference over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Joe Alkire. Please go ahead, sir.","Joe Alkire","Good morning, and welcome to VF Corporation's second quarter 2017 earnings call. Participants on today's call will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These uncertainties are detailed in documents filed regularly with the SEC. Unless otherwise noted, amounts that our participants refer to on today's call will be in adjusted and currency-neutral terms, which we defined in the press release that was issued this morning. We use adjusted and currency-neutral amounts as lead numbers in our discussion because we feel they more accurately represent the true operational performance and underlying results of our business.","You may also hear us refer to reported amounts, which are in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reconciliations of GAAP measures to adjusted and currency-neutral amounts can be found in the supplemental financial tables included in the press release, which identify and quantify all excluded items and provide management's view of why this information is useful to investors.","During the second quarter of 2017, the Company completed the sale of its Licensed Sports Group or LSG business. In conjunction with the LSG divestiture, VF executed its plan to entirely exit the licensing business, which comprises the LSG and JanSport brand collegiate businesses. Accordingly, the Company has classified the assets and liabilities of these businesses as held for sale and included the results of these businesses in discontinued operations for all periods presented.","During the third quarter of 2016, the Company completed the sale of its Contemporary Brands businesses. Accordingly, the Company has classified the assets and liabilities of Contemporary Brands businesses as held for sale, and included the results of these businesses in discontinued operations for all periods presented. Unless otherwise noted, results presented on today's call are based on continuing operations.","Joining me on today's call will be VF's President and CEO, Steve Rendle; and Chief Financial Officer, Scott Roe. Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call for questions. Steve?","Steven E. Rendle","Great. Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. The pace of change in both our industry and the broader consumer landscape continues to happen at accelerated rate. 2017 is the year of making transformational moves as we begin to evolve VF and our brands to become more consumer and retail centric in everything we do.","Six months into the first year of our 2021 strategy, our results are right in line with our expectations, and in fact, we\u2019re doing so much better than we anticipated. Our improved performance in the face of an unpredictable retail environment around the world demonstrates the strength of our brand portfolio and diversified value creation model. We're in the early phases of our journey to become a more agile and consumer centric organization and we are encouraged by our strong start to 2017.","During the second quarter, revenue increased 3% which was slightly ahead of our expectations as core growth engines continued to accelerate. Our big three brands, Vans, The North Face and Timberland, grew at a combined rate of 7%. Our international business grew 6%, including 18% growth in China. Direct-to-consumer grew 14% and our digital business was up more than 35% and growth accelerated to 8% in Workwear.","Our digital wholesale accounts, a key growth driver for VF over the next five years also increased at a high single-digit rate through the first half of 2017. Gross margin improved 160 basis points, an exceptional performance which again exceeded our expectations. ","VF's brands are strong. We remain disciplined in our renewed focus on elevating our creative capabilities, specifically in product design to enrich consumers brand experience, coupled with stronger marketplace management, is driving more profitable growth and further strengthening our brand equity.","EPS was $0.29 in the quarter at the high-end of the range we guided to in April. We also repurchased an incremental $200 million of stock which when combined with our strong dividend brings our anticipated total cash returns to shareholders in 2017 to more than $1.8 billion. Strengthening total shareholder return remains a top priority.","As we look to the second half of 2017, we are gaining momentum across key dimensions of our business, and we see several catalysts on the horizon to ignite accelerated growth and value creation in our core growth engines.","As a result, we are raising our full-year 2017 revenue outlook to $11.65 billion based on stronger-than-expected growth in our Outdoor & Action sports business most notably Vans and The North Face brands, D2C and Workwear.","Additionally, for the second consecutive quarter we are raising our gross margin guidance now to 49.8%. Our strong gross margin performance is a central element of our diversified value creation model. It provides us the flexibility and fuel to accelerate investment and drive growth behind our largest opportunities.","In light of our increased revenue growth in gross margin expectations, we are investing an additional $40 million or $0.08 per share in 2017 to amplify our momentum and fuel accelerated growth as we move into 2018. Our 2017 EPS outlook is now $2.94, which reflects the high-end of our previous outlook and includes the incremental investment just mentioned.","Earlier this year, I said that VF is a value creation company and some wondered what that meant. This quarter's results begin to provide evidence of our commitment to value creation. We're in the business of creating catalysts through our strong portfolio of diverse global brands. We will continue to reshape our portfolio and accelerate growth, and while we expect the retail landscape to remain uncertain, we will invest against our largest growth opportunities to create momentum rather than wait for it.","With that, let's review our second quarter results and dive deeper into our top five brands, Workwear and Sportswear. Starting with The North Face brand. Global revenue increased 6% driven by a 26% increase in Europe, and a 1% growth in both the Americas and Asia.","Revenue growth during the quarter was driven by strong results from our D2C business, which increased at a mid-teen rate. Wholesale was relatively flat for the quarter. However, excluding the impact of bankruptcies in the Americas, which didn't really start to impact us into the second half of 2016, global revenue for The North face increased at a high single-digit rate.","For the first half of 2017, global revenue for The North Face increased 7% or 9% excluding the impact of bankruptcies just mentioned. By region, revenue growth in the Americas was driven by mid-teen growth in D2C with strong results from digital, which grew more than 40% in the quarter. This was partially offset by a high single-digit decrease in wholesale due in large part to the impact of bankruptcies. ","Turning to product performance. The success of the Apex Flex jacket continued with Outside magazine naming it one of the best summer jackets of 2017.","And we can't forget to mention The North Face Athlete Alex Honnold, who made climbing history when he completed the first free-solo ascent of El Capitan in Yosemite. I\u2019m not if sure everyone can appreciate just how remarkable the steep was. A 3,000 foot granite wall in less than four hours, climbing alone and without safety gear with only his shoes, shorts, and chalk bag. The mental and physical strength required are beyond comprehension. Alex your passion encouraged, an inspiration to us all. Thank you for being the perfect embodiment of The North Face spirit of exploration.","In Europe, consumer demand for North Face brand remains very strong across the region. Our wholesale business was particularly solid with growth of nearly 40% and D2C grew at a high single-digit rate. The brand has tremendous momentum as we move into the second half of the year. Based on the forward-looking visibility we have into our order books as well as broad-based strength across key product categories in markets, we expect more than 15% growth for the balance of 2017.","In Asia, second quarter revenue sequentially improved as high teen growth in D2C was partially offset by an expected high teen decline in wholesale. From a product standpoint, outdoor training launched on April 1 with more than 40% sell-through, supported by the I Train For marketing campaign across the region and the opening of the first global outdoor training station in Shanghai.","Our urban exploration territory also continues to perform very well in Asia, providing consumers an opportunity to experience the brand new use occasions. While the outdoor environment remains highly promotional in China, and we continue to consolidate our retail partners and aggressively manage inventory in the marketplace, we expect accelerated growth in the second half of 2017, including mid single-digit growth in the third quarter.","There is no change to our mid single-digit growth expectation for The North Face brand in 2017. That being said, based on our strong first half performance, current order book visibility, and increased confidence for the balance of the year, we now expect growth to be at the higher end of that mid single-digit range.","Regarding the shape of our second half performance, fewer off-price sales and a significant shift in the timing of our order books from September to October, which Scott will touch on later, will likely result in a mid single-digit decline in revenue for the third quarter. Normalizing for the timing shift, however, revenue growth for the third quarter would be in the low to mid single-digit range.","Now to our largest and fastest-growing brand, Vans. Global revenue was up 9% with 7% growth in the Americas, 5% growth in Europe, and 29% growth in Asia. From a channel perspective, D2C increased more than 25% with 45% growth in our digital business. As expected, wholesale declined at a low single-digit rate.","In the Americas, our D2C business remained strong with more than 20% growth in the quarter, including over 25% growth in digital and high teen comp growth. Wholesale declined at a mid single-digit rate pressured primarily by conditions in the family channel where we are in the midst of a product transition and up against strong distribution gains a year-ago. Based on current visibility as well as a significant momentum we have in the business, we now expect low double-digit growth in the Americas in 2017.","Vans brand growth extends across multiple product categories and families. While the Old Skool has recently become the number one classic style, the iconic slip on and checkerboard styles and designs are seeing tremendous growth, up more than 65% in the quarter, targeting the core skate community, the new athlete inspired UltraRange Pro was recently launched and at a $90 price point, saw real strength in the market with more than 70% sell-through in skate and board sport accounts.","Vans product collaborations have always been incredibly popular with consumers and the [indiscernible] Co-Lab was no exception. And last, but not least, our powerful customs platform which blends the experiential with the transactional increased at a triple digit rate and is the only -- and is only beginning to tap its full potential in the market as we add functionality each month.","In Europe, the Vans business is performing better than expected, as demand continues to accelerate. Our D2C performance was exceptional with more than 20% growth driven by more than 40% increase in digital and 20% comp growth. In line with the expectations, wholesale declined at a low single-digit rate due to the timing of shipments.","Based on stronger-than-expected second half orders, we now expect our Vans Europe business to increase at a low double-digit rate for 2017, including strong high teen growth in the second half of this year.","In Asia, our Vans business is firing on all cylinders delivering almost 30% growth, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of more than 20% growth in the region. Results during the quarter were powered by 45% growth in D2C with strength across all markets, including almost 80% growth in digital, in China.","Looking to our outlook for 2017, we now expect global revenue growth for Vans to be at the high-end of our low double-digit growth range. As expected, Timberland return to growth in the second quarter as global revenue increased 3% in line with our low single-digit growth outlook for the year. Growth was nicely balanced with a mid single-digit increase in D2C, and a low single-digit increase in wholesale.","Timberland brand revenue in the Americas increased 4% with high single-digit growth in D2C, including 25% growth in digital and low single-digit growth in wholesale. Our non-classics business increased at a low double-digit rate during the quarter with more than 100% growth in our new platforms, including SensorFlex and AeroCore.","Our Timberland PRO business also remained very strong with more than 20% growth. Our growth strategy is gaining traction as we work to diversify in North America business toward a more balanced assortment. The strong sell-through we are seeing with our non-classics products gives us confidence, we can drive accelerated growth in the second half of 2017 and into next year.","In Europe, Timberland brand revenue was up 4% in the second quarter driven by low double-digit growth in D2C, partially offset by a modest decline in wholesale. Growth across the region is strong and broad-based with more than 35% growth in our new platforms such as SensorFlex and AeroCore and high single-digit growth in apparel. Our European business has good momentum and is expected to deliver high single-digit growth in the second half of 2017.","Timberland's Asia business improved sequentially, but was down 1% as D2C declined at a low single-digit rate and wholesale was in line with last year. High single-digit comp growth, including more than 50% growth in digital revenue was offset by our strategic decision to close underperforming doors in some of our more mature markets. At the same time, our new footwear plus D2C concept is performing well across the region and we continue to achieve scale and significant momentum in China as revenue increased an impressive 60%.","Regarding the shape of our second half performance similar to The North Face brand, a significant shift in the timing of our order books will likely result in a low single-digit decline in revenue for the third quarter. However, when normalizing for the timing shift, revenue growth for the third quarter will likely be in the low single-digit range. There's no change to our low single-digit growth outlook for Timberland brand in 2017.","Moving to the Wrangler brand, as expected, global revenue for the second quarter was down 2%. D2C increased at a low double-digit rate, but was offset by a low single-digit decline in wholesale. Revenue in the Americas declined 2%, while revenue in Europe increased 5% and Asia which represents less than 3% of global brand revenue declined at a low double-digit rate for the quarter, primarily because of the continuing demand weakness in India primarily related to fiscal policy changes.","As we outlined in April, our U.S business continues to be impacted by inventory destocking related to the strategic repositioning of a key customer and channel consolidation. And while our forward visibility remains low, and the quarter-to-quarter variability is difficult to predict, we do believe we're on track to return to moderate growth in the second half of this year, most notably in the fourth quarter. And we\u2019re seeing strong growth with our digital wholesale partners and in our own wrangler.com business.","Our efforts to elevate the brand and extend more deeply into new channels, such as department stores and specialty retail are showing early signs of success. From a product perspective, the 70th anniversary Retro Glory collection continues to attract new and existing consumers with strong sell-through globally, and to wrap up the Wrangler brand, our outdoor line is performing very well.","Now to the Lee brand. Revenue declined 6% with 25% growth in D2C offset by a low double-digit decline in wholesale. The Lee Americas business was down 9%, as ongoing channel weakness and consolidations, as well as difficult market conditions in our women's product more than offset solid performance in our men's business. Xtreme Comfort khakis and Extreme Motion Denim are clearly resonating with the male Lee consumer.","Lee Europe was down 4%, as low single-digit growth in D2C was offset by a mid single-digit decline in wholesale. In Asia, revenue declined slightly as mid single-digit growth in China was offset by ongoing weakness in India. Our women's business in China increased at a double-digit rate powered by our BODY OPTIX and Jade Fusion innovations, which should drive improved performance in the second half of 2017.","Turning now to Imagewear. Revenue was up 12% in the quarter due in part to LSG jersey sales. As part of the transition agreement with Fanatics, which acquired our licensing business early this year, we will supply jerseys for one-year following the transaction.","Excluding the impact of LSG jersey revenue, our Image business was up 2% and consistent with our growing optimism about our Workwear platform, which includes our Image business as well as our Timberland PRO and Wrangler RIGGS workwear, revenue growth accelerated to 8% in the quarter with at least 20% growth in three of our largest brands, Timberland PRO, Bulwark, and Wrangler RIGGS workwear.","We are very bullish on the Workwear space and are clearly advantaged owner in our highest return on capital business. In addition to the macro tailwinds we see forming, we have a unique opportunity to drive accelerated growth and value creation in a highly fragmented market. We will accelerate growth by leveraging our expertise, capabilities, and platforms with some of the strongest brands in the sector.","With this solid performance and favorable outlook, we now expect Image revenue to increase at a mid single-digit rate in 2017, excluding the LSG jersey business and up from our previous estimate of a low single-digit rate increase.","Looking at Sportswear. Revenue is showing signs of stabilization and profit has improved. Congratulations to our new management team, which is beginning to make progress in a difficult environment.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.","A - Scott A. Roe","Thanks, Steve. Our second quarter results were right in line with our expectations and came in at the high-end of the range we communicated back in April. Revenue growth accelerated to 3% during the quarter, driven by strong results from our core growth engines. Our big three brands were up 7% on a combined basis, led by strength in Vans and The North Face brands, which grew 9% and 6%, respectively.","As expected, Timberland delivered 3% growth in the quarter and our Workwear businesses increased 8% collectively, with Timberland PRO, Bulwark and Wrangler RIGGS, all achieving at least 20% growth.","Our international business grew 6% with consistent growth across all three regions. China remains our fastest-growing market, generating 18% growth and we were particularly encouraged to see that our direct-to-consumer business was up 14% including more than 35% growth in our digital business. That's even more impressive when you consider that our store count is down from the prior quarter and our growth rate accelerated.","Our Outdoor & Action Sports, Jeanswear, and international businesses all achieved high teen D2C growth during the quarter. Our D2C business has significant momentum as we head into the second half of the year, but more on that in a minute.","Consistent with our expectations, wholesale revenue declined 2% primarily due to the channel pressures in our Jeanswear North American business, which as -- which we previously discussed. International delivered low single-digit growth and our digital wholesale accounts grew at a high single-digit rate through the first half.","Gross margin remained strong at 49.7%, up 80 basis points which includes an 80 basis point negative impact from changes in FX. That is 160 basis point increase currency neutral and better than our prior expectations.","As we discussed, we remain sharply focused on fundamentals even at the expense of a little bit of revenue growth in the near-term. First half gross margins of 49.9% were up 180 basis points currency neutral. Our strong gross margin performance is a core element of the diversified value creation model that provides us with flexibility and fuel to accelerate investment and drive growth behind our largest opportunities.","SG&A as a percentage of revenue was up 210 basis points to 42.6% in the quarter. To address a question likely on your mind, let me take a few minutes and provide more context around the shape of our expense and investment profile this year. And keep in mind that the second quarter is the lowest volume quarter of the year, so our SG&A ratios are always a little distorted.","While we remain diligent with respect to overall expense control, we are making deliberate growth focused investments in our strategic priorities, D2C and in particular digital, product innovation, demand creation, and technology. In fact, through the first half, our investment in these areas account for more than all of the SG&A increase versus last year, as our focus on agility and cost optimization allowed us to reduce cost elsewhere.","As we told you in Boston, at our Investor Day, we\u2019ve made the strategic decision in 2017 to begin investing now rather than wait for our anticipated growth acceleration in the second half. In fact, we've committed an additional $40 million of investments in demand creation and strategic priorities this year. Our investments will accelerate growth as we move into 2018 and it's to our advantage to move quickly and take the offensive [ph].","Our brands are strong and in a marketplace that continues to experience significant disruption, we believe we have a unique investment and growth opportunity when many of our competitors are on their heels. So putting this all together, this means that we expect SG&A to deleverage through the first three quarters of this year. As our growth accelerates in the fourth quarter and we began to realize the benefit of our agility and cost optimization efforts, we expect to drive significant leverage in SG&A in the second half and into 2018.","Second quarter operating margin declined 130 basis points to 7.1% including a 70 basis point negative impact from changes in FX, as well as the growth investments just mentioned. So carrying all this to the bottom line, our EPS of $0.29 was in line with prior-year on a currency neutral basis.","Turning to the balance sheet, our inventory increased 3% slightly less than our second half growth expectation. During the quarter, we repurchased about $760 million of stock bringing our total share repurchase to 1.2 billion so far this year. That's $200 million higher than our previous expectation and when combined with our strong dividend brings our anticipated total cash return to shareholders in 2017 to more than $1.8 billion. That\u2019s an 8% cash flow yield based on our current market cap.","The first half was in line with or slightly better than we expected, based on the momentum we have in our business and the additional investments we're making to fuel accelerated growth, we are raising our outlook for the full-year.","Our updated 2017 outlook now includes the following: reported revenue is expected to be up 2% or 3% on a currency neutral basis to $11.65 billion. This compares to our previous expectation of low single-digit increase. Our increased revenue outlook is driven by strength in Outdoor & Action Sports, particularly Vans and The North Face, increased expectation for D2C most notably digital and higher growth from our Workwear businesses.","Gross margin is now expected to improve about 40 basis points to 49.8%, which still includes a 70 basis point headwind from FX. This represents a 20 basis point improvement relative to our previous outlook of 49.6%. Operating margin is still expected to approximate 14% on a reported basis including about a 60 basis point negative impact from changes in FX.","EPS is now expected to be $2.94, down 1% on a reported basis, but up at a mid single-digit rate on a currency neutral basis. Our outlook now includes $0.08 per share or $40 million pre-tax impact from additional investments to fuel accelerated growth into 2018. As a reminder, our prior EPS outlook was a range of $2.89 to $2.94.","Now let me provide a few comments regarding the shape of our second half. As it relates to the third quarter, which has historically represented the peak for fall shipments, we\u2019ve seen a significant shift in order book timing from the end of September to early October, simply put as consumers by a closer to need, our key retail partners are setting their floors later which pushes our shipments from what has traditionally been Q3 and to Q4.","And while we have visibility to the orders, the shift has pushed almost $100 million of wholesale revenue into Q4 compared to a year-ago. As a result, we expect revenue growth in the third quarter to be in the low single-digit range and EPS to be in the range of $1.09 to $1.12. Normalizing for the wholesale timing shift, our revenue and EPS growth rate for Q3 would be in the mid single-digit range.","Some with the first half behind us, we are confident in our increased growth outlook and have good momentum as we move into the second half of the year. Our core growth engines are delivering high single-digit growth, our gross margin is strong, our fundamentals are intact, and we are investing in our future growth drivers.","And as Steve mentioned, given our momentum and the confidence we have in our growth plan, we're putting more investment behind our largest brands and growth platforms and returning more cash to shareholders. We will create momentum, not wait for it.","If you take away one thing from our comments, I hope that one thing is confidence. Confidence in our outlook, confidence in our brands and our people, and confidence in our strategy.","I\u2019m going to close by addressing the topic I know is top of mind for many investors, the M&A environment. As you recall, reshaping our portfolio is the number one choice in our 2021 strategy. We are committed to active portfolio management. As we\u2019ve said, we believe we are a value creation company. We have a robust pipeline of opportunities and the activity has increased over the past few months, and we continue to evaluate the shape of our existing portfolio. We look forward to keeping you updated our progress.","With that, I'll turn it back to the operator and we will open the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will have our first question from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities.","Robert Drbul","Hi, guys. Good morning.","Steven E. Rendle","Good morning, Bob.","Scott A. Roe","Good morning, Bob.","Robert Drbul","I guess, the two questions, the first one is more on when you look at the third quarter expectation in some of the detail, on like the order book or the changes in the order book, have there been any material changes to the total number or it's just a shift into the third or the timing of it? And the second question that I have is, around the Jeanswear business, can you just give us an update on the transition its underway? Is there really a site line to stabilization in the Jeanswear business where the profit pressures are pretty significant?","Scott A. Roe","So Bob, I will take the first part of that. First of all, our visibility versus what you guys can see is really what we tried to bridge here, right. We -- there is really no change in what we see for the full-year relative to the order books. It's -- we\u2019re just talking about a little bit of a shift in timing. And just to put that in perspective, we are literally talking about a couple weeks. But that's the difference between Q3 and Q4. So, absolutely no change in the big picture. Just a little bit of timing between Q3 and Q4. That's why we tried to zoom out and say if you look at the second half, it's kind of in that mid single-digit range and normalizing, but you\u2019re going to see a little of noise when you compare to last year when you specifically look at just the third quarter.","Steven E. Rendle","And Bob your Jeanswear question, really there is little new news and little change to what we\u2019ve talked about in the past. The big room -- big picture remains the same, but our visibility is not great and we expect variability as we continue through the year though. We do see a line of sight to an uptick coming back in the fourth quarter. And it's important to remember, in our Jeanswear business our international business continues to be strong, especially in China where we see our Lee women's business continue to grow at double-digit great growth rates behind the two innovations, Body Optix and Jade Fusion. I think once we get through the destocking phase, velocity will increase and that's where I think, we, VF really comes into play and our ability to respond quickly with the strength of our supply chain and the quality of our team that works on that business not to be able to really read and react quickly to be back -- right back in the game.","Robert Drbul","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","We will go next to Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. With respect to your cold weather businesses, specifically North Face, but also Timberland, is your view that you\u2019re retail partners have ordered to reasonable end demand for a normal cold-weather season or are we in a stage here where they\u2019re ordering very, very tight and looking to chase, and have you based your orders on what you're pulling in terms of inventory, in terms of their orders, or have you put yourself in a position where you have excess inventory in order to chase into that demand?","Steven E. Rendle","Yes. Hi, Lindsay. This is Steve. I would characterize the outdoor specialty in even more broadly, the Outdoor Community as buying very tight, with -- two years in a row, multi-years where we\u2019ve seen variable winters. Retailers are playing it very close to the best. They\u2019re investing behind those brands, that have momentum and bringing those truly innovative products. Our inventory, we -- as you know, we buy to our order book with a real thoughtful amount of reorder around key styles within each of these brands. I would tell you where the strength sits for us. It's in the performance of our D2C and you saw in this quarter where our comps are strong, our digital is exceptional, and I really would put that behind -- the marketplace is clean. And we're sitting in an environment where -- it's to the rest of the year. We're not -- our ability to chase is limited from a wholesale and probably where if as we see momentum in digital and D2C. That's really our opportunity from -- if strong trends continue. ","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Got it. And Scott, could you just walk through the drivers of the gross margin improvement in the quarter? I know you talked about FX, but anything specific to channel shift, direct versus wholesale, cost, pricing, etcetera to break down the change that we saw in the quarter would be helpful?","Scott A. Roe","Yes, sure. So there is about 80 basis points of negative impact from FX. I think it was in the prepared remarks. So that means about 160 currency neutral. That mix has been really consistent at that 50 to 60 basis points, and we saw the mix come in through, that's our D2C, digital, international businesses being strong. Remember also we talked in February about the shape of cost, right. So cost through the first half is a tailwind to us. It turns to a little bit of headwind in the second half. For the full-year, it's really not much of a factor. So we're seeing a little bit of benefit now that will turn negative in the second half and -- but really not a huge factor like I said. And then, the other thing is honestly just better fundamentals. We\u2019ve reduced our off-price sales. We\u2019re focused on -- not bringing excess inventory into the channel and we're seeing more full price sell-through along with better D2C and digital. Those things are all pretty virtuous from a gross margin standpoint.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Great. Thanks so much.","Scott A. Roe","Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Michael Binetti, UBS.","Michael Binetti","Congrats on a nice quarter. I want to ask you about the $40 million in incremental investment. Obviously, we just went through -- the big five-year outlook with an investment plan there, and so now we\u2019ve got $40 million on top of it. I just want to ask at a high-level, as you think about that, what are some of the areas that you're seeing? Is it more recent stuff that you\u2019ve seen as an opportunity, you decided to dial-up $40 million or is it just extending things from the Analyst Day and then -- obviously, how do you think about the payback on dialing that up, as you\u2019ve already gave an initial plan? How does that $40 million flow-through to your earnings outlook, maybe in the [indiscernible]?","Steven E. Rendle","Yes, Michael. This is Steve. So, really it's based on our confidence. As we look at where we are year-to-date and what we -- line of sight to what we have for the balance of year, we just have confidence in what we'd like to do, and what we've chosen to do is thoughtfully invest behind a select number of our strategic choices that we outlined in Boston to get us moving into 2018 where we talked about maintaining and building continued momentum. So about a quarter of that $40 million is going against demand creation within our big three brands in D2C and digital. We expect that to have an impact this year and into next year, but half is around specific strategic priorities. Design and innovation, data and analytics, our digital platform, absolutely continuing to move on advanced manufacturing and innovation projects we have in play there and then talent. Talent really is the great driver for us long-term and we are continuing to look at acquiring as well as developing key talent to help us grow long-term.","Michael Binetti","Got it. And then, on North Face specifically, I think the one thing we heard coming out of the Analyst Day was, I think we\u2019ve some new leadership there. So maybe there would be some more -- more material update to the strategy after the Analyst Day. I would love to check in on that, how you guys are feeling about innovation for the year and then also just a little bit more on some of the strength you're seeing in Europe? Where is that coming from? It's been several quarters now of very, very big growth above what you see across, I guess, a lot of the channels in Europe from other companies. So I\u2019d love to hear a little bit more about what's driving that business?","Scott A. Roe","Yes, and I would love to talk about that. I think you remember, in Boston, we introduced you to Arne Arens, who at that point had been the leader of our European business and we are moving him to be the GM of the Americas business. He has since been appointed the President of the Global North Face business and just bringing that, that strong leadership presence and vision that he had in Europe to our total global business. And you just really see that in very short order, the confidence, that -- now sits within that broader North Face team, the clarity of focus against their strategy and you\u2019re starting to see the momentum in our D2C business, specifically. I will answer your point on what -- as we think about year and innovation. The Apex Flex jacket, which came out in the spring was a really good beginning to seeing new products move into the marketplace. This fall you're going to see dramatically updated Summit Series collection and there is a jacket in their called the Ventrix, that we're very excited about that not only plays into the Tier 1 aspect of the marketplace, but also into our -- into some of the broader market partners. We also see some new ski lines coming in conjunction with the focus on mountain sports. And then urban exploration, more of that North Face lifestyle presentation that just gets us into a broader set of usage occasions. I think what you see going on in Europe, really is a much tighter focus. If you remember couple of years ago, we went through a reset there as well and Arne led the -- the return to growth through a much, much more focused integrated marketplace management and significant segmentation tailoring and merchandising line, specifically to wholesale partners as well as our own D2C. And as that momentum builds, you\u2019re seeing those results not only in our first half, but in our expectation of getting that mid teen growth through the balance of 2017. So this speaks to the benefit of quality leadership, clarity of vision, and focusing on creating products and brand experiences that consumers can be drawn into.","Michael Binetti","I guess, just to follow that really quickly, is -- we can see as it go through your stores, in the U.S now some of the bigger ones starting to get segmented harder between the four different North Face segments. Is the thinking that we can really follow that similar road map has driven such nice growth rates in Europe. In U.S., I guess, as you pull back on some of the wholesale doors, in the U.S., you can -- you still think there is pretty good growth rates ahead for the North Face as you start pushing out similar segmentation strategy here in the D2C side?","Scott A. Roe","We absolutely do, Michael. I mean, I think you remember at Boston we talked about a brand that would grow, 6% to 8% on a five-year CAGR. We just raised our guidance this year to the high-end of our mid single, which is at the low-end of that 6% to 8% growth CAGR that we posted for the five-year. So we have great confidence. Just move into these four specific brand territories, just allows our product team and the marketing team to focus on these key usage occasions for our core consumer. Speaking to the core consumer, but also attracting new consumers and you see that in Europe, you see that in Asia, and we have great confidence that that will absolutely work here in the domestic market.","Michael Binetti","Okay. Thanks a lot, Scott.","Operator","We will go next to Camilo Lyon, Canaccord Genuity.","Camilo Lyon","Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. How are you?","Steven E. Rendle","Hey, Camilo.","Camilo Lyon","I was hoping you could speak a little bit about your endeavors around accelerating your speed [ph] to market capabilities and where do you see -- which brands you see the most opportunity and that impacting the P&L, first to last I think that\u2019s clearly a function that you guys are working hard to have and already achieved in, but I\u2019m curious to know where your thoughts on how you can really leverage that to your benefit so you can expect more from your D2C goals across the brand?","Steven E. Rendle","Right. What we talked a little about this Camilo in Boston, and it's a foundational element of our new five-year strategy. It's one of those key choices around transforming to be more consumer and retail centric. And what we\u2019re looking at there is really the end-to-end process of product creation and everything to do with going to market. We've got a number of projects underway with our largest brands, where we\u2019re really tearing down the timelines of product creation, as well as manufacturing and looking at where can we take time out, how can we use digital technology to advance our ability to be more agile. But it's also true, the integrated marketplace strategy, segmentation, and merchandising very specific collections to the distribution choice and building really well articulated -- well merchandised collections and flowing them in a more relevant and consistent way. So moving away from this old wholesale model, that you\u2019ve seen so many people do over the years to being present more often through more thoughtfully merchandised lines and its challenging every aspect of our product creation cycle. Our supply chain is deeply involved in this project and really helping shepherd how our product creation teams are looking at this, and how they can be more integrated in thoughtful, in improving our speed to market.","Camilo Lyon","Does it right to think that North Face maybe the brand that feels the benefits of the first as you layer on the innovation that you\u2019re talking about, [indiscernible] of your four categories and how you\u2019re improving the global process?","Steven E. Rendle","The North Face is certainly one of those brands, that\u2019s deep into the work. And I think each one of our big brands will benefit, but to your point specifically yes, The North Face will benefit being -- thinking through the lens of four specific territories, across each of the regions into each of the specific channels. When you can focus on doing fewer things better, the results typically are always very positive.","Camilo Lyon","And then, Scott, since you brought it up, I was just curious to get your latest thoughts on if your hunting ground for acquisition has changed or has evolved, I would assume that the discussion, well -- tell me if the discussions have changed to become a little bit more fluid with respect to valuations and if that\u2019s -- if there's been a closer dialog with respect to the [indiscernible] grounds of where buyers and sellers [indiscernible]?","Scott A. Roe","Well, I guess, I\u2019d answer it this way, Camilo. One of the nice byproducts of the disruption and carnage in our sector is the fact that valuations are coming a little bit our way and given our strong balance sheet the cash that we generate, that puts us as an advantaged acquirer in the space. So valuation as I try to say is only one component of the equation, right. And it has to be, first of all, the right brand, the right space, and something that we\u2019re an advantaged owner to make it -- make sense. But given that, valuation is always going to be a key component and valuations in general are moving our directions. So I would say it's a slightly more favorable environment compared to say the last 12 the 24 months.","Camilo Lyon","And then for your hunting ground, is that -- it used to be, if I recall correctly, you\u2019re focused on the Outdoor & Action Sports face, footwear was a key category that you\u2019ve been looking at, is that evolve?","Steven E. Rendle","Yes, Camilo. This is Steve. I'll take that. If you remember back in Boston, I stated pretty clearly that, I\u2019d really like the external world to not think of us as an Outdoor & Action Sports company, but as a value creation company. That is deeply informed by our understanding of our core consumer, anchored in our powerful brands and certainly a center of gravity sitting in Outdoor & Action Sports, but it's less about really the -- the sector and it's more about the consumer usage occasions. And where can we find a way to bring our skills and capabilities and the benefits of our platforms to bear it to unlock these new pools of value. The number one choice in our integrated strategy is reshaping our portfolio and we are extremely committed to doing just that in aligning our portfolio to be consistent with our financial aspirations.","Camilo Lyon","Got it. Thanks a lot guys. Good luck.","Operator","We will go next to Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie.","Laurent Vasilescu","Good morning and congrats on the continued momentum in the business. I want to follow up on the incremental investment. In terms of the $0.08 impact, how should we think about it between 3Q and 4Q? And can we potentially further parse out in basis points the SG&A deleverage anticipated for the third quarter versus the leverage expected for the fourth quarter?","Scott A. Roe","Good morning, Laurent. I would expect a question like that as you're building that massive model. The -- we haven't really shaped it, but Steve made a comment and some of that is in the second quarter. You saw some of that incremental investment. We even got going in the second quarter and it's relatively balanced through the third and fourth. This is the way I would answer that. So the -- and from a gross margin standpoint, we've talked to you about the full-year, you know with the first half is, you can assume that's fairly linear through the back half. So I think that gives you the pieces to shape the second half of the year and model it out reasonably well.","Laurent Vasilescu","Okay. Super helpful. And then a non-modeling question. A number of key vendors like Nike and Ralph Lauren have recently outlined efforts to edit this. Can you count going forward? Your March Investor Day, I think the term editing the portfolio with you several times, so aside from any potential divestitures or acquisitions, are there any internal processes you may be putting in place around [indiscernible] assortment to further drive the gross margin over time?","Steven E. Rendle","Yes. Laurent, that is real key to the transformation project that I answer just a little bit ago. As you think about integrated marketplace and what's the correct number of SKUs in each of the specific deliveries to be agile and relevant to our consumer, editing SKUs to amplify, stronger product is a key part of that. I don't have any specific metrics that I would share with you today, but it is central to how we\u2019re thinking about editing to amplify and becoming much more agile with how we come to market across each of our big brands.","Laurent Vasilescu","Okay. And if I could squeeze one more in. Shipping out the $100 million shift from 3Q and 4Q, can we expect the wholesale business to be roughly a flat to slightly up in the fourth quarter, especially as you lap last year's U.S bankruptcies?","Scott A. Roe","Yes, that -- that's a reasonable assumption. You'll see relative -- you will see the strongest wholesale growth for the year in the fourth quarter for the reasons that you mentioned also we are lapping -- we have the bankruptcy impact [indiscernible] and we're also starting to lap the destocking activities in the fourth quarter.","Laurent Vasilescu","Super helpful. Best of luck.","Scott A. Roe","Yes, one other thing just to add on that too, don't forget Vans Europe really is returning back to growth. We talked about that order book being in the double-digit range in the second half. So that\u2019s a third factor.","Operator","We will have our next question from Dana Telsey, Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Telsey","Good morning everyone and congratulations on the improved results. As you think of the digital wholesale business and the growth that you\u2019re seeing there, how do you think about your strategy with the Amazon's in the world -- of the world? And then, your thinking about D2C, which seems to have accelerated. What are your plans with store openings and closing in the different regions? Thank you.","Steven E. Rendle","So Dana I will start here. So how we -- I think it's more about how do we think about really those the digital wholesale partners that we have across the globe. And there's major pure plays. There's also key customers that we've been with for years and they are part of that integrated marketplace that have choices that we have and they\u2019re very important part. We talked about that in Boston, that our digital wholesale partners is a significant part of our growth in the next five years. Amazon is an important customer. And just we have -- some of our brands that have 1P relationships, we have some brands that have 3P relationships and we have some brands that have chosen to continue to look at and measure just how they could successfully work with Amazon more importantly here in the U.S marketplace long-term. I think it's fair to say, you will see The North Face open up a 3P partnership and have a trial going into fall '17 or you might even want to call that a pilot as we look at how to integrate Amazon into the long-term integrated marketplace strategy for The North Face here in the United States. We are working with Amazon in Europe and we will look at how we can do that here. But I\u2019d remind you there's a number of great players around the globe, AliBaba's, Orlando [ph], all of those are key wholesale partners for us long-term.","Dana Telsey","Thank you. And on the direct-to-consumer piece on the retail stores part?","Scott A. Roe","Yes, maybe I'll start with a little bit of that. Dana, first of all, good morning. So we talked about the fact that our store count actually was down very modestly versus the last quarter. And that the reason to highlight that is just to pay off the fact that we said we're serious about looking at our portfolio from a profitability standpoint. We're really focused on improving the performance of and editing our underperforming stores and focusing on those formats and brands which are very successful. So you'll see that even if it costs us a little top line, we're willing to be -- we are willing to take those actions and that really is a pay off against that. Having said that, we're really committed to brick-and-mortar stores going forward, because we think that's part of that integrated marketplace that Steve mentioned. That's the highest and 10 ultimate experience of our brands and we see that is a critical component to the overall picture. So we talked about 50 net store openings this year, and you can expect something similar to that going forward according to our long range plan.","Dana Telsey","Thank you.","Steven E. Rendle","You bet. Thank you, Dana.","Operator","We will go next to Matthew Boss, JPMorgan.","Matthew Boss","Thanks. So on gross margin is it still fair to think about 40 to 50 basis points of underlying expansion from mix just on an annual basis? And if so, can you just walk through the drivers? And then separately on SG&A, I guess, given your comments earlier should we expect expenses to grow below the pace of sales as we move into next year and beyond?","Scott A. Roe","Yes. So first of all gross margin, yes, you're right in that zone. I mean our mix is a little ahead of our long-term rate. But we\u2019ve said that 40 to 50 basis points should be sustainable and it's pretty simple. Our highest margin businesses are fastest-growing. That's been true and we expect that to continue to be true, that being our international business are our digital and our D2C in general plus Outdoor & Action Sports are big three brands, have higher gross margins in the total. So that mix we expect to continue. I will just remind you of kind of the formula, right. Our gross margins expand, we are investing from an SG&A standpoint in those strategic drivers and then looking for leverage as we talk about platforms across [indiscernible] if looking for leverage and all other expenses. And that\u2019s how this formula works together. So as it relates to SG&A, we will continue to invest in SG&A. Over time that's going to be below our margin expansion. We talked about in our 2021 plan, our operating margin will expand over the next five years. But let's be clear, we are going to continue to invest around as growth drivers particularly D2C and specifically digital underneath that.","Matthew Boss","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Sam poser, Susquehanna.","Samuel Poser","Good. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I\u2019ve got a couple. Can you clarify the change in your currency neutral revenue guidance between what you had prior and what you\u2019re giving now?","Scott A. Roe","Yes. I will start. Hey, Sam. Its Scott. So, yes, we said last time low single-digit currency neutral and reported with 2 points of currency, so that obviously if you do the math, that\u2019s about 1%. And now we're raising that to about 2%, at a $11.65 million. So that's how we get from and to and we've given you a very specific revenue target at $11.6 5 million.","Samuel Poser","So your currency impact is the same just you\u2019re raising the numbers?","Scott A. Roe","Well, there is some currency benefit. If we think about what's happened in the currency markets, our largest exposure is the euro and it's a little favorable. Our second largest is the pound, which is very unfavorable. But when you net that together, there is some benefit from a currency standpoint, although not significant.","Samuel Poser","Okay. And then -- two other just housekeeping. Most of the questions have been answered. The tax rate you\u2019re looking for the full-year and the share count, what's built into the share count for the -- in this guidance?","Scott A. Roe","Yes, so what we -- we don't give you the share count per se, but we talked about $1.2 billion of buybacks, so I guess the math can be done. As it relates to the tax rate, we said about 20%. And that\u2019s consistent with what we said in our last guidance.","Samuel Poser","Well, thank you very much and good luck.","Steven E. Rendle","Thanks, Sam.","Scott A. Roe","Thanks, Sam.","Operator","We will go next to Erinn Murphy, Piper Jaffray.","Erinn Murphy","Great. Thanks. [Technical difficulty]","Steven E. Rendle","Yes. Hi, Erinn. Its Steve. So I think what we see going on there, we put a new leadership team in place there in January. Brendan, brought a really strong understanding of retail. One of the areas we wanted to quickly shore up was our outlook business and that's really around productivity and how we're really converting the traffic that comes in our doors. Concurrently with that, we -- last year continue to look at our product offering and evolving that to be -- to allow us in the same idea of integrated marketplace, have -- specific products for each of our different channels of distribution. And I see -- I think what you see happening this year is what we have going on in the department store is relevant to that consumer. It's different than what you have in our outlet stores and online. And I think just with a more focused assortment and in a slightly cleaner marketplace, we're seeing that drop to our profitability as we continue to look to reignite sales. I really don't have a line of sight to what the balance of the year. Otherwise we\u2019re going to continue to do more of the same and bring relevant third and fourth quarter styles through this to the lens of the Nautica heritage, that we've seen working really well. And again just these assortment specific to each of the channels, which is new to some of the things that we've done in the past.","Erinn Murphy","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Kate McShane, Citi Research.","Kate McShane","Thanks for taking my question. With regards to the operating margins for Jeanswear specifically, can you help us understand the mechanics of the operating margin during the quarter and for the rest of the year how much of it has to do with the destocking and how much is Apex related?","Scott A. Roe","Sure. I will take it, Kate. Good morning. So first of all, there's a few dynamics that are going on in the profitability. First, regarding margin. We\u2019ve made a strategic decision to put more innovation and more make into the channel as an offensive move. But it's at a time when pricing is difficult. So that has put pressure on our margins in the short-term. We think that's the right move. Remember the big picture here, right. We are going through a disruptive phase, but we're really targeting and focused on when we come out of this, right. We\u2019re trying to position ourselves to be the strongest brand standing at the end of this process. And as a result, we decided from a short-term profitability standpoint we'd make that strategic decision. The other side of that is again we're playing really to win in the long-term. So we've maintained our demand creation investments through this difficult period. We could have easily made a different decision, which would have helped us from a short-term profitability, but we think again for the same reasons the smart move here is to play for the long game and for the endpoint. And so we\u2019re going to see tough margins through this year and really those same drivers that I just mentioned that we're seeing in the first half. You will see those themes continuing into the second half.","Steven E. Rendle","And Kate, I would add to that, why we made the decision to maintain our demand creation is we see our specialty business specifically the Western category, Wrangler RIGGS, but also mentioned the 70 Retro Style, as we look to open up the lens of our Wrangler brand and open it up to a broader set of channels. We're seeing really nice traction taking hold in some of these new points of sale in the moving up the distribution channel and we think it's important to continue to invest behind the brand to assure that that continues to go.","Kate McShane","Thank you.","Steven E. Rendle","Thank you, Kate.","Scott A. Roe","Okay.","Operator","Our last question will come from Jim Duffy, Stifel.","Jim Duffy","Thank you. Good morning, guys. Hope you\u2019re doing well.","Steven E. Rendle","Hey, good morning, Jim.","Jim Duffy","Couple questions for me. You mentioned that the visibility on the Jeanswear business is difficult. Is the destocking headwind behind you at this point in the Jeanswear category?","Scott A. Roe","No, Jim, it's not behind us. It's progressing and just [indiscernible] the shape. The reason we say, we kind of know the endpoint here, right. We know where the floors are going to end up when we say lack of visibility we don't control the pace of markdowns as the floor is cleared, and that can have a really big impact on our sell-through depending on what's on sale, how deep those discounts are etcetera. So the quarter-to-quarter cadence is going to be a little hard for us to project, but when you step back and say there's only so many -- so much inventory in the floor to be cleared and we know where the endpoint is, you kind of know the goalpost, you\u2019re just not sure exactly what happens in between.","Jim Duffy","Fair enough. And then building on that, you did a nice job managing the inventories. Can you talk about some of the things you are doing to keep inventory tightened? How it is that you\u2019re better managing the amount of off-price across all the brands, not just specific to Jeanswear?","Scott A. Roe","Yes, I guess, I would say it started with the fact that I think from -- we decided to play it a little on the conservative side, right. We didn't build excess inventory. We are -- we gave guidance. It's in the low end of the range and we said we're willing to walk a little bit of revenue in order to improve the dynamics in the marketplace. So we're not building the field of dreams, right. We're not building inventory in a hope that we will get it. We are not -- we are trying to hold back a little bit and match order books closer to the conservative position. And we've seen over time that that type of action will pay off in the long run. It hurts us a little bit in the short-term from the top line and short-term earnings, but for the long-term brand health and long-term growth, history has proven that's the right -- the place we want to be.","Jim Duffy","Okay, good. And then my last question. The sales model for some of the other businesses beyond Jeanswear have historically offered better visibility. In the U.S wholesale channel, are your partners giving you a better baseline of visibility to plan the business or you just still feel there's a fair amount of uncertainty as they try to get their arms around their own fundamentals?","Steven E. Rendle","You know, Jim, I think -- here in the U.S I think the wholesale community is playing things very, very tight to the West [ph] and rightfully so. The marketplace is transforming and the historical ways of ordering are needing to change and that's really central to how we\u2019re thinking about our transformation agenda, how we're -- being much more diligent around the integrated marketplace understanding our channel partners. What's the space that we have to place product in, what's the frequency required to really be present and incent consumers to come in and interact with us either in our own stores or wholesale. So I think things are tightening up and they should for all of us be, I think, more in tune with what our consumers are asking us for. This notion of transforming is a really important aspect.","Jim Duffy","Okay. Thank you very much, guys.","Steven E. Rendle","You bet.","Scott A. Roe","Okay, Jim.","Steven E. Rendle","Thank you, Jim.","Operator","That does conclude our question-and-answer session. I will turn the conference back over to Mr. Steven Rendle for additional or closing remarks.","Steven E. Rendle","Great. Yes, thank you everybody. I just want to reiterate, we are in the early stages of our journey to become a more agile and consumer centric organization. And we're encouraged with where we are at the start of 2017, but I would just remind us all that we're at the beginning of this journey. Our core growth engines are delivering high single-digit growth. Our gross margins are improving and then our fundamental business disciplines are very, very intact. We are choosing to thoughtfully invest in our future growth and the confidence we have year-to-date has us moving more quickly against our design and innovation agenda, driving demand creation, but also looking at some of the core platforms of advanced analytics, advanced manufacturing, and specifically talent. We are focused on creating momentum against our five year's objectives and we look forward to interacting with you in the future as this -- the strategy unfolds. So thank you.","Operator","That does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"21504":["V.F.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Lance Allega, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin, sir.","Lance Allega","Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss VF's first quarter 2013 results.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind participants that certain commentary included in today's prepared remarks and the Q&A session may constitute forward-looking statements under the definition of federal securities law. Forward-looking statements include management's current expectations, estimates and other projections about our business, results of operations and the industries in which VF operates.","Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements are discussed in the documents filed with the SEC.","Additionally, participants on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find the appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about an hour ago, and in our website at vfc.com.","Joining us on today's call will be VF's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Eric Wiseman; Bob Shearer, our Chief Financial Officer; and our group presidents, Scott Baxter, Karl Heinz Salzburger and Steve Rendle. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions. [Operator Instructions]","And now I'll turn the call over to VF Chairman and CEO, Eric Wiseman. Eric?","Eric C. Wiseman","Thanks, Lance. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. 2013 is off to a great start for us with results beating our expectations. Consistent with what we told you in February, our first quarter revenue growth rate was a few points below our full year target of 6%. And as we've seen over the last year, our diverse model continues to deliver great bottom line results, especially from our lifestyle brands and our international and direct-to-consumer businesses. In fact, our record earnings per share in the first quarter was a little better than our expectations. And with record revenues and record gross margin, it's another fantastic quarter for VF.","During the quarter, our Outdoor & Action Sports business grew revenues by 10% amid concerns about fluctuating weather conditions impacting our cold-weather brands. Our international business was up 6%, despite continued economic weakness in Europe and an inventory overhang in China. And our direct-to-consumer business rose 12% with strength both here and abroad, even in a generally sluggish macro environment.","While the economic environment is, overall, a headwind, we are very encouraged and proud of the consistent improvement in our profitability. Both gross and operating margins showed substantial expansion over the prior year's first quarter with gross margin up 240 basis points and adjusted operating margin rising by 130 basis points. Together, this growth in profitability enabled VF to deliver a 25% improvement in adjusted earnings per share to $2.43.","Looking to the balance of 2013. With a slightly stronger-than-expected start to the year, we're raising our full year adjusted earnings guidance by $0.05 per share to $10.75. With 3 quarters still ahead of us and many dynamics at play, we feel it's prudent to maintain a fairly cautious approach to guidance while we continue to seek and invest in new opportunities for long-term growth.","And speaking of long-term growth, it was a little over 2 years ago that we got on stage in New York and took you through our 5-year plan. By every measure, revenues, margins and earnings per share, we're well ahead of the 2015 plan we presented then. So it's time to get back on stage, which is exactly what we plan to do on June 11 in New York, where we'll take you through the next 5 years of VF strategies and the performance you can expect us to deliver.","But back to 2013. This is the year of opportunity, opportunities to strengthen our brands, to innovate more meaningfully and to connect with and reach even more consumers. Our diverse portfolio of brands, backed by deep consumer insights and the relentless focus on operational excellence, is built to inspire consumers and generate consistent returns for our shareholders.","We continue to invest thoughtfully and consistently behind key drivers of top and bottom line growth, and these investments are certainly paying off. So with a great start, the right strategies and superior execution, we're looking forward to delivering another outstanding year to our shareholders.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve, Karl Heinz and Scott who will take us through the top 5 VF brands, and then Bob will close out with a deeper dive into our financial results. Steve?","Steven E. Rendle","Thank you, Eric. First quarter global revenues for The North Face were up 6%, fueled by very strong growth in the brand's D2C business, which increased 25%. Globally, we also saw a slight increase in our wholesale business. In the Americas region, revenue was up 3%, helped by winter weather that arrived mid-January and continued until just recently.","In fact, our D2C performance was strong in the quarter, up low double digits and the highest comps in over a year, driven by solid sell-through of winter-related apparel, including insulated jacket, fleece and shells, as well as spring-weight rainwear and performance athletic apparel, clearly evidence that The North Face brand is strong and its product coveted as the industry's best, all of which gives us confidence that we have a great year ahead of us.","Looking out towards fall, as expected, retailers have remained cautious with their orders, which were in line with our expectations. So definitely a good start to 2013 and great confidence in our ability to achieve high single-digit revenue growth for the full year.","As I outlined on our year-end call, we are focused on 3 key areas to grow The North Face brand in 2013: product innovation, marketing and D2C. And with the first quarter behind us, we're definitely firing on all cylinders in these initiatives.","First up, product. Product innovation is at the core of The North Face DNA. It motivates performance, stirs adventure and inspires people to get outdoors. Building on the success of our activity-based model, we've got a great new collection due out this fall known as Steep Series. This brand-new premier line of snowsports apparel is inspired by our expedition-level products and will be complementary to our outdoor Summit Series collection. Featured this fall in ski specialty shops, our own stores and online, Steep Series will help further position The North Face winter action sports products as a natural extension to the core brand.","And of course, we're really looking forward to this fall's launch of Thermoball, a product innovation we see as a real game changer and a core component of our Science of Warmth technology platform. Thermoball offers versatility for a variety of conditions and will play a major role in our amplified transitional outerwear offering this fall.","Finally, our Flash Dry technology, an amazing innovation designed to improve moisture management and temperature regulation, continues to be included in our increasingly greater number of styles and is exceeding our expectations.","And hot off the presses, we just learned that 7 products from The North Face were named among the best recommendations from the Outside Magazine in their 2013 Buyer's Guide. From our Casimir 36 backpack and 4 different jackets, to our new Hyper-Track Guide trail running shoes and the MICA FL tent, which won the Gear of the Year Award, very exciting callouts and further confirmation that our activity-based model and focus on innovation is paying off.","On the marketing and D2C fronts, we're planning a significant acceleration in investments behind our digital and online branding efforts to help drive brand awareness and increase conversion in our own stores. We've also made great progress on improving The North Face omni-channel experience. This initiative enables consumers to research and view products online, pay for them and then pick them up at their local North face store. It also allows quick, easy and free web purchase exchanges in all of our retail stores, a very important and seamless feature to create a great shopping experience. Such a great experience, in fact, that Forbes Magazine recently recognized The North Face app as the highest in customer satisfaction.","We're also working to better leverage our loyalty and CRM programs. We've seen early success with The North Face VIP program, which combines web and store transactions to accumulate points towards future transactions. With more than 100,000 members already in our system, we have a 2-way conversation with shoppers that purchase more frequently, have higher dollar baskets and are clearly the most hard-core brand evangelists we have.","And the great news is our marketing and consumer awareness efforts are paying off. In fact, our latest annual brand equity score improved markedly in 2012 from 2011, which validates the increasing momentum and relevance of The North Face brand with consumers. So with amazing innovations, supported by great marketing and an elevated retail experience, there's a lot to look forward to for The North Face brand in 2013.","Now here's Karl Heinz to run through the international business.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Outside the Americas, The North Face brand grew 11% with balanced strength on a DTC and wholesale basis.","In Europe, The North Face saw a modest increase in revenues, driven by strong results from our DTC business, offset by a modest decline in the wholesale channel. In fact, The North Face DTC business in Europe was a real bright spot in the quarter with nearly 30% growth, including more than 30% growth in online sales. Although the overall consumer environment remains soft in Europe, our DTC comps were up at low double-digit rate, which demonstrates the brand is strong and gaining share against our competitors. We are confident to say that we believe that The North Face is the best positioned brand in the outdoor industry in Europe.","On the product front, given the great product innovations mentioned by Steve, as well as our European Daypack [ph] collection and the strong equipment offering, we are quite pleased with consumer reception and growing brand awareness. And specifically, we see robust opportunities for European-specific fits, colors and regional-relevant product to create an even greater connection with our consumers' active lifestyles.","And speaking of connecting with consumers, we continue to find great ways to share our brand story and engage them on many levels. A highlight from this winter was our sponsorship of the Freeride World Tour, the world's premier big mountain, freeskiing and snowboarding competition, where our athletes won the men's snowboard and men's skis competition. This tour was viewed live by over 300,000 people with hundreds of videos and articles available online and in print.","Turning to Asia. We continue to see excellent momentum for The North Face brand with revenues up nearly 40%, driven primarily by outstanding growth in China partner expansion and a larger spring-summer product offering. In China, we opened 20 new partner doors and successfully converted Hong Kong to an owned market during the quarter, which added an additional 60 partner doors. Our efforts here are also focused on building brand awareness and engaging consumers around the outdoors. In fact, we recently hosted the largest amateur ski and snowboard competition in China with more than 400 participants.","We're also currently executing on integrated marketing campaign to promote our spring Summit Series and hiking footwear. The industry best products, improving retail experience and leading the outdoor conversation with consumers gives us great confidence in 2013.","Now let's move onto Vans. Steve?","Steven E. Rendle","Global revenue for Vans in the first quarter was up 25% with strong double-digit growth in all 3 regions, including both the wholesale and D2C businesses. This impressive performance puts the brand well on track to become VF's second largest brand in 2013 behind The North Face.","Momentum continued in the Americas region, with more than 20% growth on revenues balanced across our D2C and wholesale channels. Of particular note in our wholesale business are very strong sell-throughs of men's apparel, a business that is gaining significant momentum. In fact, on a year-over-year basis, it's up more than 50%. It's a great sign that our styles and efforts to connect with consumers are working in concert to drive substantial growth.","On the footwear side, we continue to perform very well. In many cases, Vans is the top performer in many of our key accounts. Building on our core classics business with new materials, prints and collaborations, from Metallica to Marvel Comics, and new styles, such as the Authentic Hi, we are broadening the opportunities for growth in our core business.","As you know, one of our key growth drivers is geographic expansion. This strategy, with particular focus on the East Coast in 2013, is an ongoing success. By working closely with key partners and opening our own retail stores, using aggressive target-city marketing and providing product innovation in weatherized classic Vans footwear and apparel, we are driving awareness and affinity for Vans in big important new markets.","We continue to excel on the consumer connectivity front as well, engaging consumers in creative activity-based ways. The best and most recent example is the Vans Custom Culture national high school art competition. The contest, which is in its fourth year, drew more than 1,400 entries from high school art classes in all 50 states. Charged with creating a work of art from a blank pair of Vans shoes, this year's winner will be crowned at the Whitney Museum in New York in June, receiving $50,000 to support that school's commitment to art.","Continuing to focus on geographic expansion and consumer connectivity, we also successfully launched the first stage of our new global brand campaign called Anthem. The Anthem campaign seeks to significantly increase brand awareness through a unified global effort, which centralizes the historical authenticity of Vans Off the Wall culture.","And finally, we're hard at work laying plans as the new sponsor of the U.S. Open of Surfing in Huntington Beach in July. As the largest surf contest of its kind in the U.S., we can't wait to bring Vans Off the Wall culture to the epicenter of surf.","Now I'll pass it over to Karl Heinz who will take us through some international highlights.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Outside the Americas, Vans revenues were up 30% with similar wholesale growth and DTC growth north of 40%. In the first quarter, Vans continued its outstanding momentum in Europe with revenue up more than 30%. We continue to see strong share gains in this crucial market, which gives us great confidence that we'll deliver another year of impressive growth. So impressive, in fact, that Vans is on track to become VF's second largest brand in Europe behind Timberland this year.","Our efforts to drive Vans Off the Wall culture deeper into Europe are also proving successful. We have House of Vans Berlin in January, hosting 3 nights of music, photography, skate culture and street fashion. This event drew almost 5,000 attendees with 370,000 visitors participating via live webcast. This event served to bring youth culture together, a unique opportunity for us to educate consumers about our products amid a backdrop of music and art, ultimately creating a deeper emotional connection with the Vans brand.","During the quarter, we opened stores in Paris, Maastricht, Glasgow and D\u00fcsseldorf and underwent a major retrofit of our economy store in London to showcase our new Vans retail concept.","Vans Asian business also posted strong results in the first quarter, growing more than 20%. Here we have seen success with product collaboration that have regional and local aspects, such as our Year of the Snake product line in China. These products have proven to be very effective in ensuring that the brand remains relevant in the region and inspirational to the youth culture there. Here, too, we're using special events like the House of Vans experience, as we've hosted in Europe, to drive consumer interest and lead the conversation of youth culture.","Also, I'm very happy to report that we successfully converted South Korea to an owned market during the quarter, an exciting country for future growth. Overall, a great start to the year for Vans globally and much more to come.","With that, let's move on to Timberland.","Steven E. Rendle","Thanks, K.H. In line with our expectations, global revenues for Timberland were up 2% in the first quarter. As we start our second full year of VF ownership, we're very pleased with the progress we're making against our strategic initiatives to position the brand for long-term growth. Our expectations for full year revenue growth remain in the mid-single digit constant dollar range. In the Americas, revenue increased at a mid-single-digit rate. With more seasonably weather -- seasonable weather conditions and efforts around rigorous product segmentation and rightsizing distribution, Timberland is gaining traction with growth in the brand's D2C and wholesale businesses.","On the product front, both core and new programs performed well, demonstrating what we believe to be a genuine interest in both heritage and new styles. The men's boots business saw a great success due to a combination of proactive inventory and style management. A great example of this is dividends classic yellow boot, which achieved strong growth at full price in the quarter, reinforcing and underscoring its iconic status.","That said, Timberland is not relying solely on its product archives to drive growth. New styles like the Stormbuck Lite Oxford and Newmarket Cupsole 2.0 saw great results in the first quarter following well-supported launches. These products embody a successful blend of classic and new, which is the backbone of Timberland's Best Then. Better Now marketing campaign. The new campaign, which is set to launch this fall, marks the celebration of the company's 40th anniversary.","On the Timberland PRO side, we're also building momentum with great innovations like our Anti-Fatigue Technology and new products like Hyperion and Boondock. PRO continues to set the standard for the comfort and protection needs of this very demanding industrial consumer.","Timberland's D2C business achieved strong double-digit growth in the quarter. More favorable weather and our targeted operational initiatives designed to drive conversion proved quite successful. In our own doors, we're also continuing work on creating a more streamlined premium selling environment, one that allows us to better showcase the product and brand and ultimately provide a much more enjoyable consumer experience. Online, we're working to strengthen our mobile capability, upgrading consumer messaging and better leveraging affiliates and partners. Together, these initiatives are paying dividends. Consumers have responded very well with conversion up in all formats throughout the quarter. Overall, a great quarter and very pleased with the progress we're making.","Now here's Karl Heinz to take you through Timberland's international business.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Timberland's revenue outside of the Americas were flat year-over-year, including a mid-teen increase in Asia, offset by a mid single-digit decline in Europe. In line with expectations, revenues for Timberland in Europe were down at the mid-single digit versus last year. In a still soft market, our D2C business was a bright spot, up at mid-teen rate. This was offset by a low double-digit decline in our wholesale business with continued particular weakness in Southern Europe, Timberland's largest market.","Echoing Steve's comments, here, too, we are very encouraged by the progress we continue to make against our strategic initiatives. In fact, and though it's still early, we're happy to report that initial signs for fall footwear bookings are positive, a clear indicator that gives us great confidence that we are positioned right where we expect it to be.","In footwear, we did see some bright spots in the quarter, including success in our transitional product offerings, Stormbuck assortment and in our classic collections for both men and women. We also saw positive results in our apparel business with specific strength in outerwear and pants.","We did see a make [ph] in Timberland's 40th anniversary. Our marketing efforts are focused there on cash message [ph] and heritage. We also recently deployed a new email marketing system, which will allow us to target consumers on a more customized and relevant basis and gain key insight going forward.","Asia's Timberland business continues to perform well and grew at mid-teens rate, both in wholesale and DTC, with positive results across all product categories. We opened one new retail door during the quarter, as well as one e-commerce site, both in China, and are making great strides connecting with consumers in the region.","Now I'll turn it over to Scott to take a look at Wrangler.","Scott H. Baxter","Thank you, Karl Heinz, and good morning, everyone. First quarter global revenues for Wrangler were down 2%. In our Americas business, revenues were about flat with increases in our Western Specialty and Latin American businesses, offset by a slight decline in sales to our U.S. mass channel. Recall that in the first quarter of 2012, we pulled forward seasonals due to a very early spring here in the U.S., which created exceptional growth in that period. We expect second quarter global revenues for Wrangler to increase at a mid-single-digit rate. Overall, the Wrangler business is in line with our expectations for the full year.","In our mass channel, our jeans and Wrangler advanced comfort products continue to gain significant momentum. And our Premium Performance Cowboy Cut in our Western Specialty business is exceeding our expectations, really spot on with this very important and growing customer base.","We're also hard at work with our key retail partners, enhancing our brand's in-store presentation. From mass to specialty, we have a number of initiatives geared at more meaningful ways to tell the Wrangler story, a story of innovation, authenticity and value.","We're also seeing encouraging results and success with our expansion in the sporting goods, outdoor and regional mid-tier locations, all very important channels that allow us to really dial in the product, brand presentation and how we tell the Wrangler story to a broader range of consumers.","Quarter-after-quarter, I seem to mention it and I will again here, too, Wrangler in Latin America posted strong results, fueled by growing brand awareness and great reception to our retail expansion, particularly in Argentina and Chile.","And on the marketing front, we're excited to announce that we drafted New Orleans Saints quarterback, Drew Brees, to join the Wrangler team. Drew's dependability, work ethic, family values and personal generosity make him a natural fit for Wrangler. So stay tuned and look for a new campaign expected to launch sometime in August.","And now, here's Karl Heinz with a few words on Europe.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","While our Wrangler business in Europe was down at a mid-single-digit rate, it was also in line with our expectations, and we are seeing some bright spots. Our innovation focus on denim performance and fit is paying off, and our new products are selling through well. As a result, we are experiencing strengths in the emerging markets, particularly Russia, and a few of our key accounts across Europe. Also, due to a continued focus on operating efficiencies, our profitability continues to improve.","Now back to Scott with Lee.","Scott H. Baxter","Thank you, Karl Heinz. Revenues for the Lee brand on a global basis were down 6% in the quarter, which was about in line with expectations. And here, too, the comparison was pretty tough due to the seasonal's pull forward in last year's same period.","In 2013, we continue to expect modest growth on a global basis, driven by mid-single-digit growth in the Americas, with particular strength in the second and third quarters as new introductions and seasonal product lead the way. Revenues for the Lee brand are expected to increase at a mid-single-digit rate.","Given the ongoing challenges in the mid-tier channel, which, ultimately, we feel are short term in nature, we remain vigilant about creating new growth opportunities. Advanced fall bookings for new product, including Perfect Fit for women and Modern Series for men, are very encouraging and a clear indicator that our products are being well received.","Another great example, one that you've heard me talk about on previous calls is our Lee Platinum Label collection. A few quarters ago, we started with a small test of this product with one of our key department store partners, and we're pleased to report that it has continued to gain sizable momentum. In fact, following strong consumer response, we're adding an additional 150 doors this year, which should bring the total to nearly 450 locations by year end, so a great case study of how innovative product and consumer connectivity can generate an excellent long-term growth opportunity.","Now back to Karl Heinz to discuss Lee's international business.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","In Europe, during the first quarter, Lee brand revenues were down at a mid-single-digit rate. Here as well, we are beginning to experience some success with our new product innovation. During the quarter, we saw good sell-through of our new Stretch Deluxe women's product across most of our key accounts. And this quarter, we're launching a new collection for men called Blue Label.","In our DTC business, although still quite small, we are encouraged by double-digit comp performance in our new retail format. We will continue to roll out this new format with additional owned and partner stores opening in 2013. This is on the heels of successful launches in 2012. Lee also benefited from improved operating efficiencies and is delivering stronger profitability. The business is on track with our full year expectations.","In Asia, Lee continues to be impacted by efforts to rightsize channel inventory levels. As we stated on our fourth quarter call, Lee's performance in Asia will be particularly challenging in the first half with the expectation that the business begins to normalize in fourth quarter of this year.","Even though sales were down, profitability exceeded expectations, driven by favorable product mix and lower product costs. We have seen solid results with the recent introduction of Urban Riders' eThink [ph] and Stretch Deluxe. So our new products are doing well, just tempered by current channel dynamics. Additionally, we are increasing the number of partner door locations, executing very focused marketing campaigns and expanding our digital and e-commerce capabilities.","Now I turn it over to Bob, who will take you through our financial highlights in greater detail.","Robert K. Shearer","Thanks, Karl Heinz. Well, I'll wrap up today's call with some additional commentary around our first quarter results and our strengthened full year guidance.","VF's total revenues were up 2%, which was in line with our expectations. Recall that back in February, we indicated that we expect to just modest growth in the first quarter due to tough comparisons against a very strong performance in last year's first quarter, in part due to some timing shifts in shipments. So we're tracking right on plan. And as a reminder, our revenue comparison was negatively impacted by about 1% from the sale of John Varvatos in April of 2012.","Gross margin, a key component of VF's long-term growth story, was right in line with our expectations, improving by 240 basis points to an all-time high of 48.1%. As discussed in the press release, we saw improvements across nearly all our businesses with the biggest improvement coming from our Jeanswear coalition, as well as the continued shift in our mix toward higher-margin businesses. For the full year, we remain very comfortable with maintaining our previous guidance for a 100 basis point improvement in gross margin.","Our SG&A ratio, as a percent of revenues, rose 100 basis points to 34.4% in the first quarter. Half of that increase came from our growing D2C business and the other half is due to higher levels of marketing spending. This is a significant year of investment for us in direct to consumer with an all-time high number of new store openings planned. And as you know, most of the benefit from those new store openings will come in the second half of the year, when our direct-to-consumer business is strongest. And as previously indicated, we are increasing our marketing investments behind our brands, given the success we've had from those investments, supported by the work we've done to measure their returns.","That said, we remain very disciplined about controlling costs and focusing investments across all our businesses and brands to ensure the right balance between growth and profitability. Despite these increased investments, because of top line leverage on a full year basis, we expect that our SG&A ratio will remain relatively flat for the year.","In terms of operating margin, our strong gross margin performance helped drive a 130 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin to 13.8%. Here, too, we remain comfortable with maintaining our full year guidance of an increase in operating margin by nearly 100 basis points.","And that brings us to the bottom line, where adjusted earnings per share, which excludes Timberland acquisition-related expenses of $0.02 per share in the quarter, grew by 25% to $2.43 from $1.94 per share last year. Earnings in the quarter, included a $0.12 per share discrete tax benefit, primarily related to the impact of U.S. tax law changes enacted in 2013, which were retroactive to 2012. Now many refer to this as the fiscal cliff impact. It's important to note that benefit was anticipated and built into our plans. On a GAAP basis, which, of course, also included the tax benefits, first quarter net income was $270 million with a 26% increase in earnings per share to $2.41.","Now a few quick comments on our overall coalition results. First, Outdoor & Action Sports. We continue to be really pleased with our results here. Our brands are strong and growing, gaining share and expanding around the world, which should lead to another great year of record top and bottom line performance. Total Outdoor & Action Sports revenues were up 10% with solid growth across our top brands, including a high-teens increase in D2C and a nearly 10% increase in our international businesses. This coalition also continues to deliver outstanding profitability with a 40 basis point improvement in operating margin in the quarter to 16.4%.","Jeanswear revenue growth took just a bit of a breather this quarter, but we did anticipate somewhat challenging comparisons. You recall that last year, Jeanswear posted exceptionally strong revenue growth in the first quarter, due to early shipments in the U.S. of spring seasonal products, the rollout of the Rock & Republic brand and a strong Asian jeans business. This year, the timing of shipment of those seasonal goods in the U.S. has returned to its normal cadence, and our jeans business in Asia was negatively impacted by channel inventory issues as we've previously discussed. But the real story in Jeanswear this quarter is around profitability with operating margin reaching 20%, including improvements in both the Wrangler and Lee brands across every region of the world. Congrats to our global Jeanswear teams for delivering this extraordinary performance.","And turning now to Imagewear, where revenues declined 9% versus last year. This, too, was pretty much right in line with our expectations, given very tough comps in our image business, where revenues increased over 20% in last year's first quarter, helped by some catch-up in shipments of strong orders in oil and gas. Impacting this quarter's results was the timing of a program renewal, which is expected later this year.","In terms of our Licensed Sports business, revenues were flat year-over-year. We're looking forward to stronger top line results in our Imagewear coalition in the second half of the year based on a strong pipeline of new product initiatives in both the image and Licensed Sports sides of the business. In terms of profitability, you likely noted the decline in operating margins cited in the press release, which is due primarily to reduced sales volumes.","Sportswear revenues were up 4% in the quarter with growth tempered by a shift in the timing of Nautica wholesale shipments from the first to the second quarter. On the D2C side, Sportswear achieved growth of more than 20%, reflecting healthy double-digit gains in both Nautica and Kipling's D2C businesses. Our Sportswear business is headed toward a great year, and we expect second quarter revenues to grow by a mid-teen percent.","Since the Sportswear and Contemporary businesses were not yet covered on this call, I'll provide a little bit more cover -- color around these 2 businesses. Nautica achieved modest revenue growth in the quarter and continues to benefit from its focus on performance benefits, easy care, wrinkle free and moisture-wicking now built into nearly half of its product line. With its men's Sportswear business delivering consistently solid performance, Nautica is expanding its presence on the women's side. Building off solid results, both online and in its outlet stores, Nautica is testing a new women's Sportswear line in department stores. We're really excited about the potential of this future growth for the Nautica brand.","And a quick word on Kipling. The brand continues its run of double-digit growth in the U.S., led by its innovative crinkled metallic nylon bags and in backpacks, accessories and totes. The steady improvement in Sportswear profitability we saw throughout 2012 continues with operating margin up 14% in the quarter and an 80 basis point improvement in operating margin. So all in all, a good start to the year and a great year ahead for our Sportswear group.","And finally, Contemporary Brands. Keep in mind that the comparisons here are impacted by the sale of the John Varvatos business, which occurred in April of 2012. If you take Varvatos out of the -- out of 2012, revenues were down 4% in the quarter with an increase in D2C revenues, offset by a decrease in wholesale sales. Contemporary business in premium department stores appears to have softened a bit in the first quarter, a trend we see continuing in the second quarter. But with strong and well-received product collections for the fall, we expect the business to get back on track in the second half of the year.","And of course, no VF earnings call would be complete without a couple of comments on 2 primary growth drivers, international and direct to consumer. Total international revenues were up 6% in the quarter with growth in all 3 regions, Europe, Asia and the Americas. The growth was well balanced between D2C and wholesale. Within international's developing D2C businesses, revenue growth was at a high teen percentage. Our first quarter international results were also right in line with our expectations.","And taking a look at our direct-to-consumer results on a global basis, first quarter revenues were up 12%, or 14% excluding the impact from the Varvatos exit. With double-digit increases across nearly all of our Outdoor & Action Sports brands, Nautica and Splendid and Ella Moss, it's clear that the investments we continue to make in our D2C businesses are really paying off. Direct to consumer is a big part of our immediate and long-term growth plans. In its first quarter, we're right on track with both our growth expectations and profitability improvements.","And ending with a couple of balance sheet and cash flow highlights, we continue to be incredibly proud of the rigorous discipline around managing our inventories, which were down 7% year-over-year. Also, during the quarter, we repurchased a total of 1.7 million shares for approximately $280 million and contributed $100 million to VF's pension plan, which is now nearly fully funded.","Turning to the remainder of the year, let's revisit our full year outlook. We continue to expect 6% revenue growth to approximately $11.5 billion. And with a great first quarter behind us, adjusted earnings per share are now expected to rise to $10.75 with a $0.05 increase over our prior guidance of $10.70 and representing a 12% increase over 2012 levels. As noted in our press release, it's important to remember that last year's second quarter adjusted earnings per share results of $1.11 included a $0.10 per share discrete tax benefit, primarily related to the settlement of the prior year's tax audits.","And there were 2 additional items that were excluded from adjusted earnings per share due to their unusual nature, but obviously included in the $1.40 per share reported on a GAAP basis. They were a $0.32 per share benefit related to the sale of John Varvatos and $0.03 per share of acquisition expenses related to Timberland.","Now taking look at the revenue case for the remainder of the year. We expect second and third quarter revenue growth to be more consistent with our full year growth expectation and the fourth quarter to see the strongest comparison of the year, driven by the growing contribution and expansion of our direct-to-consumer business.","Also, one last item. Our assumed euro-to-dollar rate remains unchanged at $1.30. At this rate, the impact of a $0.05 move in the euro against the dollar would be about $60 million in revenues and $0.10 in EPS.","So to wrap it up, we're off to a great start for the year across nearly all key measures, we're right on track with where we plan to be. With the strongest brand portfolio in our industry improving profitability with a clear path to continued margin expansion and a balance sheet that is strong and flexible, we look forward to another year of strong growth. In fact, the VF story is better than ever, and we're really looking forward to sharing our new 5-year plan with you at our Investor Day in June.","We hope all of you can join us. And with that, we've concluded our prepared remarks, so I'll hand it back to Eric.","Eric C. Wiseman","Thanks, Bob. No real additional comments. We're thrilled with our start to the year, confident in our outlook and ready for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Kate McShane with Citi.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Bob, I was wondering if you could help us understand, your inventories look like they're in very good shape on the balance sheet, but regionally, can you walk us through what the inventories are like in Europe and China at this point in time?","Robert K. Shearer","Yes. Actually, Kate, we're in good shape across-the-board. As you know, we've -- this is an area we put a lot of focus, and that focus has been placed on our global inventory levels. The calls that we've referenced in the past, we have -- we do those calls on a global basis and touch base with the -- our leaders around the globe. So our inventories right now across our businesses, across our brands and across our geographies are really in pretty good -- are in good shape.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, great. And then my second question is I'm just wondering if you could talk through your backlog into the back half of the year, now that you have an increased visibility into that. Was the backlog better or worse than you expected when you last spoke to us in February? And is there still possibility for The North Face to get more orders at this point in time for winter?","Steven E. Rendle","Kate, this is Steve. I'll take this question since you seem to have The North Face in the middle of it. It's -- we've come through the fall booking season, and we mentioned the caution that's in the retail community. And this year's booking sequence is a little bit longer. There's longer tail to this than we've seen historically. So it's a little early for us to cite actual numbers. But I can tell you that the orders that we're taking in are very much in line with our expectations, in our high single-digit guidance that we gave in our year-end call.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from Bob Drbul from Barclays.","Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Guys, I got 2 questions. The first one is on Timberland. Timberland Europe, are there any plans to rationalize the Southern Europe exposure? And what could be the inflection point in the European business there?","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Bob, this is Karl Heinz here. As you know, Southern Europe is this -- the largest market for Timberland in Europe, particularly Italy. And we all know Italy at the moment is a tough spot to sell any kind of goods. We have 2 kinds of channels where we work with Timberland. One is the wholesale channel, which clearly suffered, especially in Southern Europe, as we said in the press release. The other one is DTC, which has 2 components, one is owned stores and the other one, which has -- Timberland has a great presence, is partnership stores. Now even in a challenged market like Italy, where we have 150 stores, we have seen last year, actually, positive comps on our owned -- on partnership stores and the same for Q1. So we just won also an award in the U.K. for the hottest footwear company, which we're pretty confident that, clearly, we're not immune from what is happening in the market. But the fact that in our own stores the comps are good shows that the brand is strong.","Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it, okay. And then the -- my second question is around the mid-tier channel for you guys, maybe Eric or, I don't know, Steve. But the denim business in the mid-tier and the outlook there in some of the other brands you have in the mid-tier, can you just help us understand how you have that estimated and forecasted for the rest of the year right now?","Eric C. Wiseman","Bob, it's Eric. I'll take a shot at that since it's across VF -- our 3 biggest businesses in the mid-tier are Lee Jeans business, our Vans business and our Licensed Sports business, and there's really no change in our outlook from where we started the year. The channel has been a little difficult for a host of reasons that have been well documented in the press. And the interesting thing is, actually, there may be -- it may get a little bit better for us than we're currently thinking. And the reason I'm saying that is around the Lee business. JCPenney is indicating that they're going to try to attract their traditional shopper, and that traditional shopper was a good Lee customer. And to the extent they're successful at getting that traffic back in the door, we're very confident that the Lee brand has the right products and value equation to get more business. The Vans business in the channel has actually done pretty well at JCPenney, in particular, who decided to use Vans as an action point to connect with youth consumers. Our Vans business is actually up. So we're pretty confident about that. And the Licensed Sports business is so much a factor of which teams are playing and who's winning, and there's no change in that. Did that get to that heart of your question?","Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, definitely.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from Michael Binetti from UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","First off, maybe Bob, I -- can you talk a little bit more about the gross margins for the year, maybe look at the cadence over the next few quarters to help us with our models? And also, can you talk about -- and maybe how much of the improvement in the quarter was from things like product costs versus longer-term drivers?","Robert K. Shearer","Sure, Michael. So the cadence of gross margin, as you might expect, the second quarter -- actually, each quarter will show nice improvement on our gross margins. In the second quarter, the improvement will be less than it was in the first quarter. And then the third and fourth quarters, it'll be a little less than it was in the second quarter. The bigger improvements, as you said -- what drove the first quarter improvement, really consistently seeing that 60 to 70 basis points from mix. So in the first quarter of the 240 basis points, about 70 was related to mix and the remainder was related to primarily product costs. Yes, in the first quarter, a significant portion of that was related to Jeanswear. And that'll continue, not as strongly but will continue into the second quarter as well. So -- but I'd repeat one of the things that -- one of the comments that I made in my commentary is that we expect to see gross margin expansion in across-the-board in nearly every one of our businesses on a full year basis. And actually, we saw that in the first quarter. So we're seeing improvement across-the-board, but Jeanswear clearly led the way in the first quarter.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So -- and then if I could just follow-up a little bit, maybe a little bit more color on Timberland. I think -- obviously, that's been in the spotlight as you guys look to try and accelerate that, and I think that -- especially the direct to consumer coming in at high teens was a pretty unexpected number and fairly good. It seems fairly good, particularly given unit growth might still be sluggish. Can you just talk about the brand a little bit and what's going right now? We've -- you guys have talked a lot about how apparel will be launched in the second half or what -- maybe some of the other things you're doing right now and maybe look ahead to the apparel in the second half. And then maybe also just talk about the operational initiatives. You mentioned that you're working on the D2C doors there.","Steven E. Rendle","Okay, Michael. This is Steve. Karl Heinz and I'll split this. I'll cover the Americas piece and toss the ball to Karl Heinz for the international piece. So as I mentioned, we're really encouraged with our Timberland business. Over 14, 15 months ago, we began to wrap our arms around this, begin to work diligently on a lot of the integration initiatives, which focused mostly on operational improvements and improving product and getting clarity around what the brand stands for. And what you see coming into 2013 is really that paying off across both our wholesale and D2C channels. Our product pipeline, as I mentioned, the heritage product, as well as the new products, are resonating very nicely across all channels. Our marketing message is very clear, and you can see that in how consumers are responding in our online environment. And we're very -- looking forward to the launch of our new campaign this fall. Now the operational comments that I made around D2C, we have a new leader within our D2C channel, and that leadership team really bore down on the key performance indicators across the retail channel. And we focused very hard on that retail environment, first and foremost, improving the clarity of this -- of the in-store, narrowing down the assortments and focusing, first and foremost, on servicing consumers and conversion. And we've seen that really pay off nicely and are very confident with how that will lead us on through the balance of the year.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Michael, moving to Asia, first. In Asia, we continue to do well with Timberland. As I mentioned in the script, we are up both in DTC and in wholesale. We have great presence in Japan, in Malaysia. In Taiwan and Hong Kong, we have subsidiary. And also the brand is now embedded in our headquarter in Hong Kong with our branch. So they will particularly benefit for our know-how we have in China with Timberland. As we mentioned, it's a little bit -- we -- I mean, we're just starting with China. So that is, for sure, a great opportunity. Europe, I touched before. I think what is pleasing -- I always say we're not immune from what is going on in Europe. And we all know what the situation is. But we do see great results, especially in our DTC, which is an indicator that the brand is healthy. We were up mid-teens, which is very strong in Q1, which gives us confidence. And also, as I mentioned, the future -- the fall orders are coming in, actually, a little bit better than we expected. So all in all, Timberland, I guess, we are pleased with this brand.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from Erinn Murphy from Piper Jaffray.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","My first question is actually surrounding the denim business in Asia. I mean, understanding the inventory overages just in the channel there, has there been any change in terms of how you're thinking about the potential stabilization there in the second half? And how should we, in this context, think about China and the growth there as we progress throughout the balance of the year this year? That's my first part.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Erinn, Karl Heinz here. Obviously, again, Lee has been one of our strongest performers in the last years in China, and we don't change that in the midterm. It has been strong growth, very profitable. As we said, there is a short-term issue, this overhang in inventory in the channel, which, by the way, is only related to jeans. We don't see that in all our other brands, and they're all doing nicely as we saw. You heard the numbers on The North Face. So long term, we're absolutely confident that we go back where we have been. As we mentioned, by the end of the year, we plan -- we expect this to stabilize.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful, Karl Heinz. And then just -- I guess a second question for you, following up on the European kind of macro situation. I mean, how are you seeing -- or have you seen any kind of change in consumer trends in terms of shopping patterns or even -- either channel preference? Maybe it is a little bit of distortion towards the DTC, just given the sustained weakness there. And then I guess, secondly, if you could call out -- I mean, clearly, Southern Europe is already very weak, and you've called that out, as many companies have. But any other markets that either over-indexed or under-indexed relative to your average trend in Europe? That could be helpful to kind of frame up the context there.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Yes. So the good news is we have a diversified portfolio of brands, which help us -- and the second good point is we are not overexposed in one area. We do -- we are pretty diversified in many countries in Europe, especially in the big 5 -- in the 5 countries and also in the emerging markets. So again, we see some softness, for sure, in the -- in southern hemisphere, in Spain and Italy. And Spain just announced numbers yesterday, so they're not really encouraging. But the good news is, again, because we have this diversified portfolio of brands, and you see the results, we still continue to deliver on brands are really stellar. We don't expect Europe to change significantly in the future. We don't expect it to get worse and probably not get better. But again, we're pretty confident. On the DTC side, we said that it's a great opportunity for us going forward. We don't have the size of the D2C business we have here in North America, and we are building it up. We're investing in people, talents. We're actually accelerating now the opening of stores. So overall, our plans for Europe, while this year, a little bit softer, but we reconfirm what we have said, which is mid-single digit up. But longer term, we plan to go back to the usual growth which we had in the past.","Eric C. Wiseman","Erinn, it's Eric. I'll add just a little bit of color to that, because it gets -- let me speak about VF's model, which we think is so important to our consistent success. If you look at our big 3 brands in Europe, Timberland, Vans and The North Face, The North Face and Vans are primarily built out in Northern Europe, and we're doing exceptionally well. Timberland is primarily -- was -- the biggest market is Italy. But it's that portfolio that lets us get through -- a year like 2012, I think we were up 10% in Europe. All the other heads are nodding. That's the right number. And we're looking at high single digits for this year. And it really is because we're able to say, \"All right, if we can't affect the economy in Italy, and we can't, what we can do is increase the investment in our Northern European brands, where the economies are stronger.\" And that's exactly what we're doing. And that's why Vans has had so much success in Northern Europe is we've just chosen to invest more there because that we can take action on. While we respond prudently where -- there are more challenges in Southern Europe, and that's how we work our models. So thank you for letting me make that statement.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Just a final point. We never talked about the other brands. Clearly, the top 3 brands are the major drivers. But this year's -- we saw in Q1, and particularly in the full year, on our other brands, like SmartWool, Napapijri, Kipling, Eastpak, we all expect them to grow in Europe this year, which is positive news.","Operator","Moving on to your next question from Omar Saad from ISI Group.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to follow up -- I know the DTC mix has been one of the drivers on the gross margin side. Could you kind of remind us where you are in terms of DTC penetration, what percentage of the business it is overall, where it was a few years ago, and how high you think it can go over time? Cannibalization with the wholesale channel, is that something you think about? And then how does online fit into your kind of long-range thinking about the direct channel?","Robert K. Shearer","I'll start with that, to respond to the first point in terms of the penetration that we have. We're -- in a few years, it wasn't all that long ago that our percentage was really quite low in direct to consumer. So it's expanded very, very nicely over the past number of years. In 2012, D2C was represented 21% of our total business in 2013. We expect D2C to be 23% of our business, and we're excited about laying out our plans for the future over the next 5 years. But it's safe to say that we do expect to continue to see direct to consumer expanding as a percent of our total business.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And online, cannibalization with wholesale, is there any channel conflict there? Has that been an issue at all? And then online, how it fits in?","Eric C. Wiseman","Sure. Omar, Eric here. The -- we try very hard to use this as a supportive strategy for our brands and to avoid cannibalization. And we actually work with our wholesale partners to where -- they know where we're going to put store. A great example of this is Vans, which in the last 2 or 3 years, has put up a lot of stores around New York City, around Boston, now around Philadelphia, where we didn't have substantial distribution. And we just didn't have the doors there that let the brand speak to the customers. So we're putting the doors there. And that's true in markets in Europe and in Germany. It's true in the U.K. That's how we look at it. And we have so much runway, because we ended last year with roughly 1,100 doors across all of our brands across the world. So we're so relatively undeveloped that we still see lots of runway before the cannibalization thing comes into play. The e-commerce thing is a tricky thing. Because we don't know if that's -- we can't really say where those customers are coming from, whether they're new customers to the brand, whether they used to shop in our stores or somebody else's stores. What we do know is we have to create a compelling way for our consumers to engage with our brands from their phones, from whatever devices they have, and we have to let them shop while they're there. And that's a rapidly growing piece of our business and a rapidly growing piece of the consumer experience, not just in the U.S., but also in Europe, where I think last year, we put new websites up in 7 countries.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Yes.","Eric C. Wiseman","Is that correct? In 7 countries last year. So we're beginning to do that there. And I don't know how to discuss the cannibalization of that because we know it's the right thing to do. And if it elevates the brand experience, which we think it does, it should be good for everybody.","Robert K. Shearer","Omar, I guess I'd just add to that is all of that, of course, is supported by a very strong profitability in our direct-to-consumer businesses and really high returns on the investments that we make. It's what gives us the permission and the reasons that we continue to invest heavily.","Eric C. Wiseman","The last bit of color I'll add to that, because it get to some of Karl Heinz's observations about the strength of our DTC business in Europe, where our wholesale business is not so great in some markets. I do think that there, we're putting up our best -- when we open a store, we're all in. And we put a -- bring the brand to life the best way we know how, with strong inventory across all the styles. And some of our wholesale customers' aren't able or willing to do that now in this environment, and our willingness to do that, I think, is helping us. And it shows that when you put the whole brand out there in all its glory in a retail environment, people are still shopping.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from Lindsay Dunkermann [ph].","Unknown Analyst","Just -- I was hoping you could -- as we look at the MG&A line, can you tell us the increase, the split between sort of brand investment, DTC spending and then mix or other corporate items? So in other words, how much of the increase is a function of your investment in direct versus your investment in brand-building stuff?","Eric C. Wiseman","Yes. Bob would be happy to take that question.","Robert K. Shearer","Right. So in the first quarter, there's a 100 basis point increase in our SG&A, and it was evenly split. At the beginning of the year, on our initial guidance, we indicated that from a marketing standpoint that we were going to up our spend this year. Right now, we're continuing to plan and -- on an increase of more than $60 million in the marketing side and about double the rate of our revenue increase. As I said in my comments, the reason we're willing to do that is because we absolutely believe with a lot of confidence, we're getting a great payback on those investments. And we support that with some science behind that in terms of measuring results. And yes, the other side is related to the heavier pay -- or the heavier investments in the direct-to-consumer side as well, the high number of new store openings. So in that first quarter, it was exactly half and half, 100 basis point increase.","Unknown Analyst","On the direct-to-consumer piece, you talked about investments upfront in the year and then generating greater returns on that in the back half. Can you just remind us sort of by concept where your increases in square footage are and where you expect to see the most improvement?","Robert K. Shearer","Yes. The -- what I can say is this is that, clearly, where we're reinvesting in opening new stores in high number of new stores is absolutely aligned with where we have our strongest returns. A high percentage of the new store openings is in the Vans, within the Vans brand around the globe, not just in the U.S. but in Europe as well. And then, of course, The North Face and Timberland really round out the top 3. That's where the investments are going.","Eric C. Wiseman","Yes. And that's split slightly more than half in the U.S. and slightly less than half internationally. So it's a global strategy.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. Have you given us actual store count?","Robert K. Shearer","We did. We said that we'd open about 160 new stores this year.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. And then if you can comment at a high level how you guys think about the deal environment out there, the M&A opportunity, what the pipeline might look at -- might look like and how you think of as far as -- where multiples are today relative to where you'd like them to be?","Robert K. Shearer","Yes. We're still actively looking. I don't normally respond this way, but I just don't know that the environment is a lot different than what it's been. A lot of the deals that we've made have resulted from long-standing relationships and -- that, again, have been built over a period of time. So it's the same approach that we use today, and we're still looking. In terms of multiples, the same kind of thing. The multiples don't -- from what we see and what we're willing to pay, it really don't vary a lot unless a business is really in a trough. Then we might have to pay a little more, right, in terms of the multiples. But it just doesn't -- from our viewpoint, it just doesn't change a lot over time. Good brands are still treasured possessions, and to get the right brands requires the right kind of investment.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our next question from Mitch Kummetz from Robert Baird.","Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Two questions. Let me start with Bob. I'm trying to gauge how conservative your gross margin guidance is on the year? You're saying up 100 basis points. It sounds like you're expecting mix to be about 60 to 70 basis points of that. Just in the first quarter, the benefit that you got from lower input costs, I think puts you in the black, 30 to 40 basis points even on a year. So -- I mean, what are the other puts and takes here that gets you to kind of your guidance on the year?","Robert K. Shearer","Yes. So what happens, Mitch, of course, as the year goes on, as the year goes on, we won't see the same benefit that we saw from Jeanswear in the first quarter. Obviously, all this is about what we're comping against in the earlier part of last year. And in 2012, in the first quarter of 2012, we brought in very, very high denim cost, right. So we were comping against that. That's why the big improvement. In the second quarter, you remember the sequencing last year, as we looked at, the improvements started to come as costs came down in the Jeanswear business. So in the second quarter, we're matched up against costs, which weren't quite as high as they were in the first quarter. So as I said earlier, the -- on the improvement in gross margin, the second quarter will clearly be less than it was in the first quarter. And then in the latter part of the year, the cost from a cost standpoint is more normalized at that point in time. We just -- we don't have the same kind of impact from the Jeanswear side. We're also -- I mean, we're seeing some benefit, even in Imagewear, for example. Our costs there were higher last year, and they've come down some. But in the second half of the year, again, a much more normalized situation relative to product costs. But what we have is we continue to have that mix impact that we've -- we very consistently talk about and you just mentioned, will help us in the second half of the year. So that's really the way to think about it, a little bit bigger product cost impacts in the early part of the year and then that continuation of our mix benefit coming in the latter part of the year. And sure, we're always going to be a little bit cautious relative to the guidance.","Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So there's -- so there aren't any real puts and takes of significance, other than the costs and the mix as we think about the year?","Robert K. Shearer","Yes, those are the 2 bigger factors. What we're also seeing is some benefit, but it's just not at the same magnitude. From efficiencies that we see, controlling the inventories, when we reduce our inventories by over $100 million like we did in the first quarter, it just creates less exposure related to inventories. So there are some efficiency gains. As I said, we expect to see gross margin improvement in every single business on an annual basis, and that's not driven by product costs. It's just driven by controlling inventories and having great product and be able to get -- to earn the margins. So yes, there are some other factors. But yes, those are the big pieces.","Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And the second question I had is I'm just curious, with the slow start that we've had this spring, I mean, you guys talked about the impact that, that had on Q1, some benefits, some negatives, but what's the impact that has on Q2? Do we lose kind of -- I mean, how significant is your at-once business in Q2? And do you lose -- or do you think you lose out on any business there versus a year ago, given the slow start to spring? And any maybe backup of in-season inventory at retail right now?","Eric C. Wiseman","Let me take a shot at part of that. Last year, we shipped some of our spring merchandise in the first quarter because it was a warmer year. So this year, that's going to be a second quarter shipment for pieces of our business, compounded by the fact that it's been a cooler-than-normal quarter for us so far. So we were shipping the goods this quarter, but right now, they're not selling. How that's going to play out, my guess is summer will come. It will get warm and that stuff will sell. The question will be, does -- do the -- does the summer get here in time that they sell at full price? And that, I don't know the answer to. All-in, I think we're going to get through that period just fine. Does anybody else even want to enhance that comment at all?","Scott H. Baxter","I think it -- this is Scott. I think it equalizes itself out. I feel really good about the spring. I think it's a compelling offer that we have. We have a nice assortment out there. And summer will come. It's just a little bit about 6-week differential from last year. You saw the weather changed about 6 weeks early last year. It's about 6 weeks later this year. But if you go back to '11, you go back to '10, it's back to a normal pattern this year, maybe a week or 2 cooler, but I feel confident going forward.","Steven E. Rendle","Mitch, this is Steve. From an Outdoor & Action Sports position here in the Americas, the season is actually lining up consistent with how our goods flow. Our biggest spring business in the first quarter would be Reef, and Reef had a very good quarter, follow that with Vans. And the results that we posted for Vans were extremely strong. And in The North Face, that we saw very good sell-through of our winter-weight goods. We typically sell quite a bit of spring rainwear in the first quarter, which then leads us into the Sportswear sets in the second quarter. That's when equipment has shifted to opening up. And all of that really is lining up nicely to deliver against our plans.","Operator","Moving on, we'll take our final question from Christian Buss from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Christian Buss - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes. I was wondering if you could provide some perspective on the new channels of distribution you've opened up over the last year or so for Vans, and what you've seen there, what successes you've had. And if you could talk a little bit about the LXVI product, that would be helpful as well.","Steven E. Rendle","Sure. Chris, this is Steve. So really, the only new channel we've opened up over the last 12 months was moving into Foot Locker with the LXVI collection. Otherwise, Vans stays very, very committed to the disciplined product take -- product segmentation strategy across a very clear set of channels. Our LXVI collection has done very well with Foot Locker. They remain very confident as do we in the growth potential of that particular line extension. As we access the consumer that's adjacent to our core Action Sports consumer in the athletic space, so very positive and continue to see growth and commitment from where we've extended.","Operator","And gentlemen, at this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Eric C. Wiseman","Yes. Thank you, all, for your time and attention this morning. We do have an event coming up between now and our second quarter earnings release on June 11 in New York City, where we're going to be laying out our 5-year growth plans.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lance Allega, Director, Investor Relations. You may begin, sir.","Lance Allega","Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss VF's fiscal 2012 fourth quarter and full year results. Before we begin, I'd like to remind participants that certain commentary included in today's prepared remarks and the Q&A session may constitute forward-looking statements in the definition of the federal securities law. Forward-looking statements include management's current expectations, estimates and other projections about our business, results of operations and the industries in which VF operates. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements are discussed in the documents filed with the SEC.","Additionally, participants on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You'll find the appropriate reconciliations in our press release, which was issued about an hour ago, and on our website at vfc.com.","Joining us on today's call will be VF Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Eric Wiseman; Bob Shearer, our Chief Financial Officer; 2 of our Group Presidents, Scott Baxter and Steve Rendle; and Karen Murray, President of VF Sportswear; and Susan Kellogg, President of VF Contemporary Brands. Karl Heinz Salzburger made the flight and is here in North Carolina today, however, he is sick and unable to join us on today's call. So Steve, Scott and Karen will be filling in appropriately for his parts.","Following our prepared remarks, we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions] I'll now turn the call over to VF Chairman and CEO, Eric Wiseman. Eric?","Eric C. Wiseman","Thanks, Lance. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. To set a little context for today's call, we thought it was important to spend a bit more time on our expectations for 2013 and specifically, the strategic initiatives we're concentrating on to drive continued growth across our portfolio. So as a heads-up, today's call will run a bit longer than normal, and as Lance said, we'll allow ample time for questions at the end. Let's get started.","2012 was another year of records for VF: record revenues, record margins, record earnings and record cash flow from operations. It was a year that revealed many strengths of our company and many advantages to our strategy and our business model. In fact, VF has unique strengths in our industry, including a diverse portfolio of more than 30 brands, with innovative and relevant products capable of reaching the broadest array of consumers in every market; deep strategic insights, validated by comprehensive research that yields increasingly greater returns on our marketing investment and ability to attract -- to connect with consumers; an obsessive focus on continuously improving our operational capabilities to drive growth and strong consistent returns to our shareholders; and finally, a highly efficient supply chain that includes owned and sourced manufacturing, which gives us unparalleled structural advantages, including product innovation, speed to market, low cost and outstanding quality. Individually, any one of these strengths would be an enviable asset for any company to have. Yet together, in concert, they're at the center VF's DNA and what allows us to be so successful.","Now let's take a look at how some of these strengths played out for the year just ended. Total revenues grew 15% to $10.9 billion or 17% on a constant dollar basis, including organic growth in every coalition, every geographic region and in both our wholesale and direct-to-consumer businesses. In constant dollars, our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition grew revenues by 31% or 13% on an organic basis. Internationally, constant dollar revenues for the year were up 29% or 11% if you exclude Timberland. And our direct-to-consumer business grew 25%, an increase that now takes our DTC business to 21% of total VF revenues.","Full year gross margin rose by 75 basis points to a record 46.5%, with improvements in nearly every business. And very important to this story is the fact that it's about much more than product cost. Our improvements continue to be impacted most greatly by the shift in our portfolio mix towards higher-growth, higher-margin businesses and geographies.","Our profitability also got stronger this year. In fact, all 5 coalitions ended the year with double-digit operating margins for a combined 13.5%. Excluding Timberland, our operating margin would've reached 14.4%, once again reinforcing our confidence and our ability to reach our 15% goal by 2015.","And finally, our adjusted earnings per share increased 17% to $9.63, well above our long-term expectation for 12% annual EPS growth. And included in that result is $1.12 in earnings per share from Timberland.","Turning to 2013, I'd like to underscore the confidence I have in VF's ability to deliver sustainable profitable growth. All global companies operate in a constantly fluctuating environment, and we have validated time and again our ability to effectively manage our business under a variety of conditions. 2013 is no different. We'll continue to leverage our portfolio and competitive advantages to drive revenue growth, margin expansion and earnings while mitigating risks and most importantly, creating long-term value for our shareholders.","Taking a brief look at a few of our 2013 highlights. First, we expect revenues to increase approximately 6%, which will take us to the $11.5 billion mark. But let me make one thing clear, VF is not a 6% growth company, it's a 10% growth company. In 2013, there were 2 external factors weighing on our growth, both of which are well known to you: First, a second unseasonably warm winter, which is affecting our largest brand, The North Face; and second, weak economic conditions in Europe, which accounts for 22% of VF's revenues. In addition, we have no acquisitions baked into our plan this year. Beyond 2013, our confidence in the power of VF's portfolio to deliver 10% revenue growth remains high.","Below the revenue line, we're expecting substantial margin expansion over the results we just posted in 2012. Gross margins should expand by 100 basis points to 47.5%, and adjusted operating margin is expected to grow by nearly 100 basis points, which puts us very close to our 2015 goal 2 years ahead of schedule. And we expect adjusted earnings per share to grow 11% to $10.70. All of this is expected to yield another record year of cash flow from operations, which should approach $1.4 billion. Clearly, a great year ahead of us, with balanced growth, strong profitability and the leadership you've come to expect from VF.","And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Bob to discuss our fourth quarter financial performance and guidance in greater detail. Bob?","Robert K. Shearer","Thanks, Eric. I'm going to start with a reminder. This is the first quarter where we completely anniversary the Timberland acquisition, so all fourth quarter commentary reflects organic performance. Total revenue growth was 4% in the quarter or 5% in constant dollars. And as in the last 2 quarters, revenue comparisons were negatively impacted by about 1% from the sale of John Varvatos. Excluding the impact of John Varvatos on our Contemporary Brands coalition, every VF coalition worldwide achieved higher revenues in the quarter. Also, we significantly expanded both gross and operating margins in the quarter. Our gross margin increased 220 basis points, reaching 47.4%, an all-time high for any quarter in VF's history. Every coalition achieved a higher gross margin. As you might expect, the biggest increase came in our Jeanswear business, where we continue to move closer to our historically stronger gross margin levels, following the volatility created by rising cotton costs over the past couple years.","And of course, our gross margin increase continues to reflect the shift in our mix toward higher-margin businesses. And that's particularly true in the fourth quarter, given our growing retail store footprint and expanding e-commerce business within our higher-margin lifestyle brands. The positive dynamic of expanding gross margin driven by the faster pace of growth in our higher-margin businesses has been and will continue to be a key component of VF's earnings growth story in both 2013 and in years to come. The increase in adjusted operating margin in the fourth quarter, that is excluding the acquisition-related expenses for Timberland, was even stronger, up 280 basis points and reaching 15.1%.","And a comment on our tax rate, which was right in line with both our expectations and the fourth quarter of the prior year. Our fourth quarter rate is a little lower than our annual rate due to a higher mix of international, with its lower effective rate.","And that brings us to the bottom line and another quarter of record earnings per share. Adjusted fourth quarter earnings per share, again excluding Timberland acquisition-related expenses, increased 32% to $3.07. And as we've seen in prior quarters, the fourth quarter included a combined negative impact from foreign currency and higher pension expense of $0.09 per share. All in all, a great quarter for VF shareholders.","Now a few comments in the fourth quarter financial performance of our coalitions. Our Outdoor & Action Sports business posted a 6% increase in revenues in the quarter. Vans and The North Face continue to exhibit very healthy growth. Timberland declined 4%, which impacted the overall revenue comparison for the coalition in the quarter.","We are particularly pleased by the 11% constant dollar growth in The North Face, given the challenges of another warm winter, difficult conditions in Europe and retailers' carryover of inventory from 2011. Recall too that The North Face faced pretty tough comparisons against last year's fourth quarter, when constant dollar revenues increased 22%. In fact, in the fourth quarter of 2012, The North Face posted healthy growth in all key regions and balanced growth in both its wholesale and direct-to-consumer businesses.","And Vans posted outstanding results. The 22% constant dollar revenue growth in the quarter bears repeating. The brand continues to be on fire in Europe, posting a nearly 60% increase in constant dollar revenues in the fourth quarter. Hereto, we see very balanced growth across geographies and channels. In fact, in the fourth quarter, Vans wholesale business grew over 23%, while its DtoC business increased 18%.","Now for Timberland, the biggest impact in results in the quarter were unseasonably warm weather and difficult conditions in Europe, particularly in Southern Europe, which is Timberland's largest market there. Two bright spots in the quarter were Timberland's direct-to-consumer and Asia businesses, both of which achieved solid growth. We've made a tremendous amount of progress in building the foundation for strong future growth for Timberland in terms of leadership, operations and product development. And we are as convinced as ever that the brand is poised for accelerating growth in the years to come.","The profitability of our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition continues to shine, with an 18% increase in operating income to an operating margin of 18.8%. As you know, Timberland's operating margin is below that of our core Outdoor & Action Sports businesses, which continued to deliver outstanding profitability at the 20% level in the quarter. Given our work with Timberland over the past year, we remain confident that the brand's profitability will approach that of our core Outdoor & Action Sports businesses.","Jeanswear top line results strengthened a bit this quarter, growing by 4% in constant dollars. Our Americas business continues to deliver solid performance, with growth in our Mass, Western and Latin America businesses. On the flip side, Lee's top line continues to experience pressure, both in the U.S. and abroad, with challenging dynamics in mid-tier department stores, weak economic conditions in Europe and a buildup in retailers' inventories in China.","The real story in Jeanswear this quarter is a significant improvement in profitability that I referenced earlier, with operating margin reaching 17.9%, moving closer to our historically stronger levels. Imagewear posted modest top line growth in the quarter, up 2%, but that's against a pretty tough comp for this coalition last year, when fourth quarter revenues grew by a very healthy 10%.","Hereto, the bigger story is the bottom line. In the third quarter, we indicated that the Imagewear operating margin comparison should improve in the fourth quarter, and that's exactly what we saw, operating margin improvement to 13.1%.","In percentage terms, the strongest revenue gain in the quarter was posted by our Sportswear business, where revenues grew by 15%. Both Nautica and Kipling contributed to the quarter's very strong growth. The profitability improvements we started to see last year continued into 2012, with Nautica product performing really well at retail and its DtoC business also showing a lot of improvement. Our Sportswear coalition's momentum on both the top and bottom lines is clearly accelerating and is expected to continue in 2013 as well.","The story in our Contemporary Brands business is also one of both top and bottom line growth. The decline in reported revenues was due entirely to the John Varvatos sale. Otherwise, the businesses, consisting of the 7 For All Mankind, Splendid and Ella Moss brands, saw a 4% gain in revenues in constant dollars. The profit picture in Contemporary Brands also continues to get better, with a substantial improvement posted in 2012 and continued gains expected this year.","And now just a few words on our balance sheet before moving on to our guidance for 2013. VF's balance sheet continues to be in incredible shape. We ended the year with nearly $600 million in cash, and we bought 2 million shares of our stock early in the year. We paid down all outstanding commercial paper borrowings, contributed $100 million to our pension plan and raised our dividend by a very healthy rate. Our strong working capital management was evidenced by a $100 million reduction in inventory year-over-year. And we didn't miss a beat in servicing our businesses' needs. On-time shipping performance was at our highest levels ever. Our strong earnings and working capital management fueled cash flow from operations of nearly $1.3 billion in 2012, another record for VF.","So onto 2013. We entered 2013 with great confidence in our plans for growth. In terms of the top line, we're looking forward to another year of strong balanced growth across our coalitions. In 2013, we expect revenues to increase by about 6%. Our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition should lead the way, with about 10% growth driven by continued strength in both Vans and The North Face brands. Vans is expected to grow nearly 20%; and The North Face, at a high single-digit rate. We're targeting modest growth in Jeanswear, with the continuation of solid performance in our Americas business. Contemporary Brands, excluding John Varvatos, and Sportswear are looking forward to a year of high single-digit growth, while Imagewear is planning for mid-single-digit growth. You'll hear a lot more from our coalition leaders on their brand-specific growth initiatives in just a moment.","International and direct-to-consumer should continue to be key growth drivers for VF in 2013. We're targeting 10% revenue growth in our International business this year. Asia will continue to be our strongest region, growing at a low-teen rate in 2013. And that's below the 17% 5-year target that we presented in September. But as we acknowledged then, and as most of you know, there has been a buildup in inventories in certain categories in China as a result of some moderation in economic growth there last year. That is placing some near-term pressure on our growth, particularly in our Jeans business. We think it will take a couple more quarters for those inventories to clear, at which time we expect to resume growth in Asia closer to our target levels. Our 5-year targets for 17% revenue growth in Asia and 21% in China remain intact. In Europe, our brands continue to expand and gain share, which should help drive a high single-digit increase in our European revenues this year. And on a combined basis, our non-U.S. Americas region is looking forward to a really strong year, with revenues expected to grow at a mid-teen rate.","In 2012, international revenues accounted for 37% of VF's total revenues. And in 2013, we should move to 38% of total revenues as we continue to make progress against our 5-year target of 45%. DtoC will again be a significant growth driver for us in 2013.","We're planning to open about 160 stores this year, up from 141 stores opened in 2012. These stores allow our brands to bring their stories to life and create growth in the face of regional economic and channel pressures while also providing very profitable returns. And speaking of profitable growth, our e-commerce business continues to expand rapidly and should again grow in excess of 30% in 2013. The combination of new stores, comp store growth and e-com increases should drive a mid-teen percentage increase in DtoC revenues this year, resulting in DtoC revenues growing to 23% of total revenues from 21% in 2012.","Now a couple of comments on the expected cadence for revenue growth this year. The quarters that will deviate most from our overall rate for the year are the first and fourth quarters. 2013's first quarter is comping against the first quarter of 2012 that included early shipments of Jeanswear spring\/summer product, which isn't likely to repeat this year. And the inventory issue in China that I mentioned earlier will also mute first quarter revenues. On the other hand, fourth quarter revenue and profit comparisons should be the strongest of the year, reflecting the seasonal benefits from our growing DtoC business.","And now onto margins. In today's release, we indicated that we expect a 100-basis-point improvement in gross margin and a nearly 100-basis-point improvement in operating margin this year. And that's on top of the strong margin improvement we reported today for 2012. The components of this year's increase include the continued mix benefit that I spoke to earlier, lower product costs and a variety of supply chain initiatives designed to drive even greater efficiencies. At the same time, we're planning another big year of brand and technology investments. In fact, our marketing spend should expand even further from 5.3% of revenues in 2012 to 5.6% in 2013, with obviously a much higher rate of spend against our more consumer-facing brands.","And our planned capital expenditures this year are $325 million, up from $252 million in 2012, including the higher number of new store openings, new distribution centers, as well as technology upgrades driving another year of significant investment to support our current and future growth.","Okay, so wrapping up with our earnings per share guidance. Our target for adjusted earnings per share in 2013 is approximately $10.70. That represents 11% growth over the adjusted EPS of $9.63 in 2012 and is in line with our long-term EPS target we set in 2011.","Now just to be clear, the adjusted numbers exclude Timberland-related expenses, which are currently anticipated to be about $15 million or $0.10 per share this year. On a GAAP basis, in other words, including the Timberland acquisition-related expenses and the gain on sale of John Varvatos in early 2012, earnings per share are expected to increase 9% to about $10.60 from $9.70 in 2012.","And for those of you who may be wondering, pension expense should be neutral to our comparisons this year. Also, the assumed euro-to-dollar rate is 1.30. And to anticipate a question you might have, the impact of a $0.05 move in the euro against the dollar would be about $90 million in revenues and $0.15 in EPS.","And one other outstanding item, really no news to report on Billabong, just a continuation of our discussions. And as you probably anticipated, we won't have any other commentary at this point related to Billabong.","So in summary, we're really pleased to wrap up another great year for VF and our shareholders, and we have tremendous confidence in the 2013 guidance we provided to you today. The VF-wide focus on innovation as a key growth driver is clearly working as we outperform our competitors and gain share in nearly every category and market. Our focus on TSR, or total shareholder return, has really paid off, with VF generating a TSR CAGR of 30% over the last 3 years. And we're far from done. We're winning, and we intend to keep winning.","I'm really eager for you to hear about what's next for our brands directly from our business leaders, so let's get to it. First up, Steve Rendle.","Steven E. Rendle","Thanks, Bob. Outdoor & Action Sports is VF's largest and most diverse coalition. Our coalition's portfolio of brands is purpose-built to engage the passions of a wide variety of activity-driven consumers around the world.","In 2012, global revenues for The North Face were up 9% or 11% on a constant dollar basis, including a 13% increase in the brand's DtoC business and double-digit growth, both in the U.S. and internationally.","In 2013, we expect The North Face's global revenues to grow at high single-digit rate. Despite customer caution following 2 consecutive warmer-than-normal winters in the U.S. and challenging conditions in Europe, we are confident in our plans to deliver solid growth and reach another year of record revenues for the brand. The North Face brand is stronger than ever. We continue to win against our competition, and we intend to keep winning.","Coping with current market dynamics has revealed the true strength of The North Face brand and its strategies, specifically, our activity-based model and our advanced product platform. A little more than 3 years ago, we introduced the activity-based model, reorganizing our business around 4 categories: action sports, performance, outdoor and youth. We've successfully broadened our product offering and extended our consumer and customer base. Today, The North Face is a brand for all seasons with a growing footprint in brand-relevant category extensions. And honestly, we're just getting started.","Two years ago, we also upped the investment behind our advanced product platform and accelerated our efforts to create next-generation products to drive consumer demand in all categories. You can see the results of this investment in the success of Flash Dry, our moisture management material technology launched last fall that lets the consumer stay drier and warmer in a broad range of environmental conditions. It sold in and sold through very well in 2012 and continues to show solid performance.","In 2013, you will see the introduction of Thermoball, an exclusive, new insulation material that will serve as the foundation for our insulated outerwear product story, an innovation that is very lightweight, as warm as 600 fill down, yet maintains a high level of thermal insulation when wet. Our activity-based model and advanced product platform are examples of winning strategy. Hoping for snow is not. That's why we're constantly ahead of the curve when it comes to anticipating and meeting the demands of our customers and consumers.","In 2013, we will focus on 3 key pillars to continue to grow the franchise of the world's most powerful outdoor brand: Product, direct-to-consumer and marketing. First, product. We are seeing and leading a change in consumer behavior toward more contemporary, athletic styles for the outdoor category. Style and contemporary fit, color, lighter weight and multiuse are what consumers want in apparel while not sacrificing performance. This is exactly what you'll see in our product lineup in 2013, and it's where leading-edge innovations like Thermoball will make a big difference.","Next is direct-to-consumer. Our e-commerce business continues to be fueled by our omni-channel model, which makes it easy for consumers to access our products whenever and however they choose. In-store and online, it's a digital ecosystem that puts them at the center. We're also continuing to open stores where consumers can experience firsthand the breadth and depth of our brand. At year-end, The North Face had 101 stores globally, which points to the opportunity to bring more consumers into our unique environments. And of course, becoming a better retailer helps us become a better wholesaler, as evidenced by the growing number of shop-in-shops we're building with key retail partners.","Third is marketing. With the world's best outdoor athletes pushing the limits of human performance, we have great stories to engage our consumers. In 2013, our investments will be concentrated in-store and online through national and local media and supported by a growing number of grassroots events, which have proven critical to driving traffic and conversion in all channels of distribution.","In terms of international growth, in 2013, we're looking forward to an even stronger mid-teen growth for The North Face, driven primarily by Asia, where we're expecting revenues to grow by over 30%. China presents a unique growth opportunity for The North Face, the opportunity to define and lead the outdoor category in this dynamic and growing market. New door openings are at the heart of our growth strategy in China, with plans to add 200 locations in 2013. This increase uses a new store format adapted from The North Face's global activity-based model and will bring our total door count for The North Face to more than 800 by year-end.","We're also looking for a year of solid revenue growth in Europe. Despite very weak conditions, the health of The North Face brand has never been stronger. Our ongoing investments there are driving significant gains in total brand awareness and share increases in key markets that will result in high single-digit constant dollar growth for us in 2013. That growth should come from aggressive expansion in our direct-to-consumer presence. We'll open a significant number of stores this year, both owned and with partners, in such key markets as the U.K., Germany, France, Italy and Poland. And we're looking for explosive growth in our e-commerce business, given last year's launch in 6 new markets.","Next up, Vans. Global revenues for Vans in 2012 were up 23% or 26% excluding the impact of foreign currency. In 2013, up a much larger base, we expect Vans to deliver another year of outstanding growth, with revenues expected to increase by nearly 20%. Last June in New York, we announced our 5-year plan for Vans, detailing the initiatives that will add $1 billion in new revenues by 2016. In 2013, our focus remains on the 4 key growth strategies we presented at that meeting: geographic expansion, deep consumer connectivity, product innovation and direct-to-consumer expansion.","In the Americas, we'll execute our global geographic expansion strategy to access new markets here in the U.S., as well as in Canada, Mexico and Latin America. Although Vans has been an integral part of the Southern California landscape for nearly 50 years, our presence on the East Coast and other key regions is quite young, representing an incredible long-term growth opportunity.","Here in the Americas, we'll focus our efforts this year in Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Chicago, as well as in key urban markets in Canada and Mexico. Vans expansion outside the Americas continues to be impressive, with revenue growth of more than 30% in constant dollars.","Vans' international performance in 2012 is one of VF's biggest success stories. Europe was actually our fastest-growing market, with revenues rising more than 60% in constant dollars. And in Asia, revenues grew over 20% on a constant dollar basis. We're very focused on maintaining our momentum in both these markets, with total international growth of about 30% planned for Vans in 2013. In Europe, Vans' phenomenal growth should continue, with revenues expected to rise by over 30% this year. In fact, we expect Vans to become VF's second largest brand behind Timberland in Europe. It's a region where we're using our strength to press our advantage. We're expanding owned full-price stores. We're expanding partnership stores. We are prioritizing investments against top markets such as Germany. And we're investing in a new global marketing campaign.","Next, deep consumer connectivity. Vans is a timeless brand that continues to resonate generation after generation because it stays grounded in action sports, art, music and youth culture, creating, inspiring and leading that conversation. In 2013, we plan to amplify our message with a new global brand campaign called \"Off the Wall is a state of mind.\" This new campaign will unify our global message and be heavily incorporated into our digital and interactive platforms, which are essential to reaching today's young consumers.","Our next growth strategy is product innovation. Last year's LXVI launch, a product that blends the features of action sport shoes with traditional athletic shoes, was an important milestone for us, opening up a new channel of distribution we'll continue to build on in this year. In 2013, a prime example is the UltraCush Lite footwear with cushioning system. It's a custom blend of ultrasoft EVA foam that's lightweight, reduces foot fatigue and increases comfort.","DtoC is a big part of Vans' growth story this year. I spoke earlier about expanding our retail footprint into new geographies. Last year, we launched a new global store format. It's been specifically designed to use the brand's heritage to tell locally relevant stories and has shown good results to-date. And like The North Face, Vans continues to be hyper-focused on its omni-channel vision, expanding and evolving our brick-and-mortar and click-and-order retail platforms to let consumers access Vans however they choose.","DtoC is also a critical growth driver for Vans internationally, especially in emerging markets such as China. In fact, the first store to be retrofit with our new global store format was the Vans flagship store in Beijing, a change that drove 20% growth in same-store sales. In 2013, we plan to roll out this new format to more stores in China and use this as the foundation to leverage our newly owned business in South Korea. Our DtoC growth should be -- should support high-teen revenue growth in Asia this year for Vans.","Now switching gears to Timberland. Full year Timberland revenues on a pro forma basis were up slightly in constant dollars. Timberland was also impacted by challenging economic conditions, especially in Europe, unseasonably warm weather and a cautious retail environment, which we expect to continue into this year.","In 2013, we're expecting mid-single-digit revenue growth for Timberland on a global basis. And while things we can't control, like the economy and weather, are expected to temper the top line, we feel confident and in command of the things we can control. Our new product pipeline continues to gain momentum. We've got fantastic stories to tell, and our distribution channels are now well defined and much cleaner than in the past. And their inventories are well managed and appropriate to the environment.","You may have a question about how we're tracking against the 10% CAGR we gave at the time of the Timberland acquisition. In 2013, our Americas and Asia businesses are right in line with this long-term target. But clearly, conditions in Europe, Timberland's largest market, are proving more difficult than we had originally anticipated.","In 2013, we're targeting mid-single-digit growth. Our focus is on 4 key areas: Product innovation, marketing effectiveness, direct-to-consumer and geographic expansion. Starting with product. I'm happy to report that the work that we've done over the last year with our channel segmentation strategy and our go-to-market discipline has successfully returned the Timberland's yellow boot to iconic status, a status recognized by consumers and favored by our dealers. Our Hookset Handcrafted and the leather boat shoe collections continue to help build significant momentum in the important spring season and are exceeding our expectations.","In 2013, we'll launch the Earthkeepers Heritage collection, which is an eco-friendly line of footwear, featuring legacy crafted details straight from the Timberland vault, combined with modern styling and comfort. We also have new additions to the Timberland Boot Company collection, our most premium line of footwear, featuring details like premium leather and hand-painted finishes that are inspired by a time when footwear was a tool built for a purpose.","This fall, we're set to relaunch men's apparel in the U.S. with targeted specialty department stores, as well as with our own Timberland stores and online. This is a great opportunity for us to extend the brand's identity and authenticity. Although the launch will be intentionally small and modestly incremental to revenues, we have great confidence that this will stage -- will set the stage for our ultimate goal of adding $300 million in revenues to our existing $270 million global apparel business. We know you're eager to see it, so we're planning a preview sometime this summer.","Turning to marketing. A new global campaign called \"Best then. Better now.\" will build on the brand's historic strength while delivering a new contemporary look and feel. It's very elegant, aspirational and brand building. Also we're planning to increase our investments in digital and print ads in a very focused manner to strengthen consumers' brand perception and drive wholesale and DtoC traffic.","In terms of DtoC expansion, with new leadership in place and a focus on store-level KPIs, we're expecting high single-digit growth in the Americas, with improved profitability in full-price, outlet and e-commerce channels. And strengthened by digital marketing efforts and an overall site experience, we're expecting a near 50% increase in revenues for Timberland's e-commerce here in the Americas.","On the international front, Timberland's international business is expecting slight revenue growth in 2013, with a mid-single-digit decline in Europe, where conditions in Italy, the brand's largest market, remain challenging. In Asia, we expect a mid-teen increase, a region where the brand continues to post consistently strong results.","A major focus for us in 2013 will be the integration of Timberland into our European operations, a big move but critical to establishing our platform for future growth in Europe and improving profitability. We're also working to expand our successful partnerships to our program in Europe with the addition of 40 doors, bringing total doors to approximately 300 in the region, greatly increasing brand presence and visibility. In terms of our own doors, we're continuing to assess our current footprint with a keen eye towards improved profitability through increased conversion and traffic.","In Asia, you'll recall that we announced a 13% compounded growth rate target over the next 5 years. And despite some softness in Japan, Timberland's largest Asian market, the brand grew double digits there in 2012. And we're expecting similar growth in 2013. And in China, where we're just getting started, revenues are expected to grow 30%. We're also excited to launch 6 new owned stores in Shanghai, an extremely influential city, where in conjunction with The North Face, we're leading the conversation on Outdoor.","Now I'll turn it over to Scott to take a look at Jeanswear.","Scott H. Baxter","Thank you, Steve. Good morning, everyone. In 2012, global revenue for VF's Jeanswear business was up 2% or 4% in constant dollars, a performance that reflects a mid-single-digit increase in the Americas. In addition to the top line story, there is also a story of improving profitability for both Wrangler and Lee in every region of the world. Long-term growth prospects for our Jeanswear business remain strong. Near term, we'll be navigating challenging macro conditions globally. We're expecting modest growth in our global Jeanswear business this year, with our focus, front and center, on consumer-centric product innovation. Our pipeline of new products for 2013 and beyond is designed to bring style, function and performance benefits to consumers in all channels and regions.","Starting with Wrangler, our highest-margin Western Specialty business should continue its momentum in 2013. Product innovation lies at the heart of our success in this business, with a portfolio of products to meet customer needs from Premium Performance Cowboy Cut for authentic cowboys to the Wrangler 20X Competition Jean for the more aspirational western lifestyle consumer. Not only are our key retail partners adding doors, but we're also growing our business outside the Western channel into sporting goods, outdoor and regional mid-tier locations.","2013 should also mark another year of growth for our Mass business, driven by new products like Wrangler advanced comfort, which features denim that is both stronger and more flexible. We're also seeing great success with our Wrangler tops program. We also expect double-digit constant dollar growth in Wrangler Latin America to continue, fueled by retail expansion in Argentina and Chile.","Wrangler's business in Europe remained challenging in 2012, although our profitability continued to improve. In 2013, we expect further improvement of profitability and are looking forward to the launch of a new product innovation, denim performance for men. Denim performance is focused on the functionality of jeans, a core part of the Wrangler's heritage, incorporating extra pockets, better breathability, better durability and water and stain resistance in both jeans and outerwear. Denim performance gives Wrangler a clear, defined, competitive advantage in the market.","Taking a look at Lee. In 2012, global revenues were flat on a constant dollar basis. In 2013, we're expecting slight growth on a global basis, driven by mid-single-digit growth in the Americas. Our Lee Platinum label collection performed well in 2012, including a test with a major department store customer that was very successful. And we're looking forward to the continued expansion of our collection in 2013.","The mid-tier remains challenged, but let me say this, we're not sitting back and waiting for recovery here. We are aggressively pursuing consumers with portfolio of innovative products that offer great fit, fashion and functional benefits. There's Perfect Fit for women and modern series for men as 2 examples of consumer-centric innovation. These new products will also help head the support of a new marketing campaign from a new agency.","Internationally, in 2012, we saw an improvement in profitability in Europe. And in 2013, we expect continued improvement. Our Stretch Deluxe line has been a real bright spot there, delivering 15% growth in women's jeans in 2012. In 2013, we'll continue that momentum by focusing on our bestseller, a fit called Scarlett, which will be available in 25 new combinations of color and fabric, building on the success of Stretch Deluxe. We'll launch a collection for men called Blue Label or Premium by Lee. We've also continued to test Lee's new full-price model with a cluster of owned stores in Benelux. And we'll be launching a new partner store in Germany, Scandinavia and the U.K.","In Asia, we talked about our long-term plans for the region in great detail back in September in Shanghai. In the near term, however, the jeanswear industry has been affected by efforts to right-size inventories, and Lee is not immune. Lee's performance in Asia will be particularly challenging in the first half and begin to normalize in the second half.","In the meantime, our focus is on the innovative product, growing the number of doors, new marketing campaigns and expanding digital and e-commerce platforms.","And now I'd like to take a few minutes to talk about VF's Imagewear business. Imagewear is VF's third largest coalition and a consistent performer, having now delivered 11 consecutive quarters of revenue growth. In 2012, the business grew by 5%, with strength on both sides of the business, Image and Licensed Sports Group. In 2013, we're expecting mid-single-digit growth as well.","Quickly, I'd like to touch on a few highlights of what's made Imagewear a consistent growth engine. Our success with Red Kap's new products in automotive workwear has opened up new channels of distribution, including retail.","We're also partnering with the Wrangler brand to reach new untapped channel, B2B workwear. Wrangler Workwear is a new line of premium shirts, pants and outerwear loaded with innovative features to improve comfort and durability. After successful tests in 2012, we're planning for a much broader rollout.","Finally, the Licensed Sports Group will continue to build its momentum with a new line of products within our Majestic, Authentic MLB collection. In further expansion of our successful lines of NFL apparel for men and women.","And now Karen Murray will take you through the Sportswear coalition. Karen?","Karen Murray","Thank you, Scott. We're expecting revenues for the Sportswear coalition to increase at a high single-digit rate in 2013. Let's look a little deeper at where that growth will come from, starting with VF's sixth largest brand, Nautica.","In 2013, revenues for the Nautica brand are expected to grow at a high single-digit rate. Nautica's key growth initiatives for 2013 are direct-to-consumer expansion and product innovation.","Nautica's direct-to-consumer channel should see double-digit growth in 2013, driven by double-digit comp store growth, new store openings and exceptional e-commerce growth of over 50%. In fact, we plan to launch an entirely new Nautica website this year, a timely event given our 30th anniversary of the brand.","Our next growth initiative is product innovation. We are continuing to develop a performance platform to differentiate the brand and provide new value to consumers. Products that feature water-oriented performance features, such as moisture-wicking, water-repellence and breathability currently make up 35% of our assortment. This will grow with the full 2013 introduction of elevated fashion performance products. In addition, we plan to expand our jeans offering in all doors to gain share in denim and with younger consumers.","One final note on Nautica before I move on. We also expect heavy -- healthy double-digit growth in our licensed international business as we expand into 3 new emerging markets: Turkey, Russia and Brazil.","Although we don't normally talk about Kipling, which is part of the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition internationally and Sportswear in the United States, the brand has become an increasingly larger and more important top and bottom line contributor for VF. Kipling is a fun global handbag and accessories brand with incredible strength. And as excited as we are about its near-term success, we're even more excited about its long-term growth prospects.","In 2013, we expect Kipling to grow global revenues at a low double-digit rate, fueled by strong growth in every region of the world, including more than a 30% increase expected in the United States. Kipling's U.S. direct-to-consumer business, which represents more than half of the brand's U.S. revenues, is expected to see exceptional growth in 2013 fueled on both the retail and e-commerce fronts. We are testing a new full-price retail store concept, and e-commerce will contribute significantly, aided by the launch of a new website and a global digital marketing campaign. Kipling's successful exclusive handbag partnership with Macy's is expected to continue to grow in 2013 as we add new products, expand it to new doors and work to expand our presence with this important partner.","Kipling is famous for its crinkled nylon, and we see plenty of white space for product innovation within and beyond this material. In 2013, we're looking at metallic, patent leather and lacquer materials. And we plan to introduce new product categories, such as backpacks, scarves, hats, umbrellas and jewelry.","In summary, our coalition is in a very different place today than it was just a few short years ago. We're seeing significant acceleration in our top line growth and profitability. Our momentum is set, and we are on a roll.","Now my colleague, Susan Kellogg, will take you through Contemporary Brands.","Susan Kellogg","All right, everyone, rest assured, we're almost done. In 2012, excluding the John Varvatos brand, which we sold in April, Contemporary Brands North America revenue were up 9%, with solid results from 7 For All Mankind, Splendid and the Ella Moss brands. In 2013, we're expecting our high single-digit growth to continue, starting with 7 For All Mankind. The brand's key growth initiatives are similar to what you've heard throughout the call today: Product innovation, direct-to-consumer expansion and deeper engagement with the consumers.","On the product innovation front, in 2013, we plan to introduce 2 new fabric innovations: Slim Illusion second skin for women and lux performance in casual denim for men. Slim Illusion second skin is a proprietary denim with 100% elasticity, which means it will keep its shape, fit and feel throughout the life of the product. Lux performance is stretch distressed denim for men that combines the rugged look men want with unsurpassed comfort while also returning -- retaining its shape for the life of the product.","Next is direct-to-consumer expansion, fueled by high single-digit comp growth and expected 20% increase in e-com revenue. We're also excited about launching our China website later this year and are looking forward to engaging consumers in this important market.","Finally, we're creating deeper engagement with consumers by telling evocative stories in a new way, enabled by digital technology and social media. Building on our success from last year, we're bringing back Oscar-nominated actor and film maker, James Franco, to create our 2012 marketing campaign. But there's a new twist. Instead of making films that you simply watch, we've created a new interactive experience that allows consumers to view the story one part at a time and vote on how they want it to unfold. We'll use this content to surround our millennial consumer and build our brand affinity and fuel our top and bottom line growth.","Next, our Splendid and Ella Moss brands that, on a combined basis, continue to post strong double-digit revenue growth year-after-year. Splendid's growth will be driven by aggressive DTC expansion. In fact, we expect DTC revenues to nearly double for the second consecutive year. We plan to open more than 15 new owned stores in 2013. Every store helps drive healthy brand awareness, which we know helps us win in all of our channels. Splendid and Ella Moss are just getting started, and the pace of their growth is very encouraging. And when you combine the potential of fast growing brands with VF's scale, distribution and operational efficiency, we believe we have a tremendous opportunity for future growth.","In summary, we're looking forward to a great year of combined and continued brand momentum, coupled with game-changing innovation across all of our Contemporary Brands.","And now I'll hand it back over to Eric.","Eric C. Wiseman","Thanks, Susan. That concludes our prepared remarks. But before we open the line for questions, I'd to take a moment to thank a member of our team, who recently announced her decision to retire at the end of March, Cindy Knoebel. Cindy began her career at VF in 1993 to establish our vendor relations function. Over the last 20 years, she's continued to add new responsibilities to her role, including corporate communications, public relations and sustainability. Throughout her career here at VF, Cindy's communication skills and strategic insights have been instrumental in building strong support for VF's strategic transformation by fostering strong relationships with the company's employees and investors and the media. Almost everyone on this call knows Cindy, and many of you know her well, so you know she'll be greatly missed. Please join me in thanking Cindy for everything she's done for us and for you. And we're wishing her the very best as she begins a new chapter in her life.","And of course, you already know Lance Allega, our Director of Investor Relations who joined us last time -- last year at this time. He will now be leading VF's investor relations functions, so also join me in congratulating Lance.","And with that, operator, let's open the line for questions. Cindy will be happy to take all of your questions today.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question, we'll hear from Bob Drbul with Barclays.","Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Cindy, congratulations.","Cindy Knoebel","Thanks, Bob.","Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess, Eric, the 2 questions that I have, I guess, relate around the Outdoor business a little bit. When you look at the top line that you've driven, especially at The North Face versus the industry, it's been pretty impressive. And I was just wondering if you guys can comment around inventory levels at retail, mainly around The North Face. But I would also be interested just to understand inventories of Timberland product and especially as it looks to the mid-single-digit growth rate for 2013 that you expect in Timberland.","Eric C. Wiseman","Yes, Bob, Steve will take that question for you.","Steven E. Rendle","Yes, so Bob, inventory, I mean, the channel, we really have 2 stories here, the TNF inventory is higher than we have seen historically. I think the good news is the last 4 or 5 weeks since December, week 5, cold weather has returned to much of the U.S., and we've seen really nice increases in retail sell-through. Timberland really came through, fourth quarter, in a much, much cleaner situation and enters this year with very clean inventories in all of their channels.","Robert K. Shearer","And then what we'd also say there, Bob, is that in Europe, inventories are probably a little cleaner than that, a little better shape.","Operator","And next, we'll move to Kate McShane with Citi.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","With regards to The North Face and maybe any potential changes that could be anticipated over the next couple of years, how should we think of your product mix flowing throughout the winter season? Does it impact margins at all? And are you converting or changing your sourcing with regards to The North Face in the near term?","Steven E. Rendle","Yes, Kate, so I'll take that one as well. The product mix stays very similar to what you've seen in the European market. Cold-weather apparel continues to be very important, especially in the northern region and some of the emerging markets. Here in the U.S., and as well as in Europe, we do see an increase in more contemporary athletic silhouettes which will, we believe, with our focus on the activity-based model and the learnings we have from our running, training [ph] business, we're well on the forefront of evolving our collections to meet that new consumer demand. We do see an increase in the lighter weight, what we call transitional weight insulated goods. That's made of synthetic insulations, down insulations, as well as fleeces. And again, we're well on the path of being on the front end of that trend. Margins in these categories remain the same, so there really is no change there. And our sourcing model here in Asia, as well as here in the Americas, remains the same and is well placed to be able to service what we consider will be increasing demand.","Eric C. Wiseman","Kate, I'll add one thing to that. If you think about the short term, the next 12 months for The North Face brand, our fastest growth rate will be in Asia, followed by Europe and followed by the U.S. Another way to slice that is to say our direct-to-consumer business is going to grow faster than our wholesale business. All of those facts point to higher margins for The North Face. The mix in geographies and the mix in channels will -- should expand our gross margins next year -- gross and operating margins next year.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's great. And I forgot to say congratulations to Cindy and to Lance.","Lance Allega","Thanks, Kate.","Operator","And we'll move on to Jim Duffy with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Cindy, we'll miss you. A couple questions. First, on The North Face and timing of shipments, are retailers reticent to take inventories as early as they have in the past? Should we expect any shift in revenue from 3Q to 4Q in the U.S. business like we saw in Europe in 2012?","Steven E. Rendle","Yes, so Jim, this is Steve. Timing of shipments, I don't really see a dramatic shift here or in Europe. I think what you'll see is just a more cautious prebook. And consumers -- or our retailers looking to take deliveries closer to demand. But timing should remain the same, and no dramatic shifts quarter-to-quarter.","Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. Shifting gears a bit to Sportswear, great improvement there in the operating margin for the year. Sounds like good momentum in the direct-to-consumer. Should we expect the momentum in the operating margin improvement to continue for that coalition in '13?","Karen Murray","Yes, you should.","Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Bob, care to elaborate on that?","Eric C. Wiseman","Yes, he should.","Robert K. Shearer","Yes, Jim, actually, I'll expand just a little bit, right? So actually, in both the Sportswear, as well as Contemporary, we've seen really nice improvement. And for 2013, we expect those businesses to improve to the low and even closer to the mid-teen operating margin levels, with a 15% operating margin clearly in our sight. So yes, we're seeing a lot of opportunity there for continued and significant improvement.","Eric C. Wiseman","In both.","Robert K. Shearer","In both.","Operator","And Michael Binetti with UBS will have our next question.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Can you give us an idea of the -- what the Timberland operating margins look like in the quarter and what the Timberland operating margins are that are implied in the plus-100-basis-point guidance for the company for 2013, please?","Robert K. Shearer","Yes, I'll handle that. I'll talk about for the year, Michael, for 2012. We started the year saying that we thought our operating margin for Timberland would be in the 10% to 11% area, and that's where we ended up. We were just above 10% actually in 2012. For 2013, what we're looking at is, as you'd expect, where you expect to grow our gross margins in 2013. But Steve mentioned something in his comments that there are a couple areas that we're going to be spending against, and those are in product, in the product development area, as well as we're going to up the marketing spend there as well. So improved gross margin in 2013, exactly what we need to see, but the operating margin will remain relatively flat, maybe up just a little bit from what we saw in 2012 because of the spend.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And just 2 quick follow-ups here. Could you just help us out, the order book you're seeing for the big brands, Vans and North Face, for the spring?","Steven E. Rendle","Sure. So order book for our Vans business is quite strong, which is leading us to the guidance we gave for the brand, both here and in Europe. And order book in The North Face is moderate, as you might expect, with the caution that we see in our dealer base, both in the U.S. and Asia. I mean, in Europe. But our Asia business is quite strong. So just up slightly, right in line with how we've guided the brand.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And one -- just one last one. Eric, is there any opportunity to do -- to start talking about a shop-in-shop with JCPenney this year? We've had the Vans product and the Lee product in there historically, and some of the competitor sales brands has -- look like they've signed up for some distribution there under the new store format. I wanted to see if there was an update there for us.","Eric C. Wiseman","Yes, that's a great question, and we are in active discussions right now with Penneys about what a Lee shop or a Vans shop might look like and when they might appear, but I don't have an update on exactly when that will be.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. All right. And congrats to Cindy and Lance as well.","Lance Allega","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","And next, we'll move to Edward Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Best of luck, Cindy. Can you talk a little bit about the benefits you saw from the step-up in advertising? And then also, you've indicated that advertising as a percent of sales will also increase in '13. Should we expect that to be back-end weighted?","Eric C. Wiseman","Yes, the -- we measure -- actually, for all of our big brands, we measure the impact of our investments behind those brands. And your question was about advertising. We obviously measure that. We have a pretty good feel. We measure it year-after-year by media type, and each brand knows what their consumer responds to. And because of that, that's why our ad spend has increased consistently over the last 4 or 5 years and why our investment is going up another 30 basis points this year. We think now is a great year to do that because we're expecting consumers to take a little coaxing to get them to engage with brands, and we're in a position to do that. The seasonal mix really varies by brand. For our Jeans business in the U.S., it's really important that we hit back-to-school hard. For our colder weather brands, it's important that we hit the third quarter, and the holiday quarter's important for everyone. I hope that helped.","Operator","And we'll move on to Evren Kopelman with Wells Fargo.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask about -- for The North Face, you talked a little bit about the, I guess, merchandising, some of the lighter-weight transitional goods, maybe the activity-based model helping, is -- I'm thinking is kind of this weather is here to stay, the global warming type conversations. How about for the Timberland brand? I think the new apparel that's coming in the U.S. is more outerwear-focused. Maybe you could talk if for that brand, there are conversations on the merchandising side to be kind of more versatile, seasonless maybe as well.","Steven E. Rendle","Sure. So I think it's important to note that our apparel business in Europe is the strongest in any of the regions. And our international business, we're about a $220 million business. Here in the U.S., as we look to relaunch the brand and very thoughtfully through select specialty and department store partners, we'll be placing outerwear but also a very robust collection of sportswear. So I think you can think about a really balanced approach of sportswear and outerwear, natural fibers, cottons and leathers and more of that rugged outdoor feel that you would expect from Timberland.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then second question is on the M&A front. Are you still focused -- I think you've said in the past, the Outdoor & Action Sports area? Or is there any interest in the contemporary areas you've looked into before, even more footwear now that you have the Timberland and the footwear expertise with that?","Eric C. Wiseman","I think the answers to your question are yes, yes and yes. All of those are areas that we're exploring. We clearly have been focused in the Outdoor & Action Sports area, and we've talked about that as being our priority. But in each of our coalitions, we understand where there are opportunities for us to add to the portfolio in a really accretive way to the portfolio. In other words, giving us either a skill set or a product category that reaches the consumer in a different way. That's how each coalition thinks about it. And our focus has been on Outdoor & Action Sports, but that doesn't mean we're only looking at that area.","Evren Dogan Kopelman - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and congrats to Cindy and Lance as well.","Steven E. Rendle","Thank you very much.","Operator","And we'll move on to Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I wanted to follow up on the Asia growth rate comments, as we've seen that compress over the last quarter and then kind of a little bit more of a tempered guide for next year in the low-teens range. You highlighted the inventory in the channel with respect to the jeans market in China. Can you elaborate a little bit more on what you're seeing in that market in particular there? And then how do you think about the competitive space broadly in China in that Outdoor segment at this point? Have you seen any inventory creepage in that channel there? Are you still pretty pleased with that performance?","Eric C. Wiseman","Sure, great question. We -- in September, when we were in Shanghai, we guided that we thought we could grow Asia 17% compounded over the next 5 years. And now we're talking about a low-teen rate for 2013, and it really is solely -- the sole issue we have is our inventory in our Jeanswear -- in the industry and with our brand as well. If you look at our other businesses in China, The North Face, Timberland, Vans and Kipling, they are all on track to the kind of growth rates we talked about in September. Jeanswear, with the Lee brand in particular, was the first brand we launched there. For example, it's got a 12-year head start on The North Face. One was launched in '95, the other in 2007. So it has much broader distribution than Lee does, much broader distribution, many more touch points with consumers and a lot more inventory in the space. And that's where we have this short-term issue. We expect to work through that issue in the first half of the year, begin to gain growth momentum in the second half of the year and be back on track in 2014 with the kind of growth rates we talked about. U.S., the second question, I forgot it, sorry. Can you repeat it?","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I just -- yes, sorry, I was just asking about...","Eric C. Wiseman","Oh, the outdoor.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","The competitive landscape in the outdoor space and if you've seen any kind of inventory creepage there as well.","Eric C. Wiseman","Yes, we have not seen in our brand with -- that's really -- our focus there has been primarily on The North Face until recently, obviously, when we acquired Timberland. So we now think we have a great -- we're in a great position to shape the conversation about outdoor in China. And we have not seen an inventory issue with either of our brands, and I'm not aware of an inventory build with other brands.","Operator","And we'll move on to Mitch Kummetz with Robert Baird.","Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Bob, let me start with you. Just you gave a little color on the sales growth by quarter and you mentioned that Q1 is the toughest comparison. So in light of the 6% growth that you're looking for the year, kind of where do you think Q1 falls in? I mean, are you talking sort of low single digits? And then also, I was hoping for a little color on kind of the operating margin cadence. You've got your easiest kind of op margin comparison in the first quarter, with Jeanswear still having been impacted by the input costs. And I was kind of wondering how we should think about that. And I have a follow-up.","Robert K. Shearer","Yes, Mitch, the -- to the first question relative to the first quarter, yes, we could be a few percentage points off the 6%. That's what we expect, a few percentage points below the 6% rate that we talked about for the year. In terms of the cadence of margins, you're absolutely right. Maybe I'll talk about both gross margin, as well as operating margin. We expect to see the strongest comparison in the first quarter from a gross margin standpoint, which is what you'd expect, right? We're up against -- we're comping against the highest costs of the year in -- especially in the denim side of things in 2012 in the first quarter. So that should be the strongest comp from a gross margin standpoint. But at the operating margin line, because of the significant growth, particularly on the direct-to-consumer side in the fourth quarter, that's where we expect to see the strongest expansion in operating margin.","Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And then a follow-up for Steve on Timberland. A couple of things there. One, could you talk a little bit about kind of where would Q4 sales have come in, if there's some way you can adjust for the distribution changes that you've seen? And those distribution changes, do those continue to be a bit of a top line headwind as we go through 2013? And then also, could you talk about the impact of apparel on the business in 2013? I mean, just in terms of relaunching in North America, I mean, is there any way you can sort of assign a dollar value to that in terms of kind of incremental revenues?","Steven E. Rendle","Mitch, I'll do my best to answer this question without really being able to give you dollar values, which I know you're looking for. The distribution changes that we enacted, we started at the beginning of the year, it's hard for me to put a number on it. I can tell you that it absolutely did have an impact in our sales, but so did our store closures, as well as less closeout inventory, which the brand would've shown historically. So it did have an impact, but it wasn't the major driver. Impact from our apparel, as I've mentioned in my comments, will be very minimal. We're being very thoughtful and very selective in how we launch the new product here in the United States. We want to position it with the best specialty and department store players so as to really position the brand and give the product the right theater to be presented and to be supported by the footwear. So sales will be very minimal. The growth next year will come from our footwear, as well as the growth that I mentioned in DtoC and wholesale.","Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, got it. Good and thanks for everything, Cindy.","Operator","And we'll move on to Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So as we dig deeper overseas, can you speak to your level of enthusiasm in Europe next year and also, in-sale brand or category opportunities as we look forward over there?","Eric C. Wiseman","Sure, I'll take that. This is Eric. Our expectation for next year in Europe is for a high single-digit increase. So I step back from that and say we're really taking share in Europe. We're doing that because of our portfolio of brands and the different -- the number of countries we do business in. We clearly have some countries that are really challenging. We've talked about Italy, it's a tough place to sell apparel and footwear right now. And we have brands, though, that are, on the other end of the spectrum, really delivering in Europe, like Vans did for us in 2012 and will again. So while there are challenges, what we've done is look at which brands are in which markets and where are the opportunities to invest, and we're investing with real focus behind Vans in markets like the U.K., Germany and France, and in other brands where there's an opportunity to grow. And that'll help us navigate through the European challenges right now and deliver high single-digit increases in a really tough space.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's great. And then second question, your inventory levels, very tightly managed. We haven't seen levels like this for a couple years. How should we think about how you're managing this across brands? And then what is the game plan looking forward from an inventory perspective?","Robert K. Shearer","Well, we manage our inventories pretty similarly across brands. And obviously, the retail component of any individual business has some bearing in terms of our overall inventory levels. But this was a year -- actually glad you referenced it. This was a year where we are -- I guess, we put some extra focus on our inventories and we saw -- we really saw a great progress. We have very, very frequent face-to-face conversations about inventory. As I see some smiles around the room here from our group folks and presidents. And it's just an area that we just put a lot of focus and have been able to put or make an awful lot of improvements. So for 2013, we will continue to do the same. Actually, in our cash guidance, our assumption is that inventories will generally grow. After the reduction in 2012, we'll pretty much grow with revenues. However, I can tell you that we'll push hard to do a little bit better than that relative to our overall inventory. There is still some room for improvement.","Eric C. Wiseman","Yes, I'm going to weigh in on this because I want to give a shout out to our supply chain and front-end guys. They're working together on a new process that looks at our inventory in a different way, and they're doing that across every business unit in every geography. And part of it is a new process, and that's let us grow our business like we did last year and still take $100 million out of inventory and service at a high level. And kudos to them for coming up with a new process and making it stick.","Operator","And next, we'll hear from Eric Tracy with Janney Capital Markets.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I'll add my congrats to Cindy. Really appreciate the help throughout the years. And congrats to Lance as well. Eric, I guess, if I could for you, just broader on the domestic front sort of beyond the seasonality issues. So on your macro, you're going to have the various potential sort of tailwinds versus some of the headwinds on the tax front or energy costs, sort of what your expectation here is domestically?","Eric C. Wiseman","Well, we read the same stuff you do, Eric, about how economists see the U.S. economy, and the question is how are people going to react to changes in tax rates and changes in healthcare costs and all that. And clearly, there are going to be pressures on disposable income in America. That seems pretty much laid out. In that environment, we have a mid-single growth -- mid-single-digit growth rate kind of baked into our assumption for this year. We think that's taking share as well, similar to the way I answered the Europe question. We really look across our portfolio of brands and ask, where can we win? And where we think we can, we try to distort our investment to ensure we do. And that's how we think we can deliver a mid-single-digit growth rate in an economy that's clearly not going to grow that quickly. We still have some challenges to get through here. Fortunately, VF is going to get through them pretty well.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe, Steve, for you on Timberland, maybe just a little bit more color in terms of the, I guess, sort of soft launch on the apparel side for fall this year. I know it's going to be tight, but sort of the expectations for what that contributes. And I think you said sort of the incremental $300 million, maybe just speak to, again, the timing cadence of that.","Steven E. Rendle","Sure. So just I think to restate, the launch here in the United States is on top of a very robust apparel business internationally. We have a very select number of new specialty and department store partners. We'll place it very thoughtfully with the whole focus of getting strong profitable sell-through with our retail partners so we build a platform for the future. That $300 million that we mentioned at point of acquisition is over a 5-year horizon. That would take you then through 2016, where we look to add that incremental growth across the global apparel business.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe last for Bob. Is it possible to quantify the 100 basis points of gross margins in sort of the various buckets? Again, the mix shifts, I get, are driving it. But maybe just between that, lower input costs, just walk us through and quantify for '13.","Robert K. Shearer","Sure, Eric. The -- it's actually going to be a pretty consistent story here over the past several years. And we talked about this a lot, that our mix shift has been providing us 60 to 70 basis points of improvement in our gross margin very consistently every year, and it's exactly what we expect for 2013 as well. The remainder are, in fact, product costs. Some lower product costs, Jeanswear is a component of that, to be sure, so is Imagewear, which had some higher product costs in 2012. So it's 60 to 70 for mix and the remainder coming from product costs.","Operator","And we do have time for one final question. Next, we'll hear from Omar Saad with ISI Group.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Lance, congratulations. And Cindy, definitely a shout out for such an amazing tenure. I think you do go down as a legend in IR, in the sector, not just for the tenure and the duration, but obviously, the excellence as well. So congrats to you both. I wanted to ask you about -- obviously, VF over the years really has been the company that's kind of almost pioneered this idea of the lifestyle brand in the apparel sector. Certainly coming out of North America, done a tremendous job building lifestyle brands over time. Can you talk about -- the area where you've had probably the most success is in the Outdoor & Action Sports. Are you -- how are you thinking about the lifestyle of Outdoor & Action Sports? Are you seeing any changes in how consumers are thinking about that lifestyle? Is it becoming more subtle? Is it becoming more segmented across different types of outdoor sports and action sports? What are you guys seeing in that marketplace from a lifestyle perspective?","Steven E. Rendle","So Omar, I'll take a shot at this, and Eric can fill in if I miss something. I think the outdoor lifestyle, which we've certainly been at the forefront of helping create and certainly benefit from, continues to be on the forefront of consumer minds. We look a lot at macro trends across all of the regions. And healthy lifestyle, fitness and kind of that whole notion of getting back to simplicity really plays into the historical strengths of the outdoor industry. We do see really strong influence of action sports, as well as athletic coming in and speaking to a broad number of our consumers. And I mentioned how we're looking at that athletic trend and what that means to outdoor apparel becoming more lighter weight, more contemporary in its fit while maintaining that core function. But I think the key here also is that action sports, that lifestyle component that, that plays into, that again, our Vans business has been very strong at helping shape and is again at the forefront of being able to maximize that.","Eric C. Wiseman","Yes, Omar, one thing that the Vans guys have done that quite frankly just impresses me beyond speech almost is they have kept that brand relevant to youth for over 40 years. And they've done that by not trying to speak to a customer but by speaking to youth. And they understand youth need to be individually expressive and creative, and they've changed their message and how they do that, customized it to each new generation. And that's why they're still relevant and leading with youth around the world.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. And then maybe on a related topic, it was interesting to hear you're going to accelerate marketing spend and store openings. How are you thinking about that? What gives you the confidence to do that? It's great to hear it, obviously, from a brand standpoint, but any update or thoughts there would be helpful.","Eric C. Wiseman","Sure, Omar. We went back to our thinking in 2010, and you were following us then, and you know that we increased our investment -- our brand investment number by $100 million that year because we thought the economy was going to be a little wobbly and that we had the brands and the products to make a difference and accelerate our performance. And we think this is going to be that kind of year as well. We know our retail formats work. They're tested and proven. And as I mentioned earlier to someone else's question, we measure the effectiveness of our marketing, so we know which messages work and which don't. And we're going to distort our investments behind brands in geographies with proven retail formats and proven marketing communication. And we think that formula is going to help us get through this pretty difficult time in the global economy.","Operator","And that will conclude our question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the call back over to the speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Eric C. Wiseman","No, just thank you, all, for joining us. We're really excited about 2013. We think we've got all the pieces in motion to deliver another great year, and we're blessed by having a legend in Investor Relations in the room today, and we wish her well as all of you do. Thanks so much for being with us.","Operator","And that will conclude today's call. We thank you for your participation."],"21502":["V.F.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Jean Fontana. Please go ahead.","Jean Fontana","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for VF Corporation's Third Quarter 2012 Conference Call. By now you should have received today's earnings press release. If not, please call (203) 682-8200, and we'll send you a copy immediately following the call. Hosting today's call is Eric Wiseman, Chairman and CEO of VF Corp.","Before we begin, I would like to remind participants that certain statements included in today's remarks and the Q&A session may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements include management's current expectations, estimates and projections about business and results of operations and the industries in which VF operates. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements are discussed in the documents filed with the SEC.","I would now like to turn the call over to Eric Wiseman.","Eric C. Wiseman","Thanks, Jean. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me today are Bob Shearer, our Chief Financial Officer; and our 3 group Presidents: Scott Baxter, Steve Rendle and Karl Heinz Salzburger. We are now 3 quarters through the year, and I can say with confidence that 2012 will mark another year of outstanding performance for our shareholders. However, the economic news is decidedly mixed. We're seeing some slowing in the U.S. economy, increasingly challenging conditions in Europe and slowing growth in China.","Against this backdrop, VF delivered another quarter of record revenues, margins and earnings. We raised our earnings guidance, increased our dividend payments for the 40th consecutive year and confirmed our expectation for all-time highs in revenues, earnings and cash flow. And we're looking forward to wrapping up the year on a very strong note with fourth quarter constant dollar revenue growth of 7% in the first fully comparable quarter with Timberland under VF's ownership and an increase in adjusted earnings per share of just over 30%.","I'll take just a minute to comment on a few items I think are of most interest to all of you. First is VF's margin recovery story, which is playing out even better than we envisioned at the beginning of the year, and it's not all about product cost. We're seeing the continued benefit of the transformation of VF's portfolio toward higher-growth, higher-margin businesses and geographies. Our profitability is strong and getting stronger, reinforcing our confidence in reaching the 15% long-term operating margin target we set last year.","Our international performance story also remains healthy with solid growth in the quarter. In China with 23% growth this quarter and growth across all major brands, I think you will agree that our performance there has been exceptional. Having announced last month our new 5-year growth rate target of 21% through 2017 in China, we continue to be very bullish on our prospects in this dynamic and increasingly important market for VF.","In terms of Europe, no doubt that you noted the 3% constant dollar growth in our European revenues, which follows a long string of consistent double-digit growth. We said repeatedly that we're not immune to conditions there and that we expected our growth in Europe to moderate in the second half from what we saw in the first, so no real surprise to us here. The diversification provided by our brand portfolio continues to pay off with results that continue to trend above those of many of our competitors. In fact, we're looking at about 10% revenue growth in constant dollars in the fourth quarter, and we're again confirming today our expectations that our revenues in Europe will grow at a double-digit rate in constant dollars this year.","With much of 2012 behind us, our attention and yours naturally turns to next year. The work we've done this year to build our brands, manage costs and inventories and expand internationally should pay off in the form of another strong year for VF. In fact, we've made the decision to increase our fourth quarter marketing investments over levels previously planned to ensure we continue to grow our market share and to build momentum for 2013.","Uncertainty around world economic conditions will persist, but we've demonstrated that the VF model, build around diversity in brands, products, channels and geographies, is ideally suited to succeed regardless of the environment. Our portfolio of brands is as strong as it's ever been. We have many opportunities to grow around the world. We're investing to strengthen our core capabilities across the board, including product innovation, technology, supply chain, direct to consumer and sustainability, among others, to support an even bigger and more profitable VF in the future.","And with that, I'm very pleased to turn the call over to Steve Rendle. Steve?","Steven E. Rendle","Thank you, Eric. Third global revenues for the North Face were up 5% or 8% on a constant dollar basis, including a 10% increase in the brand's DtoC business. As a reminder, we had tough comps this quarter given the 22% growth rate in last year's third quarter. In addition, comparisons also reflect some movement in our order book from the third quarter into the fourth quarter. And as we've noted in past calls, wholesale orders moved closer to need based on last year's warm winter. And coupled with challenging conditions in Europe, we're actually quite pleased with our results. As we noted last quarter, the fall order book is up low double digits on a global basis and is driven primarily by North America and Asia. We have great confidence that the business will accelerate in the fourth quarter to a mid-teen constant dollar revenue growth rate, positioning us to end the year strongly.","In the Americas, the North Face brand third quarter revenues rose at a high single-digit rate driven by a solid sell-through in both wholesale and DtoC with particular strength in sales of lightweight outerwear, Sportswear and equipment product categories. Product innovation is at the core of what we do at the North Face. We've seen strong consumer response to our key fall product initiatives including Flash Dry apparel, which has been launched in more than 3,700 wholesale doors, as well as our DtoC channel where early reads are quite positive.","Our Powder Guide ABS vest, the industry's first avalanche airbag apparel system, has won numerous awards and praise for product innovation from the likes of Outside Magazine and Popular Science. The North Face brand continues to build relevance in new product categories as well with our technical running, training and yoga lines gaining momentum, as we increase penetration in existing doors and expand into relevant new specialty doors.","Our new product pipeline is robust, and we continue to raise the bar on product innovation for the entire outdoor industry. As Eric mentioned, due to our outstanding performance, we are incrementally increasing our fourth quarter marketing spend to capitalize on our momentum. This spend, which will be focused on 2 of our strongest brands, The North Face and Vans, will include greater grass roots and media activation efforts in our strongest market, the United States.","In the fourth quarter for The North Face, we will launch our biggest technology-focused media campaign ever. The campaign, which will focus on Flash Dry, the ABS vest and key Summit Series products in 4 key U.S. markets, features TV radio and digital efforts geared at educating and inspiring consumers. We're also investing at retail both in our own stores and in those of key partners to drive traffic and improve conversion rates in this seasonally important period for the brand.","And now here's Karl Heinz Salzburger to highlight The North Face's international business.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Starting with The North Face European business, as you know, macro conditions have continued to soften. In the third quarter, we saw mid single-digit constant dollar revenue decline in Europe driven by weakness in the wholesale channel, as retailers remained cautious and committed to orders later than usual.","That said, The North Face brand continues to capture market share in Europe. We are confident that we are extremely well positioned to compete successfully even in today's difficult environment. Similar to our efforts in the Americas regions, we have high-profile events that continue to share our brand story and engage consumers.","A huge highlight in the quarter at the end of August was the successful 10th edition of The North Face Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc, an epic trail running expedition that was broadcast live with the launch of UTMB digital television. Our online presence in Europe also continued to expand with 33% growth in e-commerce sales in the third quarter. Launch of a new website in Germany, the Netherlands, Ireland and Austria brings our total e-commerce presence to 12 countries, and we are very well positioned to drive brand traffic for the fall and winter seasons.","And consistent with U.S., we're also increasing our fourth quarter marketing investment over previously planned levels to ensure continued momentum for The North Face and Vans brands. In Europe, we will increase our efforts for Vans in the U.K. and Benelux, The North Face in Germany and in China for both brands.","Turning to Asia. We continue to see excellent momentum for The North Face brand with constant dollar revenues up by more than 60%, driven primarily by outstanding growth in China where Outdoor category growth remains very strong. We also doubled our distributor business in the quarter, driven by growth in Taiwan, Australia and Singapore. Our efforts continue to be focused on building brand awareness and engaging consumers around the outdoors. For example, we have established an outdoor training school with a top Chinese athlete with the goal of training 5,000 outdoor enthusiasts in 5 years. In September, we launched a new digital outdoor ecosystem on jabba.com [ph] reaching 40,000 consumers daily in the just first 2 weeks. And in the fourth quarter, we're launching a \"turn winter upside down\" marketing campaign with a focus on Summit Series outerwear.","Now let's move onto Vans. Steve?","Steven E. Rendle","Global revenues for Vans during third quarter were up 21% or 26% excluding the impact of foreign currency. During the quarter, we continued to execute on our 4 key growth drivers: product innovation, consumer connectivity, DtoC growth and geographic expansion.","Starting with our performance in the Americas region, third quarter revenues were up at a mid-teens rate in constant dollars driven by balanced wholesale and DtoC growth. We continue to excel on the consumer connectivity front as well. The 18th Vans Warped Tour wrapped up here in the United States and was once again a tremendous success at connecting the brand with its core consumer through music, social media and philanthropic efforts relevant to their youth culture.","And our Vans House Parties concert series held at the House of Vans in Brooklyn, New York did an amazing job at continuing to put the brand on the map in the greater New York Metro region, the epicenter of our strategy to grow the brand in the Northeast. On the product front, our van Doren and swim classics lines are resonating well with men and women, respectively, and in fact, we're seeing renewed strength in classics across the board. And although still early, our Vans LXVI collection, which launched globally in late June is gaining traction across key wholesale partners and our own stores.","And similar to The North Face, we've made the decision to increase our fourth quarter global marketing investment over previously expected levels around the Vans brands to capitalize on the momentum we've created to ensure a strong 2013. In the fourth quarter, we will focus our marketing efforts at building awareness for the Vans LXVI collection and specific tactics to help drive sell-through in both our own and U.S. dealer doors. Our Vans campaign will center on TV, print and digital advertising to connect with our target consumer and to drive traffic and conversion at our own stores and key mall partners. We will focus our investments on targeted in-mall and radio advertising.","Now I'll pass over to Karl Heinz, who will take us through some international highlights.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","In the third quarter, Vans continued its outstanding momentum in Europe with constant dollar growth of more than 45% versus the same period of 2011. All markets and categories were up significantly in the quarter with exceptional strength in Northern and Central Europe. Our efforts to drive our Off the Wall culture deeper into Europe are clearly proving successful. We staged the Vans Downtown Showdown skate contest in Amsterdam with 9,000 people attending. On the heels of the successful Vans Warped Tour in U.S., the tour will return to U.K. for the first time in 13 years in November for a sold-out show at the iconic Alexandra Palace in North London. And we are building additional visibility through an aggressive outdoor campaign targeted at 30 cities in Europe and reaching 55 million consumers.","During the quarter, we opened stores in Copenhagen, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Stockholm and Amsterdam that showcase our new Vans retail concept. And so far, performance has been strong. The new LXVI product has launched in Europe as well in 188 doors and 14 countries. And as we mentioned last quarter, we simultaneously launched 7 new e-comm sites in Europe. Initial demand on these new sites has been strong across the board with the strongest demand in the U.K. region and in our classic category. So we are very bullish about the opportunities for this new channel to drive future growth for Vans.","Vans Asian business also posted strong results in the third quarter, growing more than 40% in constant dollars. Hereto, we are seeing strength in the classic category and investing more behind programs to the Vans apparel to meet local needs. Additionally, we remain focused on deepening our connections with consumers in the region by leveraging consumer insights and learnings. We're driving skate culture awareness in the region to sponsorships such as our Go Skateboarding Day and Dragon SK8 Series.","We also recently launched a new digital activation program called unlock your dreams in China with a strong collaborative and crowd sourcing component. Finally, Vans continued to show tremendous growth in a number of key distributor markets in Asia, most notably Australia, which further validates the regional growth opportunity we have beyond China.","We remain confident in our global strategy and are excited about the strength we're carrying through '13, and now let's take a look at Timberland.","Steven E. Rendle","Global constant dollar revenues for Timberland declined slightly in the third quarter. In the Americas where the industry continues to grapple with excess inventories related to last year's unusually warm weather, the Timberland business declined moderately. It's important to note that we are well positioned from an inventory standpoint with inventories running down on a year-over-year comp basis. The absence of Timberland apparel in the Americas, a business that was formally licensed, negatively impacted revenues in the quarter. In addition, we continue to take actions to right size our distribution. While this also negatively impacted revenue, it also helped to drive improve profitability. These actions are all part of the model we deploy against new acquisitions geared toward building stronger top and bottom line performance in the future.","This year on a global basis, Timberland should achieve a slight increase in revenues on a constant dollar basis. As we move through the year, we've continued to realize significant integration synergies driven by supply chain leverage, inventory discipline and organizational initiatives designed to bring Timberland's cost structure into better alignment with that of the overall Outdoor & Action Sports portfolio. And while we are still in the middle of our integration journey, we're quite pleased with the Timberland team's focus and commitment to driving this year's results, while we all continue to focus on initiatives to drive future success.","Our Hookset Handcrafted collection, consisting of only 4 material components, is the most simple, eco-friendly footwear ever designed by Timberland and has been very well received. During the quarter, we also launched the exceptionally rugged Helcor boot collection with an integrated campaign that included street team product demos, webisodes and a launch party.","On the DtoC side, we opened the first new full price retail store since the acquisition in Chicago during the month of August, certainly a strong market that appreciates great cold-weather footwear, and preliminary results are looking very good. So with 1 year under our belts, we're more excited than ever that there's a great future ahead for this powerful global brand.","Now I'll turn it over to Karl Heinz to take you through what's going on internationally with Timberland.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","In increasingly more challenging environment, constant dollar revenues for Timberland in Europe were flat against last year. The bright spot in Europe are our men's footwear collections including hereto, the Hookset Handcrafted collection and our City Cap Toe. Both are showing good performance, as is our new fall outerwear collection. We're also seeing good response to some of our in-store retail initiatives, which has resulted in improved comp store performance toward the end of the quarter.","Asia continues to experience strong growth with positive results across all product categories, very good retail comp performance and particular strength in the key Japanese market. We opened 10 retail doors during the quarter and are making great strides connecting with consumers in the region.","And with that, let's switch gears to the Wrangler brand. Scott?","Scott H. Baxter","Thanks, Karl Heinz. In our Americas region, our U.S. Jeanswear business was up 3% in the third quarter. In terms of Wrangler on a global basis, third quarter revenues declined 5% or 3% in constant currency. Wrangler revenues in the Americas region were down very slightly in constant dollars. Yet, we are seeing strength in our Western Specialty and Latin American businesses.","Our ongoing commitment to product innovation continued to be central to driving growth with the Wrangler brand especially in our Western business, which has performed very well throughout the year. Our Wrangler 20X competition Jean is selling very well in the specialty store channel, as is our performance Cowboy Cut, fire-resistant Western and RIGGS collections. We're also pleased by the continued strength in our e-commerce business.","In the mass channel, we are seeing success in our comfort Five Star Premium jean and in our expanded tops offering. We expect modest growth in our mass business in the fourth quarter, as we drive our comfort story and execute powerful in-store presentations. In Latin America, we're encouraged by solid growth in Mexico, Argentina and Brazil, where we see our business accelerating nicely and expect to continue to gain traction.","Turning to Wrangler's international business. Karl Heinz?","Karl Heinz Salzburger","As we have seen in the last several quarters, Wrangler's business in Europe continues to be challenged by demand difficult conditions there. Revenues for the third quarter were down high single digits on a constant dollar basis, but our efforts to improve profitability are paying off with strong improvements in gross margin. But we are seeing positive performance in some regions, for example, in Russia and Turkey. We also opened our first owned and operated store in Leipzig, Germany. This is our biggest Wrangler market so it provides great opportunity to stay connected with our consumers and tell the brand story in an even more authentic way.","On a relative basis, we feel our performance is consistent with our peers and the greater market. We remain confident in our ability to carefully manage the business and inventory levels in accordance with market conditions. Our Wrangler business in Asia is quite small. And in India, an emerging key market in the region, we continue to experience positive momentum.","Finally, let's take a look at Lee.","Scott H. Baxter","Thanks, Karl Heinz. Lee's business on a global basis achieved a slight increase in revenues on a constant dollar basis. Lee's Americas business saw a 3% constant dollar growth in the third quarter with solid growth in Latin America and Mexico and continued success on our new product innovations. In the U.S., the brand continues to navigate near-term difficulties created by ongoing challenging dynamics in the mid-tier channel.","On the product front, Slender Secret, which combines great fit, great finishes and fashion details for the female consumer, has been our best-selling new product this fall. For Riders by Lee, our fit innovations, including Slender Stretch, continue to garner great reception. And we are encouraged by the continued solid results from lee.com, which grew 19% in the quarter. Looking ahead, we're excited about the Lee brand and its continued expansion with the Lee Platinum label collection in the department store channel. Karl Heinz?","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Similar to Wrangler, Lee's European business has also been negatively impacted by challenging conditions with constant dollar revenues for the third quarter down at the high single-digit rate. However, hereto, we have our bright spots, mostly notably in Russia and Scandinavia, which are showing very strong revenue growth.","Lee's women initiatives in Europe led by the Stretch Deluxe concept are outperforming expectations with our woman's jeans business anticipated to be up 15% this year. We're also excited about the launch of a new website for Lee in Europe. With an energized new look and feel, the new site should also help to stimulate sales in the region.","In Asia, Lee's momentum continued with high single-digit growth. Throughout the region, we are focused on driving consumer connections to integrated 360-degree consumer center campaigns, which are contributing to the success of new product initiatives such as our Urban Riders collection.","Now I turn it over to Bob, who will take you through our financial highlights in greater detail.","Robert K. Shearer","Well, thanks, everyone, for a great overview, and I'll wrap up today's call with commentary around our third quarter financial performance and our updated guidance.","Starting at the top with revenues. Our top line growth continues right in line with our expectations. Total revenues were up 14% or 17% in constant dollars. Organic revenue growth in the quarter mirrored that of the second, up 6% in constant dollars. Given our expectations for strong fourth quarter revenue comparisons, we're confident in our ability to achieve our 8% organic constant dollar revenue growth guidance for the year. And just as a reminder, each of these revenue comparisons is negatively impacted by about 1% from the sale of John Varvatos.","Now a few words about our international and direct-to-consumer businesses, both of which are important drivers of top and bottom line growth. You recall that in conjunction with our China investor meeting last month, we increased our 5-year goal for international revenues as a percent of total revenues from 40% to 45%. Current challenges in Europe and slight economic slowdown in China notwithstanding, we feel very good about our brands' prospects for continued international growth over the coming years given their generally low market penetration and demonstrated desirability with consumers.","In the most recent quarter, total international growth in constant dollars was 28% with organic growth of 7%. Now there's no doubt that international organic growth is moderated from what we saw in prior quarters, primarily due to economic conditions in Europe. But again, we anticipated this slower growth and reflected it in our original guidance provided in February.","The good news is that unlike many of our competitors, we're continuing to grow our business in Europe. In particular, our Vans brand has been exceptionally strong, growing by more than 40% in constant dollars in the quarter. That's the power of VF's diversified portfolio. And looking forward, we do expect significantly stronger top line growth in the fourth quarter in Europe driven by another quarter of exceptional growth at Vans and new store openings across a number of brands. And as Eric noted, we're still looking forward to delivering double-digit constant dollar organic revenue growth in Europe for the full year.","Now in terms of Asia, the third quarter marked another period of exceptional growth in the region with organic constant dollar revenue growth of 25% in total and 23% in China. Last month, we set new 5-year growth targets for the Asia-Pacific region, 19% growth annually for Asia in total and 21% annual growth in China. For more specifics about our growth plans in Asia, I'd encourage you to view the presentations and videos available at vfinchina.com.  And for the full year, we remain very comfortable with our guidance for organic revenue growth in Asia Pacific of about 20%.","Now I should also point out that we're seeing good growth in our other international markets outside of Europe and Asia, particularly in Canada and Mexico.  On a combined basis, organic growth in these other international markets was 7% in constant dollars. Growth in our direct-to-consumer business was another bright spot in the quarter with organic revenues rising by 9%. We experienced strong DTC growth at both The North Face and Vans of 10% and 18%, respectively, and we were also very pleased with the DTC performance of our Nautica, 7 For All Mankind and Kipling brands during the quarter.","Year-to-date, we've opened 100 stores across our brands and remain on track to open a record 130 stores this year. Not only do these stores provide us with the source of very profitable growth, they also are helping to offset somewhat weaker conditions at wholesale, particularly in Europe. As you know, the fourth quarter is seasonally the most important quarter for our DTC business, and we're looking forward to double-digit DTC revenue growth for the quarter, given combination of new store growth, solid increases in comp store sales, the impact of higher marketing investments to drive store traffic and continued rapid growth in our e-comm business. For our DTC business in total, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our full year revenue guidance for organic growth of about 15%.","Now a quick comment on the 3 businesses we haven't yet touched on: Imagewear, Sportswear and Contemporary Brands. In starting with Imagewear, I\u2019d anticipated, the revenue growth comparisons have continued to moderate from prior periods. You'll recall the string of strong double-digit comps in Imagewear revenues during 2011 and into the first quarter of 2012, as they gained distribution and market share especially on the image or uniform side of the business during a slowly recovering economy. Now comping those exceptional growth periods of last year has proven challenging.","On the other hand, Licensed Sports revenues rose at a healthy mid single-digit rate in the quarter, and the good news is that we remain confident in achieving our guidance for mid single-digit revenues growth for the full year. In terms of operating margin, the impact of higher product cost is now largely behind us. Fourth quarter operating margin for this coalition should reflect significant gains over the prior year period. Full year operating margin is expected to be about flat with the 14% achieved in 2011.","Now on the surface, the Sportswear numbers indicate very modest growth in the quarter, but as we indicated in the second quarter, Sportswear is seeing a shift in the timing of special programs, which should lead to mid-teen revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Also contributing to the revenue comparisons in the last couple of quarters is a decrease in Nautica distressed sales. That hurts the top line but obviously, is good for the brand and for profitability. Nautica continues to grow its men's business with its biggest department store customer where it is gaining share and achieving higher AURs.","Sportswear is on track to deliver high single-digit revenue growth for the full year and a significant improvement in operating margin. In terms of our Contemporary Brands business, keep in mind the reported results now reflect the sale of the John Varvatos business. If we take the Varvatos numbers out of both 2011 and 2012, revenues were up 2% in constant dollars in the quarter driven by high teen growth in our Splendid and Ella Moss businesses.","And at 7 For All Mankind, revenue comps were affected by lower distressed product sales. Again, while this hurt sales comparison, it's a big contributor to the improved profitability of the coalition. Hereto, we expect stronger top line growth in a big improvement in profitability in the fourth quarter, with 7 For All Mankind anticipating the continuation of improved sell-throughs at retail.","For the year, due to the Varvatos sale, total coalition revenue should decline by a mid single-digit rate. Excluding the Varvatos business from both 2011 and 2012, the coalition is on track to achieve high single-digit revenue growth.","Now let's move on to gross margin. Our gross margin story is developing just as we had planned, if not, even a little better than anticipated at the beginning of the year. In the third quarter, gross margin expanded by 140 basis points to 46.7%, which was an all-time high for us for the quarter. We pointed out the main drivers of the increase in our release, improved gross margins across nearly all of our businesses, a continuation of our business mix moving toward higher-margin businesses and lower product costs, particularly in our cotton-based businesses. We continue to expect the strongest gross margin comparison of the year in the fourth quarter. In fact, we expect our fourth quarter gross margin to be an all-time high for any quarter in VF's history.","Product costs for our cotton-based businesses peaked in the fourth quarter of last year, also benefiting the comparisons is continued growth in our high-margin DTC business. Strong growth in our DTC business drives favorability at the gross and operating margin line. For the year, we now expect gross margin to expand by about 80 basis points.","Our SG&A ratio as a percent of revenues were flat to 29.6% in the third quarter, but there's more to that story. As we pointed out in the past, Timberland's SG&A rate is higher than the rest of VF. So maintaining the overall SG&A ratio despite the inclusion of Timberland for our full quarter and 2012 points to our very disciplined cost controls across all our businesses.","Our operating margin reached a record level on both an adjusted and reported basis in the quarter. The adjusted operating margin of 17.5% was 90 basis points above last year's third quarter. And while Timberland achieved the mid-teen operating margin in the quarter, exclusive of acquisition-related expenses, it negatively impacted VF's overall adjusted margin by 40 basis points.","And that brings us to the bottom line and record earnings per share on both reported and adjusted basis. Included in this quarter's adjusted earnings per share of $3.52 was $0.54 per share of earnings from Timberland. That compares to $0.25 EPS contribution in last year's third quarter, which included just 3 weeks of Timberland earnings in a short but very profitable period for the brand.  Also impacting the current quarter's earnings is a combined $0.23 per share from foreign currency and higher pension expense.","Now turning to our balance sheet. We are particularly proud of our tightly controlled inventories, which were actually down slightly year-over-year. Given our strong earnings growth and working capital management, we're looking forward to generating a record $1.2 billion in cash flow from operations this year.","Now let's close with a recap of our revised earnings guidance. We've raised our annual EPS guidance by $0.10 per share from $9.50 to $9.60. That means our 2012 adjusted earnings per share are expected to increase by 17% over 2011. The euro rate assumption for the fourth quarter is 1.25 to the dollar. Our guidance also contemplates increased marketing investments over previously expected levels for the fourth quarter in both The North Face and Vans brands globally. These investments have historically proven to be drivers of both top and bottom line growth.","Given some continued weakening in overall economic conditions, we're convinced that these are the right investments to make today to ensure that our brands remain front and center with consumers. Another factor relevant to our earnings guidance, we remain comfortable with the $1.10 in accretion from Timberland right in line with what we said back in February. In terms of revenues, our full year revenue guidance remains at $10.9 billion, which will mark another milestone for VF. And as we've noted, that's despite about a 1% negative impact on revenues from the John Varvatos sale.","And finally, a few comments on the fourth quarter. We're looking forward to wrapping up 2012 on a really strong note. Based on our full year guidance, fourth quarter revenues should increase by 5% or 7% in constant dollars. And if you take the Varvatos sale under consideration, that number would be 8%. This, of course, will be the first quarter where we fully anniversary-ed the Timberland acquisition. I've commented on the fact that we're expecting very strong gross margin comparisons leading to operating margin expansion and in turn, another quarter of record earnings per share.","Taking into consideration the revised adjusted earnings per share guidance of $9.60, the fourth quarter points to earnings per share of $3.03, an increase of just over 30% over the $2.32 in adjusted earnings per share reported in last year's fourth quarter. The VF story is stronger than ever: revenues strong and growing, outstanding profitability, keeping our balance sheet strong and flexible. Our dividend increase of over 20% says a lot about our confidence. We look forward to a strong finish to the year and talking to you about our plans for another great year in 2013 during our next call in February. Eric?","Eric C. Wiseman","Thanks, Bob. Let's open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Joseph Parkhill at Morgan Stanley.","Joseph Parkhill - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk about the reacceleration on European revenue in 4Q. Is that mostly due to a shift in wholesale orders? And have you seen that uptick already? And then also is that mostly driven by The North Face?","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Thanks for the question. Karl Heinz here. Just a few reminders, we had strong quarters in the past in Europe, and this is a reacceleration. It is correct. As you know, The North Face is our largest brand in Europe. So it is driven by The North Face. We also had some lower sales on jeans as we reported in the script. So I guess the combination of these 2, jeans and The North Face, has contributed to the 3%.","Joseph Parkhill - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then the question was more around the reacceleration into 4Q.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Yes, we do expect fourth quarter to grow again -- we said it in the script -- by low double digits, and we also do expect The North Face to grow in the fourth quarter. Vans, as you know, as you have heard in the script, is doing extremely well consistently over the year, and we expect strong numbers on the Vans fourth quarter as well. We also have a lot of new retail stores, which we didn't have last year on Vans but also on The North Face and our e-comm presence, which will give us stronger business in Q4.","Joseph Parkhill - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then also just how are you looking in general about the open to buy in 4Q, particularly around The North Face and Timberland? Is there an ability to chase some sales if the winter proves to be colder and snowier than last year?","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Well, we always said that the winter has actually more impact than weather, especially on The North Face and Timberland versus the economy. So the initial -- we don't know. We can't predict the winter, but we saw a colder winter -- a colder weather in October, and we saw that immediately on our comp sales on our stores. So if the winter is just normal, that will normalize. Remember, we had a very warm winter last year, and also, we have assumed very low reorder numbers in our forecast for the year. So if the winter's strong, then our numbers will be better.","Operator","We'll go next to Kate McShane at Citi.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","In the past, when we've seen you increase your marketing spend, you've seen a clear opportunity in the market to take share. Is this how you're viewing your spend on The North Face and Vans? Or is it more an effort to support the brands globally? And can you quantify how much of this impact will have on SG&A in Q4?","Eric C. Wiseman","Kate, it's Eric. I'll deal with the first part of that. Yes, when we pulled the trigger on focused brand investments, as we've just done, we've done it because we've seen very clear opportunities to capture some growth in share and to build momentum for next year, too, because, as you know, if we can drive better sell-through in the fourth quarter, it'll set us up for heavier ordering in 2013 in the fall season. So we look at -- and maybe -- and it gets back to the whole diversified portfolio story at VF. We look at where we have brands in a specific country that has a unique growth opportunity that we think we can accelerate with focused investment. We do that, and we hope that, that'll drive sell-through this year and set us up for bigger reorders last year. In terms of what it means to our SG&A in the fourth quarter, I don't -- did Bob don't know that. Bob looks like -- he's shaking his head like he may have an answer to that one, Kate.","Robert K. Shearer","I have one answer for that, Kate. In the fourth quarter despite the increased investment, we still expect our SG&A ratio to decline in the fourth quarter now. Part of that, of course, is as we -- as the expense ratios in Timberland improve, we'll see a significant opportunity there. So actually overall in the quarter, we will see improved ratios in SG&A versus last year.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then if I could just ask a second question, unrelated about China. Is there any way you can walk us through how much of the growth was from new distribution? I believe one of the brands you said you were able to double distribution and how much was from comp growth?","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Yes, sure. Karl Heinz here. I'll handle this question. With double distribution, that actually was not related to China but to our distributor markets, right, because our Asia presence, when we talk about Asia, we do talk about China but also our distributors, I think, we said Australia, Taiwan, Malaysia. So we doubled that business. On the China, as we said a few weeks ago during our conference, we still have -- we operate with 5 brands there, 5 let margin brands, and our total penetration is 2,200 doors, all 5. So we still have opportunities in spite of a little bit more tougher conditions in China to expand our distribution. Having said that, we don't give comps number by brands, but so far, what we have seen, our comp numbers are in line with what we expect.","Operator","We'll go next to Jim Duffy at Stifel, Nicolaus.","Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. On The North Face, you mentioned some movement in the order book from 3Q to 4Q. Is that something you could quantify for us?","Steven E. Rendle","Jim, this is Steve Rendle. Difficult to quantify it, but we've talked before about how we -- with the warm winter last year, how our dealers really started to move orders closer to demand. Also, I'd remind you that we were up 15% in the first half of the year, and some of that had to do with placing fall goods early, come through Q3 nicely and set up very, very well for Q4.","Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, Karl Heinz, for The North Face in Europe, you mentioned retailers committing later there as well. Are retailers still in the mode of de-stocking? And then I was hoping you could offer some variances that you're seeing across the different countries in Europe with respect to The North Face brand.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Yes, I think the retailers in Europe, they are handling and are managing at the moment an inventory program, which is an overhang from last winter, right? Yes, we have seen a little bit more aggressive terms in the market. There's still inventories around. Again, a normal winter. We don't see an exceptional winter but just a normal winter compared to the bad situation we had last year. We, certainly over a few quarters or maybe 1 or 2 quarters, will normalize the situation.","Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then last question on the Jeanswear business, the Jeanswear business had some difficult compares against 2Q and 3Q in '11. Those compares seemed to ease beginning in the 4Q. Is there reason or should that be reason to think that the year-to-year growth can improve in the Jeanswear business? Or is that not how you're seeing it?","Scott H. Baxter","Yes. Jim, why don't I take the North American piece okay? This is Scott, and then I'll hand it over to Karl Heinz. Yes. We feel confident on the plan for the year. And I've stated before that we felt as though we have and hit our plan for a low to mid-single-digit growth and still feel that way going into the fourth quarter. Feel real good about the Wrangler health in the rest of the year.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","On the international side, let's divide between Europe and Asia. Asia is good as you have heard. We have been consistently growing. Europe is more challenging, and if you look at all the competitor situation, there are very few brands -- actually, as far as we know, no brands, which had consistent growth in Europe. Our strategy is clearly focused on improving profitability. You heard us saying our margins are increasing from quarter-to-quarter, and we are now on par on our jeans margin with some of our outdoor brands.","Operator","We'll go next to Mitch Kummetz at Robert Baird.","Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, a couple of questions. First for Steve Rendle, Steve, could you give us spring backlog on North Face, Vans and Timberland?","Steven E. Rendle","Mitch, would that be spring 2013?","Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Correct.","Steven E. Rendle","It's a little too early to call similar to what we've seen in the fall order book. We have dealers moving specifically with The North Face, demand closer to need, and we're still in the kind of the final wrap-up of our spring. And in the case of Timberland and Vans, I know you're familiar with the footwear model. Demand there absolutely moves closer or orders move very close to demand, and we're just really 2 months into collecting those orders. So it's early to call. I will tell you early reads, we're feeling very good that we'll deliver at historic levels.","Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then, Bob, on cotton, can you quantify the impact on Q3 in terms of the basis point impact and then kind of what your thoughts are in terms of quantifying that impact on Q4? You mentioned that, that's your easiest comparison year-over-year on cotton and maybe even some preliminary comments on how that might benefit you through the -- at least the first half of next year?","Robert K. Shearer","Yes, Mitch. So it might be useful just to go through some of the breakdowns of the gross margin comparisons. So in the third quarter, the improvement of 140 basis points mix, just the improved mix moving -- our business moving to higher margin businesses was 60 basis points of that 140. Now Timberland in the third quarter still hurt us a little bit, so that cost us about 20 basis points in the comparison year-over-year. Once again, we had that -- keep in mind, we had that for a full quarter. And the rest, which is about 100 basis points is what's left, was pretty well split between cotton-based cost reductions and just overall improvements in the rest of our business. I made a point of couple of times in my comments that we're seeing gross margin expansion across the board in nearly every one of our businesses. And that, of course, is driving improvement as well. So in that remaining 100 basis points, about half of that was related to the cotton businesses, and the other half were other efficiencies like lower distressed sales, that type thing, will improve mix. In the fourth quarter, the implication with the 80 basis points of improvement is about 260 basis points of gross margin improvement, so a really strong quarter. Now to your point, up against the toughest comparisons last year when cotton costs were highest in the fourth quarter, that's when they really peaked and that's when it impacted our margins the most. But in the fourth quarter, once again, we expect to see a mix impact of about 80 basis points, so a really strong mix improvement. Timberland will help us in the fourth quarter as well, will add about 20 basis points, and the remainder, once again, are from all of our other businesses including product costs and other efficiencies that we're seeing across the board. And yes, I'd say well, I don't have a specific number, Mitch, about the same amount. About half of that is driven by our cotton-based businesses in terms of reductions, and the other half, just by other efficiencies. As we go into the early part of 2013, as you know, we'll talk a lot more about that in February, and we won't say a lot about that right now. We just -- we don't expect a lot fluctuation at this point in terms of our cotton-based businesses and their costs. Keep in mind that while cotton is down, not all of that has yet been passed through in denim cost. So we haven't yet seen all of that improvement. So again, we don't expect a big change going into the first part of next year, at this point in time anyway, relative to where we are especially on denim cost.","Operator","We'll go next Eric Tracy at Janney Capital Markets.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I guess if I could follow up on the increase in the marketing spend, is it possible to get sort of order of magnitude by geographic region? And then maybe, Eric, just backing up a little bit, what it speaks to in terms of what you're seeing from last quarter in terms of deterioration in Europe? You mentioned slow down here domestically. So what are the signs that are -- you're sort of seeing and again, the order of magnitude of where you're stepping up on those investments?","Eric C. Wiseman","Yes, I'm going to deal with the first part of this and then hand it over to Bob, who has a very large spreadsheet in front of him that's going to help him give you some specific numbers. Comment on your question about the deterioration in Europe, just to remind you and everyone, our business is around 80% wholesale and about 20% retail. So what we saw in the slowdown in our revenue growth rate in the third quarter was largely the result in The North Face of a slowdown in retailers buying fall outerwear because they were carrying over some fall outerwear from last winter, had nothing to do with consumer demand for the brand whatsoever. It's all about how we push product ultimately to consumers. We know with the product placement we have, both what we've shipped this year and what we -- what's at retail from last year, that we're in a strong position right now to grab some market share. And that's what leads us to pull the trigger on the additional investments. Bob, can you comment?","Robert K. Shearer","Well, just what I can tell you is that in our core businesses, in other words, excluding Timberland, the increase in our marketing investment will be $18 million over the prior year's fourth quarter. So that's about a 13% increase overall. Now relative to the breakout, Eric, between U.S. and the international side, I guess I'd ask Steve or Karl Heinz to speak to that.","Steven E. Rendle","Sure.","Robert K. Shearer","Fairly even? Is that the case? I would say it's pretty even between the U.S. businesses and internationally.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Yes. And remember that we had a split between Europe and China as well as we mentioned. China, we do Vans and The North Face; and in Europe we do the North Face and Vans in 2 -- 3 countries, Germany, U.K. and Benelux.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay, and then to switch gears a little bit to Timberland, maybe just walk us through as we head in to 4Q and certainly, next year and lapping the integrating of the business, just the cadence of the top line and maybe even more -- because I know you're vetting distribution. You're sort of rolling out the apparel side, how we should think about top line growth, what profitability should look like? And then on the apparel side, I know it's more fully developed internationally. How do you think about syncing up what you got existing versus, again, sort of creating that new apparel offering?","Steven E. Rendle","Great. Eric, this is Steve Rendle. I'll take it, and perhaps, Karl Heinz can add some additional color. So on Timberland and the cadence of our Q4 top line, as I mentioned, we have been putting quite a bit of effort into really rightsizing our business model there, focusing on our go-to-market strategy, product segmentation and also looking at -- within our own retail store mix opportunities to remove underperforming stores. That, in addition to the absence of Timberland apparel, which was a licensee arrangement previously, has -- had a negative impact on our top line, but I would emphasize that it's had a significant improvement on our profitability. And as we right size our business model, we're really setting ourselves up for the future. And I would tell you, as we look back historically with The North Face and Vans integration, there's a lot of experience in understanding of the value of those actions, and our team at Timberland are focused on getting those done quickly and very effectively. On the apparel, our international business is where the bulk of our apparel is sold, and we'll be relaunching apparel here in the United States. And we see opportunity to begin to grab momentum next year with some key partners. But the good -- the products are designed and developed in Europe, and we see taking that European collection and with the help of our -- the brand work we've been doing over the last 12 months being able to inform what a global product line would look like with all of the relevant regional nuances required to drive good sell-through.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","If I can just finally add, apparel is very important for us in Europe and even more so in Asia. It wasn't before a regional effort, and we, certainly, will benefit from now going forward because it's becoming a company global effort. So there are much more strength behind the development of this program. So in short, it will be good for us going forward.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay, and then lastly, Eric and Bob, maybe just speak to capital allocation. Certainly, aware of the company's track record, increased dividend here but just a ton of free cash. Maybe just speak to sort of the M&A environment, any -- now sort of fully integrated Timberland, how we should be thinking about augmenting the organic growth?","Robert K. Shearer","Eric, we -- our priorities relative to how we allocate capital remain the same. You're right especially by year end, we'll be out of commercial paper with a very strong fourth quarter cash generation number. So once again, we'll be in a great spot with a balance sheet that has a lot of flexibility in it to do further acquisitions. So the M&A side remains our #1 priority for sure. Relative to the buyback, we bought back a couple million shares in the early part of this year, and once again, our approach there is to offset the impact of option exercises, and that hasn't -- that really hasn't changed. So our priorities remain the same and again, our balance sheet remains quite strong and gives us a lot of flexibility to do so.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to Robbie Ohmes at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I -- my one question and then I\u2019ll just ask the follow-up before you guys answer, but can you guys talk about your global AUR trends? You mentioned the strength of your product margins across all your brands, and I know some of that obviously is cost reductions. But can you walk through the aspect of that, that might be related to price increases and where you are in AURs in your key businesses, obviously, North Face and Jeanswear and then maybe even in Vans, what that looks like? And my follow-up question, which is going to be, Eric, can you talk a little bit more about may be the -- just follow up on the capital allocation question. Divestitures versus acquisitions, where your head is at maybe reminding us John Varvatos small, but you've gotten rid of it. Could there be other opportunities to sort of pare down the portfolio?","Eric C. Wiseman","Yes, sure Robbie, I'll start with the second piece. As you know, we're constantly looking at the shape of our portfolio because we believe that the diversity of our portfolio is our strength. So we have to spend a lot of time looking at what's in and what's not in our portfolio, and we do that on an ongoing basis. So far this year, that's resulted in the divestiture of the John Varvatos business, has not resulted in any acquisitions this year. We're pretty focused on the integration of Timberland this year for all the appropriate reasons. However, as we were just talking about -- with Eric the -- we were having a great capital year. As Bob said, acquisitions are our priority, and we're beginning to look into 2013 about what we might do. I can't offer any specifics about any particular action that we might take, but you should know that it's something that we're always working on and always have a few irons in the fire on both sides actually. On the AUR thing, I'm going to make an overall comment and then pass it on to somebody else in the room. I would say Steve Rendle is raising his hand. In general, there's a timing difference between our businesses. In 2011, we took the big price increases in our denim-based businesses, and that's when cotton was a big issue. We had big price increases that -- cost increases that we passed some of them along to consumers, but our prices in the denim business have or in our jeans business have been more stable this year than the big changes we took last year. In our synthetic businesses, like The North Face, we're seeing those price increases passed along this year. So there is a difference in timing. And with that overview, Steve, did you want to comment?","Steven E. Rendle","Sure. Robby, on the North Face and Vans in particular, as we look at year-over-year, we have a significant percent of our total offering that's new, and then we're able to bring new innovation, new styles, new colors. We're able to really look for those value price points and have AURs that help us look for incremental margin improvement. I would tell you also as we brought Timberland into the platform, we've seen good supply chain leverage that's benefited not only Timberland but also our Vans and North Face footwear businesses. And as we grow our DtoC component, we're seeing a benefit in mix as well.","Operator","We'll go next to Omar Saad at ISI Group.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just kind of switching back to Timberland again, if you kind of go back to when you made the deal and walked everybody through kind of your long-term expectations, seemed like you guys were looking at, I believe, if memory serves, a 10% kind of annualized top line growth rate. Can you talk about where the business has been and what's different versus your expectations? And is this just kind of how you had planned it from the beginning, that you needed kind of a little bit of a retrenchment, rationalizing some of the distribution, setting up the apparel piece properly before the reacceleration occurs? Are there any discrepancies from what your original expectations were there? And if so, what are the underlying causes? And then I have one follow-up.","Steven E. Rendle","Omar, this is Steve. I'll take a shot at this one. So as we're 1 year into this acquisition, what we have found and what we have able to work on is very consistent with what we knew going in. We knew we needed to do some work on the go-to-market model specifically around distribution and on product segmentation, putting the right products in the right channels and working with customers on just basically how to market or merchandise those styles. We also knew that we had a retail distribution that needed some particular effort and investments behind our e-commerce, as we were able to drive momentum there. We're seeing good improvement. So what we found is very similar to what we expected. As I'd mentioned, it feels very, very similar to what we found with The North Face in 2000 and Vans in 2004. I would say the difference being is the magnitude of the acquisition is a little bit different, but I would tell you our knowledge and the quality of our leadership team that's in place both here in the U.S. and internationally, the capabilities and their ability to leverage the VF knowledge has helped us get after this at a much quicker rate.","Eric C. Wiseman","Omar, I'll just add quickly that it's going just about the way we thought. I would say Europe's a little bit tougher than we thought originally. But that probably isn't too much of a surprise. But overall, as Steve said, we're -- it's modeling -- it's working out kind of the way we modeled it, which is let's build the foundation first and then move forward, and that's what we did with The North Face, and that's what we did with Vans. And I'll remind everyone that we expect this year for it contribute $1.10, and that's right where we are. So economics are working out right on plan for us.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then one quick follow-up, on the -- can you give us an update on what's happening in China in terms of the inventory situation for you guys and then the kind of competitive landscape? I know there's been a buildup in some of the department stores and malls in terms of the numbers of brands that are over there, the amount of stores that everybody has or the inventory situation and how that's impacting your business?","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Yes, Omar. You will recall -- Karl Heinz. You will recall in Asia, it's not the same on all our businesses. For instance, we don't see that in our outdoor business. Our performance is very strong, but we are affected, and we see it in our jeans business. There's certainly a hangover of inventory as far as us is concerned, we had touched on jeans. We do see that.","Operator","We'll go next to Christian Buss at Credit Suisse.","Christian Buss - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes. I was wondering if you could talk about your ability to support reorder activity given your tight inventory management heading into the fourth quarter?","Robert K. Shearer","I'll start on that and maybe the rest of the folks here want to pick up. Relative to our shipping performance despite the fact that our inventories are down a little bit, a lot of that actually came from Timberland where we expected to reduce our inventories. Our shipping performance has been as strong as ever. So despite the fact that our inventories are down and they'll stay down, our shipping performance has been really strong. So again, a lot of the reduction is in Timberland, which is exactly what we expected, and we don't see any challenges whatsoever in terms of our ability to support our business going forward.","Operator","And we'll go next to David Glick at Buckingham Research Group.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Just a follow-up on the Jeanswear business, you continue to cite the mid-tier as a challenge for Lee, and I think we all know the source of that challenge. And when you look at the presence of the brand across the mid-tier channel and in some cases, the department stores, the brand has a very strong presence. And when you look at the Lee jeans presentation in JCPenney, it's not in the young men's area. For example, it's off in the men's area. And I'm just wondering how long these challenges are going to continue? And at what point do you go more on the offensive with that key retailer? Or is there -- you mentioned the department store opportunity. I think it was premium, Scott, you mentioned. Is there an opportunity to maybe offset what's happening at Penney's with some other retailers?","Scott H. Baxter","Yes, no problem, David. I did mention in my opening comments that we are pretty excited about our -- it's called Platinum label, and we are -- and have had some success already in the department store channel, but we're expanding our offering. And we feel real confident about it and have a very large test going on right now. So we do understand that the Lee brand, it's very strong, very healthy right now, but we need to go ahead and work through additional channels and expansion with the Lee brand, and that's currently what we're doing with that. As far as the mid-tier channel, Lee had a very strong year. We are working through the situation that you discussed. We don't comment on specific customers, but we're working very closely with them to make sure the end result is positive for both parties. And that's probably the most that I can currently say about that. But for the year, we feel real good about the Lee brand, feel real good about the test that we're running and feel real good about the holiday season.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","How much do guys do shop at JCPenney? Or that's part you can't tell me about right now?","Eric C. Wiseman","Yes, we have actually -- our 2 biggest businesses with Penney's are Vans and Lee, and those are in discussions with Penney's about how to contribute to their new strategy in a very significant way. And more on that in the future, but there's -- nobody's committed to anything yet.","Operator","And we'll take our last question from Michael Binetti at UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Can I just -- Eric, can I go back to a comment that Karl Heinz made earlier when -- that when the weather got colder in October, you saw the comps accelerate at your own North Face store. I think he was talking about Europe. Does that translate to the U.S. business, what you guys have seen so far in October as well?","Eric C. Wiseman","Yes, the first -- I can tell you the first week in October was cold because I know when we saw a spike in the performance in our stores because everybody was texting about it that weekend. So yes, and that was very encouraging to us because if that says when needed, they liked our products because they came to the stores, our traffic was up, and our conversion was up, and they bought in abundance. So we're hoping that we get more weather like that in the next 90 days.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And I know last year, we talked about this. There's definitely some differences between categories like jackets versus boots, but does that comment translate over to Timberland doors as well by chance?","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Yes. Because I started this, we saw the same -- Michael, we saw the same reaction our comp stores on Timberland, predominately footwear Europe. Yes, so the answer is yes.","Steven E. Rendle","And the answer is definitely yes here in the United States as well.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then if I just look at the fourth quarter guidance, it seems like it calls for some pretty significant contribution from Timberland. I'm thinking on the cost savings side, it seems like a lot of the synergies you've been talking about there accelerated in the fourth quarter. So can you just walk us through some of the components of the Timberland contribution in fourth quarter and how that's a little bit different, a little bit magnified versus the rest of the year for our models, please?","Eric C. Wiseman","Yes, Michael, you're talking about relative the 30% EPS growth in quarter?","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Or maybe even just the $1.10 in synergy?","Eric C. Wiseman","Okay.","Robert K. Shearer","Michael, you're absolutely right on. And of course, it's a gross margin as well as an SG&A story. From a gross margin standpoint, we will see improved gross margin comparisons for the Timberland business in the fourth quarter. Last year at this point in time, we were battling the higher costs without really any pricing cover and prices. We have a little bit of pricing cover this year, and the improvements that Steve was talking about earlier in the supply chain, so just managing the business a lot more cleanly so that all of those factors impact the gross margins, and Timberland will contribute to improvement in our gross margin comparison in the fourth quarter. On the SG&A line, as I said earlier, again, a significant comparison improvement there as well. Last year at this point in time, we really were just beginning to address some of the cost-reduction opportunities that we were seeing in the SG&A area, and now those are being realized, not fully yet. And yes, we are. We're actually ahead of some of our original projections in terms of what we thought we could -- the cost reductions that we thought we could achieve on Timberland. So you\u2019ve got stronger gross margins and the SG&A cost really coming in line to produce a nice contribution for Timberland in the fourth quarter.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And if I could just leave it with one last thing, I just want to make sure I'm clear on -- just from a modeling standpoint. You guys feel that there was actually a push of revenues in Europe from the third quarter into the fourth quarter based on the changes in the deliveries, right?","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Yes, we said before, Michael, we expect a low double-digit growth in Q4 in Europe again.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And you do believe that came out in third quarter?","Robert K. Shearer","It's in constant dollars.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","It's in constant dollar, Yes. It's constant dollars.","Operator","And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'll turn it back over to management for any closing remarks.","Eric C. Wiseman","Yes, just quick comment, we're confident in our year and we're confident in a really strong fourth quarter. When we look at the fourth quarter including Timberland and excluding John Varvatos, so on an apples-to-apples basis, we think we're going to grow 8% on a constant currency basis. That's what our call was for the year all along, to grow 8%. We're tracking -- we're right on track there. Our earnings per share are going to be up over 30%. We're a little bit ahead of plan there, and we're investing more than we thought so that we can propel ourselves into next year. And with that, I'll thank you for your time and attention, and we'll talk to you again in February. Thanks.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference. Again, thank you for; your participation."],"21561":["VF Corp. (NYSE:VFC) Q4 2015 Earnings Call February 19, 2016  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Lance Allega - Vice President-Investor Relations","Eric C.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lance Allega, VP of IR. Please go ahead.","Lance Allega - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to discuss VF's Fourth Quarter 2015 Results.","I'd like to remind everyone that participants on the call will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in documents filed regularly with the SEC.","I'd also like to remind everyone that unless otherwise noted, amounts that our participants refer to on today's call will predominantly be in currency-neutral terms. By our definition, which is detailed in our press release issued at 6:55 AM Eastern this morning, currency-neutral amounts exclude both the impact of translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars and the impact of currency rate changes on foreign currency denominated transactions.","You may also hear us refer to reported amounts which are in accordance to U.S. GAAP and include translation and transactional impacts from foreign currency exchange rates.","We've chosen these currency-neutral amounts as a lead number in our discussions because we feel it more accurately represents the true operational performance and underlying results of our businesses and brands. Reconciliations of GAAP measures to currency-neutral amounts can be found in the supplemental financial information included with the press release, which identify and quantify all excluded items.","Joining us on today's call will be VF's Chairman and CEO, Eric Wiseman; President and COO, Steve Rendle; our CFO, Scott Roe; and VF Executives, Karl Heinz Salzburger and Scott Baxter.","Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call for questions and ask that you please limit yourself to two questions per caller. Thanks.","Eric?","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Lance. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to recap the year recently completed and our outlook for 2016.","2015 was a strong year for VF's businesses around the world. You will recall that our original outlook for the year called for currency-neutral revenue growth of 8% and earnings growth of 12%, and through the first nine months we tracked ahead of that goal with top line growth of 9% and earnings up 15%.","Then, during our call in October we spoke about a more cautious approach to the balance of the year, including a softer consumer environment, and appropriately we adjusted our outlook for the year.","Our fundamental assumptions proved to be accurate. However, the consumer softness accelerated and was compounded by the warmest fourth quarter on record. As the quarter developed, we took immediate action to leverage the many strengths of our business model and pulled many operational levers to minimize the impact, manage the inventories and maintain brand integrity during a difficult retail period.","Our fourth quarter results did not materialize as we originally planned. However, our responsiveness and operational agility allowed us to finish out the year in a way that's consistent with our 2017 goals.","Currency-neutral revenue was up 6% and EPS was up 12%. And when you normalize for the 53rd week over the past two years, both 2015 and 2014 averaged 7% revenue growth and 13% EPS growth. So while we were a point shy on the top line, we were right on for the bottom line against our 2017 plans for these two years.","As we close out 2015, I have a renewed sense of resolve and respect for how nimble and capable our company really is and I have complete confidence in our ability to drive future growth and shareholder returns.","As consumers' priorities continue to change, we're right there with them, strategically analyzing their shopping behavior, their preferences and the way they interact with our brands. Whether that's in our stores or online or through our wholesale partners, they're demanding more from the products they buy; more engagement and more authenticity from the brands they choose to develop relationships with and the ability to show up whenever and however they choose to shop. I'm confident that VF is uniquely positioned to win in this environment.","So, what's in store for 2016? We expect the retail and currency environments to remain challenging mostly in the first half as last year's overhang works through the system before conditions normalize in our most meaningful quarters of the year. Throughout 2016, we will seize the opportunity to stay on the offense and we will remain focused on the things that keep us healthy in 2016 and beyond, such as: we're making outsized investments in product innovation to drive newness and excitement into the marketplace, we're building even stronger relationships with our consumers, we're strengthening our operational capabilities and delivering appropriate financial performance while positioning VF for sustainable profitable growth over the long term.","Our team will go deeper into the details in a moment, but translating all of that into our 2016 financial outlook, we expect mid-single digit revenue growth and 11% EPS growth. Given our incomplete visibility into the year, especially around our cold weather-related products, we believe this is a sensible reflection on the current and going-forward environment.","As I think more about our future, I think about VF's strengths and how they've enabled us to develop a respected track record of success with brands that we've added to our portfolio. Strategically, we've described ourselves as active portfolio managers. While I can't be specific, I can tell you that in 2016 we're taking an especially focused and proactive look towards the composition of our portfolio to ensure that we are optimally positioned to maximize growth and returns to our shareholders.","We are actively exploring the segments of the business we want to expand our portfolio in and we're exploring where we might want less exposure. We will certainly talk more about this in the future and keep you posted as those plans unfold.","As you know, we have a long history of returning cash to our shareholders. In 2016, we'll continue this commitment because a softer environment shouldn't mean shareholders have to sit on the sidelines. We've got a healthy increase in our share buyback to about $1 billion, and with our dividend payout we expect to return $1.5 billion in total this year.","Now, allow me to pre-answer one of your almost certain questions. With respect to potential portfolio composition, share buyback is an and conversation, not an or conversation, meaning there's no impact to our ability to pursue acquisitions that are right for VF.","In closing, our business model remains solid and intact. Nothing is fundamentally different with our story. We're committed to our strategy and it's working. VF is well-equipped to navigate through these near-term challenges, and our strength and discipline lead us to maintain our commitment to returning shareholder value. I am extremely proud of the work our team is doing and I'm excited about what lies ahead.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve, Karl Heinz and Scott Baxter to take us through our coalition of brand results, and then over to Scott Roe to review our financial performance. Steve?","Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Thanks, Eric. Outdoor & Action Sports' currency-neutral revenue was up 1% in the fourth quarter, with a mid-single digit increase in D2C offset by a decline in wholesale. As you know, we were up against a 53rd week at the end of 2014, so normalizing for that over both periods the coalition was up 5% in the quarter. Clearly contributing to these results was the warmest fourth quarter on record, yet I'm proud to say that we came through relatively strong given the challenges.","Taking a look at VF's three largest brands, fourth quarter revenue for The North Face was down 2%, with low-single digit growth in D2C offset by a mid-single digit decline in wholesale. Excluding FX and the 53rd week, revenue in the quarter was up 1% over last year.","Revenue in the Americas region was down at a low-single digit rate, a result directly related to warm weather. And while heavier outerwear styles did not perform to expectations, we did see success with shells and midweight styles, validating our strategy to provide more adaptable, multi-season product.","ThermoBall is a great example of this and a franchise that continued its strong growth. ThermoBall is the best-selling outerwear franchise in the U.S. market across all brands over the past two years. This was bolstered by a new product-specific ad campaign launched in November.","We also relaunched our pinnacle Summit Series Collection globally, offering best mountaineering product and pushing the limits of product innovation and technology.","Beyond outerwear, we saw great performance in our running and training apparel driven by Mountain Athletics growing more than 40%. Our continued efforts to connect even more deeply with consumers through inspired exploration, including physical, emotional and creative pursuits, has never been more strategic.","Our Never Stop Exploring brand campaign, which we launched in Q4, was our first expansive view of exploration and our first truly global brand effort. And with over 1 billion impressions, we're really pleased with the results and confident it connected with and inspired adventurers everywhere.","As we look ahead, The North Face will continue to encourage consumers to explore, train and live, and we have a great pipeline of innovative product that will help them do just that.","Now to Karl Heinz.","Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President, VF Corporation & Group President, International","Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. The North Face European business was down at a mid-single digit rate, with low-teen D2C growth being offset by a decline in the wholesale business. We saw strength in our ThermoBall and Mountain Athletics collection during the quarter as well as our Ultra footwear line.","We also launched a new store concept on Regent Street in London, which allows athletes to train together in weekly sessions. We have seen great response so far.","For the full year, The North Face in Europe grew faster than the overall outdoor apparel market. It was challenged by unseasonably warm weather in November and December, and even so our own DTC business grew 25%.","Across the year, we put a lot of focus on elevating our brand position in the market by carefully managing inventories. We also made meaningful steps in terms of segmenting the European marketplace from a merchandising perspective. We feel well-positioned for accelerated growth in 2016.","In Asia, fourth quarter revenue increased at a low-single digit rate driven by slight growth in D2C and a relatively flat wholesale business. During the quarter, we launched the FuseForm product for the first time, with great response. We also hosted the TNF Outdoor Festival in Shanghai Century Park, which had more than 4,000 visitors during the course of the weekend.","Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","To wrap up The North Face, revenues for the year were up 5% globally in 2015 to $2.3 billion, or up 6% excluding FX and the 53rd week. And while we're off our long-term growth target this year, our fourth quarter performance does give me confidence that this brand is built to perform in many environments, is strong and opportunistically has many competitive advantages in play.","Given the current environment, as we look at 2016 we see the year ahead as an opportunity to evolve and amplify The North Face brand both on a strategic and tactical level. We've realigned our global category management model to better focus on individual consumer usage occasions. This enabled us to deliver even stronger product and brand experiences to connect and inspire new and existing consumers in ways never done before.","For the full year, we expect The North Face to grow revenue at a mid-single digit rate, so similar to 2015. This early outlook based on fourth quarter results and our fall selling process is an accurate reflection of what we see ahead.","Turning to Vans. Global revenue was up 8% in the fourth quarter with a low-double digit increase in D2C and a low-single digit increase in the wholesale business. Excluding FX and the 53rd week, the fourth quarter was up 13%. In the Americas, the fourth quarter was up in a mid-single digit rate, again, impacted by the 53rd week, with double-digit D2C growth and a slight decline in wholesale.","On the product front, we continue to see success with our strategic move toward providing a complete four season offering. As evidence, our all-weather Mountain Edition Footwear styles were all top sellers and we've already seen significant sell-in for 2016 for these styles as well.","We're also seeing success with our Mountain Edition weatherized apparel, further extending our brand beyond footwear. And our collaborations, including one with Vans and The North Face, are reinforcing our commitment to blending street style and performance in innovative products and really showing the consumer the strength of the VF portfolio.","True to our Off the Wall culture, we continue to redefine new ways to connect with our consumers. During the fourth quarter, our PROPELLER skateboarding film saw great success and was one of iTunes top 10 documentaries of the year, not to mention TransWorld SKATEboarding's film of the year.","Vans was also recently named the number one sneaker brand on Instagram, our young consumers' number one social platform. These are great wins for the brand and great testament to keeping our core consumer at the center of everything we do.","Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President, VF Corporation & Group President, International","In Europe, Vans revenue was up at a high-single digit rate, with growth in both D2C and wholesale. During the quarter, we had several strong collaborations worth highlighting. Our second collaboration with Disney was really well received by consumers across footwear, apparel and accessories. The Vans-TNF product sold out in a number of places across Europe, and the Vans Van Doren Collection helped elevate our weatherized offering with great success.","In our Core Classics Collection, we have seen higher-than-normal inventory levels. And even though we are performing better than our competition in this category, we do anticipate a more challenging sales environment in 2016 as this product works through the channel.","The good news is that our brand health metrics have never been as strong and our other product categories are selling through extremely well.","In Asia, Vans grew more than 20%, driven by almost 40% D2C growth and a high-teen increase in our wholesale business. Our House of Vans brand experience proved to be incredible for both the brand and our consumers. We took this experience on tour to 14 cities throughout the year and connected with thousands of fans.","We also launched our MONKEY RULES campaign for the Chinese New Year and the response shows that this is a winner.","Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","In 2015, Vans revenue was up 14% globally to reach $2.2 billion, or up 16% excluding FX and the 53rd week. Looking at 2016, we'll be focused on continuing to expand the brand's relevance, updating classic silhouettes, and introducing new styles and collections for the ever-changing global consumer.","Also, Vans will celebrate its 50th anniversary in 2016. We definitely have unique products and experiences planned to keep consumers engaged and connected as we celebrate our authentic heritage.","Regionally in 2016, we're expecting continued strength with double-digit growth in both the Americas and Asia businesses, which represent about 75% of the total. However, due to the factors KH spoke about, revenues could be down slightly in Europe.","Our 26 (sic) [2016] (15:31) growth expectation for Vans globally looks to be up in the high-single digit range.","Now on to Timberland, where global revenues were up 1% on a currency-neutral basis, with slight growth in D2C partially offset by relatively flat wholesale sales. Excluding FX and the 53rd week, fourth quarter revenue was up 5%. Similar to The North Face, Timberland was impacted by warm weather in the fourth quarter too.","In the Americas, revenue was down in a low-single digit rate, and of course we're comping against the 53rd week so normalized rates are higher. Strategically, we continue to see great response to our efforts to evolve the perception of our outdoor lifestyle positioning.","Looking at product, boots were a strong performer during the quarter, led by both Classics and women silhouettes. In fact, boots were strong across men's, women's and kids. And beyond just boots, we're continuing to gain traction in some of our more casual styles such as our men's Britton Hill Collection, which had tremendous sell-through in our D2C channel. And in fact, the advertised style completely sold out, so clearly great momentum there.","We've also made significant progress in the women's business, especially in North America, and created a new generation of brand loyalists who love the style, fit and craftsmanship of the Amston and the Glancy. Early days but super promising and much more coming.","On the marketing front, we continue to connect with the outdoor lifestyler consumer. During the quarter, our Made For The Modern Trail campaign came to life across print, digital and social media, driving awareness for our Black Forest Collection. All in, our consumer impressions were up 50% at $1.25 billion over last year.","The PRO Boondock and Powertrain collections saw nice growth in the quarter, and it's clear that we're meeting consumers' needs for footwear that helps them get the job done. The PRO platform continues to be a great living laboratory for learning, testing and introducing new comfort and durability innovations that are very easily translated back into our casual, lifestyle product.","Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President, VF Corporation & Group President, International","Timberland European fourth quarter revenue was up at mid-single digit rate, driven by strength in our D2C business, another solid performance during the year that we grew faster than the market.","In terms of product, SensorFlex and sneakers continue to perform very well in men's casual footwear, and we saw growth in men's outerwear as well. In women's, our classic boots also saw strong results.","On the marketing side, our Black Forest campaign was our most successful promotion in this region ever. This 360 degree effort enabled us to integrate classic and digital marketing efforts. It also allowed us to team up with our wholesale partners, giving us very visible and unique consumer touch points.","Turning to Asia, revenues were down slightly, impacted by softer traffic in Hong Kong and Singapore specifically. And despite unusually warm weather for the region, we were encouraged by the strength of our lightweight outerwear which grew double-digits.","On the footwear side, we saw positive results with boots leading the way, growing at high-teen rate. And similar to Europe, our Black Forest campaign was very successful, driving high levels of interest in the brand.","Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","In 2015, Timberland revenues were up 10% globally to $1.8 billion, or up 12% excluding FX and the 53rd week. That's great momentum in the Timberland business. And as we look out at 2016, our strategic priorities focus on continuing to elevate style and innovation in product, continued thoughtful expansion of distribution without \u2013 with existing and new customers, as well as our own D2C, and connecting product, experience and lifestyle stories with our global outdoor lifestyle consumer. Based on our fall booking, which is impacted by similar factors at The North Face, we expect Timberland to grow revenue at a high-single digit rate in 2016.","Now let's shift gears to Jeanswear. Scott?","Scott H. Baxter - Vice President, VF Corporation & Group President, Jeanswear, Imagewear and South America","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter, our global Jeanswear business was up 1% on a currency neutral basis driven by mid-single digit growth in the Lee business and a slight decline in Wrangler. Excluding FX and the 53rd week, Jeanswear was up 6% in the fourth quarter.","In the Americas region, Jeanswear revenue was flat in the quarter. A low single-digit increase in Lee revenue was offset by a low single-digit decline in Wrangler revenue. At Wrangler, our Mass business showed solid growth with a mid-single digit increase in revenues. This was more than offset by declines in the brand's Western Specialty business where the regions challenged by the contraction in oil and gas exploration are hardest hit.","From a product perspective, we're successfully expanding the Advanced Comfort line into casuals and warmer-weather product. Additionally, we're working to address the needs of everyday consumers as the outdoor and active categories converge with outdoor-inspired casual solutions and versatile fabrics and functional design aesthetics. We also had a very strong launch of our Cool Vantage product in our Western platform. We do expect the positive momentum that Wrangler realized in 2015 to continue into 2016 as we introduce new products with innovative fabrics that satisfy unmet consumer needs.","On to Lee. We once again saw growth in this business during the quarter, with the Americas growing in the low-single digits. We're seeing strong response for both male and female consumers to our new performance fabrications, and are excited to introduce even more advanced fabrication offerings in the coming year, including improved breathability and comfort innovations. We have also made great strides as we work to enhance our presence in department stores, clubs and e-commerce. And we are pleased to have grown nicely in 2015. In 2016, we will build on this momentum as we continue to expand our distribution footprint and introduce new product assortments.","Karl Heinz?","Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President, VF Corporation & Group President, International","In Europe, currency neutral revenue for the Jeanswear coalition was up at low-single digit rate. The Wrangler revenues were down slightly in the quarter, with strength in our e-commerce and D2C business offset by declines in our wholesale business. During the quarter, we successfully launched new styles in our Body Bespoke collection and the response has been very positive. We look forward to expanding this collection even more broadly this year.","Lee's European business marked its eleventh consecutive quarter of revenue growth, with the business up at the mid-single digit rate. New products including the skinny and bootcut jeans for women, and the Malone jeans for men, drove our growth in the quarter.","In Asia, despite uncertain economic conditions, our Lee business had another solid quarter, with revenue up at the low-double digit rate and very strong profit growth. We are truly becoming a leader in the premium denim segment in Asia driven by our innovations such as our Jade Fusion line and meaningful consumer activations throughout the region. And it's not just consumers who have responded well to this product. We learned that Lee's Jade Fusion has been nominated for an Edison Award, which honors the best innovations as voted by industry peers.","In summary, we continue to see consistent momentum in our global Jeanswear business and expect to achieve mid-single digit growth once again in 2016.","Now to Imagewear.","Scott H. Baxter - Vice President, VF Corporation & Group President, Jeanswear, Imagewear and South America","Fourth quarter Imagewear revenue was down 12% with slight growth in the Licensed Sports Group business, being offset by a more than 20% decline in the workwear business. Excluding FX and the 53rd week, our Imagewear coalition was down 7%. In LSG, our Major League Baseball Cool Base jersey saw sustained momentum in the fourth quarter and finished the year strong. Our street fleece baseball product, which launched during the postseason, also had strong results during the quarter. In 2016, we'll be introducing a new patented flex-based, on-field uniform, which we expect will continue to create healthy demand in this category.","On the workwear side, our Red Kap Shop Gear collection delivered strong results, posting the sixth year of more than 30% growth. And while our Bulwark line remained very challenged by slower oil and gas exploration, we did see some bright spots, particularly in the iQ knits and woven products. Given the continued softness on the workwear side of the business, we're expecting the Imagewear coalition to grow at a low single-digit rate in 2016.","Steve?","Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Our Sportswear business was down 9% in the quarter. If you take out FX and the 53rd week, Sportswear was down 6%. Revenue in Nautica was down low double digits due primarily to lower outlet traffic, tourism declines and record warm weather, which impacted fleece, sweaters, and outerwear purchases. In spite of this, we continue to make progress in our efforts to elevate the Nautica business and realize improved profitability in our wholesale business. In efforts to elevate the brand perception, we successfully tested a full-price pop-up shop in New York City's trendy Flatiron District and received positive consumer feedback during the holiday.","Kipling's U.S. business saw a low single-digit increase in revenues due to similar factors that impacted Nautica. Kipling's global business was up at a low double digit rate. In 2016, we're expecting a slight decline in revenue for this coalition based primarily on the strategic decision to license Nautica's sleepwear business, which will provide greater profitability in the long run, and on adjusted basis, excluding this move revenue would be up at a low single-digit rate. Revenue in the Contemporary Brands coalition declined 17% during the quarter, with weakness in both the wholesale and D2C business. Excluding FX in the 53rd week contemporary brands was down 10% in the quarter. While we are disappointed with our results in this challenging sector, we are focused on optimizing our product, consumer connections and distribution options. For 2016, we anticipate a mid-single digit decline in the Contemporary Brands coalition.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott for a deeper dive into our financial results.","Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thanks, Steve. On today's call, you've heard recurrent themes, including things we can't impact like record warm weather, strengthening of the U.S. dollar, the 53rd week of 2014, and a softer retail environment. You've also heard us refer to things we can impact like operational and fiscal discipline, executing strategic initiatives and ultimately, how our strengths and agility give us the unique ability to deliver consistent shareholder returns in an uneven environment.","With both sides of this coin in play, let's review our fourth quarter results and I'll do my best to filter through the noise to illustrate an apples-to-apples story that tells the true performance of VF's model. Starting at the top, revenue was down 1% on a currency-neutral basis or if you normalize for the 53rd week, it was up 3%. This included relative strength in our Outdoor & Action Sports, Jeanswear, international and direct-to-consumer businesses.","Gross margin came in at 49% on a currency-neutral basis, equal to last year. Reported gross margin was down 70 basis points to 48.3%, and to walk you through the puts and takes, benefits from changes in mix and favorable product costs were more than offset by foreign currency headwinds and aggressive efforts to manage inventory among our brands with greatest exposure to cold weather. As you would expect, we responded quickly with respect to inventory, an effort that enabled us to finish the quarter with levels up just under 9%.","For context, nearly half of that 9% increase is related specifically to cold weather related product. And, it's important to note that the composition of this inventory is good, it's core product that's already slated for our fall 2016 line. So while inventory levels will remain a bit higher than we'd like for the first half of 2016, we expect them to normalize in the second half of the year.","Earlier, Steve gave a quick overview of our contemporary brands coalition. Suffice it to say that it was a disappointing year for our business, one in which we fell short of our expectations. As a result, the fair values of 7 For All Mankind, Splendid and Ella Moss brands were determined to be below their respective carrying values. Therefore, we have recorded $144 million pre-tax, non-cash impairment charge in the fourth quarter to reduce the carrying value of intangible assets of these brands. After tax, this was a $97 million charge or $0.23 of diluted EPS.","Adjusted SG&A, that is, excluding the impairment charge, was down 40 basis points in the quarter, demonstrating our disciplined approach to offsetting continued investments in D2C, demand creation and innovation, with operating leverage and expense control. Excluding the impairment charge, adjusted operating income was down 6%, and adjusted operating margin was 15.8% compared with 16.2% in the fourth quarter of 2014. On a reported basis, operating income was 11.6% compared to 5.1% last year.","And finally, adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter was $0.95 compared to $0.98 in the same period of 2015. Adjusted currency neutral EPS was up 5%, and if you exclude FX and the 53rd week, fourth quarter adjusted EPS was up 12%. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share was $0.72, up significantly over last year's fourth quarter.","Turning now to the full year. 2015 revenue grew 6% on a currency neutral basis. Excluding the 53rd week, revenue increased 7%. Highlights included 9% growth in both our Outdoor & Action Sports and international businesses, and 7% growth in our direct-to-consumer business, which comped positively for the full year. Apples-to-apples, Outdoor & Action Sports and D2C were up 11% year-over-year.","We also benefited from improved performance in our Jeanswear coalition, which, although it carries lower gross margins than VF's average, it's still our most profitable coalition.","Gross margin was down 0.5 point to 48.3%. To walk you through the full year factors, our mix benefit was present but slightly less than that about 50 basis points we typically see due to improved Jeanswear performance and softer than expected D2C results. And while we did see the expected tailwind from lower product costs, our aggressive management of inventory offset this benefit. So that leaves us with FX, which negatively impacted our gross margin by 80 basis points.","SG&A for the year, as a percentage of total revenue, was down 10 basis points due to the same discipline we exhibited in the fourth quarter. That is, offsetting investments in our fastest-growing businesses and strategic priorities by maintaining strong cost controls across other areas in the organization. Excluding the impairment charge, adjusted currency neutral operating income was unchanged at $1.8 billion, and operating margin was 14.6% in 2015 compared with 14.9% in the prior year. Taking into account the 70-basis-point foreign currency hit, we achieved an operating margin of 15.3% in spite of top line pressure.","On a reported basis, full year operating income was $1.7 billion in 2015, and operating margin was 13.4% compared with 11.7% in 2014. So that brings us to a full year adjusted EPS, which was $3.08, in line with 2014's result. On a currency neutral basis, EPS was up 12%. Now, at the end of year three of our five-year plan, we've averaged 13% EPS growth annually, which is right in line with our long-term guidance. On a GAAP basis, full year EPS was up 20% to $2.85.","We ended the year with a strong balance sheet and a capital structure that continues to afford us great flexibility. In 2015, we generated $1.1 billion in cash from operations and returned nearly $1.3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Turning now to 2016. While we do expect some challenges to continue in the near-term, we remain as confident as ever in our ability to deliver long-term profitable growth and returns to our shareholders, and here's why. Our portfolio of brands with its diversity of consumer, geography and channel is supported by a deep arsenal of P&L levers including strategic investments, focused operational discipline and a world-class supply chain, all of which deliver superior cash flow. Working in concert, these strengths will allow us the flexibility necessary to emerge even stronger coming out of 2016.","We expect revenue in 2016 to grow at a mid-single digit percentage rate, including about a 1% impact from a stronger U.S. dollar. On both a reported and currency neutral basis, our plans include growth in every region, as well as in our wholesale and D2C channels. By coalition, revenue for Outdoor & Action Sports is expected to increase at a high single digit rate, with similar increases for Vans and Timberland, and mid-single digit growth for The North Face brand. In Jeanswear, we expect the momentum to continue with mid-single digit revenue growth. And to round it out, we're expecting low single-digit growth for Imagewear, a slight decline in Sportswear and mid-single digit decline in Contemporary Brands business.","We expect momentum in the international and direct-to-consumer business to continue in 2016. International revenue is expected to be up at a high single digit rate on a currency neutral basis or mid-single digits on a reported basis. By region, in Europe, we expect mid-single digit increase in currency neutral revenues, up low single digit reported. In our Asia-Pacific region, currency neutral revenue should be up at a low double-digit percentage rate or up high single digit reported. And in our Americas non-U.S. business, we are expecting revenue to grow a low teen percentage rate on a currency neutral basis or up low single digits reported.","Our D2C business should accelerate in 2016 with revenues expected to be up at a low double-digit currency neutral rate with about a point of negative impact due to changes in FX. For the year, we expect to increase our total store count to about 1,600 doors compared with 1,520 at the end of 2015. Comp sales growth are expected to grow at a mid-single-digit rate, including growth of more than 20% in e-commerce.","On now to gross margin. We expect 2016 gross margin rate to improve by 50 basis points to reach 48.8% or 49.5% on a currency neutral basis. To click down into the drivers, we estimate a combination of product costs and pricing benefits to be equally offset by 70 basis points of FX headwinds. That leaves 50 basis points of mix benefit to flow through as Outdoor & Action Sports, international and D2C continue to drive gross margin expansion.","In terms of SG&A, we will continue to make strategic investments in our brands with respect to product innovation and demand creation, as well as investing in our growing D2C business. In addition to store openings, we continue to make significant investments in our e-commerce capabilities, specifically bringing additional brands onto the common VF platform. These investments, along with continued pressure from foreign currency rate changes, should result in a modest increase in our SG&A ratio in 2016. This brings us to operating margin, which we anticipate to reach 14.4% in 2016, net of an anticipated 70 basis points of foreign currency impact.","Moving to the bottom line, we expect currency neutral EPS to be up 11% in 2016 or up 5% reported compared to the adjusted EPS of $3.08 in 2015. And as you think about the cadence of revenue and earnings, there's a few things to keep in mind. In the first quarter of 2016, we expect currency neutral revenue to be about flat with the first quarter of 2015.","With respect to earnings, recall that in the first quarter of 2015, we recorded a one-time $17 million gain related to the sale of a VF outlet store. Additionally, we expect the first quarter will see the most difficult FX comparison of the year, with an estimated 120 basis point negative hit to gross margin. Therefore, we anticipate currency neutral EPS to be about flat or down low double digits as reported.","In the second quarter of 2016 revenue should increase at a low single-digit percentage rate with a low single-digit decline in currency neutral EPS or high single digit as reported. Recall that last year's second quarter benefited from a significantly lower tax rate related to the settlement of prior year's tax audits.","Currency neutral revenue growth in the second half of 2016 should increase at a high single-digit percentage rate, with the strongest performance coming in the fourth quarter. We expect second-half EPS to increase at a mid to high teen percentage rate. Our outlook for cash from operations remains very strong as we expect to generate $1.3 billion in 2016.","And finally, our commitment to returning cash to our shareholders has never been more evident. In 2016, we expect our share buyback to reach about $1 billion, which is a meaningful increase over the prior year. And to echo what Eric said earlier, this increase is in response to cash flow generation and our commitment to shareholders, not an indication that we are changing our capital allocation priorities. In fact, our first priority remains acquisition. And as previously mentioned, our intention is to take a much more proactive approach to our portfolio composition this year. So share buyback combined with our annual dividend should return $1.5 billion of cash to our shareholders in 2016. That's a 15% increase in shareholder returns over 2015.","In closing, I'd like to underscore that we are very proud of what we've accomplished in 2015. All global companies operate in a constantly changing environment. We've demonstrated time and time again, our ability to effectively manage our business under a variety of conditions. This speaks to the agility of the VF model. We are highly confident that the power of our portfolio, along with numerous flexible levers, will enable us to drive revenue growth and profitability, mitigate risk and most importantly, create value for our shareholders.","And with that, I will turn it back over to the operator and open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go first to Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","So, I wanted to ask you, and as far as I can remember, I can't remember a quarter where what you guided to ended up being so different than what you reported and what you experienced. So I'm just trying to get an understanding of where the biggest changes were post-October when you gave us the most recent guidance. Also want to understand a little bit deeper where you think the implied guidance for 2016 in the second half revenue is to really reaccelerate on a constant-currency basis. And then, lastly, on the question of revenues, did you see anything in the quarter post the October timeframe between the lines that gave you any indication or insight into what's really going on with the consumer, whether it's macro or behavioral changes, et cetera? Thanks.","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Omar, it's Eric. I'll start trying to tackle your questions. So, where was the biggest \u2013 well, what caused the big miss, and you're right, we haven't had change like that to our expectations happen before to that degree of magnitude. As you know from looking at all the retailers who are reporting, there was a significant slowdown in consumer spending from what everyone expected in the fourth quarter. So that hit everybody in all categories. It particularly hit cold weather apparel and footwear, and that's a big piece of our business. So we were unusually impacted by it, and we came out of it with only 9% more inventory.","And the implications of that were we understand the carrying that inventory was probably not the right thing to do, so we aggressively got rid of it and that affected our earnings. That was a big driver of the earnings miss, was the investment we made to end the year with only 9% more inventory than last year. So, it was that combination that got to the EPS miss that we had. We think that was a smarter choice than getting closer to our guided EPS and ending the year with significant excess inventory. The \u2013 how we're looking at next year. Scott guided \u2013 gave pretty clear guidance to how we're seeing the first half, which suggests that we \u2013 there is an inventory overhang out there. Some vendors have it, we have a little bit of it, Scott mentioned that about half the 9% was in Outdoor and cold-weather products.","So that's going to slow things down here in the first half. And then as we approach the second half, we're cautious in our outlook for next winter's weather and consumer behavior, more cautious than we have been in the past. We have the early part of that season booked and that's reflected in our guidance, and we're coming up against really easy numbers for us to beat, unless maybe it's going to be 80 degrees in New York next winter, I don't know. But if \u2013 I think the odds are that the winter weather will be a little kinder around the world to us. So with a cautious outlook and really easy numbers to lap, that's why we are more confident about the growth in the second half, and we're off the growth rates we've had as \u2013 but we've said during the call, we've been averaging 7% a year for the last couple of years, and we're calling it mid-single digits until we see how this plays out.","I think your last question was anything post all this that we learned about the consumers and I don't know that we have. There were interesting product categories that slowed down and most of the material impact for us was weather-related. It really hit our cold-weather brands. I'm looking down the table to see if anybody has more insight than I do on that, but I don't think there's any macro trends that we're seeing other than consumer spending is a little soft and we think that will continue. Our expectations for 2016 assumes that, that continues through the first half of the year.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good luck.","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Omar.","Operator","And we'll go next to Bob Drbul with Nomura.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Hey, Bob.","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Bob.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","I guess, on the Outdoor coalition, I think given your guidance in terms of all the points you just made in terms of the second half, are the order books complete or how far are they complete in terms of The North Face as you look for fall next year? And when you talk about looking at the portfolio and actively exploring business expansion, and you also talked a little bit more about less exposure, Eric, when you think about it, is it more likely to have disposals or an acquisition, like how do you think about exactly what we should take away from that statement?","Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Hey, Bob. I'll take the order book question you had for the Outdoor coalition and then I'll toss it back to Eric on the portfolio. I would tell you, the Outdoor coalition, our order books are certainly on our hands for spring and they're reflected in our guidance. But it's too early for us to tip our hat on fall. I would tell you we are looking at cautious consumer or retailer behavior, but we're no more confident than ever on the quality of the product and our ability to react to the trends that we saw coming through Q4. Our Vans business remains extremely strong, and North Face and Timberland both have great strategies in place to react.","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","On the shape of the portfolio, Bob, the \u2013 I'm obviously not going to disclose anything specific in this \u2013 on this call today. But know that as we look back over the last four years, because we \u2013 people have said, you haven't made an acquisition in four years and, we quite frankly, haven't made a divestiture in four years or five years either. So \u2013 and you talked about being active portfolio managers, so how do you define active? And what we're saying now is we're defining active as being active.","And I think the fair and honest assessment of the last four years is when we acquired Timberland, for the next two years, we were not in the acquisition market, period, flat out, we were not. We were very focused on delivering the shareholder returns that we promised to our shareholders with the biggest acquisition we ever made, and we've done that. But for the last two years, we've not made an acquisition. We are actively exploring everything in our portfolio and everything that we might want to have in our portfolio with a level of activity that hasn't existed for the last few years, and we think it's likely something will change this year. I can't give you any more guidance about how that change might happen.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Got it. And when we look at some of the more challenged pieces of the business, I guess, in the fourth quarter but throughout last year, when you look at your assumptions going forward, do you believe that you're being conservative enough in terms of \u2013 whether in some portions of the workwear business or the Sportswear business or the Contemporary businesses?","Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, Bob, I think I'll take that. I think we feel confident in our ability to understand where we are. In the case of some of these sectors, for example, the Contemporary, we continue to be disappointed in the trends going on there, but could not be more confident in the teams that we have as we maintain our number one share, though perhaps that's not as important as it was in the past as that sector's under great pressure. Workwear, we've got, by far, two of the strongest brands, Bulwark and Red Kap, and teams that deeply understand their marketplace. And the business development teams really focus on expanding beyond the sectors that we win in when some of those commodities are moving our direction. So I would say we have confidence in our plan, extreme confidence in our teams that are in place to deliver those.","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Bob, I'll lean into that just a little bit. Of all those things that Steve just mentioned, the one that drives the most earnings potential for us is the workwear business, which is really on its heels right now. We've been through this cycle at least a half a dozen times in the last 20 years where for macroeconomic reasons or things like the oil industry shutting down that's happening right now, we get hurt and then \u2013 that happens pretty quickly. And then it comes back. And when it comes back, there's years of goodness. You'll recall because we talked about it in 2010 and 2011. Bulwark was our fastest-growing brand. And it's really a good thing for our shareholders when the recovery happens and we know it's inevitable, we're not planning on it next year.","Bob S. Drbul - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we will go next to Kate McShane with Citi.","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Kate, are you there? We can't hear you. Might be muted.","Operator","Kate, please check your phone line. I'm not hearing a response. We will go next to Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie.","Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to follow up on the high single-digit guidance for Outdoor & Action Sports. Can you parse out ASP growth versus unit growth? Should we assume three percentage points for ASPs? And if that's the case, how has it changed over the prior years? And what are you seeing in terms of ASPs with regards to the competitive landscape?","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I will start and maybe, Steve, chime in. So, as a general statement, we don't quote specific percentages on what our price increases are, but we've said that's a big part of our model. And that would be true in Outdoor & Action Sports, right? We price both like-for-like and probably even more importantly, bringing new product. Remember, every season, more than half of our product is new and we are merchandising the new price points. And that's how we've maintained our margins. So, you saw it in our guidance as you look forward. We've got 70 basis points of price and rate improvement, which would be the proof point that, that model is intact, and indeed, we are seeing those prices come through.","Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, I wouldn't have much to add to that, Laurent, other than our team has spent a tremendous amount of time looking at consumer and market analytics to guide their seasonal product creation strategies, and really targeting price value relationships in each of those categories across the globe, each and every region.","Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Great. And then I wanted to follow up on the comments made earlier that you are actively exploring segments of the business that you might want to be less exposed to. Curious to know if there are any metrics we should think about with regards to this comment. Should we think about profitability, anticipated revenue growth over the next few years, or metrics tied to demographics, channels or geographies? And if it's all of the above, how would you rank them?","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I guess the answer is all of the above because when we look at our company to think about what the shape of the portfolio would be, we look across the company. As I said, we're not \u2013 I can't disclose anything today and won't, but know that when we exit a category, it's either for a strategic reason or a financial reason, meaning the business isn't aligned with us strategically, or it's unable to contribute to our shareholders financially. Either one has ended up to be a good move for us when we exit out of something.","Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much, and best of luck.","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Matthew Boss with JPMorgan","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning. So, I guess my question, as we think about the 11% constant currency EPS forecast for this year versus the 13% multiyear target CAGR that you have out there, a number of headwinds, you clearly walked through them for this year. But is there any reason to think the 13% needs to change in 2017 and beyond? And then separately, your 16% EBIT margin target, while we might not get there in 2017, is there any reason to think that this is no longer the goal of multiyear?","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Matthew, the answers are no and no. And we still have line of sight. We obviously \u2013 when we made our original plan, we said at that time that we weren't assuming any change in currency translation to affect the plan, and we've had a boatload of that happen to us. But we are on track to hit our numbers, we believe, and don't think that \u2013 on a currency neutral basis. I'm glad we have the 53rd week story behind us now, because that just complicated the discussion for all of us. But we're pretty confident in the growth rates in the top and bottom line that we're going to be able to achieve. We missed the top line. We're a little light there. We didn't anticipate some of the challenges that have happened around the world, but on an EPS basis, we're tracking right on plan. Scott, do you want to add anything to that from a profitability basis?","Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah, I guess two things. I think the best evidence of the future is what you have done, right? So as Eric said in his comments, we've averaged 13% over the last three years, and we're a little slower in the top line for all the reasons we talked about today. That is a short-term bump, that's not long term. And really, what gives me confidence looking forward is the model, right? That gross margin expansion that we talked about, the levers that we have from an efficiency standpoint and the powerful brands. I see no reason why we don't go back to that over the long term. It doesn't change anything.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just a quick follow-up. On the gross margin guide for 2016, the 120 basis point constant currency expansion that you're embedding there ex-FX...","Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Right.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","...could you just help walk through what you're seeing from a product cost and a pricing perspective embedded within that?","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we're really not breaking that down. Again, it's 70 basis points. It's kind of simple if you think about your margin going forward, right? You got 70 basis points negative currency headwinds, you got 70 basis points positive on price and cost, and then you got the 50 basis points of mix falling through, and that's really \u2013 your margin is 50 basis points plus the 70 basis points, gets you the 120 basis points that you referenced. So we're not breaking it down, but again, as I mentioned earlier, be assured that pricing is a big part of our model and we're pulling that lever along with merchandising to maintain our margins.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Best of luck.","Operator","And we'll go next to Kate McShane with Citi.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Can you hear me this time?","Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Hi, Kate.","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Kate.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. I promise I wasn't on mute. I think I was disconnected. But anyway, thank you for taking my questions. My question is on the brands, first with The North Face. I think we've had warm winters in the past, and when we take a look at winter 2011, I think there was still \u2013 you still posted double-digit growth for the brand at the time. So can you help us understand maybe what the difference is between this warm winter versus previous warm winters as we think of the supply chain, and things that you've employed have only gotten better over time, and what we should expect going forward if warm winter hits again?","Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, Kate, I'll take that. Let me first start by saying this brand is absolutely still the double-digit growth driver that we've said it is. As you kind of look over the four years in our five-year plan, and to your point on what we saw in 2012, we had two years where we had record warm weather. In 2013, we grew at a rate of 7%. 2014, where we had a more normal winter, we grew at 12%. And then this year where we saw the warmest winter on record, we were up 5%.","We've talked to you all about how we are pivoting this brand to be more competitive in a four-quarter type business model. And I think some of the results that you saw this year absolutely show that we're doing that. Our Thermoball franchise, which is a fantastic three-season outerwear franchise, continues to grow. Performance apparel with our Mountain Athletics group up 40%, our equipment category growing double-digits, re-launch of our premier Summit Series collection, and multi-sport footwear growing double-digits. We are pivoting to be more responsive and more capable to navigate these kinds of extreme weather conditions. The realignment of the category merchandising model that I referenced is absolutely kind of fine-tuning what we've already done with our activity-based model. So we see huge opportunities still from a category channel and geographic expansion standpoint for this brand.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, thank you. And then, my second brand question was on Vans. I think Karl Heinz had mentioned slowness in the Core Classics category in Europe. I think last quarter, you attributed some slowness in Vans from shipping, timing changes in Vans. Can you talk to us about what's happening with that brand internationally and, again, what we should expect over the long term for the brand growth internationally?","Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President, VF Corporation & Group President, International","Sure, Kate. I'll start with Asia, I think you heard the numbers in Asia are good. We had stellar performance in Asia and we believe in the future there are no clouds there.","Europe is a little bit different. First of all, the brand is really strong. We don't see a brand problem, right? We see that when analyzing our metrics. We see how we do with the competition and we see our product initiative. It is true, though, that there is a product issue in the market, which affects not only us but affects the entire market, which is on this Classic style. That's why we guided a little bit softer for 2016 because we need time to digest this. But the brand is very strong and we are very confident. All the great numbers we had in the past outside 2016, we have no reasons to believe that we have an issue with the brand.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Good morning, everyone. As you think about this new environment and the channels and geography and new customer profile, as you think about each division and their contribution to operating income going forward, does that change at all? Is there any puts and takes on margins or expenses on each division to be aware of, that makes things different than what have been expected go-forward? Thank you.","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Dana. That's a really good question and actually we haven't had that question before. That doesn't happen to us that often. So, well done.","Thinking about it quickly and from a high level, we have, by brand, strategies right through \u2013 for the next five years that we're looking at, and they include everything that we anticipate in the changes in shopper behavior. And so, we don't see that causing a fundamental change to the mechanics of our P&L, which I think was your question. We don't see that, but that's \u2013 I'm looking around the room to see if anybody else sees anything that I don't see. So, no.","What we will continue to see is an expansion in our D2C business, particularly through e-commerce, and expansion of our international business, which as you know very well is very profitable business for us. And because the tax rates are lower outside United States than they are in United States, that helps us create shareholder value, and we still have a lot of opportunity outside United States.","Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Thank you.","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Dana.","Operator","And we'll go next to Edward Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, just two quick ones, guys. I guess, first, I know this is kind of a fungible line, but how would you over assess the overall sales of what you'd consider to be non-weather-impacted goods?","And then I guess second, with the gross margin investment you had to make to clear and get the inventory level under control, is it your understanding that the goods are actually sold through or is some of that investment potential going toward folks that may end up packing that inventory away? Thanks.","Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, I'll take a stab at this one, Ed. I think sales on the non-weather-impacted businesses or categories were very strong. In the case of The North Face, I referenced the success we saw with our Mountain Athletics collection, up 40%; the ThermoBall franchise continuing to grow nicely, not just here in the U.S. but globally; our Vans business had another breakout year, up 16% when you take into effect the FX and the 53rd week. I would tell you, all those would be non-weather-related businesses.","But even there, the Mountain Edition collection, both footwear and apparel, saw significant sell-through, giving it great momentum going into this year. So, it really is those heavily insulated styles where we saw the slowdown.","I'm sorry, Scott will grab that second portion.","Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah, I guess the question on the second part of that was the aggressive inventory actions, where do we think that inventory ultimately ended up. And I guess the answer is, we can't really definitively answer that.","Let me tell you what the actions we took were, right? So, it was varied. We discounted through our own outlets and our own full price retail. In some cases, we sold some off-priced goods. And the weather has turned a bit this year so far in 2016. So certainly, some of that has sold through, hard to speculate how much.","Edward J. Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from David Weiner with Deutsche Bank.","David Weiner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes, good morning. So, I had two quick questions. Number one, could you talk a little bit about the wholesale business in Europe? It seemed to me from the comments \u2013 and obviously I understand that you have a mix shift to D2C globally, but nonetheless it seemed to me that there were some weakness relative to expectation in Europe at wholesale. So, can you talk a little bit about what's going on in that channel broadly?","And I guess, just my second question, a follow-up, I think it was Ed that asked the question about weather versus non-weather. Is there any way you can kind of bottom-line it and tell us \u2013 you've broken out the FX impact and the cycling of the 53rd week impact on revenue, can you give a range of estimate of what the total impact to revenues was due to the weather? Thanks.","Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President, VF Corporation & Group President, International","So, Dave, maybe I'll start with the first question, the wholesale scenario in Europe. I think Eric mentioned it in his opening script. The first nine months actually, we were tracking as we had planned. We were growing mid-single digit as per our plan. The challenge was more in the last quarter, where the weather affected us as well. I think it was widely reported, and that particularly challenged our cold winter brands.","On the other one, Kipling for instance, Eastpak, we did actually pretty well. So, we're not affected there. All in all, I think also snow came and it got cold in Europe, a little bit later but it came. So, inventories are pretty normalized now, so that is good news.","The second part of the question \u2013 what was the second part?","Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Weather-related potential impact.","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we haven't quantified what that might be.","Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Right.","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","David Weiner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, thanks.","Operator","And we'll go next to Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I had two questions. The first is, you mentioned one of your long-term strengths being your best-in-class supply chain. I was hoping that you could give us any insight as to whether you have specific initiatives this year to make you guys faster or more efficient or any other benefits that could accrue to the business from supply chain innovation?","Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Lindsay, I'll start with that, and then I'll have Scott Baxter pipe in on something specific going on in Jeanswear. Speed and nimbleness within our supply chain is top of mind and it always is. In fact, our internal production is extremely responsive and is one of the key strengths of our Jeanswear businesses, and we're looking at being able to transfer that type of thinking through our Third Way programs into the sourced side of the business.","And then on top of that, with our new Innovation Centers now in place and up and running, we have some specific projects both in our Jeanswear and Technical Apparel groups partnering with our supply chain on longer-term advanced manufacturing initiatives that would absolutely make us more nimble, add speed, partnered with the upstream merchandising capabilities within our businesses where we are constantly looking at ways to really reduce lead times, increase frequency of flow to be more relevant and more frequent in front of our consumers. And Scott might want to talk to you a little bit about something going on in Jeanswear.","Scott H. Baxter - Vice President, VF Corporation & Group President, Jeanswear, Imagewear and South America","Yeah, I most certainly can. We have a project going on right now. And, Lindsay, as you know, we own our factories in this hemisphere, and we actually use those factories and are planning on using those factories as a weapon. It's a strategic advantage for us to have those here. And we've really embarked upon a project with our Jeanswear teams on taking our cycle times down. So from concept till the time a consumer can purchase that product, we are really working on and have a pretty, pretty big project going on on how we take that lead time down, how we work throughout our entire supply chain in combination with our merchant team, and bringing the consumer the products that they're looking for much quicker and much faster than we have in the past.","And then in combination with that, we have a parallel program where we're working on some small batch programs where we can go ahead and get in style and get on trend really quickly, where we haven't done that as fast as we'd like in the past.","So, those two projects are going on right now at Jeanswear and we're pretty happy with the progress we're making. And I can talk about that in the future as we progress down the line.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. I think you mentioned that for Vans America, that the wholesale business was a bit weak. Could you expand on some of the specific drivers there? And just a quick housekeeping question. Can you confirm that the 53rd week had no impact on operating profit in the quarter or was there an impact? Thanks.","Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","I'll talk about Vans and then I'll let Scott talk about the operating profit. And I think this is the fourth quarter softness that you've heard us and others talk about, had some impact on our Vans wholesale business. Certainly, Karl Heinz spoke specifically about a Classics inventory build in a couple of our key markets having an impact on our wholesale build. We really see that working through over the course of the year.","I think it's important to note though, we have a number of styles, other collections. For example, our Sk8-Hi, Old Skool that are performing extremely well and much stronger than our competition. And I think another catalyst there would be our D2C and e-commerce performance that continues to perform very, very strongly, and it's really that balanced model between wholesale and D2C for our Vans business that allows it to continue to show such significant growth.","Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah, and just to add on the second part of your question about the 53rd week, sure, it of course has an impact on profit. Probably, a couple of points for the year, so the 12% would be a couple points higher. And remember what Eric said, if you want to take that noise out and look over the last two years, we averaged 13%, and that's probably the right way to look at it.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","And we'll go next to Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Great. Thanks. Good morning. You guys alluded to briefly of the off-price lever that you pulled in the fourth quarter. Can you just talk a little bit more about your exposure overall to off-price versus what the norm would normally be in this season? And then, when you talked to those partners post-season, what is their appetite to take on more products just given the abundance of inventory out there in the channel?","Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","I think as we look at the off-price lever, our businesses, we have our outlet stores that are our first choice, where you see us holding the inventory that Scott referenced. When we look outside of our model, we've got some very strategic partners that have worked with us very, very well over the years.","Our exposure year-over-year is up slightly but not to a degree that would have us at all concerned. And I can't really speak to the appetite for them. I can tell you in our quick movement and strong relationship, we feel very good with where we are with our inventories going into next year. And not really sure \u2013 can't really comment on how those partners sit in their relative business.","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And, Erinn, I'll add to that. As I said this, I think it was Omar's question at the very beginning, we reacted early and aggressively to the slowdown that we saw coming at us and it was only 9% growth in inventory. And we think that's going to look pretty good versus some others in our space.","And so, we moved on our inventory. Now, that came at an earnings per share cost, it absolutely did have a gross margin rate cost, but we would rather come into this year with as much of that behind us as possible versus dragging around a big inventory anchor for the next six months to nine months, maybe 12 months, and we think some people are going to be doing that.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Got it. No, I appreciate that. And then I'm sorry if I missed this, just as a housekeeping on the guidance for 2016, but in Imagewear how are you thinking about the first half versus the second half? It seems that things aren't getting broadly better in Texas or some of the other oil and kind of gas-producing regions. I'm curious what's driving that improvement to the low-single digit positive rate in 2016 versus where you exited in fourth quarter. Thanks.","Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","This is Scott. So obviously, Erinn, you heard that we're actually coming out of the gates a little bit slower in the first half, but through business development opportunities and also a focused team around the Red Kap and Bulwark brand we do feel that the positive momentum in the second half will continue that we've had in previous years.","And I think the most important piece of that is we do have some big product introductions. So, it's a product story there too. We've got our continuation of our shop (01:11:46) line, which kicks off several big new initiatives and big items in the second half. So, we're feeling more confident as the economy kind of moves ahead forward in the next half of next year.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Got it. Thanks you, guys, and best of luck.","Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thanks.","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Erinn.","Operator","And we'll take our last question from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America.","Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Eric, can you hear me okay?","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I can, Robby. Can you hear me?","Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. For the last question, I was hoping that you could talk about Greater China and maybe tell us what you guys are seeing there right now, maybe even go through Vans, TNF, Jeanswear and Timberland, and sort of the just broad brush strokes 2016 assumptions for Greater China? Thanks.","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, Robby, Karl Heinz is going to take that question for us. I'm actually a little under the weather today, so I'm trying to reduce my talking.","Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President, VF Corporation & Group President, International","Okay, Robert, I think you heard me saying, I always tend to give the same answer, China is a marathon for us, it's a great opportunity long term. I mean many people talk about China, the slowdown in China. The fact is when we talk China, it's Greater China, we grew 13% in constant dollars in 2015, and that includes Hong Kong which was widely reported being down because of the tourists. So, Mainland China was even higher for us. And we expect similar numbers for 2016.","So actually, we're performing well in China. As you know, we are active with primarily four brands; The North Face, Vans, Timberland and Kipling. For the rest, we have a distributor model. So, there's a long way to go. We have about 2,500 doors on four brands, which, benchmarking to large players, where they play about (01:13:33) 5,000, 6,000, 7,000. So, we have a long way to go there.","Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then on Jeanswear?","Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President, VF Corporation & Group President, International","Jeanswear, we act with Lee in China. And I mentioned that in my script, it's doing extremely well. We have a leadership position there in that market driven by product innovation. The Jade, I mentioned, we are a candidate to win an award. We're really doing well. We're up this year again double-digit, and, no, it's good, it's really good.","Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, there's no assumption of a China slowdown \u2013 a significant China slowdown in 2016 in what you gave us today?","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We see Greater China in two halves. There absolutely has been a slowdown in Hong Kong. Our business is really strong in Mainland China, and the two of those together, we're up 13%, as Karl Heinz said, which tells you how strong the Mainland China business is. And we're not anticipating it being much better or worse. We're right in that zone of up 13%.","Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it.","Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President, VF Corporation & Group President, International","And clearly, I mean...","Robert F. Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's very helpful. Eric, I hope you feel better soon.","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Robby.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back to Eric Wiseman for any closing or additional remarks.","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, just a quick comment. First, thank you for taking so much time with us today. Look, we are disappointed in our fourth quarter numbers for sure, but we're not disappointed in our performance for last year. We think we threaded the needle really well coming through a very surprising and difficult fourth quarter, and that we're positioned to put ourselves right back on track towards our 2017 growth rates that we've talked about.","As we've said, we have a cautious outlook for this year at this point, and we think that's a prudent thing to do. And we'll give you another update in April. Thanks so much.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"21562":["VF Corp.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lance Allega, Head of IR. Please go ahead.","Lance Allega","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today to discuss VF's first quarter of 2016 results. I'd like to remind everyone that participants on this call will be making forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to certain uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These uncertainties are detailed in documents filed regularly with the SEC.","I would also like to remind everyone, unless otherwise noted, amounts that our participants refer to on today's call will be predominantly in currency-neutral terms, which we defined in the press release that was issued at 6:55 a.m. Eastern this morning. We've chosen to use currency-neutral amounts as the lead number in our discussions because we feel it more accurately represents true operational performance and underlying results of our business and brands.","You may also hear us refer reported amounts, which are in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These amounts include the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. Reconciliations of GAAP measures to currency-neutral amounts can be found in the supplemental financial information included with in the press release which identify and quantify all excluded items.","On today's call you may also hear us reference to Damn Daniel, which is most certainly not meant as profanity but instead a nod to a video that California high school kids put together with great reverence for the bands' brand.","Joining us on today's call will be VF's Chairman and CEO, Eric Wiseman; President and COO, Steve Rendle; President of our International business, Karl Heinz Salzburger; and our CFO, Scott Roe. Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call for questions and ask that you please limit yourself to two questions per caller. Thanks.","Eric?","Eric Wiseman","Thanks, Lance. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our First Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. At VF, delivering consistent long-term value to shareholders by creating sustainable profitable growth for our brands is at the heart of what we do every business day. To do this, we leverage our business model which consists of powerful brands, powerful platforms, a healthy balance sheet and a uniquely talented team. This foundation enables us to continually and successfully benefit from our key growth drivers which include driving best-in-class product innovation, providing exceptional consumer engagement and leveraging our operational expertise to manage the growth potential for our brands and for our shareholders.","We challenge ourselves and each other to operate our business with nothing less than excellence across our brands and channels, and we do that in a responsible way. Long-term consistent achievement is what's made VF an industry leader and what will enable us to remain successful for years to come.","In the quarter, we delivered results that were right in line with our expectations, and yes, our first quarter performance puts us right on track to meet our goals for 2016. Our currency-neutral - on a currency-neutral basis, revenue was up 2%, driven by 4% growth from our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition with strong growth from The North Face and, as expected, moderate growth in Vans and Timberland. Likewise, Jeanswear was up 4% with both Wrangler and Lee posting increases during the quarter.","In terms of our fastest-growing brand this quarter, or should I say brands, it's a tie between The North Face and Kipling, each with 8% currency-neutral growth. Kudos to the teams at The North Face and Kipling who delivered for us in the quarter.","The real strength in the quarter came from our direct-to-consumer business which was up 8% and included a low-single digit comp. What this tells us is that our brands and products are resonating strongly with consumers who are happy to show their approval by buying. However, our wholesale business is still navigating through the inventory carryover from what was a challenging fourth quarter at retail in general.","Our international sales were up 4% overall, with Europe up 2%, Asia up 6% and our non-U.S. Americas region growing 12%. On a reported basis, gross margin was down about 80 basis points for the quarter. We continued to see a benefit from pricing, lower product costs and a favorable sales mix shift, but as expected, this was more than offset by negative impact of changes in foreign currency. That said, we continue to expect that we will expand gross margin for the year. This speaks to our portfolio's overall brand strength and supply chain excellence.","For the quarter, currency-neutral earnings per share were in line with last year, and despite a flat start to the year for the bottom line, we continue to expect that EPS will increase 11% on a currency-neutral basis in 2016. Looking ahead, our brands remain strong. We continued to execute well and we're taking the necessary steps to ensure that our portfolio is optimally positioned for growth and to enhance shareholder value during the long term.","Now before I turn it over the Steve, I'll remind you what I said on our last call with respect to being active portfolio managers with an increased focus on ensuring our business is optimally positioned. To that end, we recently announced that we are exploring strategic alternatives for a licensed sports group within our coalition. That processes is ongoing, and we will be sure to date you would we have something to report.","Steve?","Steven Rendle","Thanks, Eric. Starting with our Outdoor and Action Sports Coalition. Currency neutral revenue was up 4% in the fourth - first-quarter driven by a low teen increase in D2C and flat wholesale results. Sluggish traffic and the hangover from the warmer than normal weather once again influenced our cold weather brands. That said, overall, we are pleased with how the quarter played out for the coalition.","Let's take a look at BF's three largest Outdoor and Action Sports brands. Globally, first quarter revenue for the North Face was up 8% with wrong mid-teen growth in D2C and low single digit growth in wholesale. In the Americas region, revenue was up at a low single-digit rate with a low teen increase in D2C including strong eCommerce results. On the wholesale side, sales were down at the mid-single digit rate as retailers continued to manage through inventories remaining from the difficult fourth quarter of last year. Within the quarter, there was a tale of two cities. With the cold start in the first half of the quarter, we saw success in our top 10 outerwear styles which, is a group, was up mid-single digits.","In the second half, when the weather turned wet and spring like, we saw strength our rain wear business led by fuseform styles and the venture jacket. Other warm winter categories turned in nicely as well, in particular are Mountain Athletics streaming collection in women's business which continues to build momentum. Overall the strength of these categories demonstrates our ability to achieve increased spring relevancy with consumers.","During the quarter, the North Face launched the second installment of its maiden U.S.A. apparel line called the Backyard Project. This collection is completely designed, sourced and produced in the United States. This uniquely local relevant product driven by targeted media coverage has generated significant exposure and although it's off a small base, we're really scaling up production to nearly 15 times in only the second year.","Now to Karl.","Karl Salzburger","Good morning, everyone. I am very happy to report the North Face European business was up almost 20% with more than 25% growth in D2C and a meeting increase in her wholesale business. We saw strength in Fromaball as well as ultra-footwear. During the quarter we launched our Mountain Athletics collection across Europe supported by strong media buy, and we are ahead of our expectations. And really important to point out that this growth was widespread. From double-digit growth in DTC in wholesale to double-digit growth in the U.K., Italy, France, Spain and the Nordic region.","In Asia, the first quarter revenue increased at the high single-digit rate. Driven by double-digit growth in the wholesale business, and a mid-single digit increase in DTC. We launched fast hiking products featuring the super lightweight fuseform waterproof jacket as well as the circular knit functional T-shirt and the 2-in-1 athletic pant.","We believe these fast hiking initiatives will strengthen our relationship with current consumers, attract new ones, and overall further establish our leadership position in the outdoor industry. Overall, globally, we are pleased with our start to the year, especially in Europe. The fall winter order book is in line with our full year expectations. We feel good about our inventory levels, and we are energized by the continued evolution of our product pipeline.","And now Vans. Vans global revenue was up 2% in the first quarter with a near 20% increase in D2C offset by a high-single digit decline in its wholesale business. It's important to note that these results are in line with what we expected in February. A direct result of our choice to strategically reduce wholesale shipments on certain classic styles, predominantly in Europe as we managed retailers seats to match otherwise healthy consumer demand.","As we have indicated previously, this should be a short-term work through. It's not a brand, product or consumer issue, and accordingly we expect growth to normalize in the second half for Vans.","Now before we discuss specific regions, I do want to congratulate Vans on their 50th anniversary and thank the entire Vans family for five decades of an off-the-wall ethos that defines youth culture. On March 16, the brand kicked off a worldwide celebration to mark this golden event.","Vans utilize multiple global advertising tactics, including promotional events and communication platforms, backed by a new visual campaign with a fresh creative look that explains the brands 50-year journey in the meaning of living off-the-wall. 75,000 people around the world attended 10 House of Vans events featuring music, art, action sports, and creative workshops, and of course, Vans launched a number products including a gold pack of classics footwear and a range of apparel. Social media exploded with Vans 50th rising to the top as a trending topic on Instagram, Twitter and Snapchat.","Now back to the geographies. In the Americas, in line with our expectations, revenue was up at a high-single digit rate with an impressive near 20% increase in D2C, including over 30% growth in e-commerce. This was offset by a slight decline in wholesale results. During the quarter, we launched are most innovative pro state shoe ever, the AV Rapid Weld Pro. This shoe was co-created with Vans pro skater and Thrasher Magazine's skater of the year, Anthony Van Engelen. Using the Vans heritage-inspired lace-up low-top, the shoe is engineered for advanced performance using innovative construction methods to improve comfort, increase flexibility and reduce overall weight.","And of course, how could we not mention Daniel, as in Damn Daniel, as in damn, Daniel, which as you can imagine, did have been a strong impact on the sales of white Vans which saw a 100% sell-through in both detail, D2C and wholesale channels. The national media attention the brand received is a wild demonstration of how creative expression, youth culture and loyalty can conspire to cause a phenomenon. Well done, Daniel, well done.","We also announced that Vans has renewed its title sponsorship with the U.S. Open of Surfing in Huntington Beach, California through 2018, one of the most preeminent action sports events in the country.","Karl Salzburger","Vans revenue was down in Europe a below-teen rate with a mid-teen increase in D2C being offset by a high-teen decline in wholesale. It is important to note that this result was in line with our expectations, and to give more color on this, on our last call we spoke about the proactive steps we are taking to manage through elevated inventory of the Authentic style, which is part of Classic collection. To be clear, this is really isolated to the Authentic style. In fact, two other styles in the Classic collection, Old Skool and Sk8-Hi, where up strongly in the quarter.","The anniversary celebrations across Europe including major events in London, Paris, Milan and Berlin drove strong momentum in D2C and our e-commerce business. In summary, progress is being made. There's no change to the expectation that this will take a couple of more quarters in Europe for the wholesale business to normalize back to growth.","In Asia, Vans revenue was up at the lowest double-digit rate, driven by 25% D2C growth and a mid-single digit increase in our wholesale business. Our Chinese New Year product, Monkey Back, achieved strong sell-through in our D2C channel. To mark the anniversary, House of Vans events were held in Hong Kong, Seoul, Malaysia and Shanghai, with special mention is a breakthrough e-commerce collaboration with China's Tmall, creating events [indiscernible] for our anniversary, an event that attracted more than one million unique visitors.","Now on to Timberland.","Timberland global revenue was up 3% on a currency-neutral basis with low-single digit growth in both D2C and wholesale. In the Americas, revenue was up in mid-single digits, with wholesale up high-single digits and D2C down low-double digits. Reduced consumer traffic and mild weather impacted the brands' outlet-based D2C business in the U.S.","Product wise, boots continue to be the main driver in footwear and our women's business remains quite strong, with sales up nearly 50%. Another standout has been the men's Killington collection featuring our Sensorflex comfort system. Even better, the Oxford style was number-one, confirming that Timberland has increasingly greater permission to play in the warmer, drier months.","On the marketing front, we continue to connect with our outdoor lifestyler consumer. Our spring media campaign showcases Timberland's unique combination of function and style by pairing up the Britton Hill boot collection with our Mount Davis waxed canvas jackets. Strong demand for both collections continues to reinforce Timberland as a relevant brand for spring both inside and outside the city.","While we continue to see pressure in our industrial Timberland PRO business, one highlight is our Boondock boot collection which caters to the construction market. This collection was up more than 40% versus last year, driven by the successful, When Your Feet Hurt, Your Work Suffers campaign.","Timberland's European first quarter revenue was up mid-single digits driven by strength in the D2C business. We are very proud to report that our order book for the Sensorflex platform reached one million pairs for the first time. It is now the leading family both in D2C and wholesale channels. We're also pleased to share that our investment in men's apparel is paying off with double-digit growth in sell-through in our new spring collection. To support the great results with our Sensorflex product, we launched a new campaign featuring the Killington which perfectly captures all-day comfort demanded by the casuals sport lifestyle consumer.","While our Asian revenue was down slightly, primarily from weakness in Hong Kong. Mainland China and Korea saw a strong growth, and Japan was relatively that. In China, where we are just getting started with this brand, we launched a new footwear Focused Rita Forement and early results are very encouraging. We're pleased to report that our Korean flagship store won silver at the 2016 Associate for Retail Environment Design Awards. A prestigious global award for retail innovation and design. Now to Jeanswear.","Eric Wiseman","In the quarter our global Jeanswear business was up 4% on a currency neutral basis with balanced growth across all brands and all regions. This marks the sixth consecutive quarter of mid-single digit growth for our Jeanswear coalition. So a big congratulations to the team. In the Americas region, Jeanswear revenue was up at a mid-single digit rate driven by the same increase in both the Wrangler and Lee brands. At Wrangler, our mass business remains strong with a mid-single digit increase in revenue that marks the eighth consecutive quarter of growth for that business.","These results were driven by innovation platforms extending into our seasonal business. Wrangler Advanced Comfort flat front shorts with a four-way flex technology and riders by Lee heavenly touch capris each saw meaningful increases in the channel. In contrast, and similar to results in the fourth quarter, we saw further declines in Wranglers Western specialty business where challenges in oil and gas exploration continues to negatively impact that business.","From a product perspective, we shipped our Cool Vantage innovation product in the Western platform and launched our Wrangler ultimate riding jean Cool Vantage for women. This breakthrough sweat control technology works five times faster and pulls moisture outside the garment which helps the consumer stay warm and dry even on the warmest day. We also successfully launched our Wrangler outerwear business. These products are prime example of how we have identified, and are meeting unmet consumer needs.","We continue to see solid growth from this existing business and division expansion. During the quarter we saw a balance growth in men's and women's seasonal products in our mid-tier and department store channels driven by especially strong growth in items made with performance fabrications. And we saw more than 100% growth in Lee men's casual bottoms driven by the expansion of our extreme comfort pant. So good momentum starting to build in this business. Cage?","Karl Salzburger","In Europe, constant for the Jeanswear coalition was up at single-digit rates driven by Lee. The brand had an excellent quarter until high single-digit growth with positive sales coming from all product categories and channels. For Wrangler, revenue was down slightly in the quarter, which strengthened our eCommerce and DTC businesses, offset by declines in our wholesale business. During the quarter, we received a very positive response to our active ready Jean, which balances comfort and style.","In Asia, our Jeanswear business was up mid-single digits. With similar growth in Lee and Wrangler. This growth was driven by strength in eCommerce, partially offset by softness in Hong Kong. Lee China launched the first ever Chinese New Year providing campaign on one-on-one plus to capture the holiday season. This was a key business driver during the quarter. Now to Imagewear.","Steven Rendle","First quarter Imagewear revenue was down 4% with flat results in our LSG business, and a high single-digit decline in the workwear business which continued to be impacted by weakness in the energy related sectors. In LSG, our baseball performance saw a meaningful increase in Cool Base replica jersey sales and our innovative flex-based uniforms, which uses a patented design to maximize player flexibility movement, debuted with all 30 teams during stream training. Also, the My team, My colors, marketing campaign featuring a player from every MLB team is really resonating.","On the workwear side, positive Red Kap sales were offset by Bulwark as the brand remained very challenged by slower oil and gas exploration with recounts at historic lows. Given that, we will now begin to lap this decline. We do expect the workwear business to stabilize in the second half of the year.","Our sportswear business was down 13% in the quarter, because of traffic declines in both wholesale and D2C. Revenue at Nautica was down 14% due to ongoing challenges in the channel and our strategic decision to license the women's sleepwear and men's underwear businesses, worth about six points in the quarter. Our decision to close the unprofitable stores and the reduction in wholesale selling to improve future profitability.","Kipling's North America business was down 8% due to slower tourist traffic in D2C, including our outlets. Kipling's global business was up 8%, driven by strength in both wholesale and D2C in Europe and Asia-Pacific.","Revenue in the contemporary brands coalition decline 15% during the quarter with weakness in both wholesale and D2C businesses. This sector remains challenging as softness and increased promotional activity continues in women's contemporary apparel. We remain focused on product innovation and differentiation and consumer connections.","And with that I'll turn it over to Scott.","Scott Roe","Thanks, Steve. Our first quarter results were in line with expectations and despite the uneven retail environment we see across the industry, be of diversity, operational discipline and strong connection with consumers continues to give us great flexibility to deliver on our financial commitments.","First quarter currency neutral revenue was up 2%, to $2.8 billion, and included growth in seven of our 10 largest brands. By coalition, Outdoor Action Sports and Jeanswear, when combined, were more than 80% of the quarter's revenue with each growing 4% on a currency neutral basis. This was offset by a 4% decline in Imagewear and ongoing weakness in Sportswear and contemporary brands. By channel, direct-to-consumer revenue was up 8%, including low double-digit growth in our Outdoor Action Sports Business and weaker than expected Sportswear and contemporary brand results. Currency neutral wholesale revenue was down 1%, reflecting the expected right-sizing of retail inventories we spoke about on the February call.","By region, the Americas, EMEA, and Asia-Pacific businesses each posted gains in the quarter. Gross margin was down 80 basis points to 48.2%, benefits from pricing, lower product cost and favorable mix shift were more than offset by FX and inventory management actions, particularly in Sportswear and contemporary brands. In line with our expectations, SG&A as a percentage of revenues de-levered by 130 basis points as we continue to invest in our key growth priorities, including D2C, product innovation, and demand creation.","First quarter operating margin was 11.8%, which included 90 basis points of negative impact from currency, and on a comp basis, keep in mind that last year's first quarter included a one-time gain on sale of a VF outlet location.","Clicking down into profitability by coalition, we see that reported Outdoor Action Sports operating income was down 13% and operating margin was 13.9%, a decrease of 230 basis points compared with last year's first quarter. More than half of that operating margin decrease was due to foreign currency changes as the majority of the coalition's business in the first quarter was outside of the U.S.","Operating income and Jeanswear's was up 4% the quarter with operating margin up 40 basis points to 19.3%, driven by benefits from cost controls and favorable FX. The strength in Jeanswear continues globally, and we are very pleased with this, our sixth consecutive quarter of mid-single digit revenue growth. Imagewear profit was up slightly and operating margin was up 80 basis points due to favorable mix of business and changes in FX.","In Sportswear, operating income was down more than 60% and the story remains the same. Challenging department store in D2C conditions along with the strategies we're employing to improve future profitability are impacting current results. Finally, contemporary brands saw more than a 50% drop in profitability as the sector remains challenging.","So carrying all this to the bottom line, are reported earnings per share was $0.61 in the first quarter. On a currency neutral basis, EPS was in line with last year's same period. Also to note, we elected to early adopt recent accounting rules related to the tax treatment of equity compensation, a change which yielded about $0.03 of benefit in the current quarter. Regarding our balance sheet, inventories were up 9% of which about half is cold winter product that we are carrying forward to fill demand in the back half of the year. So all in all, very similar story to the fourth quarter.","During the first quarter, we bought 11.3 million shares of our stock for $14 million. There are about 19 million shares remaining under the current authorization, more than enough to accommodate our intent to repurchase about $1 billion of shares in 2016.","Turning now to outlook. There is no change to the full year targets that we detailed on our February call. Revenue, up single-digits, gross margin up 50 basis points, reaching 48.8%. Operating margin at 14.4% and currency neutral EPS up 11% or up 5% on a reported basis against 2015's adjusted EPS of $3.08.","So how should you think about the cadence for the first half in the full year? All in, we are expecting first half revenue to be flat on a reported basis or up at a low-single digit percentage rate currency neutral. Based on what we said in February, reported first half EPS should be $0.95, which is down at a low double-digit range or down low single-digits currency neutral. This reflects continued weakness in Sportswear and Contemporary and our continued investment in our strategic growth drivers, which pressures earnings giving the relatively lower first-half revenues. Recall that the second quarter of 2015 benefited from a lower tax rate related primarily to the settlement of prior year's tax audits worth about $0.02 in EPS.","We continue to expect currency neutral revenue growth in the second half of 2016 to be up at a high single-digit percentage rate with the strongest performance coming in the fourth quarter. And finally, we expect second-half reported EPS to increase at a mid-teen percentage rate or up high teens on a currency neutral basis.","In closing, as I stated earlier, our business model provides the operating flexibility necessary to deliver topline growth and profitability despite an uneven retail environment. Our entire team remains steadfastly focused on our strategic growth drivers, including product innovation, consumer engagement, and D2C expansion. This focus, coupled with a healthy balance sheet, powerful brands, a strong operating platform and exceptional execution capabilities give us the confidence to maintain our 2016 outlook and to deliver on our long-term financial targets.","And now with that, we'll turn it back over to the operator, and open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll pause for just a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal for questions. And will go first a Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti","Hey, guys, good morning. Congrats. I know is was a tough quarter out there. So I just want to clarify one thing that we're getting questions on this morning on the web - on the cold weather inventory. This really just sounds like it's pack away of some of the hero items like Denali on the North Face side that we really see year after year again. So you chose just not to mark it down and you'll be ordering the same for next Fall. I'm assuming that bolstered your confidence, you'll be able to sell that product without marking it down much in the second half. Am I thinking about that correctly?","Eric Wiseman","You got it exactly right, Michael. Really the story is what we said in February, right? It's the inventory quality is good, we see demand for that in the second half. Now just as a reminder, we'll see that through the first half, right? So it will be the same story in the second quarter, and then by the second half we expect that to normalize.","Michael Binetti","Okay, that make sense. Okay, and then as you guys, since you spoke last quarter about we'll look at this position if it's necessary, and then we saw something with a licensed sports group come across. I know you don't want to go into too much detail, but when we see an announcement like that, obviously there's some strategic things that we can think about that would make your algorithm look better if he sold the business like that. There might have a lower growth rate or lower margin, but are there other strategic overtones that we should think about such as building a cash balance to do something? Or would you say that that would just go - if there was like a cash lump sum that came in from something like that? Just think about it for share repurchases until the time of an acquisition? Anything like that to think about that?","Eric Wiseman","Yeah, Michael, it's Eric. That's a great question, and unfortunately, I can't deal with it as directly as you would like.","Michael Binetti","Okay.","Eric Wiseman","When I said that we are actively managing portfolios, what you should read is that we've looked across our portfolio for potential divestitures, and we looked across the landscape for potential acquisitions, and we're trying to get, make progress on those. Whether or not we do, remains to be seen. But we are active and we had disclosed the LSG thing because we license the brands that we sell through LSG, so we needed to include our partners in the discussion early, and once we've included four or five partners, we felt the only thing fair thing to do was to make a public statement about it. We don't normally do that for divestitures, obviously, but that was the right thing to do.","Michael Binetti","Thanks a lot, that helps us understand it. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","And we will go next to Bob Drbul with Nomura.","Bob Drbul","Hi, good morning, guys. I just wondered if you could talk a little bit just about trends in Vans and what you're seeing in the category. And I wonder if you could spend a little bit time just on the fall order books? How they've materialized, and if there has been any change one way or the other over the last few months?","Steven Rendle","Hi, Bob, this is Steve. I'll take this question for you. Our Vans business is really strong. In fact, this quarter came in as expected. I think why we're so confident in our business, if you look at our global D2C results, we we're up 20%. That is huge for a business like this. And why we're so confident is really three things. Our new products, I talked about the AB rapid well pro, but also innovations in our authentic collections, classics collections. We continue to see great growth in our Skate High in old Skool group of products. They are really resonating with consumers.","Now this quarter we ramped up demand creation and we saw really great impact of the 50th anniversary promotional cadence as well as the events that went along with that. And I think we continue to see significant digital connectivity with this brand and its loyal consumer base. Things like Damn Daniel just don't happen by accident. That's years of building a loyal consumer base and having them really come to life and tell our story through their own words is very, very powerful.","And then the success of our D2C model, as I mentioned at the beginning. There is one drag on our brand, and it's CBA, and we talked about that last quarter. And it's really wholesale inventory as we get that right sized, but I think our D2C business there in Europe was up mid-teens, and our eCommerce business was up 30%. So again, another great example of a brand resonating with the consumer and working through some channel partner issues, which we talked about being right sized by the second half.","I would be remiss if I didn't say our Asia business continues to grow very, very strong, up low double digits, with D2C trending plus 25. Their connecting with their consumer growing that loyal consumer base. Again, Team All, Vans super brand day, that doesn't happen with many brands. That really speaks to the power of this brand and the recognition of our Team All partnership that this brand is good for them as well. On the fall order books, our fall order books are right in line with the plans that we've guided to for the year. In the past, we've been pretty open and we really don't break those down, but I can tell you with confidence that we are right in line with the plans that we guided to in February.","Bob Drbul","Thank you very much. Good luck.","Steven Rendle","Thanks, Bob.","Eric Wiseman","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","And we will go next to Matthew Boss with J.P. Morgan.","Matthew Boss","Hey, good morning, guys. So, Eric, higher level. I'm curious what you're seeing out there today with the consumer. It seems like apparel pretty much saw a clear slowdown in August for pretty much everyone out there. But then it seems like we hit a more recent soft patch here in the second half of March. Any forward indicators you guys are watching that might just provide some thoughts on overall consumer demand? And then multi-year, anything that you are seeing that might change your high single-digit revenue and low double-digit earnings growth for opportunity longer-term?","Eric Wiseman","Yeah. So I will start with your last question. No, we don't see anything that changes the trajectory of our organic growth rates in either revenue or earnings. Clearly, it's not easy out there right now, and the truth is if I look back several years I remember a time that it was. So it's not easy out there, consumers are being very thoughtful about how they engage in apparel and footwear, and the good news is when they think about it strong authentic brands that offer a decent price value equation are what they're drawn to. And we've got a portfolio of those, so we think this environment is good for us to the extent that we were very competitive in that environment.","The interesting thing going on right now is around the retailers that we sell to who are demonstrating very conservative behavior around buying. And that's why you see this big disconnect right now between our direct-to-consumer numbers, which are, quite frankly, very strong, and are wholesale numbers, which are, quite frankly, weak. And it's part an inventory build, and part with consumers moving to a buy-now, wear-now. The consumers are buying closer to their need as are retailers. So that's changing the cadence of our bookings.","Fortunately, with our supply chain excellence, we're going to be able to respond to that demand when it comes, and we are pretty pumped about that. I can't predict what the future is going to be with consumers, but I can predict that we are going to be able to deliver the kinds of numbers we put forward in our plans.","Matthew Boss","Great. Then just a follow-up. On distribution, and you touched on this. A lot's made of the capacity across Apparel today. You guys do have less exposure across the mid-tier department stores, but any channel out there where you guys are changing your go-to-market or distribution strategy? And then just any thoughts on Amazon becoming a larger player in Apparel. Is it somebody that you deal with today and you see yourself in that channel in a larger capacity?","Eric Wiseman","Yes, let's do Amazon first. We do deal with Amazon today. I'm going let Karl Heinz comment on it today. Karl Heinz, go ahead.","Karl Salzburger","Yes I'm assuming there's a great [indiscernible] in Europe. We do business with them since a few years. On most categories we do apply that product segmentation with them. It's actually a good customer we work with well.","Eric Wiseman","And Amazon is a good customer here in the U.S., as well as the Zappos business which has been part of Amazon for quite a while. Clearly a strong and growing retailer that our businesses have a good partnership with. Your question on distribution channels. We really don't see us changing our approach or our tone with any of the specific channels that our brands work with. We're thoughtful in how we approach channel partners, we're thoughtful and how we segment our products and work with individual retailers on making sure that their assortments are compelling and appropriate for the consumer that we know are walking in that door.","Karl Salzburger","And just kind of the tape for perspective. Less than 8% of our business is in department stores as we define them. That would be about half in mid-tier, half in traditional department stores.","Matthew Boss","Great. Best of luck, guys.","Karl Salzburger","Thanks.","Operator","Will go next to Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Mann","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just to maybe follow on a little bit on the question of department stores. Outside of cold weather product, could you talk about how you're seeing inventory levels in mid-tier and as you described, traditional department stores. And then my second question is, could you give us little bit more detail on the Vans direct to consumer, the composition of the stores, how many of them in North America, full price versus outlet. And just help us understand what your strategy is for Van stores going forward. Thanks.","Eric Wiseman","So, Lindsay, on the department stores specifically mid-tier inventory levels. I can't really comment on what our wholesale partners' inventory levels are. I can talk about ours, and we're feeling very good with our businesses that participate there, both mid-tier and in the department store channel. Our referenced our Nautica business. Really thinking strategically about the amount of product and the frequency of the flow of that product to improve turn and drive better margins. So good, thoughtful work there as always, but we're confident in where we are from an inventory standpoint. On the composition of the D to C store counts for Vans.","Scott Roe","I'll jump in a little bit, Lindsay. Globally right now it's about 560 around the world. I think it's about 75% or so is in North America, so over 400 and about a third globally is an outlet type percentage. So that's where we're at.","Lindsay Mann","In the strategy they're going forward for stores?","Scott Roe","We see our stores as a real key component for how we connect with our consumers. A little over half of our revenue comes from our D to C, both brick-and-mortar and e-Commerce. E-Commerce being the fastest-growing channel. We've talked about our geographic expansion strategy here in the U.S. as we have come along the southern tier of the country, up the East Coast, and now we've tipped towards the Midwest and we continue to see opportunities to open stores here. Opportunities to open stores in Europe and Asia continue to be significant and we'll use this as a strategic connection point to our consumer. They will tell those authentic stories, represent our products in the most compelling way and obviously drive good profitable revenue.","Eric Wiseman","The only thing to add to that maybe that in Asia, this brand is growing very rapidly. It has been embraced by the Chinese and recently the Korean consumers. We launched Vans in Korea in 2014. So we are just getting started. We think about it as regional expansion which includes the region of the Midwestern part of the United States, which is the last region we're getting to here. It certainly includes Korea and China and other markets that we have great opportunity in.","Lindsay Mann","Great.","Operator","And we'll go next to Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie.","Laurent Vasilescu","Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. Question on Imagewear. Imagewear yielded a 14.6% operating margin last year. I was just curious, should we assume that LSD generated 10% operating margin? Then you had about $360 million of Imagewear assets on the balance sheet for December. Can you give us a breakdown of those assets for LSD versus workwear? And then any color on the SG&A would be great.","Steven Rendle","Yeah, Laurent. We really can't break that down. We haven't given any detail below the coalition level and we're not going to do that in this forum.","Laurent Vasilescu","Okay. And then maybe following up on Lindsay's question on Vans. I think during the 2012 Investor Day, you talked about just getting over 500 stores. And then you also talked about 1,200 doors globally for 2016. Can you give an update on that number and then can you also remind us of how much is your core classics category advance? Should we assume a 50% rate? Any color on the size of that category by geography would also be great.","Eric Wiseman","So, Laurent, I'll fill in the blanks on the D to C. [indiscernible] said that we're at 560 stores today, and we see opportunities to continue to add the stores on an annual basis across each of our regions. Really it's a strategic connection point for the brand. On the percent the classics makes up of the total Vans business, we really don't break that out. It's obviously a very important part. What's exciting is how our brands has built on the power of that franchise, bringing in new innovations with new lightweight cup sole options, innovating in insole cushioning, innovating with the Sk8 pro series, building off of that entire series. So important, I think the real story here is the continued, methodical expansion of new styles, new franchises while obviously staying very focused on maintaining that classics piece.","Laurent Vasilescu","Thank you. Best of luck.","Operator","And we will go next to Kate McShane with Citi.","Kate McShane","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.","Eric Wiseman","Hey, Kate.","Kate McShane","My first question is around some of the questions at the sporting goods retailers just with a few of the bankruptcies that have been announced. I wondered if it provided an opportunity for The North Face specifically from DTC standpoint and how you were possibly marketing that for the back half of the year.","Scott Roe","Yeah, so Kate, Scott here. Maybe I'll first talk about - get a little perspective on that. The bankruptcies, of course we're not going comment on any one particular account, but we're still watching to see how this develops. I think there's a lot of uncertainty right now on what the ultimate outcome is. We feel that while in the long term this is probably a net positive for us and for our brands. There could be some turmoil in the short term. As it relates to the year, too, in the first quarter. We have seen some impact in the first quarter and we've taken what we can see for the balance of the year. No year evolves exactly as you expect and when look at bankruptcies individually it's not significant to VF. We talked about the accounting change in the first quarter which is a positive. We've got puts and takes which are developing for VF in total given the fact that we're sitting in the first quarter. We've got 80% of the year to go. We don't see that as fundamentally changing our outlook for the full year.","Eric Wiseman","And then, Kate, to build on your question around The North Face opportunity. I would say what we see going on in the sporting goods channel, we have multiple brands in this channel with those partners. I think we see positive, not with our own D to C as a single point, but we see it with our wholesale partners. We have multiple channel partners across each of these different sectors willing to invest with us and present our brands in the most compelling ways, both from a product and the experiences. So though it","could be short-term disruptive and it's unfortunate for the partners that are going through this. I think it will probably be net positive and an opportunity for us to double down with our existing wholesale partners as well as turn up the volume on our D2C stores.","Kate McShane","Okay, that's helpful, thank you. And then, Scott, I just had a question around the gross margin. I know there was lower product cost and mix and higher prices contributing to the positive side of gross margin expansion. Can you prioritize which was the bigger contributor? And how you're thinking about pricing again going into the back half of the year on your product?","Scott Roe","Sure. So we did have some price in the first quarter. The way you should think about that, we were down 80 basis points, about 100 basis points negative from FX, and the mix and rate were roughly balanced to get the other 20 basis points. And as we look to the balance of the year, we will see price as one of the components for gross margin. Our 50 basis point increase guidance for the full year that assumes that price cost essentially offset FX and what falls through is that mixed benefit that we've been talking about for so long. That's our model and we see that for the balance of the year.","Kate McShane","Thank you.","Eric Wiseman","Thanks, Kate.","Scott Roe","See you, Kate.","Operator","And will go next this Jim Duffy with Stifel.","Jim Duffy","Thanks, good morning. A couple of questions. First, for Karl-Heinz, the European North Face business saw strong reversal of trend from the second half of 2015, particularly in wholesale. Is there anything unique with respect to timing of shipments or anything behind that?","Karl Salzburger","As we mentioned, Jim, in the script, we're in a very healthy moment with the North Face. We do well in many categories, as we said. We do well in many geographies in actually, most of Europe. And we do well also in - by channel. So we expect a strong year. It's not related to quarter shipments.","Jim Duffy","Very good, thanks. And then the second question, maybe for Steve. If I'm not mistaken, Vans commentary this quarter had some additional nuance. The message was consistent on the European business, but there was some suggestion you are proactively managing wholesale inventories in North America. Can you talk a little bit about that? Is that concentrated in any particular channel?","Steven Rendle","Yes, good question, Jim. I would say the issue that we are working through that brought that slight decline in that wholesale shipment is isolated to a few key partners. And it absolutely will be done by the first half and normalized as we move into the second half. So it's not a worrisome moment for us. In fact, that's why I spoke so boldly about our D2C growth. You know, globally as well as here in the Americas, it's a great indicator of the strength of this brand. Our opportunity to work with wholesale partners to get their assortments lined up so we can see that growth accelerate.","Jim Duffy","Great. Thanks for that.","Steven Rendle","Thanks, Jim.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go next to David Glick with Buckingham Research Group.","David Glick","Thank you. Two quick questions. On the Outdoor and Action Sports margins, they have been down for several quarters in a row. Obviously FX being a big part of that, a few inventory issues that you called out. Can you guys talk us through how you see the margins recovering and do you assume as your sales growth potentially accelerates here as implied in your guidance that the Outdoor and Action Sports margins will continue to recover and improve from the 2014 level? Thanks.","Scott Roe","Yeah. David. Scott here. So a couple of factors. Remember in the first half really in Outdoor Action Sports, you nailed one of the issues, which is FX, and we said that's about half of the rate impact in the first quarter. The other thing that is going on is we're long term focused, and we are investing - continue to invest in our strategic priorities, and a lot of that happens in that Outdoor Action Sports area. So far as we look at those investments through the first half, coupled with the fact that for the reasons we've already detailed, our revenue growth is relatively low, that pressures earnings through the first half. Now that turns in the second half as we see the leverage and the growth returning to more normal levels. As it relates to gross margin, too, we do have pricing actions throughout the year and in addition, there are some cost benefits, particularly in leather, which will be benefiting the coalition as the year goes on from a gross margin standpoint.","David Glick","Great. One quick follow-up, if I could. It looks like the second quarter plan may have been tweaked down slightly from your original guidance. Is that related to the Van's issue that you just referred? Is that the primary reason? It's a slight change, a couple pennies, but I just want to get some color on that. Thanks.","Scott Roe","Yeah, really. I guess I can't speak to your model, but from our standpoint really there's no change in the first half. A little bit better in the first quarter, a little bit lower in the second quarter, but from a first half standpoint we see it right where we saw it before.","David Glick","Okay. Thank you very much.","Scott Roe","Thanks, David.","Operator","And we'll go next to Camilo Lyon with Canaccord Genuity.","Camilo Lyon","Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. Eric, you made a comment earlier on about the consumer's behavior about being more driven by buy now, wear now. Does that confer that your DTC channel will be the channel that could drive upside in the back half? If you could just comment on how you're building inventories with respect to your wholesale channels versus your DTC channels to potentially meet that demand given the more cautionary commentary and actions by your wholesale partners?","Eric Wiseman","Sure. I can comment. I think you're seeing one of the strategic reasons we have a direct to consumer channel which is, we're able to adjust our inventories within our stores very, very quickly because it's all our inventory. And I think that's one of the reasons that our D to C business was up 8% in the first quarter versus our wholesale business which was up low single digits. We are able to react for our wholesale partners at the same speed, but we can't comment about all the inventory they have in their stores. They buy based on what they see consumers wanting with the reality of what their current inventory situation is, not just in our brands, but across their total operation. So we have an advantage, quite frankly, in that because all the inventory in The North Face company is North Face inventory. So we can move it back and forth and in and out of our stores and it just makes us a little bit more nimble, and I think that's one reason we are seeing growth. It's just a different business model. I forgot the second half of your question. Was it around wholesale inventory?","Camilo Lyon","Yeah. Just how the wholesale inventory plan differs from your retail inventory plan. I'm assuming that there's not going to be a lot of incremental inventory build for the wholesale channel.","Eric Wiseman","Yeah. It's a different model because they come and place orders with us to buy for fall or for holiday well in advance and we flow that into them when they need it. Now there's not a wholesale inventory model. Every wholesale partner we have has their own way of doing business. So it's really impossible for me to answer that more specifically, because we deal with different models with very different retailers.","Steven Rendle","One clarification. We're not building inventory on the hopes of that one. So we're not getting ahead from an inventory standpoint for the second half.","Scott Roe","Camilla, I would build on Eric's comment. If you looked across the enterprise, our Jeanswear team, especially here in the United States, mass specifically, they operate like a retailer with big very professional retailer and we're watching daily sell-through working with our partner on daily, weekly fill-ins which is very similar to how we would operate with our own D to C. Compare and contrast that to more specialty driven partner. Our sales associates are working probably more weekly, monthly with our partners in looking at sell-through and working on fill-ins. So it really varies across the spectrum and it varies across the globe. But I would tell you that are D to C expertise really does cover how we think about our business with our wholesale partners and how we think about floor sets, flow, frequency of delivery to drive the very best sell-through and margin for our partners.","Camilo Lyon","Great, thanks for the detail. My second question is going back those demands and what's going on in Europe. I think the comment was that there's probably another couple of quarters of expectations around the channel inventory being reduce. If you could just drill down a little bit more as to what's actually happening. I think there was a comment made that there wasn't a brand issue. Could you just talk about the trends that are driving some of the softness in Europe? And whether there is excess inventory by a competitor that's just clogging the channel in the wholesale piece? because clearly the DTC component is healthy. So if you just talk a little bit about either the category or some trends away from the category, within the category, that are driving that overall softness?","Karl Salzburger","Yeah. Karl Heinz here. As I mentioned in the script, we believe, we have strong elements to believe this is not a brand issue but it's a category issue. We mentioned DTC was up and DTC gives us the possibility to merchandise in very short times the product offering. What I did not mention in the script, but it's very relevant, are reorders are up close to 10% in Q1 which really shows that we don't have a brand issue, but we have a product issue. The good news is the product issue is related to a few styles which are evident in the collection. That's why we need a little bit more time. But we actually expect the situation to improve in the second half in a very significant way.","Camilo Lyon","So again, is that to read that there's a trend shift away from those core styles?","Karl Salzburger","No, no, no, no. No. There's, we have many elements of other products we see on the brand which are really doing well, many categories, many styles. It is related to a few specific styles, which, especially in a few areas, which are a bit larger market. The U.K. is a good example, are under pressure, too. Even in our own stores in the U.K. where we have a better and a faster possibility to merchandise, we see very good results.","Steven Rendle","May I can add just a little bit of color to support Cage. Within Classics is our Authentics group. And in a few markets, in specific retailers, good partners, our inventory has got a little bit ahead of sales, and that's what we're working through right now. Within Classics are also some very powerful franchises, Skate High, Old Skool that are selling through at very strong rates. It's really limited to be the Authentics' portion of the Classics in a few markets with a few key partners, and as we work through that inventory strategically with these partners, we see returning to growth in the second half.","Camilo Lyon","And that is being exacerbated by other competitors also suffering from similar sort of results. Right?","Steven Rendle","Yes, certain, absolutely. Yes.","Camilo Lyon","Perfect. Thank you for the detail. Good luck, gentleman.","Steven Rendle","Thank you.","Operator","And we will go next to Sam Poser with Sterne Agee.","Sam Poser","Thank you for taking my question. I just want to go back to the buy-now, wear-now thing - issue. In the summertime, I mean, it used to be that I guess the people used to take markdowns in July, now they've extended that. But with back-to-school and everything, that could work. It's getting much more complicated in Christmas time, in the holidays and in the winter, because the traffic drops off so hard like right after Christmas, though it could stay, as it did get a little colder this year. So how are you changing the way you sort of manage that scenario, especially around say November through February?","Eric Wiseman","A lot of it, Sam, we have learned, if I go back 12 years, we didn't have any full price retail stores. And a lot of it we've learned in our own retail stores which is a $3.3 billion business or us now. We have learned how to read daily sales and get stuff into the stores. Our stores or other people's stores. On top of that, we run the company with around 100 days' worth of inventory. That's a forward-looking assessment of inventory. So any day during the year, we've got kind of the next 100 days' worth of inventory sitting on the shelves and in some capacity in our warehouses. So we have the inventory. The question is how do we read it and get it out?","This hasn't been a change that happened like a light switch change, it's evolving slowly every year with retailers wanting to manage their stores more efficiency that means with less inventory. And rather than placing all their orders well in advance of the season, they are placing some of their orders in advance of the season and asking us to be able to respond, and we are able to do that. Steve, you want to add anything to that?","Steven Rendle","Yes, Sam, I would add to Eric's comment, I think","the consumer in this, we can call it buy now, wear now or consumers just being very thoughtful and very prescriptive of what they want when. It's in our responsibility to really think about the frequency of flow of new products. Historically, you know our business as well, or these industries well. It's a two to four-season model. I think to really win with the consumer who I believe, call me the eternal optimist, is very incented to purchase, but you have to put very interesting offers in front of them. New products with very compelling stories and if we do that on a more frequent basis, like a real retailer would, thinking through a monthly flow lens, our brands with the strength of their connections with that consumer and our ability to drive these new innovative products, especially going forward with our innovation centers, I think we're particularly well-positioned and situated here to growth and in this changing dynamic that all of us have to contend with","Sam Poser","Thank you. And then just a follow-up on the margins in the actions [indiscernible] outdoor and action sport coalition. Can you give us a little more detailed breakdown on the, it's FX offset by the better pricing and cost, the higher pricing and costs. But what about, I'd say the promotional activity, what you had to do to help out then some of your accounts and so on Where does the markdown issue from the warm winter come into play in the margin there?","Steven Rendle","You may remember, Sam, our fourth quarter we took pretty aggressive actions to get a lot of that behind us. I won't say there was no action in the first quarter, but it was not significant from our margin standpoint.","Sam Poser","Thank you very much.","Steven Rendle","Thanks, Sam.","Operator","And will go next to Ed Yruma with KeyBanc.","Ed Yruma","Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. Two quick ones. First on e-com. Obviously you guys have had a very impressive growth rate for a number of quarters here. As you think about overall investment levels, I know you re-platformed some of your brands last year. Anything you're contemplating to maintain this level of growth? Then as a follow-up on tax. I know there was a slight adjustment this quarter. Was that contemplated when you guided in the other forward implications to that tax change? Thank you.","Eric Wiseman","So I'll take the e-commerce question and then I'll pass the tax happily to Scott. On e-commerce, you've heard us talk the last few calls about our investments around our one commerce platforms, specifically in our digital capability common platform with a very specific set of capabilities that we're able to utilize and leverage across our brand platform. We will continue to invest behind us important area. It's a powerful tool to deliver content, that experiential aspect of our connection to our consumer and I think we've been able to marry nicely the commerce component and make that a real seamless interaction for our consumers as they interact with us on our website. See that as a very important growth opportunity in the future. We've got some very exciting projects that you'll see come live in the second half the year tied to our digital platform with a few of our platforms and this is a really important, exciting area of growth.","Scott Roe","Yeah, and as it relates to the tax issue. We said in the comments, and I think I said earlier, it's $0.03 in the quarter and we expect that to be the majority of the benefit, although there will be some for the balance of the year. The reason it's first quarter focused is because in our equity comp cycle that's when our grants mature and that's where the majority of the activity is historically. That's what we based it on. I'd also ask you to just remember the other comment I made and that is that, while yes, we did have a benefit from this tax in the first quarter and that would benefit the full year. On the other hand, we've absorbed the impact of bankruptcies in the first quarter and through the balance of the year. We talked about our sportswear CBC business being a little bit weaker through the first quarter. And when you add all that up, given the fact that we're one quarter into the year with about 80% of our revenue and profit to go, none of these items are individually significant to VF, and in total it's really not material to our outlook. So that's why, the way we're looking at it, our outlook is unchanged we reiterated what we said 60 days ago.","Ed Yruma","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. Mr. Wiseman, I'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Eric Wiseman","Sure. Thank you all for your time and attention this morning. As we've said here during this call, the first quarter came in pretty much exactly as we planned, which changed since February as we've got better visibility into the back half of the year because our orders have begun to shore up, and that's coming into exactly as we thought it was, and our outlook for the year is unchanged. So we'll continue to execute as well as we do around here and talk to you in July.","Thanks so much. Bye, bye.","Operator","This concludes our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"21555":["V.F.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Lance Allega, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Lance Allega","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today to discuss V.F.'s second quarter 2014 results. Before I begin, I'd like to remind everybody that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in documents filed regularly with the SEC.","Participants may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. Where applicable, you can find presentations with comparable GAAP measures in our press release, which was issued at 7 a.m. Eastern Time and on our website at vfc.com.","Joining us on today's call will be Chairman, President and CEO, Eric Wiseman; Bob Shearer, our CFO; and V.F. executives, Scott Baxter, Steve Rendle and Karl Heinz Salzburger.","Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call for questions and ask that you please limit your questions to two questions per caller. Thanks.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Eric Wiseman. Eric?","Eric Wiseman","Thanks, Lance. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We are very pleased with our second quarter and with our year-to-date results not just because they're consistent with our outlook, but also because we're winning where and how we said we would. Although V.F. second quarter is the smallest revenue and earnings quarter of our fiscal year, our strong top and bottomline results are a great example of our ability to create and build sustainable momentum.","And momentum is the key theme you'll hear throughout today's call. Momentum isn't luck and it's not random. It's earned through focused strategies that come together to consistently generate multiple growth opportunities across our diverse portfolio. We never stopped creating great products. We never stopped elevating our relevant to in connection with our consumers and we never stopped strengthening our balance sheet to enhance long-term shareholder value.","The V.F. revenues in the second quarter were up 8%, which is right in line with the organic growth component of our 2017 plan. This is acceleration also of the 6.5% growth we achieved in the first quarter. Our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition delivered the biggest gain in the quarter, with revenues up 16%. This is also acceleration off of the first quarter with notable performances from the big three brands. The North Face was up 11%. Vans was up 21%. And Timberland was up 19%.","Our direct-to-consumer business delivered 18% revenue growth with double-digit gains in every region around the world and nearly every single brand in the portfolio. Looking towards the second half of 2014, which is the biggest period for a D2C business, we're well positioned to leverage both our brick and mortar and e-commerce channels to strengthen our brands and drive revenue growth.","Our international business also showed accelerated momentum with revenues up 14%, reflecting double-digit increases in both our European and Asia-Pacific regions and strength across both the D2C and wholesale channels. Our gross margin at 48.4% was about in line with our expectations and at 48.9% for the first half of 2014. We're squarely on track to meet our full year outlook for 49%. Second quarter operating margin reached 9.2%, a 10 basis point improvement over last year, reflecting slight SG&A leverage and our earnings per share increased 16% to $0.36 per share.","Since we announced our 2017 targets more than a year ago, V.F. has shown considerable resilience and exceptional results in the face of the challenging global economic environment, a highly competitive retail landscape and inconsistent consumer trends. When I look at the solid execution of our strategic growth drivers combined with our unrelenting focus on operational excellence, I am extremely confident about our ability to deliver consistent long-term value to our consumers and our shareholders.","With that, I'm going to turn this call over to Steve, Karl Heinz and Scott to take you through our five largest brands. And then Bob will go through our financial results. Steve, it's over to you.","Steve Rendle","Thanks, Eric. The key growth strategy of The North Face brand success has been our ability to create products with industry leading innovation that equip and inspire consumers to get outdoors, push the boundaries of their own personal journey. This journey of course is a year round exploration. And because of that, over the past couple of years, you've heard us detail our strategies to evolve The North Face into a four season brand for our consumers.","While I'm happy to report that these efforts are really paying off with strong results in our second quarter, with global revenues up 11%, including 37% growth in our D2C business and healthy increase in our wholesale sales. This was The North Face's strongest second quarter ever. In the Americas, revenues were up at a mid-teen percentage rate with double-digit increases in both wholesale and D2C. Our transitional products, led by Thermoball, continued to perform at extremely high levels, validating our ability to bring outerwear solutions to consumers across multiple seasons.","We're also particularly proud of the launch of our Mountain Athletics apparel and Ultra Protection footwear collections. Both of these collections, which saw a great sell-through across all channels, significantly amplify our ability to serve the core outdoor consumer on a year round basis. Of course, great products are only a part of the equation. We continue to strengthen our strategies to connect our brand and products to consumers, looking for even more meaningful ways to engage and inspire them.","This fall, you'll see the launch of a new US TV campaign designed to inspire the explorer in everyone and to drive an emotional connection to his\/her own personal adventure. This effort of course will be connected to the in-store experience and new store openings to increase customer engagement across our D2C business and wholesale partners. Definitely a very exciting fall ahead of us.","To sum it up, we had a great second quarter in the Americas. Now let me turn it over to Karl Heinz to walk you through TNF's result in Europe and Asia.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. In Europe, The North Face saw a high single-digit increase in revenues in the second quarter with our D2C business up nearly 40%, including very strong online sales. We are especially pleased with these results and believe we are all well positioned for the third quarter, generally the banks' biggest quarter of the year in Europe.","On the product side, we saw strong results in our running and training categories with several running pieces receiving accolades in respected industry publication. Also, the Ultra series footwear collection successfully launched in Europe. We're also making great progress in advancing The North Face towards the four season brand. To support this strategy, we executed our biggest ever marketing campaign in 10 countries focusing on key spring\/summer categories like running, training and hiking. These efforts are driving significant sales to add brand awareness across Europe.","Turning to Asia, sales were down at the mid single-digit rate in the quarter as we held back shipments to proactively manage channel inventory. We expect a strong finish to the year, returning to double-digit growth in the second half. We will see some positive momentum as we continue to build brand awareness to events like the TNF 100 and (inaudible) race in China, which affected over 3,000 participants and extensive media coverage across three events.","We also resumed our TV campaign in China to build on the momentum we gained from our efforts last fall. Globally, The North Face remains on track to achieve 12% revenue growth in 2014.","Now turning to Vans.","Steve Rendle","Global revenues for the Vans brand in the second quarter were up 21%, including strong double-digit revenue growth across all regions and channels. This marks the 19th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth for Vans, which is an incredibly impressive accomplishment.","In the Americas, revenue grew at a high-teen rate, including a similar growth rate in both our D2C and wholesale channels. It was truly a great quarter for the brand, both strategically and tactically, with strong product launches and targeted efforts to further connect Vans directly to our consumers through our own content platforms and events.","On the product front, we had a very successful launch of our unique Star Wars collaboration with Boutique and Lifestyle retailers. And to kick off back-to-school and rethinking what a future classic might be for Vans, we've just launched our classic light footwear, which combines the newer silhouettes like Authentic, Old Skool and SK8-HI with our super-comfortable and light weight ultra-cushion sole.","Our apparel efforts also continue to be a focus with the launch of our summer collection, the very first time Vans has had a four season offering. Utilizing our four brand pillars, action sports, art, music and street culture, the Vans team is hard at work creating platforms and encourage creative expression. First up, June marked the launch of the 20th edition of the Vans (inaudible). We're already halfway through the more than 40 dates and 30 states scheduled in the US and Canada. And once again, it's an epic summer celebrating music, youth culture and the Vans brand. And two weeks from now, more than 750,000 people will immerse themselves in the unique Vans culture as they attend the 2014 Vans US Open of Surfing, the industry's largest surf event.","And finally, our Fifth Annual Custom Culture Art Competition garnered 2,000 entries from high schools in every state across the US. Great product connected through authentic relative relevant events, while keeping youth culture at the center of everything we do combined for yet another stellar quarter for Vans. Karl Heinz?","Karl Heinz","Vans had another great quarter in Europe, with revenues growing at high-teen rate, including more than 40% D2C growth and a low double-digit increase in wholesale sales. As in Americas, the Star Wars collection performed extremely well. In fact, before we launched the main product, we released a limited number of special edition products that sold out in 24 hours. The broader Star Wars release also has seen tremendous success.","We're also proud to announce that our first European House of Vans opens on August 9th. Located in one of London's most iconic spaces beneath Waterloo station, House of Vans launch represents our commitment to creativity from art and music to skateboarding and fashion. This represents an amazing vehicle to engage and inspire youth culture in this extremely important market.","In Asia, men's revenue grew more than 40%, including more than a sixth increase in China. Especially exciting here is the meaningful acceleration of our apparel and accessories category, which saw strong results during the quarter. And at the start of the year, our Artist program saw great sell-through. Further evidence to our ability to go local and address regionally specific consumer preference is key to long-term success.","Additionally, our Van Doren and Star Wars footwear collections were very successful. We also brought our House of Vans concept for the third time to Beijing Music Festival, which generated a lot of great buzz online and engaged more than 750,000 consumers in the Vans band. What a great finish to the first half of 2014. The Vans brand remains on track to deliver a mid-teen increase in global revenues for the full year and become V.F.'s second $2 billion brand.","Now let's turn to Timberland.","Steve Rendle","Globally, Timberland posted outstanding results for the second quarter, with revenues up 19%, driven by more than 25% growth in wholesale revenues and a 10% growth in its D2C business. And although it's the smallest revenue and earnings quarter of the year, we couldn't be more pleased with the continued progress this powerful brand is making.","In the Americas, revenues were up nearly 25%, driven by more than 35% growth in our wholesale business, a definitively clear indicator that our product, consumer connectivity and channel distribution strategies are working quite well. With great results across every footwear category from boat and casual shoes to hiking and boots to Timberland PRO's new Boondock family, the success is broad based and balanced.","Throw in continued success and momentum of apparel in the Americas with strong spring sell-through and fall sell-in were positioned were strongly going into the second half of the year. We're also working hard to drive brand visibility and consumer demand for the brand. Our Best Then Better Now brand campaign has been successful in helping us to reposition Timberland with consumers as a lifestyle brand. And we're starting to see very positive data that indicates consumers in the Americas are starting to recognize the brand as much more than a boot company.","Now I'll turn it over to Karl Heinz to discuss Timberland's business internationally.","Karl Heinz","Timberland's revenues in Europe were up at the mid-teen rate in the second quarter. Similar to the Americas, we also saw balanced and broad-based positive trends across our products. From a channel perspective, we had double-digit growth in both D2C and wholesale, so very balanced.","Continuing to take advantage of the huge e-commerce opportunity in the region, we've now added The Netherlands and Spain to the roster. This is in addition to the first quarter launches into France, Germany and Italy, a huge leap forward in our platform that enables us to better reach consumers, tell stories and connect them every even more deeply with the brand.","In Asia, second quarter revenues increased at the mid-teen rate, with strength across all channels in the business. Growth in the region was highlighted by strong sales of our classic boots and boot shows in men's. In addition, apparel, which is about half the business in Asia, is tracking in line with our plan. Overall, we're very pleased with the momentum we've earned at Timberland. And we have great confidence moving into the second half of the year as we work towards our goal of 12% global growth.","And now let's move to Jeanswear. Scott?","Scott Baxter","Thank you, Karl Heinz. Global revenues for the Jeanswear coalition were down 1%, reflecting improvement over the first quarter, the result of a slightly better than our expectations. In the quarter, global revenues for the Wrangler brand were up 4%, while revenues for the Lee brand were down 7%.","In the Americas, the Jeanswear business was down to a low single-digit rate due to continued challenges in the US mid-tier channel and the ongoing unfavorable women's denim trend. These factors had the biggest impact on the Lee brand with its 60-to-40 ratio of women-to-men sales and a high degree of exposure to the mid-tier channel. This resulted in a mid-teen decline in Lee's Americas business. Wrangler on the other hand, with only 20% of revenues from the women's category and a depth of three different channel weighting saw a mid-single digit increase in the Americas. In fact, both the mass and western specialty businesses grew in the quarter.","All of this is pretty much what we expected coming into the quarter and we continue to expect slight growth in the global business for the full year due to an accelerated second half. So why the confidence in the second why? The same reasons I outlined on last call, new product introductions, expanded distribution and enhanced demand creation strategies. For example, in Wrangler, we're set to launch our Advanced Comfort line, the brand's more comfortable jeans yet. And to celebrate this launch, we're hosting a major kick-off event with Drew Brees in Comfort, Texas, a small town that embodies everything the brand stands for, hard work, integrity and an appreciation for the small things in life.","On the Lee side, Heavenly Touch and Easy Fit, which have stretch fabrication that combines the comfort of leggings with the structural benefits of denim are on track to launch in the mid-tier in mass channels. And as I mentioned on last call, the mid-tier will also see the launch of Modern series Curvy Fit. And to support these launches, you will see a new fall campaign supporting active comfort for men and curvy fit for women. So all in all, a tough environment in the Americas, but our brands and products are well positioned and our inventories are in very good shape as we move into the second half.","Karl Heinz?","Karl Heinz","Our international Jeanswear business had done exceptional quarter. In Europe, revenues increased at the mid-teen percentage rate, led by 25% growth in the Lee business and high single-digit growth in Wrangler. And in Asia, Lee continued its growth in the second quarter with a low single-digit increase with considerably stronger expectations in the second half.","Similar to the first quarter, key accounts and consumers in both regions continued to respond strongly to the evolution of our collections. Our products are resonating well. Our connection with consumers is getting deeper and our geographic expansion strategy is working.","So 2014 is shaping up to be one of the strongest years in quite some time with significant topline growth and margin expansion. In closing, in the second half, we expect global Jeanswear revenues to grow at the low to mid single-digit rate, with some growth in the third quarter and substantially stronger results in the fourth quarter.","Now Bob will take you through our financial highlights.","Bob Shearer","Well, thanks, Karl Heinz. Well, as Eric mentioned, the second quarter represents the smallest revenue and by far the smallest earnings quarter in the context of V.F.'s fiscal year. Now that said, we couldn't be more proud of our results. Strong contributions from our largest coalition and our biggest brands help us to deliver industry leading results. And with the first half behind us, we've got great confidence in our ability to achieve our full year outlook.","Now taking a look at our second quarter, total V.F. revenues were up 8%, driven by accelerated results in our key growth drivers, including Outdoor & Action Sports, which was up 16%; international revenues, which grew by 14%; and our D2C business, which was up 18% in the quarter. These have been our core growth drivers over the past few years. They will be for the remainder of 2014 and will be for years to come. In so many ways, we're just scratching the surface related to these powerful growth engines.","Our gross margin of 48.4% was about in line with our expectations. To look at a few of the parts, on the positive side, we saw another quarter of predictable mix benefit from the shift of our revenues toward higher margin businesses. There were however two main offsets that tempered this benefit. First was foreign currency impact, which we spoke about on our last call. The good news here is this was isolated to the second quarter. The currency impact should be relatively neutral in the second half of this year.","The second offset came from our efforts to aggressively manage inventories mainly related to our Jeanswear business, which continues to be challenged, especially in the mid-tier channel that Scott talked about earlier. To avoid taking markdowns, we took downtime in our own jeans factories, something V.F. is uniquely positioned to do to reduce markdown risk going forward. What was a result of our disciplined approach to inventory management? Well, inventories were up only 6% in front of the second half of the year when we expect revenues to grow close to 9%.","All in, our first half gross margin sits at 48.9%, which puts us right on track to reach our outlook of 49% for the full year. Without a doubt, we're very pleased with the continued evolution of our gross margin story.","Now turning to SG&A, our SG&A ratio to revenues was down slightly despite our continued investments focused in D2C and marketing. We're operating 140 more stores now than we did at the same time last year. Given that significantly larger base and as you all know, D2C carries a higher SG&A ratio to revenues and that our marketing expense as a percent of revenues also grew slightly in the quarter, well, that means we realized significant leverage in other parts of our cost structure. And that's our model. We make investments to drive topline. We find leverage elsewhere in our expense structure and improve our profitability.","Taking all of this to the bottomline, our operating margin was up by 10 basis points to 9.2% and earnings per share were up 16% to $0.36 for the quarter. That's right in line with our expectations and definitely a quarter we're really pleased with.","Now let me touch on our coalition results for the second quarter. As I mentioned, revenues for our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition were up 16%, but perhaps equally impressive was the channel balance that drove that. We had more than a 20% increase in D2C sales and a low-teen increase in wholesale revenues. We also had great balance on a regional basis. Our Americas and international businesses, both experienced about the same percentage increases.","Given the results Steve and Karl Heinz went over earlier for The North Face, Vans and Timberland, along with other brands that are smaller today like Napapijri, Kipling, EASTPAK and SmartWool, all of which grew by more than 20% in the quarter, well, needless to say, we are extremely pleased with performance of this coalition.","Operating income for Outdoor & Action Sports was up 31% in the quarter and operating margin expanded 120 basis points to 10.3%. We're hitting on all cylinders here. We improved gross margin. We increased the marketing ratio of revenues and improved our profitability. The focus of continuing investments that we're making behind these brands is truly paying off. For the full year, in Outdoor & Action Sports, we're now confident we'll grow at the upper end of our range of 12% to 13%.","Now turning to Jeanswear, we did see the sequential improvement we expected, with revenues down 1% compared to a 4% decline in the first quarter. And actually Jeanswear revenues were up slightly on a constant dollar basis. In the Americas region, revenues were down in the low single-digit percentage range, reflecting the ongoing challenges in the US mid-tier channel and shifting consumers trends in the women's denim. And as you heard earlier, this environment had the biggest impact on the Lee brand in the US.","In Europe, our Jeanswear business saw continued strength with revenues up at a mid-teen percentage rate, while revenues in the Asia-Pacific region rose in the low single-digit range. Second half revenues in Asia are expected to grow at a high-teen percentage rate. Operating margin for the coalition in the quarter was down 130 basis points due to the proactive efforts to ensure inventories stay in line that I mentioned earlier.","As we look toward the back half of the year, we expect Jeanswear revenues to turn positive, with the strongest growth coming in the fourth quarter when the benefit of expanded distribution kicks in and several new product innovations are launched.","Imagewear revenues grew 3%, driven by mid single-digit growth in the Image or Workwear business. And our [ph] LSG business was up at a low single-digit rate. As you recall, we talked about our decision to license the youth business for Major League Baseball. This negatively impacted Imagewear second quarter topline by 2 percentage points, but will lead to better profitability in the long term. Operating margin was down 20 basis points compared to last year due to a shift in product mix isolated to the second quarter. We continue to expect this coalition's full year operating margin to expand.","Sportswear coalition revenues were up 5% during the second quarter. Nautica revenues were up 2%, which is lower than what we had anticipated. In Nautica, a low double-digit increase in D2C was tempered by a mid single-digit decline in the wholesale business due to the same department store challenges that you're all aware of. Kipling's US business delivered another outstanding performance with 18% growth in the quarter, a brand that on a global basis was up 27%. Operating margin in our Sportswear coalition was 7.3%. We expect the coalition's full year operating margin to be about flat with last year.","In our Contemporary brands business, revenues declined 2% with similar decreases in both the Americas and European businesses. Our D2C business was up 10%, but this was offset by a high single-digit decline in the wholesale business, reflecting the challenging consumer trends in the women's premium denim. As we said last quarter and similar to Imagewear, we decided to move part of our kids business to a license model. That negatively impacted revenues for this coalition in the quarter by 3 percentage points.","And finally related to our balance sheet, we did purchase an additional 2.9 million shares for $173 million in the second quarter, which concluded our planned share buyback anticipated for 2014. We continue to expect another really strong year from a cash generation standpoint, which should exceed $1.65 billion, allowing us to completely repay our commercial paper balance by yearend and providing us great flexibility to invest in future growth.","Now with respect to our outlook for the full year, as you've heard throughout the day, we believe we're right on track to achieve our targets. We expect annual revenues to be up 8%, which is directly in line with the organic growth expectation of our 2017 plan. Full year gross margin and operating margin should reach 49% and 15% respectively, which would be ahead of the pace anticipated for reaching our 2017 goals. Earnings per share in 2014 is expected to reach $3.06 per share, which is up 13% over 2013, right in line with our 2017 plan.","And finally, we will keep an opportunistic view and looking for areas to invest in our brands, products and marketing to provide further momentum going into 2015 and beyond. And now I'll give a little bit of color on how we see growth trending in the second half.","Third quarter revenue should increase at a rate similar to that of the second quarter, driven primarily by strength within our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition, our international operations and continued strength in our direct-to-consumer businesses. Investments in the third quarter, driven by a record number of store openings, will pay off significantly in the fourth quarter. That means of course that the strongest growth and profitability comparisons of the year will be in the fourth quarter when our direct-to-consumer business has its most significant contribution of the year.","So in closing, we've had a great first half of 2014, growing revenues by 7% and earnings per share by 13%. We're set up well for an even stronger second half of the year. Our portfolio is strong. We have many opportunities to create even greater separation from the competition. 2014 will be a year when we'll make significant gains in improving our profitability and enhancing long-term shareholder value. In summary, we're very confident in our ability to deliver on our full year outlook.","With that, I'll turn it back to the operator and we can open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew Boss - JPMorgan","So, Eric, on the consumer, curious how you described the overall environment out there today. Any changes in ordering trends that you've seen and expectation for the promotional environment in the second half versus what we're seeing out there today?","Eric Wiseman","Sure. On the US front, it's pretty obvious. By the promotional activity that you're seeing at retail today that consumers are tough to get at. We're seeing that in our wholesale business, not so much in our direct-to-consumer business where our business was up in single digit in our own stores in the quarter. But in our departments that we sell to have adopted a more promotional environment and we see that affect us primarily in our Sportswear and in our Jeanswear business, particularly in the mid-tier, not so much an issue anywhere else in the corporation though and not an issue for us international at all. So where that affects us is in a very small sliver of our business and we're finding consumers are coming to our brands in other channels of distribution, including our own.","Matthew Boss - JPMorgan","And then as you think about the promotional environment in the second half, I mean are you kind of planning for it to be as it is today or do you think that things will actually calm down a little bit here?","Eric Wiseman","I wish I knew the answer to that. But we're prepared for it to be as it is today.","Matthew Boss - JPMorgan","And then on the balance sheet, you leveraged in about levels when you acquired Timberland. Buyback is now complete. It doesn't sound like there is an acquisition eminent. Can you just talk about capital allocation priorities going forward here?","Eric Wiseman","Our capital allocation, the way we look at it is it's pretty much exactly where we've been. Our first priority is in the M&A front. It's been very, very successful for us. Our buyback program will remain pretty much the same. You said the program is complete is for the year, just to clarify that, where we said was for 2014 we weren't anticipating buying back any further shares. But going forward, we will. And we'll use that to offset the impact of stock option exercises. So yeah, our priorities are very clear. And that is on the M&A front, the buyback program is more of a maintenance level spend. And actually from a dividend standpoint, in 2014, we'll expect to increase our dividend substantially, once again just as we have over the past couple of years, is likely by more than 20%, just like we did last year, moving toward that ultimate goal of 40% payout level.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America.","Robbie Ohmes - Bank of America","Hey, just two questions. The first was just on that Jeanswear business. Maybe, Karl Heinz, you could tell us how did Lee do the 25% growth in the second quarter, and is that sort of a trend that we should expect to continue? And then maybe in aggregate, could you give us a little more help on what the Jeanswear margin outlook is? I understand how you protected the margin downside in the second quarter. But how should we think about Jeanswear gross margins? And maybe some color on just the third quarter versus fourth quarter gross margins to get to your full year guidance.","And my second question is just on the Timberland business. Maybe some comment on how that operating margin in that business is tracking versus your plan of the revenue look great, but is the margin also doing what you guys are hoping it's going to do?","Karl Heinz Salzburger","So, Robbie, let me start with your first question. The 25%, as we mentioned, it's an exception number. It's not a number which normally the jeans sector is delivering going forward. What I would say though is we have done a great work. We had a good Q1. We expect a good year and we do expect finally our jeans business in Europe going back to growth again.","Eric Wiseman","And, Robbie, relative to the jeans gross margin percentage in the second half of the year, and this is a global view, the gross margins will return back pretty close to where we've been. So actually on a full year basis, our gross margins will be relatively flat year-over-year. Just to clarify, in the second quarter, I mentioned in my comments that we took some proactive actions to control inventory and we took some downtime in our plans. And again, we're in a unique position to do that and we could really see it in our inventories. And our inventories are really under good control. We just didn't want to go into the second half of the year with any kind of inventory positions that were in excess. So that was the biggest on the gross margins in jeans. So yeah, that'll improve in the second half of the year, so the overall on an annual basis will be pretty close year-over-year.","Robbie Ohmes - Bank of America","And just on the cadence of the third quarter overall gross margin versus the fourth quarter, we should assume gross margin improvement in the third and fourth quarter?","Eric Wiseman","Absolutely. But obviously stronger in the fourth quarter, given the mix of D2C.","Bob Shearer","I'll go back to the acquisition assumptions. Obviously when we talked about Timberland acquired, we talked about a 10% annual growth rate. We're running ahead of that this year. Certainly ahead of it in the second quarter, but the guidance we've given for Timberland is for 12% global growth this year. From an operating margin standpoint, we're on track to hit the targets we set when we acquired the business. And we're going to give an awful lot of color about that to you guys in a few months.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Laurent Vasilescu from Macquarie.","Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie","I have a few questions with regards to the anticipated September Investor Day, which will focus on the Timberland brand. With the brand growing at a high-teen rate now, could we expect revised 2017 targets for the brand? Could we see gross margin operating margin goals as well? And lastly, does the success around the Timberland acquisition give you more confidence to make another potential acquisition revolving around the footwear line?","Eric Wiseman","We were going to go into details about where we are with Timberland and where we see it going when we're together in September. And that story needs to be put in the context of the total picture around the world is the only way to really tell that story. And in about eight weeks, we'll be going through that. We are very confident in our acquisition model. If you go back a decade ago, we bought Vans and 15 years ago we bought The North Face. And you go through the brands and in Bob's script, he mentioned that Napapijri, Kipling, EASTPAK and SmartWool all grew greater than 20% this past quarter. We think we're pretty capable acquirers and integrators and enablers of businesses in any category.","Our interest in footwear is obviously growing. That really started for us with Vans and then followed by Reef and now Timberland. And we have other brands that are in the footwear business, but those two are really footwear acquisitions. We're a pretty big player in the space now and we have a lot of momentum in our footwear businesses. So yeah, that would lead us to believe that we could do another footwear acquisition. I'm not going to say that's our top priority, but we could do one, yes.","Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie","And can you talk a little bit about the lucy brand, how it has performed over the last couple quarters? And then maybe bigger picture, if you could share your general thoughts on the yoga market, as we see some existing players struggle with new brands entering the space, any general insights would be greatly appreciated.","Steve Rendle","So our lucy business, a business we're very proud of, had a strong first half. We're up mid single-digit. Second quarter was off plan a little bit, primarily due to retail traffic trends in our own stores, which remain a significant part, about 75% of our total business. What we're really proud of with our lucy business is the partnership that they're forming with the exporting goods. As of the end of May, we had set a little over 300 doors in the new exporting goods women's studio pad and are seeing really strong results. That partnership is building on additional partnership we've had for just about two years with REI where we're an all-door provider and seeing really strong results there as well. So we're able to take our Outdoor & Action Sports model of a balanced wholesale and D2C strategy, bring that to lucy, extend the reach of our brand, touching consumers where they're shopping.","As we look at this space, the women's athletic and yoga space, absolutely something we're interested in. We think it's in a sector that's here to stay and one that we can do very, very well with, with our unique ability to understand the consumer and bring products and emotional marketing to drive our success.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS","Could you help us put some numbers or some magnitude around the two impacts you mentioned on gross margin as far as factory downtime versus FX, Bob?","Bob Shearer","Yeah, maybe what I'll do is just run through the gross margin and the components of the gross margin in the quarter. So as we've very, very consistently said and as we've been saying and realizing the mix benefit was absolutely intact and will be for the year and will be going forward. That was about 70 basis points on the plus side. You might also remember the concession accounting change helped us by about 30 points and that increases SG&A as well by about the same. That's about 100 basis points.","So offsetting those two in about equal amounts, number one was the FX impact. We talked about that in our last quarter and we could see that coming. By the way for the second half of the year, that won't be an issue. It's really isolated to the second quarter. That was about half of the offset. And then the other half was related to the inventory actions that we took. And a big piece of that was the downtime in the jeans plants that we talked about.","Michael Binetti - UBS","So as far as second half goes, the jeans guidance, maybe you can help us think about how much of it is reflecting your expectation for improved sell-throughs or they're just new programs?","Bob Shearer","Yeah, it's particularly in the fourth quarter. I think Scott mentioned this in his comments. In the fourth quarter, it will be the strongest comparison as we gain some distribution and also the new product launches. So that will be the strongest quarter. From a gross margin standpoint, no, we don't expect to see the same impact that we saw in the second quarter. We feel that we have that clean-up behind us and we enter the year with really clean inventories going into the second half of the year.","Scott Baxter","Yeah, Michael, we feel real good about our core business going into the second half of the year, especially with where we are in the inventory position. But I think the big thing for us is the innovation that we've had in our pipeline that's now starting to come to life. You're going to see it in the mass channels as it rolls out right now with our Advanced Comfort. The best test that we've ever had in the history of Wrangler for a new product, we just nailed with that and it's gotten full distribution within the mass channel. And that's hitting right now. So we couldn't be more excited about that product and for when folks finally get a chance to buy it and wear it and the word of mouth.","And then in the mid-tier, we're also doing the same with new products, Curvy Fit and Easy Fit. So that's really going to take hold as we move through the third quarter and it's really going to help us in the fourth quarter and going forward.","Michael Binetti - UBS","Last winter, obviously there was a lot of media around how cold the winter was and certainly we were all looking at the temperatures in the US. But you guys were pretty consistently commenting that it wasn't universal and that there were some areas, I think Lance called out California, but certainly Europe was an area where the winter wasn't as favorable as those of us watching the news in the US were saying. Could you just comment on how order trends are looking for The North Face or what the retailers are thinking about as they are sitting on inventory in Europe that you think might be holding them back from ordering stronger for the back half?","Karl Heinz Salzburger","We had a very strange winter in Europe. We had tons of snow in the Southern part of the Alps and we had no snow on the Northern side. So a pretty strange thing. I would say now the situation has normalized. And as we anticipated, we look forward on The North Face for a mid-single growth for the year. As you know, we don't announce fall orders anymore because of the strong D2C component we have. But we are looking forward to a good year.","Now we have assumed a normal winter to come. So no spectacular at the same time hopefully not a bad one like this year. But we don't see the promotional activity as strong as what's happening here in the US at the moment. So I would say all in all, thanks God, we went over well and we look forward to a normal year.","Operator","And we'll move along to our next question from Bob Drbul with Nomura Securities.","Maddie Steiner - Nomura Securities","This is actually Maddie Steiner on for Bob. I just have two quick ones. Firstly, can you talk about any visibility you have into the fall holiday pre-booking for the outdoor brand?","Eric Wiseman","We're not giving our forward-looking booking with The North Face for a couple of reasons. Probably most importantly is our D2C business is now about a third of our total revenue and trying to contrast our wholesale order book really isn't accurate depiction of what our business looks like. What I can tell you is our orders in hand support the outlook of a 12% global growth rate that Karl Heinz mentioned in his script. And here in the US, we're feeling very good about the momentum that we've carried out of '13 into '14 first half has been very strong. Our order trends for fall are in line with our guidance here in that low-teens growth rate for the US business.","Maddie Steiner - Nomura Securities","And then lastly, with regard to the Jeanswear inventory issues, was any of that related to Lee overhang in China that you've mentioned previously or has that been resolved?","Karl Heinz Salzburger","That has been resolved. In fact, we did announce a positive quarter for Lee this quarter. What I did mention in my script was the situation on outdoor. We see a similar situation happening in the outer channel, but this time we have proactively acted. And the fact what we have done, we have not delivered the entire order book we had, the spring order book to the market in order to avoid a similar situation.","Steve Rendle","And the inventory situation that we discussed was really around the Lee brand domestically. If you step back 10 feet and look at the Lee business, it is almost entirely in the mid-tier channel and it's tilted heavily towards women's, which is the weaker part of the jeans business. The channel choice we've made and who the brand resonates with women, you put those together and that's the softest part of our Jeanswear business in the world right now.","Eric Wiseman","We don't think the fundamental brand problem, it's more structural around it.","Operator","And we'll move along to our next question from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory.","Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory","Can you talk a little bit about the marketing investment plans going forward and what you see the cost as this year versus last year, how you're planning? And then anything on product cost and West Coast port strike, how you're planning? And just lastly, Europe strength, was it particular regions that you saw the strength?","Bob Shearer","What we indicated early in the year and we're right on track for the spend is that last year we spent just below 6% of our total revenues on marketing, spent close to $680 million or so. In the current year, we expect to keep our ratio about flat with what it was last year, again right under the 6% level, so if we're just well above $700 million mark, closer to $720 million or $730 million or up about $50 million over 2013. That's our plans right now. As I indicated in my commentary, if we see some opportunity to make some additional investments in marketing or other areas, just as we have in the past which have been very, very effective for us, we may do that. But our plan right now is to hold the ratio to revenues pretty flat and again close to the 6% mark.","Eric Wiseman","On the product cost side, Dana, I think the best way for you to think about that is we have complete visibility of our product cost for the balance of this year and we expect to deliver 40% gross margin for the company this year. So we've contemplated all the pluses and minuses in product cost into that 49% gross margin number. On the West Coast port strike, the good or whatever the situation is out there right now, we obviously saw that coming well in advance. Our supply chain reacted in a really strong way and we got inventory into our warehouses much earlier than we would otherwise have. And remember, our inventories were only up 6% at the end of the quarter. So they would have been even better than that had we not accelerated receipt of goods. So we're prepared to fill orders here in the third quarter. I can't predict what might happen out in the West Coast, but we have the inventory in our warehouses right now and hopefully that situation will get resolved.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","The fourth question, I guess, was on the stressed situation in Europe. So as I mentioned it before, we did not see, thanks God, what's happening here in North America. We have some markets, some countries, Europe is a conglomeration of markets, but overall I would say it's business as usual.","Operator","And now we'll move along to our next question from Omar Saad with ISI Group.","Omar Saad - ISI Group","My first question, following up on the jeans commentary, how do you think about this kind of divergence, especially with the Lee brand, how it's doing domestically versus international in this era of globalization and information availability and digital, just how do you think about the sustainability of those kind of diverging brand positions for the international versus domestic?","Scott Baxter","I think there is a big opportunity here for Lee. If you think about the brand, it's got permission to play in this space as far as comfort goes, and that's really where folks are going right now. And we're getting at it with a lot of new products in our innovation pipeline. You heard me talk about a few of them earlier. But they're starting to roll out now. And our team thinks of it as additional wearer occasions. We're the leading brand with our brands that we have in Lee and Wrangler. So the permission to plan that space and the footprint from a distribution standpoint that we have put us in a really strong position. And then the work that we can do globally together will really help us drive that around the globe. And it's part of the thing that makes V.F. great in that we work and communicate together as brands globally. We talk and communicate and we understand the trends that are happening globally and we share those together and we can work together to make sure that those brands are healthy and growing in the future.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Omar, as we discussed and as you know, we have pretty aligned on Lee and on Wrangler between Europe and Asia. So we're there. And globally, we're working closer and closer. Stretch fabric is a good come on that team on Lee, which we're using in US and in Asia and in Europe of course. So we're getting there to have common brand positioning.","Eric Wiseman","Omar, the challenge for us obviously is how do we recognizing that the brand was a pioneer internationally, just celebrated its 50th anniversary of doing business in Europe. And back when it was launched in Europe, it didn't have to look consistent globally, because there wasn't global communication, but today there is. And we're undergoing a lot of efforts to gradually, but deliberately find common ground for this brand around the world. That will take time, but we're on it and it's going to take time. There're a lot of little steps. We're moving closer. And the strange thing about that to me is here in the United States, the Lee brand in Europe looks like it has a premium positioning. But sitting in Europe, it does not have a premium position. It's just relative to American price points. In Europe, it's really more of a mid-tier positioning, which is right where it is in the United States from a price point standpoint.","Scott Baxter","And, Omar, I think one of the things that's really going to help us do that is we're opening up and we're in the process right now of opening up our denim innovation center and it's a global denim innovation center. And Karl Heinz and I are very aligned on what we need to do and what we need to accomplish there. And we're going to work on joint projects around denim and around our products going forward. So there is a lot of excitement around that and you'll hear more of that in future too.","Omar Saad - ISI Group","I also wanted to ask about Timberland, kind of a follow-up. I mean this was the biggest acquisition you've done. The margin opportunity you guys have obviously executed really well. But now this thing is growing in the teens, high-teens even. And it was already such a big brand when you bought it. Like how much confidence does the topline success you're having with this brand, a few years removed from the deal, to do other even larger acquisitions in the future? Is that something you think about?","Eric Wiseman","We obviously are in a different place than we were 10 years ago when we talked about having a sweet spot for acquisitions of $300 million or $400 million. We are a much bigger company now. We were $4 billion or $5 billion company then. We're a $12 billion company now. We need to be looking at larger opportunities for acquisitions to move the needle. Does it mean we wouldn't do a smaller deal if it was a really smart business that we thought that if we bought we could do with that, like we've done with a lot of the other smaller businesses we bought and grow them and expand their profitability and deliver great shareholder value. But given our current size, we're capable of doing bigger deals. Given our current annual cash flow, we're capable of doing bigger deals. And something like Timberland gives us confidence that we could do it well too, that's fair.","Operator","And we'll move along to our next question from Barbara Wyckoff with CLSA.","Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA","Can you talk about the China opportunity, where are you versus your projected trajectory? And then second, could you comment on the acceptance of the re-launched Timberland apparel that we saw I think about a year ago? What have you learned, what have you changed, et cetera?","Eric Wiseman","Yeah. The big picture on our China trajectory is that we are essentially on track. There've been some puts and takes and there always are going to be in a business that has a diverse portfolio. But in terms of our aiming and the China targets we've talked about, we're still aiming and we're making progress.","Steve Rendle","So the limited re-launch of the Timberland apparel was here in the United States. Our most significant apparel business is sitting in Europe and Asia. We brought the apparel back here to the US last year. It was a strategic limited launch with a small number of specialty retailers as well as Nordstrom. We saw very good results, very good sell-through. That momentum carried into spring, as I mentioned in my comments. And our order book for fall '14 reflects that success, as we've seen in expansion of our specialty doors and expansion of the number of doors that we'll participating with Nordstrom on. And we're very happy. We are on track with what we believe this brand can do from a head-to-toe standpoint and we'll continue to drive apparel as part of that balanced portfolio of products that we're bringing to the outdoor lifestyle consumer.","Operator","And we'll move along to our next question from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Erinn Murphy - Piper Jaffray","I just wanted you guys to maybe think a little bit more about your direct-to-consumer business, very strong in the quarter, up 18%. Could you just help us parse out the growth between e-commerce and then your brick and mortar stores? And then as you take a step back and think about the e-commerce goal you've provided for the longer-term plan of $750 million, where are you in achieving that, and then how are you seeing the role of mobile kind of impact the pathway to get there?","Eric Wiseman","We had a really nice quarter in our direct-to-consumer business. Let's keep in mind that the second quarter is not the biggest quarter for an Outdoor & Action Sports type business to have in our D2C world. But we have a consistent string here of really strong quarters. We're up 18%. We have double-digit growth in every region and growth in nearly every brand. What makes that up is a mid single-digit comp store growth, which we're proud of, over 30% growth in our e-commerce. And we are on track to open 150 new stores this year. So there is a new store component, we've said all along. And we are very early in our journey of opening up our own stores. Because we have so many brands and so many geographies that we're in, we have a lot of runway to open new stores and we said we're going to open 150 this year and less than half of them are opened as we sit here today, but they'll be opened by the end of the year. And that's part of what gives us confidence about the strength we're going to have in the second half of the year.","On mobile, we are beginning to activate our brands, so the consumers can relate to our brands through their mobile devices. We're not where we want to be. I think in general, the industry didn't see mobile coming on as big as we could. I'm going to ask Steve to make a comment on that, about where we are.","Steve Rendle","So, Erinn, this last March, our Vans business launched a new V.F. platform for our web businesses going forward. It has a very powerful adaptive responsive mobile component to that. We certainly see our consumers interacting with us on mobile, searching out our products and our content. But we also see mobile as a very critical tool of how we interact with our consumers in-store, and we're making investments in that part of our digital platform as well as bringing service and efficiency to that in-store component. So a very, very important and an area that our big brands are driving very aggressively and will benefit all of the V.F. platform in the future.","Eric Wiseman","And, Erinn, just one other point relative to D2C, our profitability as well has been very, very strong and our returns are high in our D2C businesses in total. And they're even improving. Some of that's coming from improvement on the international side, where our business was less mature and is now maturing, it's improving and also the fact that on the e-comm side of the business, which is highly profitable, becomes a little bit bigger piece of the overall mix. So a good news there as well.","Erinn Murphy - Piper Jaffray","And I guess it just the last question just for Karl Heinz, just a follow-up for you. You responded to an earlier question just speaking about the inventory starting to build in the channel for outdoor brands in Asia and that kind of led to you proactively pulling back on The North Face orders there. Can you just speak to when did you start kind of seeing this inventory build in the space there, and then how should we think about kind of the next few quarters in terms of rightsizing where you want to be? And the inventory there, seeing the channel, I guess just the last question is, are you seeing that more from global brands that are expanding in Asia or from some of the local brands?","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Well, we mentioned we had a similar situation with Lee a while ago, as you might well recall. And we're kind of [ph] cocked by that and we suffered then. We had a few quarter where we had negative growth. This time, we changed our strategy. We saw it coming. And as I mentioned before, we did not deliver our full order book, the order book we had, for spring into the market to avoid exactly a similar situation. In fact, I also mentioned we do expect the second half to grow on The North Face in China, probably stronger in Q4 than Q3. So the situation normalizing.","China, I always mention China is a marathon. There will up and down, but we have great opportunities in that market. We are acting only with four brands at the moment directly and we have relatively low penetration in terms of distribution. We are engaged in the higher tiers. So there's still a long runway to cover. I'm not sure I've covered all your requests. Do you have other questions or did I give you an answer?","Erinn Murphy - Piper Jaffray","Yes, just in terms of kind of where you are seeing that inventory build. Is it really across more of the global brands that are expanding in China in the outdoor market, or is it some of the local brands that you are seeing that pressure?","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Well, it's kind of both. Everybody has an appetite to succeed in China. As you know, the market is very fragmented. There're a couple of hundreds of outdoor brands, global brands, local brands, regional brands. So it might change over time, but I would say it's coming from every side at the moment.","Operator","And we'll move along to our next question from Mitch Kummetz with Robert Baird","Mitch Kummetz - Robert Baird","A few questions. One, I just was hoping you could reconcile a few things on the sales side. I know in the quarter, going into it you were expecting sales to be up around 6.5% like the first quarter. They definitely came in better than that. So I was just kind of curious where you saw the upside. I would guess it was on the Outdoor & Action Sports side, but I think Scott also said that jeans were also a little bit better. And then two, with sales coming in better in Q2, I'm a little surprised you didn't take up the sales guidance for the year. So I was hoping you could address that. Are you just being conservative on the back half? And then three, on sales. It looks like your Outdoor & Action Sports guidance is now at the high end of 12% to 13%. I think previously you were just saying 12% to 13%. So I'm just wondering what's changed there. It didn't sound like you adjusted any of your expectations for your three main brands there.","Bob Shearer","Yeah, where we've seen the strength is primarily in Outdoor & Action Sports. I don't think that's any surprise to any of you. And those three big brands, you're absolutely right, in The North Face, Vans and Timberland, all performed really, really strongly. And in the first half, actually a little bit better than we expected. So it has been a little bit stronger. In the second quarter, it was particularly strong. And we also have a very, very strong growth plan for the second half for those businesses in total for Outdoor & Action Sports. And our plans there at this point in time are right in line with our initial plans and our initial guidance around the strength of our Outdoor & Action Sports business.","And yes, to your point, with the current trends that we're seeing, with the growth rates of the first half, it would indicate that it could be a little bit better in Outdoor & Action Sports. But we have two very big quarter ahead of us, particularly on the outdoor brands. And North Face and Timberland, as you know, are very much heavily weighted to the second half of the year. So yeah, it could be a little bit better. But I think the bottomline here is we're looking forward to a very, very strong second half, just as we saw in the first half.","And the 12% to 13%, yeah, what we're seeing is that is where the strength has been. The strength of our business clearly has been in the Outdoor & Action Sports base. And as we saw the results of the first half of the year, we have strengthened our expectations around that to the 13% level. So it does continue to strengthen somewhat.","Eric Wiseman","Yeah, Mitch, I'm just going to weigh in on this one too, because it's an interesting question, one that we've talked a lot about in the last several weeks, because clearly we have momentum. I used the word momentum early in my prepared comments, because we have it. And we have it in abundance in Outdoor & Action Sports across a whole bunch of our brands. So sitting with that momentum and that trend and the confidence we have about fall, the questions are two. How are our consumers going to shop this holiday season? And what kind of weather are we going to get? And that's why we're sticking with the guidance we have. No one knows the answers to the second two questions. But we're confident we can hit the guidance we've given for the year on the revenue basis. And as Bob said, it might be a little bit better if those two unknowns bless us with the positive positioning. But we don't know that, so we're going to stick to right to where we are for now.","Mitch Kummetz - Robert Baird","And then just a quick follow up. Eric, you mentioned 150 stores this year. Bob talked about record store openings in the fourth quarter. I'm just wondering from a square footage standpoint, I don't know if you can talk about this, but how much square footage do you think you could pick up in the fourth quarter on your stores? I mean is it somewhere in the 10% range? I'm just wondering how much of a driver of D2C growth square footage is expected to be.","Eric Wiseman","We don't look at square footage, but the only way you might think about that is we ended last year with around 1,250 stores. We expect to end this year with around 150 more. So you could do some rough math, assuming they are of the same size as average. But that's the only way I can guide you on how you might think about that.","Steve Rendle","Mitch, our overall store openings for the year will probably be maybe 30 higher on that basis versus last year. But we have such differences in the size of the stores with our individual brands, it's really hard to talk about the square footage.","Eric Wiseman","But what is different this year is about half of our openings are international. We've really got momentum in our direct-to-consumer capabilities around the world, stronger than it has ever been. Karl Heinz and his team have been working for a long time to really improve our capabilities there. And those stores tend to be a little bit smaller than domestic stores, particularly in Asia. So they're probably going to be smaller than average, half of it.","Operator","And we'll move on to our next question from Kate McShane with Citi.","Kate McShane - Citi","I had a question on The North Face and the supply chain. I know over a year ago that you had changed over two lines, I think, in some of your owned manufacturing towards The North face. I wondered if there had been any other changes made to the supply chain with regards to this brand this year and can we anticipate any change in terms of deliveries or how you are approaching retail in winter 2014?","Eric Wiseman","We saw really good results last year when we moved some of our fleece production into our jeans facilities in Central America. We saw an improvement in speed for sure, but also we were able to really see some positive product cost improvements. That success and the assurance of continued quality will continue to move those types of items into our jeans production when those lines become available, really looking to leverage the expertise and strength of our supply chain and do that very strategically where we have needs and opportunities to really drive speed for The North Face business here domestically.","Kate McShane - Citi","And then my second question was on the Lee introduction into Macy's in the fall. Can you tell us a little bit about the presentation of the brand at that retailer and how it might look different?","Scott Baxter","It certainly does. So, Kate, we took the Lee brand into Macy's and it's actually been in the department store channel for a little while with Belk and it's called Lee Platinum and it's a little bit more upscale with a little bit more decoration, some different washes, some different fabrics, a little bit high end on the fabrics. And we are expanding our store base in the department store channel right now, and it continues to go very well. We're pleased with how we're doing. We think there's really a big upside here going forward with the Lee Platinum label. And all plans are tracking on progress right now.","Kate McShane - Citi","Is there a lot of distinct fixturing associated with Lee Platinum? Can you find it in its own section or is it just amongst denim within Macy's?","Scott Baxter","It is amongst denim in Macy's and there's some distinct fixturing and some call out, but obviously we have to work with our partners on the in-store fixturing, as you know.","Operator","And we'll move along to our final question from Jim Duffy with Stifel.","Jim Duffy - Stifel","A couple questions from me, Bob, first for you. I just want to make sure I am clear on the gross margins. Was the pressure on constant currency gross margins confined to the Jeanswear and Sportswear business or is there promotional activity you are seeing across the other coalitions as well?","Bob Shearer","Are you talking about the FX impact?","Jim Duffy - Stifel","No, I am talking about constant currency gross margins. You called out some promotional activity. You also spoke to downtime in the factories. If we were looking at the P&L for the coalitions, was the gross margin pressure that you saw relative to your expectations confined to Jeanswear and Sportswear?","Bob Shearer","Right, from the standpoint of the proactive inventory adjustments and that kind of thing, it was mostly Jeanswear and some Sportswear. It's mentioned the constant currency. What I said was that half of the offset to the mix benefit was related to FX and of course it is the transaction side and the hedging activity, that kind of thing, which was isolated to the quarter. And that extended obviously pretty much throughout the international business. But yes, the remainder of the other half is mostly Jeanswear and some Sportswear.","Jim Duffy - Stifel","Second question I guess for Eric, maybe Steve relating to Vans. Momentum tremendous. What's the strategy to keep the Vans brand from overheating and perhaps being a transient fashion phenomenon?","Steve Rendle","I would tell you what I think the Vans team is the primary driver of that sustainable growth pack. They're very, very mindful about their product segmentations, the partners that they work with and how they sell in seasonal initiatives. Here in the US, which I can speak to directly, through their go-to-market process, looking at these really creative collaborations coupled with just normal seasonal product releases, they stay very on top of who they partner with, what they're selling in and really managing that growth on a long-term view.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","I mentioned that in my quote, it's very important point you touched. I think what gives us confidence, I mentioned that in China, not only the footwear growth, but also apparel and also accessories. And the same we are very careful in Europe. We had a peak and a heated situation in the UK, but we immediately managed the brand and invested in the brand in different European markets. And we see the brand now very strong in most of the European markets actually. So we're very careful and prudent.","Eric Wiseman","Jim, at the risk of piling on, Steve's comment about how thoughtful the Vans team is about making sure the quality of our growth is strong is absolutely spot on. You might be interested in knowing that most of the conversations we have about the Vans brand are about how underdeveloped we are geographically, underdeveloped on the East Coast, underdeveloped in Midwest, underdeveloped in the Southeast of this country, underdeveloped in Europe, just getting started in Asia, launched in Korea two years ago. So when we look at the future of the Vans brand, most of our discussions are about at what pace do we continue our march around the world with this brand. We see a lot of runway.","Operator","And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'll turn things back over to our speakers for any closing or additional remarks.","Eric Wiseman","Again, thanks for your time today. As many of you said, we had a really strong second quarter and I hope you understand that we're really confident about the end of this year. The back half is shaping up quite nicely and we'll all confident that we can deliver what's in our guidance and hope to see you in September. Take care.","Operator","That concludes today's conference call. We appreciate your participation."],"21554":["V.F.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Lance Allega. Please go ahead.","Lance Allega","Thank you, operator, and good morning to everyone joining us today to discuss VF's first quarter 2014 results. Before I begin, I would like to remind everyone that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.","These risks and uncertainties are detailed in documents filed regularly with the SEC. Participants may also reference non-GAAP financial measures. Where applicable, you can find presentations with comparable GAAP measures in our press release which was issued at 7 am Eastern Time and also at the vfc.com.","Joining us on today's call will be Chairman, President and CEO, Eric Wiseman; Bob Shearer, our CFO, and VF executives Scott Baxter, Steve Rendle and Karl Heinz Salzburger.","Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions and ask that you please limit your questions to two per caller. Thanks.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Eric Wiseman. Eric?","Eric Wiseman","Thanks, Lance. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. Our strong first quarter results demonstrate more than just our solid performance over the last three months. They show the value of how we build our business and how we've executed against our growth strategy during the last three years.","By consistently leveraging our powerful brand portfolio and our business platforms, we continue to create and transform the market to outperform the industry and position VF for consistent long-term growth. 2014 is off to a great start.","So let's dive right in with the top line. Total first quarter revenues were up 6.5% driven by continued strong momentum in our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition. Of note, that coalition grew at a faster rate in the first quarter and in the fourth quarter of last year with revenues up 14% versus 12%. The three largest brands; the North Face, Vans and Timberland all posted outstanding results with strong double-digit growth in each.","Our international business was up 11% and included double-digit growth in both Europe and our Asia Pacific regions. And our direct-to-consumer business grew 16% with double-digit growth in both our U.S. and our international business. Combined, this performance translated to a 130 basis point gross margin expansion lifting us to 49.4% in the quarter including improvements in all five of our coalitions.","First quarter operating margin reached 14.5%, an 80 basis point improvement over last year and our earnings per share increased 12% to $0.67. So overall, we're very pleased with the strong momentum in our business and what is setting up to be another record year for VF. And given our first quarter results, we now expect revenues to increase to the upper end of our previously guided 7% to 8% range, so nearly 8%.","Supporting this higher growth was an increase in our expectations for Outdoor & Action Sports coalition which we now expect to be 12% to 13% higher than last year's already strong results. Additionally, we now expect earnings per share of $3.06 which represents 13% growth over 2013's results. With a great start to 2014 and our outlook for the full year, we are squarely on track to achieve the goals outlined in our 2017 plan.","While the past few years have revealed many changes in the world from macroeconomic challenges to consumer trends to a changing retail environment, that dynamic operating environment has highlighted the considerable strength of VF's powerful brands and powerful platforms.","Our ability to deliver consistent, sustainable financial performance remains grounded in the cornerstones of our growth strategy; leading innovation, connecting with consumers, serving consumers directly and expanding geographically. When we deliver on each of these in concert, VF is at its best. As I look out across the balance of the year, I can say that I've never been more confident about the potential in front of us.","So with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve, Karl Heinz and Scott to take us through our five largest brands and then Bob will go through our financial results. Steve, over to you.","Steve Rendle","Thanks, Eric. Starting with the North Face, industry-leading product innovations and amplified marketing efforts continue to build on the fantastic momentum we saw at the end of 2013. In fact, not only did it carry over but it accelerated to drive 14% global revenue growth for the North Face in the first quarter.","The America's business showed great strength posting a high teen increase in revenues led by successes in both winter and spring products. Product highlights like Thermoball and our premium Steep Series line saw consistent strength over the winter season. And as we made the transition into spring, Thermoball which is engineered as a transitional-weight product remains quite strong along with the spring '14 launch of our ultra performance footwear collection and the mountain athletic training line, which are driving continued momentum and further validating our expansion into a four season brand.","Looking out towards fall '14, we continue to have great product stories from significant expansions in Thermoball styles, in the mountain athletics collection to the launch of our new Quantum outdoor training collection and the debut of FuseForm in our Steep Series line, 2014 will be one of the strongest product offerings in TNF's history. To support all this, our targeted brand level campaigns like Mountains are Calling and the Explorer have created significant social media momentum and driven the highest TNF brand equity scores we've ever posted.","In our retail stores and online, we're focused on telling big stories through curated assortment amplified by visual merchandising and superior customer service. To wrap it up, the first quarter in the Americas was a success. Inventories in both the D2C and wholesale channels are in great shape and with amazing product on deck and solid booking in hand for this coming fall, we have great confidence in our ability to deliver 12% global growth for the North Face in 2014.","Now here's Karl Heinz to run through Europe and Asia.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. In Europe, the North Face saw a low single-digit increase in revenues in the first quarter, which given a much warmer than normal winter, we consider a solid result. DTC revenues were up at the mid teen rate including more than 30% growth in online sales. So we did see some strength in a somewhat challenging market, but perhaps most importantly I have great confidence that we remain ideally positioned in the European outdoor industry.","On the product front, we continue to make significant progress on transitioning apparel to the European fit as well as greater expansion of our snow sports and activity inspired categories to better meet local demand. These are important initiatives that will help the North Face create an even greater connection with our consumers' active lifestyles.","Turning to Asia. We saw a mid teen increase in revenues during the quarter with significant DTC strength. In China, the brand was also up at the mid teen rate. We continue to build brand awareness and engage consumers and recently (indiscernible) we campaigned in China to build off the strong momentum that we gained from our advertising campaign last fall. With a solid start to the year, 2014 should see another record year for the North Face in the region.","Now let's move on to Vans.","Steve Rendle","Global revenue for Vans in the first quarter was up 20% with similar growth in both wholesale and D2C businesses, another phenomenal performance by the Vans' team and the 18th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Revenues in the Americas region were up at a low teen rate, driven by balanced strength in both our D2C and wholesale channels.","On the product front in the Americas, there are several exciting things happening in footwear including a great response in our women's business, particularly in Slip-ons in both sell-in and sell-through. Additionally in classics, we have seen great success with our collaboration product including our Beatles collection which coincided with the 50th anniversary of their appearance on Ed Sullivan.","On the technical skate front, the Gilbert Crockett Pro model has been successful elevating the brand into higher price points. We also continued to accelerate our apparel rollout with the re-launch of our women's apparel this spring. 2014 also marks the first year for Vans moving into a four season apparel model with a true summer collection.","Finally, we launched a new Vans digital platform in late March at vans.com that merges content and commerce in a new and transformative way for our consumers. We've created what is a truly comprehensive and exciting experience for consumers and we're showing both loyal fans and newcomers that they can turn to vans.com to not only connect with the brand but also to stay connected to what's happening in the skate, surf, snow, music, art and street culture. Early reads on the new format in both sales and sentiment have been nothing but positive. All-in-all, Vans Americas posted a great quarter.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","First quarter revenues for Vans Europe were up more than 20% and included D2C growth of more than 40%. As in Americas, we continue to rollout new and innovative ways to connect with consumers and are working to ensure that Vans is synonymous with the youth culture. A great example of this effort is the addition of House of Vans in London which is set to open up in August.","This location which is similar to the one many of you have been to in New York will bring youth culture together in the heart of the city and provide a unique opportunity for us to engage consumers with an intersection of action, sports, music and art. We are also in a process of redesigning the brand's website in Europe. Our European ecommerce business, although small today, represents a terrific opportunity for significant growth.","Vans Asian business grew by more than 40% in the first quarter including its China's business which more than doubled. Throughout the region we have seen great success with our collaborations including the Beatles collection which has seen significant sell-through since its launch.","Our core classic products also continued to do incredibly well in this region. In addition to launching the Living off the Wall brand campaign, we also officially opened the first indoor skate park in Korea which given we have only been in the country for a little more than a year, represents an incredible opportunity to connect with consumers. Globally, a great start to 2014 and we're on track to deliver a mid teen increase in revenues for the full year.","With that, let's move on to Timberland.","Steve Rendle","Carrying the theme forward, Timberland also saw great momentum in the first quarter. Global revenues were up 12% and included balanced strength across channels and geographies. So what's working? Pretty much everything. In fact, based on our strong first quarter results we now expect Timberland to grow 12% in 2014 versus the 10% we discussed in February.","In the Americas, revenues were up at a high teen percentage rate driven primarily by our wholesale business. Sales of core Timberland men's and kids boot styles as well as our hiking boots almost doubled versus last year. And our Pro line continues to be a game changer in the marketplace led by the Direct Attach collection.","Four of our top six Timberland product families are now built on the anti-fatigue platform. And we also rolled out our spring collection of apparel during the first quarter and it's off to a very good start. In the first quarter, we also launched the new Bradstreet collection with the SensorFlex technology. Originally inspired by the technologies for trail running, this platform infuses a new level of comfort and shock absorption that we plan to expand across many of our casual products.","To support the launch, we activated TV ads and retail merchandising displays to communicate a message of comfort and versatility and it's a global effort with more than 1,000 windows that encourage consumers to come in-store to learn more about the innovation. Our efforts are definitely paying off as customers are responding really well to this new product. Overall, we are feeling great about the Timberland business.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Timberland's revenues in Europe were up at the high single-digit rate, an indicator of what we anticipate being a consistent growth story throughout the year. We also saw a strong launch for the new Bradstreet collection featuring SensorFlex technology and in particular we saw strong results from our classic footwear for women where we introduced a line of new casual transitional products.","Similar to Vans, we see ecommerce as a huge opportunity. Hitting off the existing success in the UK market, Timberland is now live in three new countries; France, Germany and Italy. In Asia, first quarter revenues were up at low double-digit rate, including positive results across all our areas of business driven by strength in our classic boot in the both man's and woman's.","Men's apparel performed well during the quarter driven by outerwear as consumers responded well to the new materials and silhouettes that we rolled out. Woman's apparel also saw an increase driven by outerwear, in particular lifestyle waterproof jacket. Consistent with the North Face and Vans, we are very happy with the momentum of the Timberland brand and really proud of the way the team continues to execute against our long-term growth targets.","Now, I'll turn it over to Scott to take a look at Jeanswear. ","Scott Baxter","Thank you, Karl Heinz. Globally, revenues for the Wrangler brand were down 2% and revenues for Lee were down 1% in the quarter. The Jeanswear Americas business was down at a high single-digit percentage rate due to ongoing challenges in the U.S. mid-tier department store channel and to a lesser extent, consumer trends in women's denim. These challenges resulted in a lower single-digit decline for Wrangler in the Americas region and a high single-digit decline for the Lee brand.","Of the high single-digit decline in the Jeanswear Americas business, roughly half of the decrease was due to a combination of a decline in the Rock & Republic brand as we worked to realign styles to meet consumer preferences and the exit of a lower profit private label business. That said, our results were consistent with what we expected. We're on track for our full year expectation of low single-digit growth. That implies acceleration in the Jeanswear Americas business in the second half of 2014.","So given the environment, why the optimism? Product innovation, expanded distribution and focused integrated marketing campaigns. Let's walk through these drivers and I think you'll better understand what gives us confidence that we'll finish strong in the second half of the year. First, as I just mentioned, we're launching innovative new products focused on comfort which is what we know our consumers want.","In Wrangler, you'll see the introduction of new products in our advanced comfort line and for the younger Western consumer, we'll be launching Rock 47. To address current trends in Lee's mass business, we plan to launch Heavenly Touch and in our mid tier business Easy Fit, both of which have stretched fabrication that combines the comfort of leggings with the structural benefits of denim. Mid tier will also see the launch of modern series Curvy Fit, a new line that features figure-enhancing contoured waist.","Second, we're expanding our distribution to give more consumers greater access to our brands. Wrangler is moving more significantly into the mid-tier including JC Penney where we've already had a very successful test over the past few months. For Lee we will see additional door expansion into the department store channel including Macy's and Bon-Ton.","Finally, we're connecting even better with our consumers. As you know, marketing science is a key asset VF offers its brands and our findings have been extremely valuable in sharpening our storytelling. We're starting to see great traction from these efforts including response to campaigns for advanced comfort which continues to resonate quite well with the consumers in the mass channel, and heightened visibility for Lee's modern series which successfully launched last fall. We've also upped our investment in Lee's point-of-sale which is currently rolling up to 2,000 doors across the U.S.","Another great example of how we're connecting with consumers is our Wrangler network, which started live streaming PRCA rodeos in country music concerts, an effort that continues to be the cultural echo system with Wrangler at the center. The second quarter will remain challenging for the Jeanswear coalition but we're confident that that will return to growth in the second half of the year.","Now back to Karl Heinz to discuss Jeanswear international businesses.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Our international Jeanswear business performed really well in the first quarter. In Europe revenues were up at high single-digit percentage rate including strong growth in both the Wrangler and Lee business. And sales in Asia were up at low double-digit. Across both regions, key accounts and consumers alike have responded well to the continued evolution of our collections. We look forward to 2014 being one of the strongest years for our Jeanswear business in quite a few years.","We remain focused on creating and marketing our innovative products in ways that form an stronger connection with consumers. In Europe, Wrangler has had success with its denim performance product. The Lee brand continues to see great strength with its stretch deluxe line for women and its blue label collection for men which features superior fabrics and comfort at competitive price points.","In Asia, Lee returned to strong growth in the first quarter. We saw great performance from lines like our 101 plus collection which is a contemporary premium interpretation of our heritage denim offering. This line is seeing great consumer response and sell-throughs in both China and Hong Kong.","Now Bob will take you through our financial highlights.","Bob Shearer","Thanks, Karl Heinz. Our first quarter is a great example of why VF's business model is successful in delivering consistent, profitable growth and meaningful returns to shareholders with diversity across products, brands and consumers, across channels, geographies and our supply chain, our unique competitive strengths have us well positioned to deliver yet another record year for VF.","In fact, based on first quarter results, I'm happy to report that we're raising our full year revenue and earnings per share guidance but more on that a little later. Let's take a look at how we did. VF revenues were up 6.5% led by our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition with 14% revenue growth, which as Eric pointed out is even higher than the strong 12% growth we posted in the fourth quarter.","Our international and direct-to-consumer businesses also showed strong gains with revenue growth of 11% and 16%, respectively. Gross margin was a great story as well reaching 49.4% in the quarter, an all-time record for any quarter in VF's history. This marks a 130 basis point improvement over last year. Of this improvement, about 90 basis points was due to mix.","In other words, strongest growth in our highest margin businesses and about 30 basis points was due to the previously disclosed reclassification of retail concession fees. Also, great to notice is the fact that despite some headwinds in a few parts of our business, all five coalitions saw gross margin improvement in the first quarter.","Now, I know you're probably questioning how after a 130 basis point improvement in the first quarter, we're holding our outlook to 49% for the full year. The answer is that as we look forward, we see some foreign currency headwinds and that's especially in the second quarter. In addition, the mix benefit was particularly magnified in the first quarter given the strength of Outdoor & Action Sports relative to other businesses.","SG&A as a percent of revenues rose by 50 basis points. However, the increase was driven primarily by that same reclassification of retail concession fees. Excluding that, SG&A was relatively flat year-over-year even though we continued to invest heavily in our D2C business and marketing. Obviously this implies that we're successfully getting meaningful leverage elsewhere in our expense structure.","And that's just how we think about our model. We invest heavily against our highest growth and most profitable brands and businesses supported by marketing science which drives our top line creating leverage elsewhere in our expense structure, and the result continuous improvement in our operating margin. At end of first quarter, operating margin improved 80 basis points to 14.5% all of which brings us to earnings per share of $0.67 which was up 12% over last year.","Now I'll make a few comments on our coalition results for the first quarter. Revenues for Outdoor & Action Sports coalition were up 14% with high teen percentage growth in our direct-to-consumer business and low double-digit growth in wholesale sales, really hitting on all cylinders here; the North Face, Vans and Timberland were up 14%, 20% and 12%, respectively. And needless to say, we couldn't be more pleased with the continued strength and momentum of these powerful brands and the entire coalition. And of course, a 21% increase in operating income in the quarter with an improvement in operating margin of 100 basis points to 17.4%, well, that's not too bad either.","Turning to Jeanswear, first quarter results were in line with what we expected with revenues down 4% due to ongoing pressure in the U.S. mid-tier channel, challenging consumer trends in women's denim and the exit of a lower profit business. That said, revenues outside of the U.S. which was a third of the business in the quarter were up at a mid-single-digit rate with particular strength in Europe and Asia. We do expect Jeanswear to post similar results in the second quarter, however, accelerate meaningfully in the second half of the year, driven by great new product innovations and channel expansion.","For the full year, we continue to expect low single-digit growth for this highly profitable coalition. Our Imagewear group had a solid first quarter with 4% revenue growth driven in large part by our licensed sports business. We saw great success from strong NFL postseason sales. First quarter operating margin was up a healthy 180 basis points reaching 14.3%, driven by gross margin improvement and SG&A leverage.","During the quarter, we decided to exit the youth business for Major League Baseball which hit our top line rate by 4 percentage points, however, sets us up for better profitability in the long run. Our sportswear business grew 3% in a somewhat challenging retail environment. Nautica revenues were flat impacted by the timing of special programs. Reflecting this shift, second quarter revenues for Nautica should grow at a low double-digit rate. Kipling's North American revenue was up at a high teen percentage rate with greater than 20% D2C growth. Globally, the Kipling brand grew 23%. Sportswear's profitability was up slightly with last year's same quarter.","Revenue on our Contemporary Brands business declined 5% in the first quarter with a high single-digit decline in North American revenues offset by a high single-digit increase in Europe. Globally, the coalitions D2C business was up at a low teen rate but this was offset by a similar rate decline in the wholesale business, which continues to experience challenging demand for premium denim. Lower volume caused operating margin to decline to 8%.","Similar to Imagewear, we decided to move a portion of this coalitions youth business towards a licensed model. This decision negatively impacted the revenue results by 3 percentage points in the quarter. VF's balance sheet remains very healthy. At the end of the quarter, inventories were up 7% compared with March 2013 levels including 2 percentage points related to higher costs and changes in foreign currency.","During the quarter, we bought 9.1 million shares of VF stock for approximately $553 million and in the second quarter, we purchased an additional 2.9 million shares for $173 million to conclude the share buyback program that we spoke about in February. No additional share repurchases in 2014 are anticipated at this time.","Now turning to our outlook for the full year, we now expect annual revenues to increase at the upper end of the 7% to 8% range we gave you in February, so close to 8% which is in line with the organic growth of our 2017 plan. Driving the increase is across-the-board strength within our Outdoor & Action Sports brands including the momentum in our Timberland business that Steve mentioned earlier. We now expect revenues in Outdoor & Action Sports to be up 12% to 13%.","Our gross margin and operating margin expectations remain unchanged at 49% and 15%, respectively. With SG&A, as in the past, we will continue to look opportunistically for areas to make targeted investments in our brands, products and marketing to drive future growth. We now expect earnings per share to rise to approximately $3.06 per share representing 13% growth over 2013.","In terms of the second quarter, we anticipate revenues to increase at a similar rate to that of the first quarter and again be driven primarily by continued strength from our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition.","So to wrap things up, I'm really excited about 2014. It's a year that presents terrific opportunities for us to increase competitive separation, further optimize our profitability and create long-term value for our shareholders. So with a great first quarter in the books, we're very pleased by the underlying strength of our business and look forward to successfully executing against our growth strategies in 2014 and beyond.","With that, I turn it back to the operator and we can open up the line for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). We'll take our first question from Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS","Congrats on a great quarter and a tough market there.","Eric Wiseman","Thanks, Michael.","Michael Binetti - UBS","Bob, if I could, just a little bit housecleaning. First of all, your comments on SG&A that we'll look opportunistically for investments in the brand. Obviously, you give a little confidence in your revenue outlook for the year, but should we interpret that as if the revenues do track in at or above the range that you've given that you would try to dial back some SG&A into investments that might offset some of the upside in EPS for the year?","Bob Shearer","Really the way to think about that, Michael, is \u2013 what we've been doing is we've been making those investments pretty consistently over the past couple of years. Last year we increased our marketing spend by about $100 million and this year we're looking to increase by another $50 million. And the reality is it's working for us. It's driving the top line. We had a strong fourth quarter last year and we're seeing a lot of momentum, particularly in our Outdoor & Action Sports business here in the first quarter and we absolutely believe that those investments are part of that. So, the idea is that we would look to do the same. We're absolutely committed to our long-term targets and the 13% that we mentioned. And when we have the opportunity to make some of those investments both to help us on a shorter term basis, but especially on a long-term basis, that's what we'll do. So, again, the point is it's been working for us. And yes, we will look to do the same thing in those highest margin, fastest growing businesses.","Michael Binetti - UBS","Okay. And then a quick follow-up on \u2013 a little bit more on two things in the Jeanswear commentary. First off, the low margin business that you mentioned you exited, any more detail you could give us on that? And then more importantly, can we hear a little bit about the \u2013 you mentioned I think a new platform launch in the second half that kind of supports your guidance for a pretty meaningful acceleration in the growth rate there?","Steve Rendle","Yes, I think it's a couple of things. Let me take the platform first, Michael, since that's the most important one. I think the confidence really is around expanded distribution, so you know we're taking the Wrangler brand up into the mid-tier and we're taking Lee brand up in the department store channel. But in addition to that, we've got some really innovative products that are hitting the marketplace and that's Heavenly Touch and that's Easy Fit, both products that play into this new trend that we've seen in the marketplace. But what's important about that too is it's not just new products into that trend, its new products into the Jeanswear business also with our Rock 47 which is a big initiative for us for the younger Western consumer. So things like that that also play into our core categories in our business. But also, as you think about that, we've got some really strong integrated marketing campaigns and programs that are coming from POS in the stores to broader marketing programs that nearly support not only our core business but also support the initiatives that we have going forward. So that gives us great confidence in the second half. The first part of your question was it was a lower profit business that we made the decision to exit because it didn't fit our core and it wasn't what we did best, and we want to focus on the things that we do best and we want to focus on our brands.","Michael Binetti - UBS","Okay. Eric, any comments on the acquisition environment out there? Thanks a lot.","Eric Wiseman","No, Michael, no comments on the acquisition front. I will add to Bob's comments about the investment and just kind of go through how we think about it. And Michael you remember last year. We only grew organically 5% and that was disappointing to us and we invested $40 million in the fourth quarter to try to accelerate our growth rate to the 8% target we have in our long-range plan. And as Bob said, that seems to be working. So the way I think about that investment is if we make incremental investments \u2013 we will make incremental investments that deliver the results we promised in our 2017 plan, and we'll continue to make those investments to make sure that we deliver the 8% organically on the top line and 13% on the bottom line. And that's why we did it last year. Our growth rate was below what we planned. We wanted to get back on track to close to 8% and that's where we are.","Michael Binetti - UBS","Thanks again, guys.","Operator","We'll go next to Bob Drbul with Nomura.","Bob Drbul - Nomura Securities","Hi. Good morning.","Eric Wiseman","Hi, Bob.","Bob Drbul - Nomura Securities","I guess the first question is with the quarter ending in March and Easter, can you just give us \u2013 you have usually a very broad read across retail with the portfolio. Can you just walk us through how it impacted the business and sort of how it materialized when Easter happened and just sort of how you feel about the business at this point in time with Easter now behind us?","Eric Wiseman","Sure. I guess the easiest way for me to talk about that, Bob, is in our direct-to-consumer business where we like, everybody else, saw the impact of an Easter shift. And it was obviously a North American event, was significant in China. And our direct-to-consumer business for the quarter was up 16% and that included mid-single-digit comp store growth which we're thrilled with. We think mid-single-digit growth given all the days that stores were closed and the Easter shift is really strong. So we're confident in our direct-to-consumer business.","Bob Drbul - Nomura Securities","And Bob \u2013 thanks, Eric \u2013 on the share repurchase program, is that the way that we should think about how you'll approach it going forward as well, just go heavy in the first quarter like you did and just maybe give us an update in terms of the approach that you've taken with that?","Bob Shearer","Yes, Bob, we have been pretty consistent in that. So when we're looking to buy back some shares, we've done that and got in done pretty much in the first quarter. We haven't changed our perspective in term of our buyback. We still look at it as primarily a means of offsetting the dilutive impact of option exercises. In a year like this we got a little bit ahead of that. Our option exercises \u2013 the buyback will outweigh the option exercises this year. But yes, generally the timing is pretty consistent. We've demonstrated that over a number of years and again no change in our strategy related to our buyback program.","Bob Drbul - Nomura Securities","Okay. Thank you very much.","Eric Wiseman","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","We'll go next to Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew Boss - JPMorgan","Guys, congrats on a good quarter. Eric, can you talk about in general what you're seeing from the consumer today, drivers of the top line confidence here? I mean it's definitely one of the rarities out there. Any visibility you can speak to in fall orders I think would be really helpful?","Eric Wiseman","Sure. The North American consumer is in general struggling we think. I mean they're really resilient. They keep fighting back but it is not easy out there. If you look at the first quarter that we just went through, particularly in the mid-tier and mass channel where people have less discretionary income, they were challenged with higher heating bills and healthcare costs, a lot of things came at them that affected their discretionary income and it showed up there. Where we had great growth was in our direct-to-consumer business worldwide, but we're at a different price level than what a mid-tier and mass is those stores and we did really well. We also know that while consumer spending was tough to find, if you had amazing products supported by impactful marketing, you could win. And one of the reasons we invested so heavily in the fourth quarter behind our brands was we knew we had the right products that consumers would want. We wanted to make sure that they knew that and we really dialed up the marketing in the fourth quarter and that momentum carried forward into the first quarter this year and we're pretty happy with 6.5% organic growth.","Matthew Boss - JPMorgan","Absolutely. So as you look forward in terms of orders, are you seeing your retail partners buy the brands to stock on the shelves that are driving the organic traffic? I'm curious what you're seeing as you see the orders coming in?","Eric Wiseman","Sure. The objective that \u2013 we don't disclose our forward order book, but obviously if we're sitting at 6.5% and guiding to close to 8% for the full year with the biggest part of the year coming at us, that sends the message that our marketing was effective, our products sold through and as Steve commented, our product line up coming in the fall in Vans, Timberland and in North Face in particular. Scott talked about our jeans business. We think we have a great product line up for fall and we've got orders to support us giving an increase in our revenue guidance for the year.","Matthew Boss - JPMorgan","Great. And then last question on Timberland. We've clearly seen the top line inflect here last couple of quarters. Can you talk globally about where do you see the biggest opportunity going forward and from a margin perspective, where do you stand kind of versus that mid-teens goal?","Eric Wiseman","So I'm going to pass that over to Steve and Karl Heinz for comment on.","Steve Rendle","So real quick on the Americas business, we're just seeing really strong growth across all of our regions; Canada, U.S., Mexico, all channels and all categories. And it's very much a broad brand momentum. Historically, you've seen Timberland surge in single items or categories. The brand heat that building around Timberland, we give a lot of credit to the work we've done with our end consumer, really understanding who they are, how to connect with them and how that's influenced our product. The product creation component of this brand has been dramatically elevated. You see that at retail today. How we're able to market to and speak with our consumer and connect with them at retail has really been dramatically improved. And as we continue to drive better product at full price through our retail channels, we're seeing strong growth in our gross margins and our ability to really have the dollars to invest behind this brand.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Matthew, just to add a few color in Europe, you heard me saying last quarter we started to grow. We had a solid growth in this one and it's an indicator that we're looking forward to a good year. We had a lot of work to do in the last year with Timberland. We moved it. It's all set now. We have a strong team in place. It's all working basically. Asia is good also. It had been consistently growing since the acquisition double digit. It's strong in Japan, but we have a great opportunity in China where we basically just started and it's one of our smaller brands in China. So it's a long way to go there.","Bob Shearer","And related to the margin question, we are right on track with our acquisition plan in terms of moving toward that mid-teen percentage that we committed to initially when we acquired the brand. So, I'm seeing nice progress and it's right on track with where we expect to be.","Matthew Boss - JPMorgan","Great. Best of luck, guys.","Eric Wiseman","Thanks, Matthew.","Operator","We'll go next to Kate McShane with Citi.","Kate McShane - Citigroup","Thanks. Good morning.","Eric Wiseman","Hi, Kate.","Kate McShane - Citigroup","Bob, I wanted to ask you with regards to gross margin. Are you currently ahead of where you thought you would be on gross margins at this point in time when you gave your targets in June? And how should we think about the cadence of gross margin for the rest of the year given from the FX headwinds and the strength of Q1?","Bob Shearer","Kate, we're on track with what we expected. We did expect the first quarter to be a little stronger than the overall year guiding to the 90 basis point expansion. In terms of looking out at the last three quarters, as I said in my commentary, a little pressure on the FX side in the second quarter. So we'll likely be a little below the 90 basis point improvement but nice solid improvement in our gross margin. Third quarter should be pretty close to the 90 basis point and then fourth quarter, as you can imagine with the inclusion of the stronger D2C we'll be a little bit above that. So, yes, we're tracking very, very close to what we expected and are really confident in the 90 basis point expansion for the year.","Kate McShane - Citigroup","That's helpful. Thank you. And then my next question is for Karl Heinz with the overall environment in Europe. If you could talk on a comp basis, because I know you have a lot of white space potential and incremental growth in Europe as well, but on a comp basis where have you seen the most improvement in your business? And what region or country has surprised you most to the upside and what area is still struggling?","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Kate, thanks for this question. We announced a good quarter in Europe and it's widely reported the economic situation and we can't do a lot there. It's not the best. But I guess the good news is, and this is the strength of our portfolio, most of the brand, also the brands which we normally don't report, the smaller ones like Kipling or Napa or Reef, they're doing really well. They are all growing. And actually what we see especially in Southern Europe is coming back strongly. Italy is a big market for us. It's the largest market for Timberland. It's really doing well. So, we're happy with that. I would say we play out the strength of our portfolio, a lot of things are doing well and we look forward to a good quarter and a good year actually.","Kate McShane - Citigroup","Thank you.","Eric Wiseman","Thanks, Kate.","Operator","We'll go next to Omar Saad with ISI Group.","Omar Saad - ISI Group","Thank you. Good morning.","Eric Wiseman","Good morning, Omar.","Omar Saad - ISI Group","Eric, first question for you. Your Actions Sports & Outdoor segment obviously has been phenomenal. You've done a lot of great acquisitions there. There's almost a megatrend going on with active healthy living, active lifestyle. But there's many different segments to this whole phenomenon. Obviously you've got a lot of them covered in your portfolio. Could you talk about, I don't know, Actions Sports versus Outdoor sub-segments within it where you see the most attractive kind of opportunity from an industry standpoint where the trends are going? Maybe some areas where you're not as actively involved? Maybe the athletic part of it, the world there, maybe you feel like some of your existing brand assets you could use to go after the athletic segment or maybe you want to bring in more assets for that? Just think on the broader perspective around that whole segment given how much success you've had and it looks like the trend was going to continue structurally? Thanks.","Eric Wiseman","Sure, Omar. Action Sports for us is defined by Vans and Reef with Vans being by far the biggest piece of that business for us, and as we reported not only our fastest growing coalition in the quarter where we up 20% but Vans was our biggest brand in the quarter. So Vans was VF's number one revenue brand in the quarter. So that is a big business for us and it's kind of zeroing on the $2 billion mark here pretty quickly. So, we are really important in that space and the opportunity for us there and was mentioned during some of the comments is our footwear business and that was a footwear brand that we're taking to apparel and we're doing a better and better job of taking it to both men's and women's apparel going to a four season calendar and getting some growth there. The Outdoor coalition is defined by the two big brands really, the North Face and Timberland, which reported growth of 14% and 12%, respectively, in the quarter. So those three big brands are really, really pulling more than their share. They're doing really, really well. The athletics space is a space that we operate in the fringe on. Does the North Face have athletic styles? Yes. The Mountain Athletics program, the new ultra kilowatt line, all of that is geared towards training not towards team sports but towards training and fitness, and that is an emerging trend. And between the North Face getting into that space and Lucy being into that space for her and Lucy had a solid quarter. It had double-digit growth in the first quarter. We think we have the opportunity to do more in that space. Omar, does that address your question.","Omar Saad - ISI Group","Yes. No, I mean just\u2026","Eric Wiseman","If not, we'll turn it over to Bob.","Omar Saad - ISI Group","Of course, Bob, if you have anything to add. But there are just so many opportunities and it's such a secularly growing segment, and there's so many other brands out there having success and it doesn't seem like it's going to end anytime soon. It's become such a big part of your business. It can become really intricate how you think about the different elements within it and what assets you have to use to go after it, and assets maybe you want to bring in, in the future.","Eric Wiseman","Yes, and to the point Karl Heinz touched on is one of our strengths in Outdoor & Action Sports in the quarter was it wasn't just those big three brands I mentioned growing. We had momentum in pretty much every space we were in from Smartwool to Lucy to Napapijri. I mean we had a good quarter in that space.","Omar Saad - ISI Group","All right. One quick follow-up, maybe Bob to an extent. On ASPs we do seem to be seeing industry-wide some premiumization trend or at least a barbell effect in those brands that can generate a higher price point, higher quality, more innovative product. Are you guys seeing that in your businesses or within some of the brands within your businesses?","Bob Shearer","Average selling price is the question. I'm just looking at some of the other folks here in the room as well. Number one, our pricing is up just a little bit and I don't think that's exactly what you're getting at but our pricing is up a little bit and relative to average prices that we're seeing across the board. I might ask Steve to comment in terms of what you're seeing in his business.","Steve Rendle","Sure. Outdoor & Action Sports businesses, we've seen \u2013 our average selling price in our own stores move up incrementally and where we're able to do that is where we're adding greater value from a technology, fit function and form. But also as we're able to really drive home that emotional marketing message that links back to the product and how we move our consumers through the funnel and we saw great results of that starting last \u2013 in fourth quarter for the North Face and really carried through the momentum that we saw coming into first quarter. And we used those learnings across all of our brands within this portfolio to drive that.","Bob Shearer","I guess what I'd say there, Omar, as well is what we are seeing is consumers are paying for innovation. I think that's what Steve is saying as well. We're seeing that consistently and that's why we think our innovation platform is so important for us.","Omar Saad - ISI Group","Thanks.","Steve Rendle","And that's true for Vans and Timberland as well. I was probably remiss in not mentioning that. Some of the products that we're seeing move through Vans today as we bring in cushioning technology, durability materials into these skate shoes, we're getting a lot of credit for that and we're able to ask for a higher price and capture that all the way through the channel and clearly at Timberland as we've elevated the product. We're seeing starting with the yellow boot all the way through our footwear collection driving full price retail sell-through across not only our own channels but our wholesale partner channels.","Omar Saad - ISI Group","Got you. Thanks, guys.","Eric Wiseman","Thanks, Omar.","Operator","We'll go next to Dave Weiner with Deutsche Bank.","Dave Weiner - Deutsche Bank","Good morning. Dave Weiner. How are you? So I wanted to drill down a little bit or expand a little on gross margin. Clearly you still have mix shifts, the ability to grow gross margin through mix shifts, coalition, geography and channel. But I guess could you talk longer term, maybe the opportunity to \u2013 what other drivers can be used to drive gross margin? I'm thinking specifically, I think you have an initiative in place to switch X percentage of your or migrate X percentage of your production of product from sourcing to manufacturing. Maybe an update on how that's coming along and kind of what \u2013 are you getting more technical product in that bucket? And kind of what implications that could have for gross margin? Thanks.","Eric Wiseman","Yes. So just to I guess confirm what you were saying is relative to the mix shift, as we look out over the next five years and just as we spoke about when we presented our 2017 plan that mix improvement, the mix leverage will continue without a doubt. So we're very, very consistently seeing that 60 to 70 basis points pretty much every quarter and every year and that's exactly what we expect to see over the period. On top of that we continue to manufacture a greater percentage of our own goods in our plants much, much more so than any of our competition and a lot of that is in our Jeanswear business and we produce a pair of jeans at a lower cost and is available anywhere in the globe. And we're looking at new innovative ways to see even further benefits, I guess, from the capabilities that we have from a manufacturing standpoint. So, building stronger partnerships with people outside of our existing space in terms of where we manufacturer goods today is part of our story. So, the idea is leverage the skill set that we have that can't be matched by anyone else in the industry from a manufacturing standpoint and leverage that skill set and lower cost that is available by others.","Dave Weiner - Deutsche Bank","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Erinn Murphy - Piper Jaffray","Great. Thank you. Good morning. I guess Karl Heinz, just for you, a follow-up on the Italian comments you made. You talked about it doing a little bit better. I guess my understanding just broadly in Italy is that the pressure over the last several years has really just been this continued culling away of the independent channels and multi-branded retailers, they've continue to shutter their doors. I guess are you guys seeing some stabilization in the wholesale channel as well or at this point is it really just improvements in the direct-to-consumer piece of that business?","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Thank you, Erinn. I think it's both. We have a pretty strong component of partnership stores primarily with Timberland. We have more than 100 stores, so that is one component. We also see the overall economy is doing a little bit better, which is good and we also see the larger customers having stabilized (indiscernible) and all the guys you know. So, Italy is a very fragmented market as you know, but for sure we have seen a stabilization there and the outlook I think is better than it used to be last year. But again, it's a market where we have very strong partnership stores, especially on Timberland and they clearly help us.","Erinn Murphy - Piper Jaffray","Thank you. That's really helpful actually Karl Heinz. And then I guess on the North Face overall, Q1 versus Q4, really good incremental improvement there as well. Just from a product perspective, if you guys could just reflect on what's driving some of that incremental strength in the first quarter? Thanks.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Is this question in Europe or in general?","Erinn Murphy - Piper Jaffray","Sorry, in general actually for the entire line.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Well, I think Steve mentioned it well. They have a lot of new stuff happening and new products primarily. This is a product industry, as you know, and we came out with a lot of innovation and it's paying off. Thermoball is one example, we mentioned that clearly and that's where our strategy is also going forward. Consumers are looking and paying for innovation.","Steve Rendle","I can build on that a little bit. I think if you were to look at it from a four season basis or first half\/second half, we had a really significant launch with Thermoball last fall. The emotional marketing with the singular focus against that initiative driving consumer through that funnel to conversion was a very powerful campaign. We brought that into spring with the launch of our ultra performance footwear as well as our Mountain Athletic training apparel, while also continuing to support Thermoball as it really is a three season jacket, a transitional weight, but the only question around the fitness trend \u2013 North Face has significant permission to move into this athletic space but we're doing it in a very authentic way where we're using Mountain Athletics as an apparel collection and coupling it with training seminars or workouts; San Francisco, Washington D.C. are great examples where we had these Train Smarter outdoor training events where we were able to bring consumers to train with our athletes and begin to tailor programs for the support that the North Face builds products for. So definitely looking to expand technical collections based on our consumers needs and really link it with emotional marketing and that pull through push through retail.","Erinn Murphy - Piper Jaffray","Thank you and congratulations.","Eric Wiseman","Thanks, Erinn.","Operator","We'll go next to Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group","Good morning, everyone, and congratulations. As you think about the product costs and obviously pricing, what are you seeing in terms of product cost? Is it different in terms of region or different in terms of product category? And then on Southern Europe coming back, is that from locals, from tourists? Are you seeing it in wholesale, retail? Thank you and congratulations.","Eric Wiseman","Thanks, Dana. I'll start on the cost side. Really not a lot of movement in costs overall for the year. We came into the year expecting a little bit more and that's been a little better situation than we first thought. So what we're seeing from a cost side is the number would be about a half a point of cost increase overall for our business and that's been offset by little pricing. So, pricing net of cost is neutral for us in 2014.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","The second comment, it's actually very consistent. We see it in our future orders which are nicely up. We see it in our retail trends. We see it in our partnership stores and overall, as I mentioned before, the overall economy is for sure improving this market. I would add also the strength of our portfolio is for sure helping us. Customers are looking to reliable vendors with strong initiative and for sure we are one of those.","Dana Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group","Thank you.","Eric Wiseman","Thanks, Dana.","Operator","We'll go next to Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Eric Wiseman","Good morning.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs","I have a question just on Jeanswear. Scott, I was hoping you could give a little more detail on the channel expansion, so maybe more specifics on where you're rolling into, how much incremental square footage that adds to your distribution or sort of how incremental you think it could be for sales? And then the sequence you've got, is it really a Q3 event or is this something where we get an initial start in Q3 and there is more expansion to be had as we move across the next several quarters? Thanks.","Scott Baxter","Sure. You bet. So let's start with the beginning, let's start with mid-tier. We have the Wrangler brand, as you know, has been very strong in the mass channel for many years and also in the Western channel. The brand has gained a lot of strength in the last few years relative to the health of the brand and how people work with the brand and how people lived a lifestyle with the brand. And as these channels merge a little bit closer together, we saw a real opportunity to bring that brand to the mid-tier, to bring it to that mid-tier American consumer and that's going to start really strong probably fourth quarter, first half of next year but the testing has already been done in the first half of this year and we really like what we see and we really like the response that we've gotten from that consumer. So that's a big channel. There are really big consumers in that channel, really big customers in that channel, so we feel like that's a really good thing going forward for the Wrangler brand and it's pretty new for the brand and a lot of opportunity going forward. From a Lee perspective, the Lee brand has the permission to go to a channel a little bit higher and that being the department store channel. What we haven't talked enough about and probably spend enough time talking about is the fact that Lee has actually been at the department store channel for many years with a couple of customers and has full distribution at one large department store channel. And with that we've really expanded that to the other big department store players in the country and has had great traction on Lee female. So, obviously, as we continue to have really good traction on Lee female, we're going to think more broadly about male too and we think that that's going to gain really good traction in addition to what we already have in the second half of this year, so you'll see more traction there in the second half and then we'll expand it to male in '15 going forward. So, all-in-all, there's a lot of opportunity for both brands to expand and grow.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs","And then could you guys help us quantify maybe how incremental that might be to sales for you over the second half?","Scott Baxter","That's kind of hard to do right now over the second half, but as the year progress I think that will be an opportunity for us to discuss that going forward.","Eric Wiseman","But it's clearly a factor that as we indicated, we expect our acceleration in our Jeanswear business, the numbers in the second half and it's clearly a factor.","Scott Baxter","We baked into the plan going forward.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs","Thanks a lot.","Eric Wiseman","Thanks, Lindsay.","Operator","We'll go next to Barbara Wyckoff with CLSA Americas.","Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA Financial Services","Hi, everybody. Good quarter. Of the brands in your existing portfolio, outside of the top five big ones, are there any that could be accelerated to add more scale, like Kipling, Lucy, Napapijri, how would you do that? And if so, how would you do that?","Scott Baxter","Yes, yes and yes to those three brands. In fact we have active initiatives underway in all of those brands to be amongst the size that our current big plans are. Particularly around Kipling where we've been working for quite a while on a growth program there, Kipling was a very small business when we bought it. It is not a very small business anymore. Last year it was VF's fastest growing brand for the year and grew with our fastest growing brand in three of the four quarters of last year. So, it has terrific momentum. Nautica for the last 24 months has had terrific momentum. Napapijri has great momentum. So each of our brands is part of our growth strategy and we're investing in all of them to achieve what they believe their potential is, different programs.","Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA Financial Services","Okay, great. Thanks. And then could you share any kind of market share information you might have, U.S., Europe, Asia for Outdoor & Action Sports and Jeans?","Eric Wiseman","We really don't have that information in Outdoor & Action Sports because the categories are so broadly defined, it's hard to look at them when we look at apparel versus equipment versus footwear, we don't really have that information.","Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA Financial Services","And Jeanswear?","Scott Baxter","Very similar. It's hard to define exactly from a category standpoint.","Barbara Wyckoff - CLSA Financial Services","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Eric Wiseman","Thanks, Barbara.","Operator","We'll go next to Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robby Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Eric Wiseman","Hi, Robby.","Robby Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, Eric. How are you? I just had a follow-up on China. Could you guys talk about maybe what the overall environment looks? It's pretty incredible, the growth you guys are doing. Is the Chinese consumer sort of reaccelerating again? Others in other categories, they've had more problems, I'd say, over the last 12 months over there or more. And then may be just a shorter follow-up. The 100% growth in Vans, can you help us think about what the sort of annual growth rate for Vans should be? Can you do 100% for the year over there or how long can you maintain that growth? Thanks.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Thank you. Let me start with the last piece, doing 100% every quarter I think is hard. Having said that, I always give the same answer. China is a great long-term opportunity for us, it's like a marathon and we do well every quarter. I want to remind you we are actually in China with primarily four brands that we're investing at the moment directly and have very long \u2013 big opportunities in terms of penetration. Our total door count is, all four combined, 2,500 doors which is still very, very low. So I guess the opportunities going forward is long term. We only have operated four brands at the time. We have opportunities in penetration. And specifically Vans you mentioned, clearly 100% is hard to achieve but Vans is a fast growing brand. It resonates well with consumers. It's one of the top four and it's for sure a big, big opportunity for us in China.","Eric Wiseman","Robby, to add some perspective, two weeks ago yesterday, Karl Heinz and I were in China opening an 850,000 square foot distribution center that we just built for over $60 million about an hour outside of Shanghai. So, we are committed to China. We see enormous potential there. Across our portfolio we're focused on a few brands now and all of them are at the early stages of their development. So we put a bit stake in the ground and plan to grow there in a big way.","Robby Ohmes - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That sounds great. Thanks so much.","Eric Wiseman","Thanks, Robby.","Operator","We'll go next to Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie.","Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie","Thank you for taking my question. Overall, impressive numbers out of Asia. A follow-up on Robby's question on China. With the anticipated DC in Kunshan, can we anticipate additional one-time investments for this region to fuel future growth?","Eric Wiseman","We've been investing in that region \u2013 we've been focused on it now for about seven odd years, we've been there for a long time. We opened our first subsidiary there in 1995, so that was Lee and so we're coming up on the 20th anniversary of VF direct investment in China. But a lot of the momentum has happened in the last five to seven years. And our Asia Pacific regions should break $1 billion this year and China is still half of that. We make investments behind our brands. We're making investments in infrastructure to support our brands. We made a lot of investments in marketing in the last couple of years to build categories that didn't exist. A great example of that is the Outdoor category didn't really exist there five to ten years ago and we've been investing a lot to help define what that category should look like in that region and the North Face is the leader in Outdoor in China and I think we launched there in 2007. So, still very early days, lots of potential and we're excited by it.","Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie","Okay, great. And then in terms of labor costs, are you seeing anything for the balance of the year?","Bob Shearer","No change certainly from what we anticipated. No, we're not seeing any escalation or any reductions either, a pretty stable environment.","Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie","Okay, great. Thanks.","Bob Shearer","You bet.","Operator","We'll go next to Edward Yruma with KeyBanc.","Edward Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for sneaking me in there. You guys recently realigned your management structure I think to more closely mirror the structure you had in international. I guess any outcomes you're looking for as a result of that? And how do you think this will help accelerate your growth in the U.S.? Thanks.","Eric Wiseman","Sure. One of our platforms that \u2013 one of the things that we think will deliver more potential to VF is what we call 1VF which is having our \u2013 we're organized by brand and we empower each brand to achieve their potential, but we gained most when we work across our company. And our hope is that this structure will encourage more of that because it takes a lot of individual leaders working together to make that happen. Everybody is kind of heads down on their brand, but we find when we \u2013 the more we share the better we get. So, that was a big point underline the organization structure change.","Edward Yruma - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Great. Thanks so much.","Eric Wiseman","Thank you.","Operator","Let's turn it back to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Eric Wiseman","Sure. Hey, listen, we've got the year off to a great start. We appreciate your interest in our company. We look forward to catching back up in 90 days and we'll give you another outlook on how we're doing. Thanks so much. Bye-bye.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation."],"21608":["V.F.

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host Mr. Joe Alkire, Vice President of Investor Relations for V.F. Corporation. Please go ahead, sir.","Joe Alkire","Good morning, and welcome to V.F. Corporation's first quarter fiscal 2019 earnings call. Participants on today's call will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These uncertainties are detailed in documents filed regularly with the SEC. Unless otherwise noted, amounts referred to on today's call will be on in adjusted basis, which we define in the Press Release that was issued this morning.","We use adjusted amounts as lead numbers in our discussion because we believe they more accurately represent the true operational performance and underlying results of our business.","You may also hear us refer to reported amounts which are in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reconciliations of GAAP measures to adjusted amounts can be found in the supplemental financial tables included in the press release, which identify and quantify all excluded items and provide management's view of why this information is useful to investors.","During the first quarter of fiscal '19, the company completed the sale of its Nautica brand business. Accordingly, the company has classified the assets and liabilities of the Nautica brand business as held-for-sale through the date of sale, including the operating results of this business in discontinued operations for all periods presented.","During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the company completed the sale of its Licensed Sports Group or LSG business, in conjunction with the LSG divestiture, VF executed its plan to exit the licensing business, which comprises the LSG and JanSport brand collegiate businesses.","Accordingly, the company has removed the assets and liabilities of the licensing business and included the operating results of this business in discontinued operations for all periods presented. Unless otherwise noted, results presented on today's call are based on continuing operations.","Joining me on today's call will be VF's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Rendle; and Chief Financial Officer, Scott Roe. Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call for questions. Steve?","Steven E. Rendle","Thank you, Joe. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter 2019 earnings call. VF's results for the first quarter were stronger-than-expected fueled by the continued broad-based acceleration in our core brands and platforms.","Our growth was balanced across geographic regions and channels as consumers globally remain resilient despite increased geopolitical uncertainty. The year and half into our 2021 plan, I\u2019m pleased with the progress that we've made. We continue to deliver on our commitments and remain sharply focused on the foundation we're setting to position VF for sustainable, long-term growth and value creation.","Taking a look at the results for the quarter. Revenue increased 12% on an organic basis as our strategic growth drivers continue to fuel results. Our big three brands grew at a combined rate of 21% with our Vans brand delivering another exceptional quarter, up 35% with double-digit growth across all regions, channels and product families.","The Vans brand is clearly outperforming the long-term growth targets we laid out at our Investor Day in Boston, little more than a year-ago. We look forward to updating you in Vans vision for its next chapter growth at the brand's upcoming Investor Day in September.","Momentum in the North Face brand continues to build with 8% growth and importantly continued improvement in quality of our business. The brand delivered strong growth in performance women's and lifestyle products. The brand She Moves Mountains campaign, which focus on the next generation of female explorers contributed to the strong performance of our women's business. And with the launch of the renewed program we're piloting a circular business model that will extend the reach of our brand to new consumers through emerging new purchase model.","On an organic basis, international increased 14% led by more than 30% growth in China and 18% growth in Europe. Direct-to-consumer increased 16% with more than 30% growth in digital. Our Work segment increased 8% driven by balanced growth across nearly all brands. And finally jeans increased 3% as Wrangler delivered another solid quarter of growth.","As a result of our strong performance in the quarter and our increased confidence in the full-year, we're raising our revenue and earnings growth outlook. Scott will cover the details in a moment. A few of the highlights from the quarter. In May, we launched our corporate purpose and guiding principles to our 70,000 associates across the globe. And the response has been overwhelming.","VF's purpose is to power movements of sustainable and active lifestyles for the betterment of people and to our planet. Fueled by the deep commitment of our employees, our purpose will help unlock new opportunities for our company, while also empowering us to be a collective force for good. Together, driven by a shared purpose we will positively impact our communities and the evolution of our business.","We believe our purpose will help attract and retain the industry's best talent as well as provide clarity to our decisions and actions. Reshaping our portfolio remains our top priority. We're committed to actively managing the shape of our business to align with our purpose and financial aspirations.","In early June, we formally welcomed Altra into the VF family and are working to leverage the brand's capabilities to strengthen our technical footwear platform. The integration processes for both Icebreaker and Williamson-Dickie remain on track, and we're excited about the long-term opportunity for these two high quality growth assets.","So one quarter into our fiscal 2019 plan, I remain highly confident in our purpose led, performance driven strategy and our ability to execute and deliver on top quartile growth and value creation for our shareholders.","And with that, I will pass it to Scott.","Scott A. Roe","Thanks, Steve. Before reviewing the highlights of our first quarter, I'd like to quickly cover the change to our segment reported. In light of recent portfolio actions and organizational realignments, we\u2019ve changed our reporting segments. We believe these new segments provide greater transparency into the growth and profitability of our portfolio. Our new segments are Outdoor, Active, Work, and Jeans.","We\u2019ve outlined the brands included in each of our segments in the press release and accompanying earnings presentation posted at our Web site. We\u2019ve also included restated historical information in our press release. And my apologies once again to all of our modelers out there who are just recovering from our fiscal year-end change and portfolio actions.","So moving now to first quarter results. Revenue was stronger-than-expected driven by continued broad-based acceleration in our core brands and platforms. On an organic basis, revenue increased 12% with balanced growth across brands, geographic regions and channels.","On a combined basis, our big three brands increased 21%, led by 35% growth at Vans and 8% growth in the North Face. The global momentum in our Vans business remains strong and growth is well diversified with double-digit growth in all regions, channels and product families.","Likewise, momentum in the North Face is building. As the brand executes on its strategy and the quality of the brand's growth is improving as evidenced by more than 20% growth in first quality wholesale in the Americas. While still early we're confident that our efforts to elevate and reposition the North Face are beginning to pay off.","So rounding out the big three, Timberland delivered modest growth led by strength in Timberland PRO and Europe. In the Americas, the quality of our business is improving and we're beginning to see better results in our core classics.","On a regional basis, excluding the impact of acquisitions, growth was balanced, up double-digit both in the U.S and international. Europe remains robust delivering 18% growth, while Asia Pacific increased 14% including more than [technical difficulty] growth in China.","Our organic D2C business increased 16% with 15% comps, more than 30% growth from digital. And lastly, wholesale increased 10% organically led by more than 20% growth from our digital wholesale partners.","Gross margin was 15.5%, up 90 basis points over the last year. Organic gross margin increased 170 basis points driven by higher margins in our core growth engines and our continued focus on fundamentals and quality growth. As a percentage of revenue, SG&A was 41.5%, down 110 basis points versus prior-year.","On an organic basis, SG&A as a percentage of revenue declined 40 basis points. Investments in our strategic priorities increased at a double-digit rate. However, this was more than offset by strong leverage given the strength of the top line. And for the full-year this algorithm continues. Strong investment in our strategic priorities offset by leverage elsewhere resulting in an overall decline in our SG&A percentage.","So, pulling it altogether, earnings-per-share was $0.43, including a $0.04 contribution from acquisition. That\u2019s up 62% versus last year. Given the strength of our first quarter and increased confidence in the trajectory of our business, we are raising our full-year outlook.","Our fiscal 2019 outlook now includes the following: revenue is expected to be in the range of about $13.6 billion to $13.7 billion, reflecting growth of 10% to 11%. This includes organic growth of more than 5%. Our updated revenue outlook also includes more than $150 million negative impact from unfavorable FX relative to the prior outlook. For the full-year, we don't expect FX to have a material impact on our growth rate.","By segment, Outdoor is expected to increase 6% to 8% or at a low single-digit rate on an organic basis with mid single-digit growth expected in the second half. Revenue for Active is expected to increase 13% to 14%. Work revenue is expected to increase more than 35% or at a mid single-digit rate on an organic basis, and revenue for Jeans is expected to be about flat compared to last year. Global Vans revenue is now expected to increase at least 15% with more than 25% growth in the first half. There's no change to our outlook for the North Face or Timberland.","International revenue is now expected to increase between 12% and 13% due to the negative FX impact just mentioned. Excluding FX, there's no change to our outlook for the international business. European revenue is expected to increase 12% to 13%, Asia-Pacific revenue is expected to increase 14% to 15%, and revenue in the non-U.S Americas region is expected to increase 9% to 10%.","Direct-to-consumer revenue is now expected to increase 11% to 13% with more than 30% growth in digital. Gross margin is still expected to approximate 51% and operating margin is now expected to increase 70 basis points to about 13.4% due to improved SG&A leverage.","Adjusted earnings per share is now expected to be in the range of $3.52 to $3.57, reflecting growth of 12% to 14%. Our updated outlook included a $0.06 negative impact from unfavorable FX rates relative to the prior outlook. For the full-year, we don't expect FX to have a material impact on our earnings growth rate. And finally cash flow from operations is now expected to exceed $1.7 billion with CapEx of $275 million.","So to conclude, we are pleased with the strong start to the year. Our confidence is high. We are executing well against our strategic growth plan, and momentum continues to build across our core growth engines and platforms. We are focused on transforming VF into a purpose led, performance driven organization. We remain deeply committed to reshaping the portfolio and delivering superior returns to shareholders.","And with that, I will turn it back to the operator and open the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew Boss","Great. Congrats on a nice quarter, guys.","Scott A. Roe","Thanks, Matt.","Steven E. Rendle","Thank you.","Matthew Boss","On the expense front, can you speak to drivers of SG&A leverage in the quarter, maybe your confidence in the back half? And then, Scott, any color on the front end loaded investments that you've made and how best to think about the expense line, maybe now multiyear? I think that would be really helpful.","Scott A. Roe","Sure, Matthew. I guess the bottom line here is, it's really no change from what we've been saying. Steve mentioned in his comments, we did a little better on the top line than expected in the quarter. And given that this is our smallest quarter of the year, little bit of movement on the top is probably disproportionate percentage impact on the ratios in the quarter. But really our algorithm and how you should model, I think going forward is the same. We talked about double-digit investment in our strategic priorities. But with that leverage for the full-year and actually that leverage picked up couple of bps, I guess, 20 bps in our implied guidance for the year. So it's really, really no change. You shouldn\u2019t look at this quarter and say something is fundamentally different. We are really maybe just slightly better than what we\u2019ve got, but the big picture remains the same.","Matthew Boss","Great. And then just a follow-up on the gross margin. Any change in the outlook for 40 to 50 basis points annual mix benefit? And I guess with the model approaching the 5-year plan, the 51.5%, just any structural ceiling on gross margin as we think multiyear?","Scott A. Roe","Yes. So, obviously two years in we -- its better to be ahead than behind. I just made that comment. And yes, we\u2019ve confidence in the gross margin that we laid out, but we haven't changed that algorithm. This year, the way you should think about that is about 50 basis points of mix and when you take in the impact of acquisitions, that\u2019s about a 20 bps negative. So that gets you to the 30 bps, that takes you to the 51% that we referenced in the guidance. So that\u2019s kind of right in line with what we\u2019ve said. And listen, I think if we do a little better on gross margin, that is a key focus for our business. We talked about, and it's almost internally, because it comes up in every discussion that we have and that\u2019s our checkbook for investment. And as we see that, those margins, if they do get a little bit better, does that give us a chance to move even a little faster against our strategic priorities, it might. But it doesn't change our commitment to our earnings growth pattern, that 16% long-term operating margin is dead in our sights and could it evolve a little differently, it might. But I think the takeaway here is we are feeling good about the gross margins.","Matthew Boss","Congrats again. Best of luck.","Scott A. Roe","Thank you.","Steven E. Rendle","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Erinn Murphy","Great. Thanks. Good morning. I guess, Steve, for you just bigger picture, in your prepared remarks you talked about the consumer being resilient. Can you just expand upon this comment and how you\u2019re feeling about the health of the consumer as we get into the back half and into 2019? Maybe just starting here with North America.","Steven E. Rendle","Sure. I think we all see that the U.S consumer continues to be open to and motivated to interact with powerful brands, brands that they connect with, brands that provide products and experiences that are relevant to who they\u2019re. I don\u2019t think we're sitting here saying that this is easy and that everywhere we look that there's resilient consumers, but we -- what we\u2019re seeing is what we have a clarity of focus on what our brands stand for, that we\u2019re bringing the best product. And more importantly, big learnings over last couple of years is really elevating the brand experience in connecting more emotionally with our consumers. We are able to stay at the forefront of the decisions that they have and where they choose to spend their time and money. We see the same to be true in Europe, and we see the same being very true in Asia and I think as we really focus our attention against those key drivers and platforms within our portfolio, we will continue to see our opportunity to connect and maintain those long-term loyal relationships.","Erinn Murphy","Okay. Thank you. And then just on the North Face, would love to just better understand the North American growth for the quarter. I know its flat, but it sounds like you\u2019re pretty pleased with the quality. So maybe just expound upon the confidence as you get into the back half and still a little bit more second half weighted? And then in that if you could speak about the new circular business model you referenced in your prepared remarks. What does that entail for the brand?","Steven E. Rendle","That's great. I\u2019m glad you picked up on that Erinn. Yes, so the North Face for this quarter, as we mentioned, the business was flat, right where we thought it would be, but what\u2019s giving us so much confidence is the quality of our sales. And first quality wholesale being up, such a good 20%, is this validation that the work we've been doing over the last 18 to 24 months is paying off. Inventories are clean. Retailers have opened to buy that they\u2019re able to commit to us, commit to the new programs as the brand continues to evolve and improve the product offer across Mountain Sports, Urban Exploration, the performance piece specifically with Women's. We are just getting the opportunity to put our best products on floor and we're seeing really good sell-through that\u2019s giving us confidence as we move into the second half. And in the second half, Erinn, the -- just how you think about the North Face through its Mountain Sports focus on consumer and the Urban Exploration focus to the consumer, in each case we're -- the work that we're doing on the top end of those product offers in Mountain Sports, the Summit Series and Steve Collections, continue to involve, continue to get stronger, and we're getting really good placement in all of the right dealers, including how we represent within our own stores and online. It's giving us really good confidence. The evolution of Urban Exploration, bringing in some of those European products that we've seen, work so well under Arnie's leadership here. We're seeing those resonate here in the U.S., continue strong placement and sell-through in Europe as well as Asia. To your question on the renewed program, we are -- we all see, consumers are changing, the way that they\u2019re buying footwear and apparel. They -- we think that they\u2019re valuing quality over quantity and they\u2019re looking for access potentially over ownership. So, with our desire to connect with our consumers and really stay at the forefront and focused on agile experimentation, we're piloting a number of different circular business model tests. In the case of renewed, that is about refurbishing clothing that is either been worn, damaged or return to us. We inspect it, we wash it, and we tune it up, get it back to the quality that it was initially there when we sold it the first time around. So you have the same quality, but the big difference is much less impact on the earth. We are piloting these programs. They do not have significant impact on our results, but they are doing for us is giving us an understanding of is our consumer interested in our brands, working in this way is this a new growth factor that we should be exploring for future. And I think the teams that are working across the brands with our corporate leadership to really explore these new business models. We think there's something very interesting here and very much in line in our journey to transform.","Scott A. Roe","I just like to add on -- yes, Erinn, sorry to add on, just put some numbers around here with the first part of your question on the North Face confidence. First of all, the demand is really showing through. If you look at D2C at plus 12 and digital I think plus 30 in the quarter, you can see that that the interest and the strength for the brand is there. Also, when our price is down and the quality is up like Steve said, plus 20% first quality, when we look at the full-year, wholesale is growing for this brand. We\u2019ve visibility to the order book and so all those things together give us confidence in the full-year outlook, just to put some numbers behind that.","Erinn Murphy","Great. Love the number. Thank you guys and congrats.","Steven E. Rendle","Thanks, Erinn.","Scott A. Roe","Thanks, Erinn.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.","Omar Saad","Thanks, guys. Good morning. I will add my congrats too. Great quarter.","Scott A. Roe","Thanks, Omar.","Omar Saad","It's interesting to see you guys kind of raising the full-year guidance after the first quarter. And I\u2019d love to kind of hear you talk about parsing out what the strength you\u2019re seeing in your business is macro versus fundamental. Obviously, those have been above broad-based reacceleration for you guys, now Vans as a key example of that. But you are also using digital technologies and consumer engagement really effectively and maybe you could help us think about or understand how you think about what's driving your business in terms of broad macro consumer confidence and [indiscernible] as opposed to what you're doing in your brands using digital and creating stronger connections with consumers in greater excitement around the product etcetera. And is there a way for you to kind of discern between the two?","Scott A. Roe","Yes. So, I will take a first shot at this, Omar, Scott here. I'd say this is really much more about our brands and less about macro. I mean, the macro from what we\u2019ve seen macro conditions have not really changed that much over the last 18 months as it relates to our consumer now. Obviously, there's many things going on at the macro level that we\u2019re keeping an eye on. But as it relates to our consumers, we really haven't seen that much of a change. Now at some of the -- we\u2019re keeping an eye on some of the other -- some of the things happening geopolitically, but so far hasn\u2019t baked into our business and since where we haven't really seen either an upside or a downside, where I think you\u2019re seeing is a multiyear payoff of some of the focus on fundamentals and going back to basics in a sense kind of our big franchises. And what's happening in Vans has been a long-standing pattern, the TNF we\u2019ve been talking about for a couple of years, we are seeing the payoff. I think it's just a focus on fundamentals that\u2019s paying off more than anything that\u2019s happened on a broader basis.","Steven E. Rendle","And, Omar, let me -- I would add to that. Last year when we spoke to everybody in Boston, we talked about the work we've done on what we like to call the forces of change. And really diving into the changing consumer mindset and how should we be thinking as a portfolio of brands. And it's really putting the consumer even further forward in our thinking in every aspect of our company. And the integrated strategy that we rolled out in March that we continue to talk about guiding our decisions, we\u2019ve narrowed our focus on those things that we see being most important to putting our brands at the forefront of the consumer's mind. And as we\u2019ve continued to reshape our portfolio, we're focusing our portfolio on those brands that we can drive in our most connected to consumer for us on this long-term journey. So it is -- I think its intense focus on a very -- focused set of choices, building stronger capabilities within our brands, and even more deeply connecting our corporate functions to service and help enable the growth of our brands, you\u2019re starting to see the momentum build based on that focus.","Scott A. Roe","Yes, Omar, just one other factor I think that\u2019s relevant here is the portfolio actions that we\u2019ve taken, right. In terms of bringing and focusing on new growth factors such as Work, such as our Icebreaker, Altra platforms moving away from some of the more disruptive parts of the market where we saw a little bit tougher sledding. And you're starting to see that that mix and improved mix also shining through, I think as you look at our performance.","Omar Saad","Got it. So to that end guys, maybe you could also as a follow-up talk a little bit about what you're seeing -- what were you developing, technologies and capabilities you\u2019re developing that are scalable across the portfolio. Historically, I think the company was very focused on keeping the brand separate and having kind of unique functionality, especially in the consumer facing side of the business. As the business evolves, are you seeing more scalable opportunities in consumer facing areas that you can leverage across multiple brands in the portfolio? Is that the right way to think about it?","Steven E. Rendle","Yes. Omar, I think that is the right way to think about it. I think VF is always been focused on looking for those leverageable capabilities that we could bring to our brands. But through this integrated strategy focus, a couple examples, certainly would be our digital platform and the advancements that we're making there on how to use that technology more productively, how to begin to use o the consumer data files that we have to more thoughtfully connect with consumers to drive that one-to-one relationship. That\u2019s so important and you see that really coming to life in the Vans results. Part of our strategy, we don't talk a lot about is act vertical work the we're doing in really tearing down our go-to-market processes and product creation and with the expectation of improving speed, improving quality through lesser SKUs and more focused merchandising. That work is going on within the North Face and Timberland and you are starting to see the results come to life there. I think the capabilities that we're bringing in to our portfolio, the Icebreaker acquisition was very intentional. That was a purpose led acquisition to bring in natural fiber expertise that we can scale beyond just Icebreaker and Smartwool across multiple brands in our portfolio with even stronger connection with our consumers. And then the last one is our increased attention on insights and analytics, taking what has been a strong consumer insights capability and now marrying that to an analytics capability for better decision-making not just on the consumer facing side, but on merchandising and supply chain decision-making to just improve the quality and efficiency of the work we do.","Omar Saad","Thank you.","Scott A. Roe","And I think, Omar, the economics around that are these are the big, we call them enterprise-wide initiatives that were outlined in our strategy, and those are leverageable across the entire portfolio. So those are -- we are distorting investment in those directions. And then on the rest of the business that\u2019s where we see leverage and where we drive leverage into the model. So that\u2019s the way that algorithm works.","Omar Saad","Great job. Thank you.","Steven E. Rendle","Thanks, Omar.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie Group. Please proceed with your question.","Laurent Vasilescu","Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Congrats on really solid results. I wanted to follow-up on the Vans guide of 25% for 1H '19 and then the full-year guide of at least 15% growth for the year. That would suggest high single to the low double-digit growth for 2H '19, is that the right way to think about it? And then for last year's Investor Day, I think you guys guided for Vans longer-term to grow 8% to 10% with wholesale guided to be low single-digit, but then D2C to a high single. How do we think about those numbers, especially on the context of the channel mix going forward?","Scott A. Roe","Yes, on the first part of your question, Laurent, you had it right. I mean, kind of high single digits is where the second half is. And again, I think as I\u2019ve consistently said, hardest thing to predict in terms of the pace of this business, honestly we really haven't seen it slowdown. We know we\u2019re comping really big numbers. A lot of this is digital and D2C, essentially half of the business go-to-market is in the D2C area. So we know it will moderate at some point and that\u2019s we\u2019re at this point, although, frankly, we haven't seen that. We haven't seen that occur yet.","Steven E. Rendle","I would -- and Omar -- I mean, Laurent, I\u2019m sorry, what I would say, what you see going on right now is in our opinion is Vans is seeking its natural level as a top provider of active lifestyle footwear. So this growth, though exceptional, this brand has been growing in the teams since we\u2019ve acquired it in 2004. And they\u2019re focused on franchise management, bringing new products offers. We are seeing really good results with items like the Altra range, some of the new apparel offer as the brand expands and offers more choices to the consumers that have been with the brand for a very long time and the new consumers that are coming. We are looking forward to our September meeting in Costa Mesa, where you all can meet Doug and his team more personally and hear from them on what is driving this growth and what we believe to be that resettable long-term strategy that is very well-founded in a strong understanding of their consumer and a very disciplined approach to managing that brand.","Laurent Vasilescu","Okay. Very helpful. And as a follow-up, Greater China, that was a key message of the Investor Day last year, it was up 45% and then I think 31% on an organic basis. I think you guys originally guided for Greater China grow up -- grow high teens for the fiscal year. Is that still the case? Anything changing within the Greater China market that we should consider with regards to this momentum?","Scott A. Roe","Well, I guess, what\u2019s changed is we\u2019re running a little ahead of our long-range guidance. But at this point we are not updating that. We are really encouraged by the strength that we\u2019re seeing in China. We know that that\u2019s -- its one of our declared strategic priorities, and so we're -- it's nice to see that performance. I wouldn\u2019t isolate on one quarter though, right. So, yes, it's encouraging, but at this point we haven't updated that long range outlook.","Steven E. Rendle","And Laurent, just one additional point. As we focus on becoming more retail centric and how we think not just for our own store and web platforms for how we work with our wholesalers, that mentality with our new leadership in Kevin Bailey is leader of our Asia platform, you\u2019re seeing greater attention to thinking and acting like a retailer, focusing on sell-through and getting our very best products on the floor at the beginning of the season, working dynamically to make sure those products are selling through and just keep the offer fresh, balanced with better and better marketing. I think you\u2019re seeing the proof of what is -- just early steps in a longer-term journey.","Laurent Vasilescu","Thank you very much and best of luck.","Scott A. Roe","Thanks, Laurent.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Binetti","Hi, guys. Let me add my congrats here this morning and Scott thanks for the opportunity to work on a model again. It's very helpful.","Scott A. Roe","We got pretty deep into the call with quite [indiscernible].","Michael Binetti","[Indiscernible]. So I do have just a couple of questions really quickly on the models and housekeeping, tow moving parts. It seems like D2C digital driving more of the revenue growth than you expected for the year, and really strong gross margins in the first quarter maybe above the run rate you're expecting when you gave us the initial guide for the first half. Is there any new take from the gross margin here that keeps the annual at 51?","Scott A. Roe","No, other than it's early and this is yes, everything you said is right, although it's a relatively low retail quarter and we got 90% of our earnings out of it. So early days, is it encouraging? Yes, but again it's pretty small in the scheme of -- there's a lot of real estate ahead of us.","Michael Binetti","Okay. Would you mind reorienting us with the first half guidance you gave last time, given mostly the metrics are above what we are thinking for first quarter. I think you said gross is up 20 in the first half and SG&A leveraging about -- sorry, I think it was 70, right, for the first half?","Scott A. Roe","Yes. Well, I guess, the bottom line is we really didn't reorient the -- or we didn\u2019t gave new first half, second half guidance at this point. So, what you have is the first quarter actuals and what we said about the year, in general, the shape of the year is unchanged, right, with the acceleration in the back half. Overall, you\u2019re going to see more leverage and margin expansion, but beyond that we really haven't given any more detail on that, Michael.","Michael Binetti","Okay. Fair enough. And then, I guess, the more fun question is, as we think about the line of sight on Vans, and I\u2019m sure you guys spent a lot of your time answering this questions, but obviously as we look across our coverage, it seems like we\u2019re in a bit of a fashion cycle that would very naturally include brands like Vans. But as we do look across the coverage, I\u2019d say there's some brands that have been through a little less durable than Vans over long -- over past cycles, and maybe we would be worried about how they\u2019re going to comp the comp as they get into tougher compares. Can you help us think about how you look at managing one of your big brand that goes through a period of very strong growth like this. We hear things from the channel that you guys are managing allocations into the channel pretty well, is there a toolkit that you can tell us about that spoke to your confidence, you mentioned a little bit earlier about achieving its natural level here. The things you say, these are the ways we know we\u2019re playing good defense and this isn't just overcooking in a retro logo, a cycle or things like that that give you confidence, that look these are the right growth rate, these aren't retro cycle driven growth rates that post risk to those numbers as we get into the tough compares.","Steven E. Rendle","So, Michael, let me take a stab at that. As I mentioned earlier, Vans has been growing at a mid-teen rate since VF acquired it in 2004. So this brand has been on a very strong solid growth trajectory. And each year through this -- throughout its growth as it gets more disciplined and how it manages its business both financially and operationally through the -- that they\u2019ve taken from our Vans or from our VF ownership. The strength and understanding of the consumer, that the team has gained through our consumer insights and brand building focus, they just have gotten stronger and stronger, more focused on who they are and more importantly who they are not. We are in exceptional moment where we're seeing distorted growth. Some of that could very much be some trend, level of trend. But honestly, the way we look at it, we are resetting the rightful level of penetration that this brand has with the consumer and within the wholesale channel and as you -- as we do our channel checks, you can see the brand has just taken a larger footprint both on the footwear wall, the tables in the footwear section, but we're also now starting to place really relevant assortments of apparel. So that the better this brand begins to understand -- the better this brand understands its consumer, the more thoughtful we can be on placing the right products at the right time. The discipline franchise management, channel management segmentation just get stronger and stronger and it really is disciplined of how that team operates. You will see that when we host you in September. This isn't an exceptional moment of time that likely has a downward cycle in the back and this is just a reset of its rightful position as one of the top footwear brands in that active lifestyle component of the consumer's choice.","Michael Binetti","I really appreciate the help taking in through. Congrats again on the quarter.","Steven E. Rendle","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Camilo Lyon with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.","Camilo Lyon","Thanks, guys. And I will let my congrats too and a fantastic start to the fiscal year. If we think about the big three brands kind of stack together in the progression that we're seeing in all of them. So Vans acceleration began last year. It seems the North Face is starting to be on accelerating path this year. Is it fair to think about Timberland beginning to show its acceleration next year? And if so, what are the clues and hints you're seeing now that would suggest that, that is in fact the case and how do we think about that piece of the puzzle unfolding over the next 18 to 24 months?","Steven E. Rendle","Yes, Camilo, its -- I think it's a really good way to characterize where we are in this journey. This is our diversified portfolio, really showing itself and the strength behind what we have. Today our Vans business is doing exceptional. Our North Face brand, we've been working on it for the last 24 months intensely on all the things that we talked about from channel clean up, better focus around core product categories, stronger leadership in all the key areas to just bring that discipline back to one of our most powerful brands, its accelerating. Timberland is in the same journey and as we line this up over time, we just see a continued improvement brand by brand across each of these regions. I guess, that would leave you, just imagine what this portfolio will look like when all of these brands are functioning at their optimum level at the same time.","Camilo Lyon","Great. Is there a way to maybe quantify how to think about the Timberland mix acceleration into next year that you would be willing to speak to you right now?","Scott A. Roe","Well, I think we gave you the long-term growth algorithm, which is 4 to 6 mid single-digit and we talked about acceleration. So beyond that, Timberland we really haven't it. You can expect sequential improvement as we go into next year. Beyond that we haven't really shaped it.","Camilo Lyon","Okay. That\u2019s fair. And then just, I'd be remiss if I didn\u2019t ask about the tariff discussion, your manufacturing exposure to China, your ability to defer product to other countries. And where does this lie in kind of the rank order of concerns in your business. And if it's not one of them, what would is the chief concern that you are kind of contemplating?","Scott A. Roe","Yes, Scott here. I will start. We wouldn\u2019t be asleep if we weren't concerned about it, right. We are watching this very carefully. Again, as for us so far is in all of the guidance and insight that we\u2019ve seen so far these are the minimis. I mean, there's some relatively extraneous categories, felt some other accessories type things that had a very small impact. We have a very diverse supply chain, and once we know what the rules are sometimes the hardest part is figuring out what the rules are, but once its communicated, we can adapt pretty quickly. And that\u2019s the beauty of the diverse -- diversification of the supply chain and frankly the competency of our supply chain we are really good at this stuff. These guys are -- these men and women are awesome at optimizing around total landed cost once they know the rules. As it goes to the [indiscernible], I think it's anybody's guess, right. Of course, we\u2019re watching it. It's an area of concern. It could become an issue for us in the future. It just depends on where the rhetoric is versus compared to what actually gets implemented.","Camilo Lyon","Got it. Thanks a lot guys and best of luck going forward.","Scott A. Roe","Thanks, Camilo.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Please proceed with your question.","Dana Telsey","Good morning, everyone and congratulations on a terrific performance. Can you talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing on Amazon given some of the tests that you\u2019ve put on there and how the brands you had on there? How they\u2019re performing and what you\u2019re seeing? And can you give us an update on wholesale? What are you seeing both overseas and in the Americas? And just any feeling on the Jeans business, how Wrangler and Lee are performing, what you're seeing in this new fashion cycles? Thank you.","Steven E. Rendle","Dana, this is Steve. So on the Amazon question we're working closely now with Amazon as a strategic partner for us both here and in Europe. We talked in the past about dedicating a key account team that we are now placing people in Seattle, just getting to deeper knowledge and understanding of how the Amazon platform works and how and where does it fit into our integrated marketplace decisions, what are the right assortments, how do we work with them on managing the marketplace, so we can have the very best representation of our brands within their environment. We are --- the test that we\u2019re -- we\u2019ve been working on are working well. We are pleased with the results. Our jeans businesses, Wrangler and Lee are some of the best performing brand -- apparel brands within the Amazon platform and really are helping us understand a broad spectrum of how brands work within that platform. Your question on wholesale, is that more broadly just how do we see wholesale, not only here \u2026","Dana Telsey","Yes.","Steven E. Rendle","\u2026 but in all the regions?","Dana Telsey","Yes. Exactly. Order trends and by division. Thank you.","Steven E. Rendle","Sure. So I think what we see here in the U.S., in the domestic wholesale market is a channel that\u2019s much cleaner and more focused on putting stronger merchandising assortments in front of consumers, working I think more effectively with us on how to drive demand and sell-through. I think the one channel that we talked most about is the outdoor specialty channel, its much cleaner than it has been. Our inventories are much, much more in check to the point where really it's our outlets that we are using to move our excesses. And that just gives us so much more opportunity to place new fresh seasonal product in a more thoughtful flow to keep consumers interested. So I think it's really in all aspects we see each one of the sectors, each one of the business units working better within the wholesale standpoint. And then on Jeans, you -- I think you see an improving quarter by quarter result. I think this was Wrangler's fourth quarter.","Scott A. Roe","Fourth consecutive quarter.","Steven E. Rendle","Fourth consecutive quarter of showing improvement. Is there a gene cycle going on out there? May be. I think what we see is fundamentally our bottoms business is working very well in our Wrangler brand and as we expand in these some new categories, our Outdoor category doing extremely well. And this brand really begins to think about itself is more of a global lifestyle brand evolving all the appropriate new products to round out that head to toe offer, we are starting to see really good results. And just slowly, but surely the brands continue to show strength -- improving strength here domestically, but more importantly in Europe where we've seen really good growth in for our Lee business in Asia for sure.","Scott A. Roe","Yes. And just perspective on that, we are coming off, if you go back a year or so, you think about destocking and some of the things that were going on more in the channel, do this for us as we now see stabilization of the business and even we\u2019re seeing some modest growth. So that just give us confidence that we're coming through the end of that period and really on solid foundation as we\u2019ve -- as we look forward.","Dana Telsey","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Thanks so much. Could you talk about just the Williamson-Dickie integration. Where you are in that process? Have you realized the SG&A synergies? And just if you could identify maybe some of the core sales drivers, whether its Work or some of the expansion into international lifestyle, that would be helpful. Thank you.","Scott A. Roe","Yes, I will start at the end, because you just nailed it. International lifestyle are some of the key areas of growth that we see and frankly, probably even underestimated it at the time of the acquisition that we are excited about some of the opportunities that we\u2019re seeing in Asia and internationally on the lifestyle pieces as the former management team have done a nice job of setting up that business. And when you put it in our model and our in-country know-how, we see this is as a real interesting potential opportunity going forward. First part of your question, Jay was around the integration. The short answer, its going really well from all -- financially, we\u2019re a little slightly ahead of what we see at and talk the bottom line. We -- culturally it's been a great fit. We can't say enough about quality of the WD organization. It's just been a really positive experience. We\u2019ve been really impressed by their associates and we are feeling really good about where we\u2019re at on the Dickie's integration at this point. No, it's not done, but it's going well. You mentioned SG&A synergies and there are some SG&A synergies, but the majority -- just to remind you the majority of the synergies that we saw in this deal are on the margin side. As we get the scale and purchasing power and integration into some of the manufacturing and supply chain side of our business. That\u2019s where we saw -- I think we said [indiscernible] of the benefit when it comes on the margin side, gross margin.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. And then -- so would you say, Scott, on those gross margin benefits, are those sort of being -- are those sort of being implied in the guidance for the rest of the year that you\u2019ve already been able to make those changes and improvements or is that something more, so working on maybe for a next year type of situation?","Scott A. Roe","Yes, some are -- so let me put it in another way. The guidance we have reflects what we see. And -- but we also said because a lot of these are in manufacturing supply chain they sometimes take a while to get out. So we said you would see these over a couple of year period. Some of which you're seeing implied in the guidance right now and then you'll see some continuing as we move forward as -- in rough number as we said we could double the margins of this business over a period of time. But the majority of that coming in the first year.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Great. Thank you so much.","Scott A. Roe","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Ike Boruchow","Hi. Good morning, everyone. Let me add my congrats to a great quarter. I guess, first question probably for Scott. Going back to the Jeanswear business, can you maybe just bigger picture talk about the U.S wholesale business and the mass business specifically to how you're feeling there with visibility, maybe relative to the prior 6 to 12 months?","Scott A. Roe","Yes. So I think I mentioned in a previous comment relative to one of the largest players there that has just gone through a destocking at least in our categories, there may be others that are affected, but as it relates to us we appear to be through the back end of that and we are really in favor of that. We think that was a good move and good for the consumer, good for the productivity, the inventory. We work with them and applaud them on that move. And we think that sets that business and that experience positively as you look forward on a positive base. Now obviously there is other -- there's various winners and losers that are in that space. I think, we are winning with the winning consumers, and if you look at our -- sorry customers and if you look at our forward guidance, we've not been -- we've been fairly, I think, realistic and somewhat conservative as we look forward knowing that there will continue to be consolidations and store closures in some areas and we're maximizing our relationship and our growth with those that are doing relatively better. We are also cautiously working with some that are not doing as well.","Ike Boruchow","Got it. And then to switch gears to the North Face, just kind of curious, it all makes total sense and for the brand the quality, the sale initiatives and improving the quality of sell-through. I guess my question is the U.S wholesale in totality has been negative for a little while. Should that inflect at some point this year? Should we see the U.S wholesale channel for North Face stabilize at some point? And as -- what\u2019s kind of embedded maybe in the 6 to 8 for the year from a U.S wholesale perspective? Just trying to understand when we from a modeling perspective should expect that channel to get back to positive territory?","Scott A. Roe","Yes, you will see growth this year in wholesale. And again, it's really even -- what you will see reported is it's going to be even better when you consider the quality of that growth. Another way to say that as you reduce stock price and obviously that puts pressure on the overall growth rate, but the underlying quality of that growth rate is better. So when we grow low single-digits, we have visibility to that from a wholesale standpoint given the order book we have and -- so that would be an inflection point of what we\u2019ve seen over the last several quarters. Remember our overall algorithm, too, if you think about North America and this would be true with North Face as well as we're actually expecting overall big picture wholesale in the U.S to be down from a brick-and-mortar standpoint. We are growing with the digital wholesale partners, , those like Amazon and others as well as they click through, the digital component of our retail customers. So, again, where I think we have a realistic view of the marketplace as you look forward or not -- we are not ignoring the trends that we see out there, but it's important to distinguish and remember, they\u2019re not all created equal and as we see some very driving solid customers, and they\u2019re the great partners to us and we are working really well with them as we will grow our business with them over this period of time.","Steven E. Rendle","And, Ike, I would add, the focus on -- at wholesale specifically for the North Face, it's deeper focus on the key accounts that where we\u2019re able to really have strong in-store presentations. We are focusing on those specialty retailers that have particularly strong positions in specific communities. There continues to be ups and downs. And if we found the right partners, we know the right partners, and this is where we feel so confident about being able to place better assortments on a more frequent basis based on the lower excess inventory across those channels. The digital wholesale piece is very, very important. On a global basis, partners like Zalando in Europe, Asos. We talk a lot about Amazon as an up-and-coming integrated marketplace option for our brands, but you\u2019ve got key players like Dick's Sporting Goods in Nordstrom, you got the Moose Jaws that we focus on. But you also have a new strategic key account for us in Europe coming to the United States in JD Sports. We are excited to partner with them and find the right level of assortment to add value for our brand here in the U.S marketplace. So really understanding who those key accounts are, understanding what the right assortments are is really the basis of that comment around just the improved product merchandising decision-making and how that flows into an integrated marketplace set of decisions.","Ike Boruchow","Really helpful. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question for today comes from the line of Jonathan Komp with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Jonathan Komp","Yes, hi. Thank you. I want to first just kind of big picture on the guidance if I could. The organic revenue growth for the year looks to be in the mid-single digits. And I know if I look to the past few quarters you were trending close of the high single digits and then in the first quarter accelerated to 10% organic growth. So outside of Vans, is there any more color on what you\u2019re embedding in the guidance for the year from an organic growth perspective?","Scott A. Roe","Well, I think we laid out all of our growth rates in the top brands. So you can see what our assumptions are. Obviously, in the first half our guidance implies relatively slower growth with acceleration in the second half first quarter as Steve said at the very beginning we did a little bit better albeit, on a small quarter. So should we do a little better, we might. But at this point one quarter end and a small quarter is that -- this is where we\u2019re at. So I think what we said specifically is organic guidance -- our organic top line is greater than 5%. So we said mid single digits here in the [indiscernible] top and the mid single-digits.","Jonathan Komp","Okay, great. And then maybe a broader question around the segment reclassification or regrouping. I want to ask kind of big picture how much is based on backward looking actions that you've already taken and how much might be based on kind of the forward vision for any additional portfolio reshaping, especially since when I look at the Active segment, there are seven brands included, but Vans dominates that category, that segment today. And maybe there's a lack of traditional more kind of Active or Athletic brands within that grouping. So any color on kind of the motivations forward-looking versus backward looking what you\u2019ve done?","Scott A. Roe","Yes, I would caution you not to get to prognosticate too much based on our segments. The rules are pretty clear in the guidance and you could even argue whether they\u2019re always logical or not, but they\u2019re what they\u2019re. So we -- the justification for the new segments I think it's pretty straightforward. Our Outdoor Action Sports business has become so large that we felt it was good for you the readers to have one click down one more level of visibility rather than having at one giant segment, especially given some of the different financial characteristics of the two as you can see, right. And really that's the driver in the guidance is companies with like characteristics are grouped together and it's really no more or less than that.","Jonathan Komp","Understood. Thank you.","Steven E. Rendle","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we have come to the end of our time allowed for questions. I will turn the floor back to Mr. Rendle for any closing comments.","Steven E. Rendle","Great. Thank you everybody for joining us. We are very proud of the quarter we just put up. Our growth is broad-based. We are seeing acceleration across core brands and platforms. But I would just remind us all that this is just yet another quarter in a 5-year journey and we\u2019re very, very happy and proud of where we are in that journey. We are confident with where we're going against our long-term vision to be a purpose led, performance driven enterprise that delivers top quartile value to our shareholders. We look forward to talking to you in the not-too-distant future. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Let's take a look at some of the highlights from our first quarter. Revenue increased 9% or 11% on an adjusted organic basis. Growth was driven by our two largest brands, Vans and The North Face, which grew 23% and 12%, respectively, as the strong momentum for both brands extends into this year.","Our Vans business continues to perform well above its long term growth target. More importantly, the quality of the growth is strong, and diverse as we are seeing the rapid acceleration of the Slip-On franchise complement the continued strength of the Old Skool.","The Vans team remains intensely focused and disciplined as they continue to deliver consistent performance that is driven by not just one thing. When coupled with the investments we are making to drive and fuel the brand's explosive growth, we are confident in Van's ability to sustain its trajectory above our long term target, including 11% to 13% growth this year.","The brand is well on its way to achieving its $5 billion [ph] target by 2023. Similarly, The North Face continues to exceed expectations, with double digit growth across all regions and strengthen all channels and product territories. In light of the brand's strong first quarter performance, increased visibility to the full year and renewed energy in the brand's product pipeline and innovation engine, we are increasing our fiscal 2020 growth outlook for The North Face to 8% to 9%. Speaking of products, we are just a few months away from the launch of FutureLight and the response from the marketplace has been very strong. Given the opportunity FutureLight has to significantly disrupt the outdoor industry, we have decided to invest even more aggressively behind the breakthrough technology.","We look forward to sharing more with you over the coming months. Now let me give you a few more highlights from the quarter's revenue performance. International increased 10% including nearly 30% growth in China. Direct-to-consumer increased 16% with a 14% total comp and nearly 30% growth in digital. And work increased 4% with consistent performance across our brand portfolio. Our fundamentals remained strong as gross margin, a key driver of our value creation model reached 54.4% providing us the fuel to continue to drive investment in the capabilities required to sustain our growth momentum.","And lastly, adjusted EPS has increased 67% to $0.30 including a 10% increase in growth focused investments, tied to our long term strategy. As a result of our strong first quarter results and increased confidence in the full year, we're raising our fiscal 2020 outlook including an additional 20 million of incremental investment, primarily focused on The North Faces FutureLight launch. Scott will cover the details of our updated fiscal 2020 outlook in a moment.","At the beginning of June, the move to Denver officially began. And in just a short time, we already have more than 500 associates living and working in the Denver community. The energy around our new headquarters is palpable and further validation of the decision we made just to -- just over a year ago, to co-locate our corporate leadership team and our outdoor brands at the base of the Rockies. By the end of the summer, we expect the relocation to be complete. So one quarter into fiscal 2020, our business is performing ahead of expectations. We are thoughtfully investing in our brands, and against our largest growth opportunities. We're confident in our ability to deliver our increased growth outlook in another year of top quartile returns for our shareholders. We look forward to our upcoming Investor Day scheduled for September 25th in Beaver Creek, Colorado where both our corporate and brand leaders will provide an update to our long term strategy, financial model and CSR algorithm.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.","Scott Roe","Thanks, Steve. Fiscal 2020 is off to a strong start, yet another proof point that our consumer centric transformation continues to result in accelerated growth. VF post Kontoor is a stronger, better aligned, growth focused version of itself and the performance and composition of our current portfolio give us a high degree of confidence as we look to the future.","Before diving into the results, it's important to note that Q1 is the smallest quarter of our year. So while performance is certainly encouraging, most of the year remains ahead of us. With that said, we are executing exceptionally well. The fundamentals of our business are strong and the demand signals we are seeing from both consumers and retail partners give us confidence in our full year outlook. We're tracking ahead of plan and are pleased with the quality and balance of the growth across the portfolio.","Now let's review the first quarter. Revenue increased 9% or 11% on an organic basis, driven by continued momentum in our core growth engines. Our big three brands grew 16% led by 23% growth of Vans and 12% growth at The North Face.","The consistency of Van's growth across all regions channels and product categories remains impressive. Equally exciting is the continued momentum of The North Face, which delivered double-digit growth across all three regions with strength in all channels and product territories.","Revenue increased 16% in our D2C business highlighted by a 14% total comp and 29% growth in digital. Our wholesale business increased 8% driven by 17% growth with our digital wholesale partners, and strong sell through across key accounts.","From a geographic standpoint, we saw double digit growth in both the U.S. and internationally in the first quarter, highlighted by 29% growth in China. The performance of our work segment also remained solid despite a somewhat more tempered economic environment in the more cyclical parts of the brand portfolio.","Revenue in the Work segment increased 4% which was in line with our expectations. Dickies revenue increased 2% in the quarter which was impacted by a strategic repositioning of the brand in Japan, and timing of shipments which will impact growth during the first half of the year. We remain confident in the full year outlook of 5% to 7% growth for the Dickies brand.","Gross margin expanded 120 basis points to 54.4% driven mainly by our ongoing mix shift towards higher margin businesses and the timing of FX transaction hedge gains. SG&A grew slightly faster than revenue as strong operating leverage was offset by 11% growth in investments tied to our long term strategy.","These investments continue to translate into strong, tangible results. Now pulling it all together, operating margin expanded 100 basis points to 7.2% representing 37% organic growth in operating profit compared to the prior year. EPS has increased 67% or 86% on an organic basis to $0.30 reflecting strong growth in operating income as well as the benefit of lower interest and pension expense.","Moving to the balance sheet, inventory increased 9% which is relatively in line with our full year revenue growth outlook. We ended the quarter with adjusted gross leverage slightly below two times, as we used the proceeds from the Kontoor spend to repay short term borrowings.","Our balance sheet position is strong, and we have a lot of dry powder to pursue our M&A agenda as well as other capital allocation priorities. As you saw in our release, our board has approved a $0.43 per share dividend payable in September 2019 to BFC shareholders of record. Consistent with our prior communication and disclosure, VFs dividend adjustment represents the recalibration of our dividend following the spinoff of Kontoor brands.","And as Kontoor announced yesterday, they intend to pay an initial quarterly dividend of $0.56 per share. When considering the Kontoor and dividend combined with our dividend of $0.43 per share, shareholders who hold both companies will receive a total distribution that is equal to the dividend they had with VF prior to the spinoff.","The dividend remains a key component of our long term TSR algorithm and we intend to grow our dividend consistent with earnings as we move forward. These actions should result in a market average dividend yield.","Now turning to our updated outlook for fiscal year 2020. Based on the strength of our first quarter performance, the broad based growth across the portfolio and increased visibility and confidence in our full year plan, we are raising our fiscal 2020 growth outlook.","We now expect revenue to approximate $11.8 billion representing 8% growth on an organic constant dollar basis. Gross margin is now expected to be 54.1% representing an 80 basis point increase compared to the prior year.","Operating margin is now expected to be 13.8% representing a 90 basis point increase over the prior year. We now expect EPS of $3.32 to $3.37 representing 18% to 20% growth on an adjusted organic constant dollar basis, including $0.04 per share of incremental investment relative to our prior outlook.","The incremental investment is focused on the launch of The North Face future life technology. The ability to opportunistically invest demonstrates the power of our model, strong revenue growth and gross margin expansion, coupled with operating leverage across enterprise wide platforms give us the fuel to invest in sustained momentum while at the same time, over delivering on our commitments to shareholders.","Moving now to our segment outlook. We are raising our growth outlook for Active to 10% to 11% reflecting continued strength at Vans. We're also raising our outlook for outdoor to 6% based on the strength of The North Face. We still expect the Work segment to grow between 4% and 6%.","By brand, we're raising both our Vans outlook to 11% to 13% and our North Face outlook to 8% to 9%. We still expect Timberland to grow at a low single digit rate and Dickies to grow between 5% and 7%.","By region, we continue to expect high single digit growth internationally and we're raising our U.S. outlook to 6% to 7% growth. And finally, by channel we're raising our D2C outlook to 11% to 13% and maintaining our growth outlook for wholesale of 4% to 5%.","So one quarter into fiscal 2020, we're pleased with the balanced growth across the portfolio and our momentum heading into back-to-school and the key fall holiday season. Our fundamentals are strong and we are purposefully investing to sustain and accelerate our growth momentum, and the balance sheet is well-positioned to pursue M&A as well as other capital allocation priorities to further enhance what we believe to be a top quartile TSR outlook. We look forward to updating you on the evolution of our strategy, financial model, and TSR algorithm in more detail at our Investor Day this September.","Now, we\u2019ll open the line and take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Michael Binetti of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Michael Binetti","Hey guys. Good morning. Let me start with congrats on a great quarter out of the gate here at VF 2.0. I just want to ask one brand question on North Face. Congrats on really get the momentum back there on a sustainable basis. And I'm just curious, it's July, so it's obviously very hot out and it's an awkward time to talk about North Face. But as you look at the backlogs there, how would you describe how the retail customers are ordering for that, for the back half of the calendar year, and over a few years you mentioned I guess shipping windows have slip back but retailers wanting goods a little closer to need is that, is that continuing and you get the sense that the retailers are ordering more or less conservatively than they were if you look back a year, whatever you think the prevailing mindset is in the calendar for the back half?","Steven Rendle","Sure Michael, this is Steve. I'll start. North Face backlogs are good there. They're in line with our guide for the year or outlook. I would tell you the retailers over the past two or three years and we've talked about this in the past have absolutely modified their approach to how they place their orders, how they flow their product. And that's very consistent with how we are modifying the way we approach being much more retail centric, thinking about increased flow, better merchandise assortments, consistent with the time of year, but also helping raise the level of experience that we're able to help our wholesale partners drive.","So North East finds itself in a really good place. A lot of hard work's been done over the last three years to put themselves in this position and relocation to Denver. You know they've handled that extremely well and we're confident and looking forward frankly to the launch of FutureLight and what that will mean to the brand as it moves into this important fall winter season.","Michael Binetti","Great. Thanks for that. And then I just want to ask something a little bit longer term, and I know, I know we'll get into the nitty gritty of it at the Analyst Day, but on the last call, Scott you were asked about the 16% operating margin target from the 2017 Analyst Day. And I think you said it was still the right framework to think about for this business longer term. And you got to know we'll get into the details but now that we've seen some of the restatements, you know that at the time that you guided to 16 before you were working off of a baseline of 14.5 operating margin. Now we're working off fiscal 2019 restated at 12.9 and I guess 13.8 this year, so a lot of margin improvement this year. But I guess, I'm just, it's a bit of a steeper climb to get to 16 for here if that's still the right general range, do you think it helps us think at a high level about what some of the components from the margin that will be bigger drivers in this algorithm versus oldco algorithm to keep that kind of level intact, if that\u2019s right?","Steven Rendle","Sure, yes, and I -- Michael I think you set the right context, right. It\u2019s VF 2.0 or whether it's 10 point out of this after 120 years, I think this company has reinvented itself many times, but sure the base matters, right. And I would just point you to the algorithm that the earnings growth, algorithm that we talked about for so long, and we'll give you an update on what that looks like at this, this fall. But in general, you know you shouldn't expect a massive change from what we said before, right. The gross margin expansion, the leverage and enterprise wide platforms and investing in those key credit growth drivers to get us mid-teens kind of earnings pace on a go-forward basis, that, that's that's the ballpark you should you should assume going forward.","Well, we'll clean that up again. It's a different portfolio than we had in Boston. It's a different baseline. So all those factors need to adjust. So it\u2019s a long way of saying, I wouldn't get too isolated on the absolute nominal number. Think more about the growth algorithm, on a go-forward basis.","Michael Binetti","Got it. Region \u2013 thanks again for all the help and congrats again.","Operator","The next question is from Matthew Boss of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Matthew Boss","Thanks, and congrats on a nice spring guys.","Steven Rendle","Thanks, Matt.","Matthew Boss","I guess first on the revenue front, Steve, maybe how best to broadly characterize the consumer as you see it today, as we think about North America, Europe and China and what drove your raised forecasts for the Vans and North Face. If you broke it down, if you broke down the trends, by geography?","Steven Rendle","Sure. So it\u2019s the consumer that we that we're focused on. We see remaining quite healthy. And if you were to break that down by region here in the U.S., we've done a quite a bit of work over the last two years to realign where our products are sold on the move. You know some of the divestitures that we've executed have moved us away from some of those more pressured distribution channels like the department store and mid-tier and we find ourselves really well aligned with a more specialty side of the business and a very strong, fast growing, D2C and digital business.","So we're able to really connect with that consumer in a much more effective way, much more experiential way. And my comment earlier you know how we're really aligning our merchandising strategy and our ability to flow products and the proper amount of marketing to pull that, connect with that consumer and pull them in. So U.S. consumer seems healthy, clear there's a lot of noise around us from a macro economic and political point of view, but we really think our brands provide that that place where you can pause and really focus on you as an individual, align yourself with a likeminded community, and kind of separate yourself from the noise in the marketplace.","And we see the same true in Europe, some challenging certain indicators in across the marketplace there. But it's really our diverse strategy from a country standpoint that we're able to really navigate and connect with the consumers in the European marketplace and feel confident with where we sit there.","And in China, you'll continue to see just tremendous opportunity ahead of us, our brands, you know a very tight portfolio brands that we're working with there, have so much upside from an awareness standpoint and ability to connect with our consumers. We continue to feel very very confident and the results that we just posted in that near to 30% growth rate this quarter, I think this is validation of our brands ability to connect.","What gives us confidence to raise our guidance is what we \u2013 the momentum we carried out of last year, the performance that we\u2019ve seen this in the Q1, in the broad based nature of that growth across the categories, across the regions and across the channels and then the forward outlook that we have against our order books and you get the confidence in the product and the marketing that we have in place to drive our outlook for the year gives us confidence. You know one quarter in and it\u2019s the smallest quarter of our year, you know it still gives us confidence that we are on our path to deliver against our commitment.","Matthew Boss","That\u2019s great. And then just a follow up on gross margin, what was the breakdown over your 40 basis point rate expansion, if we were thinking about ASPs and full price selling versus product cost this quarter and then what\u2019s the primary driver behind the moderating gross margin in the back half of the year.","Steven Rendle","Yes, so the first part of your question in the first quarter, currency benefit from the hedge gains that we locked in a year or so plus ago was the largest driver. I think we said last quarter -- you\u2019ll see that moderate as you move through the year. So there\u2019s still a benefit in the preceding quarters, the amount of that benefit will subside. So for the year you know it\u2019s still one of the drivers of rate, but by the end of the year it\u2019s relatively insignificant by the time you get to the fourth quarter.","The other issue is that our guidance implies Vans in moderation. The soft landing through the second half you know I think it\u2019s if you do the math, it will say you're in that high single-digit range by the end of the year. Vans with a large D2C format and the mix related to D2C that will moderate somewhat by the end of the year, but we still see that 50 basis point mix for the full year and that implied in that 80 basis point expansion that we talked about.","Matthew Boss","Great. Congrats again on a nice quarter.","Steven Rendle","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Erinn Murphy of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Erinn Murphy","Great, thanks good morning. I guess Steve for you, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more China. Could you just speak about how the competitive landscape maybe evolving there both from a Chinese National brand perspective? And then, are you seeing anything different in the outdoor space now that Anta has bought Amer Sports?","Steven Rendle","Yes, so the competitive set in China really remains very very similar. I mean the outdoor space specifically; it\u2019s a very crowded market place. As you do your channel checks and walk the different retail environments you see just a plethora of international as well as local brands. And as Anta invests more heavily into this segment, it\u2019s early we haven\u2019t really seen any significant change in what they are doing, but certainly respect them as a competitor.","I think what\u2019s most important is how we are looking at our North Face brand in that market place. And the experiences that we\u2019re able to bring and the focus that our brand, our team there has on products that are very relevant to that consumer, and understanding that the Outdoor consumer in China is very different than the outdoor consumer in Europe and Asia. It\u2019s less individualistic, it\u2019s less trying to peak, bag the big outdoor peak, it\u2019s more about going with your friends into the outdoors and that outdoors could be really in adjacency to where they live versus going to the mountains like we might see here or in Europe.","So I think it\u2019s the deep understanding of that consumer, how to connect with them both with the outdoor Mountain Sports collection, you know what\u2019s the outdoor lifestyle piece that our teams have and then how do we properly use the urban exploration component to connect with the more city aspect of this consumer\u2019s life.","Erinn Murphy","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just drilling down a little bit more that the first quarter for the North Face. I guess with FutureLight so forth coming, can you just talk about from a product perspective what drove the Q1 results? And then, in terms of the incremental investment that $0.04 that it sounds like you are fuelling behind the FutureLight launch, kind of what area is around that launch or is that investment going to? Thank you.","Steven Rendle","Yes, So I\u2019ll start in. So for Q1, what we see was really broad based growth across the regions, but also across the categories. We had really solid rainwear, sales, strong sportswear and logo wear, which is real validation of the work the brand has been doing, learning taking their learning\u2019s from Europe and being able to fly that more holistically here and in Asia and their results have been really good.","In fact, the logo wear aspect is great. Validation that people are looking to the brand, as a brand that they want to be part of in purchasing those logo wear products. But the core of the brand is the equipment category and we saw really strong double digit growth in our equipment and that was certainly in the PACs \u2013 APACs as we come into this important back-to-school but we also saw it in the bags and tents which is prove a point that people are using our products to get outdoors and really falling with the brands driving from a marketing standpoint.","On the FutureLight aspect, would you mind, could you just repeat the question, Erinn?","Erinn Murphy","Yes, just curious you talked about $0.04 of incremental investment and that\u2019s really going behind FutureLight, kind of what other areas does that incremental investment is now going to be fuelling that maybe you haven\u2019t had in the plant before around that launch?","Scott Roe","Yes, sure. It really holistically around just building demand and awareness for this new technology now so there will be quite an expanded media of investment both from a print and online social component, but also enhanced in-store tools that\u2019s really help people understand it, because this is a different technology. It deals different, it performs differently and our team has done a tremendous job in being able to articulate that story in a very experiential way. And we\u2019ll bring that to light both in print, online and in the in-store component.","Steven Rendle","Yes, and I\u2019ll just build on that Erinn. Obviously we had significant investment in the plants. So this is even more. As we see the reception from consumers, from the trade as we see the opportunity we felt this was a great time to lean in even harder on what we believe can be and will be a very disruptive technology for the outdoor industry. If you think about it by region, it was pretty well distributed. The one area we did the store it was China as we see the opportunity and need to do a little more storytelling in the Chinese market.","Erinn Murphy","Great. Thank you both and all the best.","Steven Rendle","Thank you, Erinn.","Scott Roe","Thanks Erinn.","Operator","The next question is from Alexandra Walvis of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alexandra Walvis","Hey there. Thanks so much for taking the question. I had a question about America's wholesale. It was strong for both Vans and the North Face. I was wondering if there was any discrepancy between selling and sell-through trend that you'll keep partners. And then, you know following on from that, which partners these same particular strengths in the wholesale channel that perhaps you know thinking about those digital partners versus brick and mortar partners and any other color you can get that would be helpful?","Scott Roe","Yes. A couple of comments. What may be behind you your comment is the trend is a little different than some of the other things you're hearing out in the market. I'd just reiterate Steve's earlier comments that, the distribution channels were selling and our product categories are pretty healthy. Inventories are in good shape at retail. From what we can see, certainly our inventories are in good shape, and we're seeing a strong receptivity to the -- to the product that's out there. You know I would also reiterate another thing Steve said, that we're seeing that retailers in particular are going closer to demand with their buy. So you're not seeing a big push of inventory into the channel, you're seeing more by later closer to demand, and we're keeping an eye on that as well.","So I would characterize at least in our categories for our business that the inventory and health of the -- and balance of the situation is good from what we can see.","Steven Rendle","And then from a partner standpoint\u2026from a partner standpoint, I would -- I wouldn't breakout any one particular partner doing an outstanding job. How we've aligned our portfolio to now be more focused on the Specialty Channels, the sporting good channels, you know where these where our brand portfolio really comes to life. Each one of our partners is performing well, and where we don't see strength. Our teams are able to really break down the business, understand you know what are the issues within the assortment, that we need to work with them on to make sure that we're delivering against our commitment to be that top provider of product, sell through and margin for them.","Digital wholesale continues to be you know an important aspect. We've seen very nice growth there, and it's with our national partners that have both brick and mortar and digital in their toolkit but also the standalone digital partners continue to be really strong performance for us.","Alexandra Walvis","Great. And then the debt you mentioned that within that North Face direct-to-consumer performance that outlets were dragging on the performance a little bit. I wonder, if you could elaborate on that comment a little bit, and then perhaps more broadly across the business, you could, I mean if you could comment on trends at outlet versus the full -- direct to consumer business that would be -- that would be helpful?","Steven Rendle","Yes, I'll start on that. So the comment was pretty simple. I mean, I guess good news, bad news. Our outlet suffered a bit from lack of inventory, which is a good thing overall, but you know we just simply didn't have the broad assortment in our outlets, and remember, we don't look at outlets as a growth driver, we look at it as a way to dispose of access in a -- in a brand appropriate way.","So we -- we're not too upset when we see outlet suffer a bit. It's notable that our brick and mortar did grow as well as our digital, right. So we see growth in full price. Both channels in our full price and the drag was in our outlet business.","Alexandra Walvis","Thanks so much guys. Good luck.","Steven Rendle","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Bob Drbul of Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead.","Robert Drbul","Hi guys. Good morning. I was wondering on the Timberland on the Timberland business, you know the variation between the plus seven in the U.S. and the other regions see what's working in the U.S. and you know can you talk about Europe and Asia a little bit more in terms of where that brand is, and given your outlook?","And then, just was wondering if you could spend a few minutes just on the Dickey's business in terms of the current quarter versus the outlook and what do you guys expect to drive the rest of the year on the 4% to 6% increase?. Thanks.","Steven Rendle","Great. Why don\u2019t Scott I take -- I'll take Timberland, and Scott can you fill on in on Dickies. So Bob, where we are with Dick with Timberland is really interesting. You know our reset actions are in full motion. We've talked about this for a number of quarters, and I think first and foremost behind that is our desire to elevate the brand, from a creative standpoint, how that then impacts product from a merchandising design and development standpoint, but also the marketing and really raising the experiential aspects of this brand. And we're tracking on plan. We're a little bit behind where we would like to be from a results standpoint, and what's interesting as you look at the results for this quarter you know coming off of even last quarter is our U.S. business is doing it's doing better, is doing better because of lot of the efforts to realign their go-to-market disciplines, how they've segmented the product into specific dealers, and that we're seeing improved sell through on our classics products. But at the same time, we're seeing a really good sell through on our non-classics and that's the part of the diversification strategy that we've been working very very hard on.","And you've seeing that start to pay off here in the U.S. marketplace. When you look at Asia, we see strong sell through on the classics, and good sell-through on the non-classics and that's the continued work around right sizing the assortment to make sure that we're relevant across the broad based offer that we bring into the Asia and specifically China market.","In Europe, we're still in a recovery mode you know from the warm winter where we saw an impact on our classics business and that has carried through into spring and spring sell throughs. We continue to see our non-classics sell well in that marketplace, earlier as the impact of our classics that drove the European results. We remain very confident in our ability to manage this reset and drive ourselves to that mid-single digit commitment. We're a little bit behind where we'd like to be, that doesn't exactly make us happy. But the good news is we have the playbook. We understand how to execute it, as we continue to add to that leadership team on a global basis. The skill sets, the capabilities required to drive these actions are in place, and now it's just in our court to get the work done, to get the results to where we've committed to be.","Scott Roe","Yes, so Bob I'll take Dickies. So first of all it's really you've got to look by region. So in the Americas, we grew mid-single digits which is in line with our long range growth aspirations really, and international that that's put a drag on the quarter. Speaking first to Europe, we expect mid-single digit growth for Europe for the year and really we just see timing from quarter by quarter basis where we don't see a change in trajectory there just a little noise in the quarter. As it relates to Asia, the unfortunate thing is we had high teen growth in China and that's really been masked by some of the actions that we've taken. We call it a repositioning of Japan in the prepared remarks obviously that has a beginning and an end, it's episodic. As we look at both a few some categories and collaborations, which in our judgment have been done historically that are not appropriate with the long term health of the brand as well as in distribution choices that would fall in that same category.","So as our teams have gotten in, we've really torn apart the marketplace. We've looked at segmentation, we have decided that really this is a case of you know shrink to ground, pull back to us a solid foundation in Japan, so that we can then have a friend appropriate growth on a go forward basis.","I say it's unfortunate because, we see China as a really big opportunity for this Dickies lifestyle brand. The consumer interest in the brand, in the category, this work inspired apparel we think is a real growth factor for the coming years and we're pretty excited about the opportunity there.","Steven Rendle","Bob, if I may just add on the brand side. You saw us announced recently the appointment of a new brand president at Dickies. We\u2019ve brought on Danny Bruce, who has a history with VF. He was part of Vans when we acquired the business and went on to be involved in some really good consumer brands, and we're very fortunate to be able to bring him back because as we look at our Dickey's business and our work business, and we've talked about this is the opportunity to elevate the authenticity and the stories behind these really important brands and take them beyond the occupational side of the work, marketplace and move them into a work lifestyle application as well.","And you know Phillip Williamson has put the brand in a really strong place. He remains a partner in helping us really drive the brand from a core authentic standpoint, but bringing in Danny and his brand building skills, his business management, and international understanding we feel we've got the right person at the right time to really elevate and drive this brand forward.","Robert Drbul","Thanks, Steve. Thanks Scott.","Steven Rendle","Yup, Rob.","Operator","The next question is from Laurent Vasilescu of Macquarie Group. Please go ahead.","Laurent Vasilescu","Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. I want to follow up on the brick and mortar performance this quarter. It looks like it actually the revenues grew about mid teen rate versus the 3% increase in the number of stores year-over-year. Can you parse out how much how your store comps performed overall for the quarter, what your expectations are for the year and how many stores you plan to end the year with?","Steven Rendle","Yes. So I'll start at the end. From a store count we're at fourteen fiftyish as we put it out for 1427. We have about 15 net store openings for the year, obviously more than that from a growth standpoint as we're continuing the updating that portfolio. So that's in line with what we've talked about over the last several years. From a comp standpoint, we are -- our comp and our overall growth is obviously fairly comparable. So we're looking at a double digit comp on an overall basis, really led by our 29 or high high 20s percent growth from a digital standpoint.","So another way of saying that Laurent, what I think you're trying to get out is how much of the D2C guidance is led by store openings, it's very consistent with what we've seen over the last couple of years with that 50ish net store openings. Most of that is being driven by comp and our e-com is the largest contributor to that.","Laurent Vasilescu","That's great. Thank you very much for that. And I wanted to follow up on some modeling questions with you Scott. The $75 million and synergies called out last quarter. In today's press release, it looks like it's $13 million for the quarter, which included Icebreaker and Altra. How much of the 13 million was tied to the spend. How should we think about the cadence of next quarter?","And then lastly, the tax rate looks a little bit high on an adjusted basis for this quarter. Anything we should think about in terms of the tax rate for the by quarter?","Scott Roe","Yes. So I'll start at the end. So it\u2019s a small quarter and there's you know when you get small quarters, you get strange percentages. Overall we\u2019re going to see that tax rate in our guidance, 15% to 15.5%. Again it's the law of small numbers which kind of distorts that. Remind me the first part of your question, Laurent?","Laurent Vasilescu","Sure. It was about the synergy the 75 million called out last quarter. And then, of the [Indiscernible] million, yes.","Scott Roe","Yes. So that the synergies and our -- so we put out the 8-K and you can now you know we were estimating those numbers it's about 85 million for the full year. And you can actually see that, we break it out by quarter. So the short answer is, no new news from what we just put out, what was out a week and a half ago or so in the 8-K. And the 85 million, about half of that we expect to be covered by CSA. And that's pretty consistent with what we've been saying.","So you'll see that evolve relatively evenly through the quarters. Other there's a little noise on the TSA as those are slightly more back off loaded as you know the first quarter. We only had one month of TSAs is in the first quarter. So you'll see a full three months as a -- full three months per quarter as you move through the year.","Laurent Vasilescu","Very helpful. Thank you very much. And best of luck.","Scott Roe","Thank you, Laurent.","Operator","The next question is from Ike Boruchow of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Ike Boruchow","Hey good morning everyone let me add my congrats. Good way to start the year. Two questions, one on Van's, one on North Face. I guess first on Vans. You know just simply like kind of looking at it. It's the first quarter and in over a year where the global growth constant currency is actually accelerated you know which is pretty impressive given the strong numbers. I guess, I'm just curious Steve or Scott, is there something product launch specific that occurred in the quarter or anything that made 1Q abnormally strong for lack of a better word.","Scott Roe","Yes. Ike, I'll start on that. One thing I would say is if you think about the soft landing that we've talked about I would encourage you to zoom out a click and look at the overall trend and not isolate too much on one particular quarter. Last quarter, the bears were saying oh here we go, and you know the bulls may come out this quarter and say where we're in the new world.","We see this as an orchestrated soft landing over a long period of time. It's hard to predict the exact shape of that curve, but we don't fundamentally see ourselves in a different place. I think it is very encouraging now in the quarter to see the strength of the slip on franchise. Remember, there that business is not just one thing the way they manage their icons. And so while the old school remains strong, we saw the resurgence or the acceleration of slip on. That didn't happen by accident. That's been a very managed and orchestrated series of events whether it's in-store from demand creation online, communication, the loyalty communication, which is at 8.5 million people at this point. So again, I would say what this quarter says to us is, we have it's just another proof point in our ability to manage this franchise over a long period of time, and gives us more confidence on that long term drive. That's how we've view it.","Steven Rendle","I would just add some real quickly. I mean, it really is validation of the team's intense focus on their consumer, the commitment to driving the product both from the Heritage standpoint you see that in the slip on and the old school, but really strong results coming from the progressive portion of their product line as well as apparel. So you know executing against their product grid, but it's really, it's how they create the excitement around the brand. I know you saw the waffle heads campaign and really celebrating creative self-expression in -- the in the artists and makers out there who are tailoring their Van shoes to be very personal and individualistic. Just how the brand is able to bring those stories to life to, to elevate those individuals and drive their vision around creative self-expression keeps his brand at the forefront of their very specific consumer base.","And Scott mentioned, the loyalty programs continues to grow in their ability to shape one to one conversations with a very high percentage of that, of that loyalty base, really helps them manage that conversation and keep those consumers growing in loyalty and interest.","Ike Boruchow","Got it. And then just a quick one on North Face. So the global growth has been strong double digits for almost a year now. Trends have been strong. You've got Steve; you talked about FutureLight coming in a few months. You had the ability to put another 20 million in investment behind it to drive up some demand creation. I guess, Steve can you kind of frame maybe FutureLight just to help us out you know how does this rank maybe internally, are there some examples of product launches either for North Face or another brand in the portfolio that gave you this level of excitement? I'm just trying to understand just how excited internally you guys are, and what this could actually be to the brand because all the reeds do seem to be very very bullish so far.","Steven Rendle","Great. I'm happy to talk to you about that. So you know FutureLight, when it hit the marketplace last year, it really is, it's a it's a breakthrough idea in a very important category of the outdoor apparel marketplace. And there's not been a breakthrough in waterproof breathable technology to this level in many many years. I think, what gives us such confidence in a validation to put even more resources behind this launch is it's such a breakthrough idea, that we want to make sure that we're able to tell this story in the most clear, powerful way in those channels of distribution be it our own. And in the specialty channels where this product will be placed, it's able to break through and draw the consumers in to experience it.","Because once you experience it, you understand just how different it is from some of the historical waterproof breathables you know that we've all become accustomed to using. It's important to remember that the way the North Face has positioned the product in its assortment this fall is at the very high end of their outdoor or mountain products in the Summit Series and in the Steep Series. So it does not have a broad assortment. It's very targeted in those most technical pieces. That's the absolute right place to start it.","And then over time it will start to cascade through the broader rainwear assortment, and it will then will be followed with gen 2 and gen 3 iterations that the brand has line of sight too. So it is a breakthrough idea. It's validation that the innovation focus is very clear at the North Face and they're starting to line these ideas up to bring new exciting ideas to draw consumers to the brand, not just in the outdoor technical side, but also how this comes across the lifestyle and the urban exploration piece to talk to that broader based outdoor lifestyle consumer.","Ike Boruchow","Got it. Thanks guys.","Operator","The next question is from Sam Poser of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","SamPoser","Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. A couple of things. Can you -- did you talk about how the market place is relative, let's say the last year coming into the fall season at North Face? What you're seeing in the retailers and your own stores, you talked about know what was going on in your outlets already?","Steven Rendle","Sure. I don't know if that's an inventory question, Sam. I guess what we see in the outdoor segment is a set of retailers that are doing well. I think everybody has learned their lesson over the years. No one is, I think coming at this season in a really robust and overt way. I think there's very you know a lot of thought goes into the assortments to manage inventory properly. We've talked in the past about how our teams continue to evolve our practices around interacting with individual retailers not only on the sell in, you know based on the prior year sell through, but really staying in contact and in step through the season, watching sell through and making sure that we've got the right products in place you know to deliver against our sales and margin commitment to those individual retailers.","So we see we see a healthy marketplace. We see a marketplace that's thoughtful, and you know sitting in a in a much more healthy place from an inventory standpoint. I would tell you Europe had a \u2013 like we mentioned you know the warm winter as it impacted Timberland. The outdoor segment in Europe is healthy despite a warm winter last year, and I think it comes back to just thoughtful management of selling based on sell through and staying in step with our retailers to assure that our portion of their retail store is operating at the best level.","SamPoser","Thank you. And then you mentioned urban exploration. How is -- is that are we going to see more of that? Is that going to come more into the states and expand on a more global basis, are we going to start seeing that this year? And then lastly, where are you in sort of taking, I'll use the word, the pull model that you've created with Vans and really I would say forcefully create you know putting that in place if it's with North Face, with Timberland and your other brands as well?","Steven Rendle","Sure. So on urban exploration, I mean it's an important part of the North Face expression. And it will you see it grow? Certainly, but in a very thoughtful and I think methodical way. I mean urban exploration you know oftentimes is thought about the things that we see happening in Asia specifically, Japan and that is an important element of the design and the inspiration. But sitting within urban exploration are some very key icons from 40, 50 years ago within the North Face team, manages those icons you know within that that portion of the line, just helps build that pole and that interest you know to the more urban consumer. I think Sam you've probably been to the store in Brooklyn, you know where the North Face has an urban exploration, retail store. And we were able to really understand you know what parts of our line, both driven from you know the global offer but we also offer some of our Japanese partners products there and have seen really nice you know sell through and in connections.","So it will continue for sure, but it's a it's a small percentage of the total North Face offer and they'll manage it accordingly. To your question on the Vans poll I mean, there's a lot of cross-brands sharing. One of the reasons that we've asked our outdoor brands to come to Denver and co-locate is to be able to get an accelerated and even more intimate cross-brand selling opportunity through co-location we see that worked really well in our Swiss and Hong Kong offices. By moving to the center of the country, we've already seen our Vans team here in Denver more often than we would have in North Carolina.","And that is exactly one of the other reasons. So that the sharing and the ability to really speak about best practices across these key areas of brand experience, digital investments, how we're driving loyalty, using that data to speak to consumers, that sharing is going on a day to day basis, and the investments that we're making behind the platforms that enable that kind of work to be done, are central and have been a big part of that event enhanced investments that you've seen over the last two years. So we absolutely see that as a key part of each of our brands growth, not just the North Face.","SamPoser","Thank you very much and a continued success.","Steven Rendle","Thank you, Sam.","Scott Roe","Thanks Sam.","Operator","The next question is from Jim Duffy of Stifel. Please go ahead.","JimDuffy","Thanks and good morning. I wanted to ask about Van\u2019s loyalty program. Pretty impressive growth in membership in a fairly short period of time. Can you guys speak about some of the behavioral patterns you're seeing from these consumers? Any data on the frequency of purchase, assortment range, channel shopping behavior, that type of thing?","Steven Rendle","Well that's a good question. Jim, I don't I don't have that specific data in front of me. We do know that this consumer has a much higher rate of frequency. They're much much enhanced element of loyalty. The assortment that they're drawing from I think is represented in the results. You know we see the heritage product, scaling through slip on and old school, but we're seeing really nice growth in a lot of the progressive styles.","So I think the assortment would be well represented within that loyalty base consistent with what we're seeing from the sell through. The key here, is to drive greater loyalty and is to drive a much more personalized conversation might come in around the one to one messaging, and in the data and data science capabilities being built advanced is to really drive that one to one relationships so that we're talking to you about relevant products at a relevant time of year. And then we're able to introduce to you new ideas, consistent with your purchase patterns, but also you know the events and the in-store interactions that we've had with you just making that much more of an intimate relevant one to one interaction and that really sits at the core of the work what the Vans team is doing.","JimDuffy","Point of clarification on the membership program. In the presentation, 8.5 million members is listed under the Americas commentary. Is that just an Americas number or are there plans to expand the program globally?","Steven Rendle","There -- that is a global number. And it is live in Europe today. It went live last fall, and the loyalty program will roll out in Asia. It's well in a manner that we're able to do in the Asian marketplace, but it's predominantly the Americas that's where that work is done. But we did bring a loyalty live you know last year in Europe.","JimDuffy","Great. Thanks.","Steven Rendle","Thanks Jeff.","Operator","That's all the time we have for questions today. I would like to turn the call back over to Steve Randall for closing remarks.","Steven Rendle","Well thank you everybody here for joining us today. We're excited with where we are. You know the moves that we took last year and the position we find ourselves in at this time of year just gives us confidence to deliver against our commitments for the year and we look forward to seeing you here in September. We know we owe you an update to our five year strategy. There\u2019s been a lot of change and evolution since we launched that in Boston in 2017 and we look forward to being able to share that with you here in the Rocky Mountains in September. So thank you again for joining us today.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."],"21566":["VF Corp.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time I would like to turn the call over to Joe Alkire, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Joe Alkire - VF Corp.","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to VF Corporation's First Quarter 2017 Conference Call. I'd like to remind everyone that participants on today's call will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These uncertainties are detailed in documents filed regularly with the SEC.","Unless otherwise noted, amounts that our participants refer to on today's call will be predominately in adjusted and currency neutral terms, which we define in the press release that was issued this morning. We use adjusted and currency neutral amounts as lead numbers in our discussion, because we feel they more accurately represent the true operational performance and underlying results of our business.","You may also hear us refer to reported amounts, which are in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reconciliations of GAAP measures to adjusted and currency neutral amounts can be found in the supplemental financial tables included in the press release, which identify and quantify all excluded items and provide management's view of why this information is useful to investors.","During the second quarter of 2017, VF announced it had reached an agreement to sell its License Sports Group, or LSG, business to Fanatics Inc. In conjunction with the LSG divestiture, VF executed its plan to entirely exit the Licensing business, which comprises the LSG and JanSport brand collegiate businesses.","Accordingly, the company classified the assets and liabilities of these businesses as held for sale and included the results of these businesses in discontinued operations for all periods presented.","During the third quarter of 2016, the company completed the sale of its Contemporary Brands businesses. Accordingly, the company has classified the assets and liabilities of Contemporary Brands businesses as held for sale as of March 2016 and included the results of those businesses in discontinued operations for all periods presented. Unless otherwise noted, results presented on today's call are based on continuing operations.","Joining me on today's call will be VF President and CEO, Steve Rendle; and Chief Financial Officer, Scott Roe. Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call for questions. Steve?","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2017 earnings call. VF's first quarter results were right in line with our expectations. Our growth engines continue to deliver solid results, despite a retail backdrop that continues to experience disruption and consolidation, particularly here in the United States.","Overall revenue was down 1% during the quarter, but this doesn't tell the whole story. The momentum we see building in our largest brands and in our international and direct-to-consumer platforms is strong. And our first quarter results give me confidence in our expectation for accelerated growth as we move through 2017.","For the quarter Vans, The North Face, and Timberland grew at a combined rate of 4% with strength in The North Face and Vans, which grew 8% and 7% respectively. Our international business grew 5%, and our China business delivered an impressive 10% growth rate. Direct-to-consumer grew 7%, including a mid-single digit comp. And our digital business was up more than 25%. We're really pleased with this solid performance.","Operational discipline and sharp focus on fundamentals led to a 190 basis point improvement in our gross margin during the quarter. Our gross margin drivers remain intact. And our strong margin expansion will fuel investment in our strategic priorities and provide flexibility as we execute against our 2021 plan. It's an important and sustainable part of our model.","EPS was down 3% to $0.52 in the first quarter. That being said, know that our earnings growth was negatively impacted by 8 percentage points due to a higher tax rate. That means that our EPS growth would've been 5% excluding the tax headwind. Scott will cover this in more detail later in the call.","One of the core pillars of our strategy is to reshape our portfolio. We've shared with you in detail the strategic and financial filters we use to evaluate our existing portfolio and also our acquisition pipeline.","In early April we announced that VF had signed an agreement to sell our LSG business to Fanatics. This announcement is another example of our work as active portfolio managers and our intention to move faster. On a personal note the LSG and JanSport collegiate employees have been part of the VF family for many years, and I thank them for their service and wish them all continued success.","Pace of change in our industry and the broader consumer landscape is accelerating. The choices and capabilities embedded in our 2021 strategic growth plan positions us to win and will serve as a catalyst for VF's accelerated growth. We will become a more agile and consumer centric organization. We will reshape our portfolio. And we are a diversified value creation company.","So with that let's dive into our first quarter results and look at our top five brands and Workwear.","Starting with The North Face. Global revenue was up 8% with strength in the Americas and Europe offset by a slight decline in Asia-Pacific, which we did expect. Excluding the impact of bankruptcies in the Americas business, which didn't really impact us until the second half of 2016, global revenue for The North Face was up at a low double digit rate. Our revenue growth during the quarter was balanced with low double digit growth in D2C and mid-single digit growth in wholesale.","By region, Americas grew 4%, driven by low teen growth in D2C with strong results from e-commerce, which grew nearly 20%. This was offset by a low single digit decrease in wholesale due to the impact of the bankruptcies. From a product standpoint, rainwear performed well in the quarter, driven by the launch of our new Apex Flex Gore-Tex jacket, which provides comfort and protection coupled with a new fit and aesthetic.","In Europe, The North Face was up 19% as its strong momentum continued. The wholesale business was particularly solid with growth of nearly 30%. The business remains well-balanced with strong results across all product categories and channels, which we expect to continue for the balance of the year.","In Asia, as expected, first quarter revenue was down 1%, as low double digit growth in D2C was offset by a high single digit decline in wholesale. As the outdoor environment remains highly promotional in China, we continue to consolidate our retail partners and aggressively manage inventory in the marketplace. We continue to expect high single digit growth in 2017, primarily weighted toward the second half.","While revenue growth at The North Face was slightly above our expectations for the first quarter, there's no change to our outlook for mid-single digit revenue growth for the brand in 2017.","Now switching to Vans. Global revenue was up 7% with broad based growth across all regions of the world and all product franchises. From a channel perspective, D2C increased at a high teen rate, while wholesale was flat, as growth in the Americas and Asia was offset by an expected decline in Europe.","Vans Americas business was up 6%, driven by low double digit D2C growth, including more than 20% growth in e-commerce. The wholesale business increased at a low single digit rate. As you'd expect our wide range of product continues to resonate with consumers, with Classics and particularly the Old Skool fueling success in D2C and wholesale.","And building on our commitment to deep consumer connectivity, the brand opened a permanent House of Vans in Chicago, a pop-up House of Vans in Toronto, and three pop-up House of Vans locations in Mexico.","In Europe, the Vans turnaround story continues to take hold with 1% growth during the quarter. Our D2C business remains strong, with 20% growth driven by a 30% increase in e-commerce and a high-teen comp growth. As expected, wholesale declined at a low single digit rate. With inventory levels in the channel now normalizing and double digit growth in our fall order book, we're on track to deliver high single digit growth in Europe in 2017.","In Asia, for the third consecutive quarter Vans delivered more than 20% growth. This was fueled by more than 50% growth in D2C with strength across all markets driven by exceptional growth in the digital space in China. Wholesale increased at a mid-single digit rate with strength in China and Korea. Looking to 2017, we are confident in our low double digit growth outlook for the Vans brand.","In line with our expectations Timberland global revenue decreased 4% with low single digit growth in D2C and high single digit decline in wholesale. Revenue in the Americas decreased 7%, as mid-single digit growth in our D2C business, including almost 30% growth in e-commerce, was offset by a low double digit decline in wholesale.","We continue to work on diversifying our business toward a more balanced assortment, which will reduce our reliance on Classic boots in the Americas region. This is the strategy we outlined at the Investor Day, and it's the same successful strategy that has led to more consistent balanced growth in our international business.","While not yet to scale in the Americas, we are seeing tremendous success in our men's casual platforms, such as SensorFlex and AeroCore. Our D2C business has the right assortment. And the growth we are seeing gives us confidence that we have the right strategy.","However, the product transition in the wholesale channel will take a little longer to play out. As we diversify the assortment, and our retail partners work through inventory in the boot category, we expect the Americas business to return to growth in the second half of 2017.","Timberland revenue in Europe was in line with 2016 levels, as low single digit growth in D2C was offset by flat revenue in wholesale. As expected, wholesale revenue in the quarter was impacted by timing of shipments in our distributor business. We expect Timberland Europe to return to growth in the second quarter and for growth to accelerate into the high single digit range in the second half of 2017, supported by the order book, which is now fully allocated.","Revenue in Timberland's Asia business was down 5%. D2C declined a mid-single digit rate, as strong e-commerce growth in China and low single digit comp growth was offset by our decision to reduce underperforming doors in some of our mature markets. Wholesale was down at a high single digit rate.","For 2017 we continue to expect Timberland to grow in the low single digit range. We expect the brand to return to growth in the second quarter and for growth to accelerate in the second half of the year, as our international business gains momentum, and we continue to evolve our product segmentation and assortment in the Americas.","Looking at Wrangler, global revenue for the first quarter was down 9% with low double digit growth in D2C more than offset by a low double digit decline in wholesale. In the Americas region a low teen revenue decline in the U.S. offset high teen growth in our non-U.S. Americas business. And revenue in Europe and Asia declined at a low single digit rate for the quarter.","As we've discussed, our U.S. business has been impacted by inventory destocking related to the strategic repositioning of a key customer and continued channel consolidation. These actions will affect our business primarily in the first half and growth should return by year end. We're working closely with our key retail partners. But our visibility regarding timing is low and the variability is hard to predict.","While quarter-to-quarter forecasting will be difficult, our past experience tells us several things that we can expect once the repositioning is complete. First, strong brands like Wrangler will command even stronger positions, as smaller brands are edited out. And second, superior supply chain and replenishment capabilities give us an advantaged position.","Regarding product, this week we announced that we are expanding our offerings for the spring season with a men's collection that is built for the outdoors. The Wrangler Outdoor line incorporates multifunctional features ideal for the outdoor enthusiast. Made of performance materials that keep the wearer cool, dry, and comfortable, these products also feature UPF 30 to protect the consumer from the sun. This is a perfect example of our efforts to transform Wrangler into more of a lifestyle brand, while keeping it connected to its heritage and its loyal consumer.","Switching to Lee, revenue declined 6% during the quarter with mid-teen growth in D2C offset by a high single digit decline in wholesale. Low single digit growth in Europe, Asia, and our non-U.S. Americas business was offset by a low double digit decline in the U.S.","BODY OPTIX continues to perform well in Asia, comprising about 25% of our women's business. We plan to bring this to Europe and to North America later this fall.","In the U.S. our men's business continues to deliver solid growth, as X-Treme Comfort Khakis and Extreme Motion denim continue to resonate with the Lee consumer. However, ongoing channel weakness and challenging conditions in our women's business are impacting results. For 2017, we continue to expect Jeanswear revenue to be in line with 2016 levels.","And finally, I'd like to highlight Workwear, the business we recently presented as a new growth platform for VF. Workwear, which includes our Image business as well as Timberland PRO and Wrangler RIGGS Workwear, increased 1% during the quarter. Our Image business was negatively impacted by the timing of a government contract between Q4 and Q1 and declined 5%. However, our largest brands within Workwear were strong, as the recovery in the industrial sector continues.","Timberland PRO grew 15%, Bulwark was up 17%, and Wrangler RIGGS Workwear increased 13%. Given our expectation for accelerated growth through the balance of 2017 and the inherent profitability of this business, we are even more optimistic about the Workwear opportunity.","And with that I'll turn it over to Scott.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Thanks, Steve. Before I cover the first quarter in detail, let me provide a few comments regarding the LSG transaction and how it impacted our first quarter results relative to the outlook we provided in February.","As you know, in early April we announced that we had reached an agreement with Fanatics to sell our LSG business. The sale price is about $225 million pre-tax, subject to working capital and other adjustments. And we expect to close this transaction very shortly.","In conjunction with the sale of LSG we are also exiting the Licensing business of JanSport collegiate. Accordingly, the results of these businesses have been classified as discontinued ops, and the prior periods have been adjusted.","In 2016 these businesses contributed about $575 million of revenue and roughly $0.13 of EPS. We provided an income statement in the press release issued this morning excluding the Licensing business, so you can see the full impact.","Relative to the first quarter of 2017, before restructuring and other charges triggered by the transaction, these businesses contributed about $0.03 of EPS during the quarter. So relative to the outlook we provided in February, our LSG and JanSport collegiate businesses contributed about $130 million of revenue. And our continuing operations EPS of $0.52 would've been $0.55 on a like-for-like basis.","So with that out of the way, let's review the first quarter results. In line with our expectations, revenue was down 1% on a currency neutral basis to $2.6 billion. Our growth engines delivered solid results in the quarter. Our big three brands were up 4% on a combined basis with particular strength in The North Face and Vans, which grew 8% and 7%, respectively. And as the industrial recovery continues to evolve, Bulwark, Timberland PRO, and Wrangler RIGGS grew at a mid-teen rate.","Our international business grew 5%, and China remained particularly strong with 10% growth. And our Direct to Consumer business was up 7% in the quarter, including more than 25% growth in our Digital business. Now to unpack our Direct to Consumer results a little further, our Outdoor & Action Sports, Jeanswear, and international businesses all achieved low double digit growth during the quarter.","Wholesale revenue was down 4% due to a key customer's inventory action in our Jeanswear North American business, the impact of bankruptcies in Outdoor & Action Sports, and difficult conditions in the department store channel, which continue to pressure our Sportswear businesses. In contrast, our international wholesale delivered low single digit growth, and our digital wholesale accounts grew at a combined rate in the mid-teens.","I want to take a few minutes to provide more context around our outlook for the Jeanswear business in 2017. There is no change to our outlook of about flat revenue for the year. Our international business remains solid, with particular strength in Europe and Asia, where we expect low to mid-single digit growth this year. We continue to expect our business in North America to decline at a low single digit rate, as a result of the previously mentioned inventory destocking. This impact will primarily be in the first half.","Now, despite the short-term noise, it's important to keep focused on the end game. We are confident that our Jeanswear brands are strong and our superior supply chain places us in an advantaged position, once the process is complete. However, our visibility regarding timing is low. Therefore, the quarter to quarter variability will be hard to predict.","Gross margin remained strong at 50.2%, up 150 basis points on a reported basis, which included a 40 basis point negative impact for FX. That's a 190-basis-point increase on a currency-neutral basis. As we mentioned in February, we are sharply focused on fundamentals and willing to sacrifice a little growth in the near term for quality. Our efforts are clearly paying off in the gross margin line. And we believe our decisions will improve the long-term health of both our brands and the marketplace.","SG&A as a percentage of revenue was up 200 basis points to 38.9%. While we remain diligent with respect to overall expense control in light of the growth environment, we continue to invest in strategic priorities, D2C, and in particular, digital, product innovation, demand creation, and technology. In fact, while our overall SG&A expense was up just 3%, investments and strategic priorities accounted for more than all of that increase, as our focus on agility and cost optimization allowed us to reduce cost elsewhere.","And as our growth accelerates in the second half and we begin to realize the full benefits of our agility and optimization efforts, we expect to drive significant leverage in our SG&A ratio in the second half and into 2018.","First quarter operating margin declined 50 basis points to 11.3%, primarily as a result of the negative impact of changes in foreign currency. On a currency neutral basis our operating margin during the quarter was down 10 basis points to 11.7%.","So carrying all this to the bottom line, our EPS declined 3% on a currency neutral basis to $0.52 in the quarter. However, our EPS rate was negatively impacted by 8 percentage points due to lower discrete tax benefits, primarily as a result of the adoption of the equity comp accounting standard last year. Excluding the discrete tax impact, EPS on a currency neutral basis was up at a mid-single digit rate.","Turning to our balance sheet. Our inventory increased 2%. And as promised, we continued to return capital to shareholders, as we repurchased about $440 million of stock. As we announced in March, our board has approved a new $5 billion share repurchase program to support the capital allocation priorities we laid out in our 2021 plan.","As we look to the balance of 2017, we are updating our outlook to incorporate the sale of the Licensing business. Reported revenue is still expected to be up at a low single digit rate, including about a 2 percentage point negative impact from foreign currency. However, this is off an adjusted 2016 base to reflect the sale of LSG. We expect gross margin to improve about 20 basis points to 49.6%, which includes a 70 basis point headwind from FX.","Operating margin is still expected to approximate 14% on a reported basis, including about a 60 basis point negative impact from FX.","Currency neutral EPS is still expected to be up at a mid-single digit rate in 2017 or down at a low single digit rate compared to 2016 adjusted EPS of $2.98.","While there is no change to our currency neutral revenue and EPS outlook for the full year, I'd like to make a few comments relative to the first outlook \u2013 first half outlook we provided in February.","First, our Licensing business contributed about $0.03 to $0.04 of EPS per quarter during 2016, so that should help you think about your models. Second, as we mentioned, our visibility in Jeanswear North America is low, and the quarter-to-quarter variability is hard to predict right now. While there is no change to our annual outlook for Jeanswear, it's hard to predict which side of the Q2\/Q3 quarter break orders may fall. As a result, were providing an EPS outlook in a range of $0.27 to $0.30 for the second quarter.","So in closing, the first quarter of our 2021 strategic plan played out as expected. We are confident in our mid-single digit earnings growth outlook for 2017 and in our ability to accelerate growth in the second half. We are focused on fundamentals and becoming a more agile and retail centric organization. And we are committed to becoming a more active portfolio manager, while delivering top-quartile TSR through our diversified model. We are a value creation company.","And with that I'll turn it back over to the operator, and we'll open up the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. We'll go first to Laurent Vasilescu of Macquarie.","Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Morning, and thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on the 4% decline in the wholesale business. I think in the prepared remarks I think it was noted that it was primarily due to a key U.S. customer. Any sense what the wholesale business would've looked like if we strip out that customer?","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Well, you're right, Laurent. It was driven by the U.S. customer, particularly in our Jeans business. But we also called out our Sportswear business was a little tough in the quarter as well. So I think if you stripped those out, really if you look, our \u2013 we did see growth in our larger brands as well as our international business. And also importantly our digital accounts as well, we saw mid-teen growth.","Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Very helpful. And then on international revenues I wanted to follow up on last quarter's guide that Europe and Asia would both grow at a high single digit rate for the year. In light of the first quarter results for those regions can you possibly walk us through how we should think about those regions? How they'll grow in the first half versus the second half?","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Well, I think I'll start with Europe. We are seeing \u2013 the largest acceleration in the second half will be in our Vans business. This has been a really great story over the last several quarters, where we've seen sequential improvement. In fact we returned to growth, although it was modest, in the first quarter.","But based on the order book we see going forward, we're seeing double digit positive order books in Europe. And that's going to be a big driver. That has been a big driver consistently in our Europe business. And we're really excited to see that come roaring back, because that's also a very profitable business. As CFO I like that.","Also on the second half our digital business, our e-comm, is where we see the majority of that. It's more second half weighted. And based on the trends, while the trends won't necessarily get larger as a percentage, the absolute amount of business is larger, as well as the openings that we've had from a D2C standpoint in the first half, as those start to pay off in the second half. So generally, that's the trend we see in both regions, which gives us confidence. Steve?","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","And, Laurent, I would just add a little bit there. I mean clearly it is the return of strong growth with our Vans business. I mentioned we have a very strong back half order book.","But it's also the continued growth and the high level performance from our North Face brand in Europe. Our Timberland brand comes back to very strong growth as we see our expanded apparel offer, a stronger women's offer coming into the second half.","But we also \u2013 it's the strength of our Vans brand in Asia that continues to drive that strong double digit growth and gives us confidence in that back half growth.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","More than 20% growth in Asia, right?","Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Very helpful. Best of luck.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Binetti of UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Morning, Michael.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","I just wanted to ask a couple modeling things really quickly. On the FX we've seen that \u2013 it's been pretty volatile here recently. I was actually a little surprised to see that it was still just a 2% estimate in your \u2013 the way that you're modeling it for the year on the impact to revenue for the year. Is that \u2013 I mean is that \u2013 would you mind helping us with how you're pegging the euro or maybe the pound on that? Just so we understand what you're looking at in case things change more through this quarter, which obviously they could, tend to be volatile.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Sure, Michael. So we looked at the last 90 days basically average and that's essentially what we've \u2013 for all our basket of currencies. And yeah, some of them are positive like the euro and others not as much. But what we've done is we've looked about at the last 90 days and gone \u2013 projected that going forward.","So if the currencies, if the dollar continues to weaken, could that be a tailwind for us? Yeah, it could. But based on what we're seeing right now in our forward projections, we're not counting on that trend continuing. And it's slightly beneficial, but it's not material to the overall results.","The other thing I'd just remind everybody is about 80% of our transactional exposure is hedged. So from an in-country profitability standpoint, there is some variability, but not a lot.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Right. And then I think just you mentioned something I think around Timberland. But I was surprised to see it looks like only about four net new store openings in the quarter versus last quarter. It sounded like you had a couple closures, though.","Maybe we could get a little bit of context behind how you're thinking about the seasonality of the store openings this year. Because I think if we just look at some of the longer term run rates you gave us at the Analyst Day, it looks like that you'd be opening at a lot faster pace than what you reported in the first quarter.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Yes. Maybe I'll start there. So one of the things that we said, Michael, is that we're going to take a hard look at the productivity of our stores and profitability. And in Asia and in particular, we have a large business in some of the more mature markets like Japan there. Where frankly, we've struggled a bit. And we've taken a step back from a store footprint there based on productivity.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. I guess just one last one. I think you had a \u2013 for North Face you had a competitor I guess this week talking about a little bit more of a cautious outlook for the U.S. on orders through the year, which is unusual from the standpoint of the first quarter, taking a more cautious outlook for the year. Can you just talk about your North Face outlook in the Americas? Obviously the Europe numbers are great. But for the Americas this year, what gives you confident in the order book you have today? And how much variability there is around those numbers if things change through the year?","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Sure. I'll grab that one, Michael. As you heard, we reaffirmed our mid-single digit growth outlook for the year. Really happy with our first quarter results, as we came through the colder January, February. And then the launch of some new products here at the back half of Q1.","I think the key here is, as we came through last year and the decisions that we made to clean up the marketplace and focus on, first, quality sales, the orders that we have in hand are really driven against the sell-through we saw last year and very thoughtful growth rates across each of the wholesale partners that we have.","There's some new products coming in our higher end Summit Series, some new ski and snowboard styles that are giving us confidence with that wholesale distribution.","But I think the key here also is our D2C is performing really well. And we see our digital platform driving strong growth. And certainly that's the higher quality product offer, but it's also the impact of a cleaner marketplace and not having to compete with a large amount of off-priced goods, some ours, some others. But I think that all of that kind of aggregate gives us confidence against that mid-single digit outlook that we just reaffirmed","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Ike Boruchow of Wells Fargo.","Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Good morning.","Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Just a question. I wanted to focus on Timberland in the U.S. So I'm just trying to look at the numbers. And D2C is up mid-singles, so it looks like with the current product you have, things look good. And the wholesale channel is down low double digits. So just kind of curious if you could contextualize it. How much of it is just a channel inventory issue, and you just need that to get kind of cleaned up, versus the current product pipeline performance?","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Yeah. So I think you've characterized it really well. We talked at the Investor Day, and I think we really see that continuing right now is our \u2013 a little bit more dependent on boots here in the U.S. than we see in other parts of the world, specifically Europe. And a lot of work going on right now to work on product segmentation and really leveling the different franchises that sit within each of the different channel partners.","We are moving through some boot inventory, as we place our SensorFlex and AeroCore franchises at a better rate. But where we are able to get that front and center is in our own D2C. And that is where we're seeing really strong reactions. And in our e-commerce platform where we were up 30%.","So it's really moving through inventory. It's getting \u2013 really creating the space to place these new franchises and using the proof points that we see in our own D2C here in the U.S. But also the performance that we've seen in our European platform in taking those learnings back here to our domestic market.","Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. That's helpful. And if I could, Scott, one more for you on the Jeanswear side. I'm just trying to make sure I understand. So on one hand it sounds like you're saying you think the Jeanswear business could begin to improve in the back half of this year. But I thought you were \u2013 you discussed at the Analyst Day that you didn't really expect the pressure in that segment to abate until early 2019. And that's why you thought the business would start to inflect more on the top line at that point.","Can you help me just kind of understand? I mean I know you don't have a lot of visibility, given what's going on there right now.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Yeah. Yeah.","Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","But just how do I take those two comments and think about them?","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Yeah. So first of all, as you think about the pace of the year, we're going to see sequential improvement as the year progresses. And if you think about it just kind of big picture, you got a destocking that's occurring through the first half, which is again one of the reasons we talked about the variability and lack of visibility, is we don't fully control the timing of how markdowns and floors are cleared and all that. That's our customers' decision, right? Not ours.","But we know where we're going to end up at the end. And at the end of the year \u2013 by the end of the year we should, according to their plans, be through the destocking phase and getting into the new floor set by the end of the year. We have visibility to what programs we have. We know what the expectations are. But the way this is laying out is a narrower assortment with higher velocity. And again, these are a lot of assumptions.","So we should see that higher velocity start to pay off in the second half. And that's what I meant by the acceleration by the end of the year.","Now if you zoom out a click and go back to the Investor Day, we know that there are a number of factors in that channel of distribution which cause variability. One of those is the repositioning of a major customer. There's other customers that have been closing doors. And there's other disruptions that are occurring.","So my comments at the Investor Day were more of a broader picture, to say that while quarter to quarter we could see some disruption and choppiness, if you keep the end game in mind and think about the big picture here, we really like where we're going to end up once all this plays out. Right?","That is, we own the strongest brand in that category with the Wrangler brand. We know that in a narrower assortment, big brands win. And there's more focus on replenishment and quick supply chain capabilities. That plays right into our strengths.","So, one of those comments is more tactical. Just it's going to be really hard quarter to quarter to thread the needle exactly on what we expect. But we know where the end game is. And the other is, if you keep your eye on the prize here, we like strategically where we're going to end up in the jeans section, given what we believe are some core advantages, strength of brand and strength of supply chain.","Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. Thanks a lot.","Operator","We'll go next to Omar Saad of Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Thanks for taking my question.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Morning, Omar.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Morning. Wanted to talk to you about kind of a dichotomy between the U.S. trends in the business here versus in Europe and Asia, where there seems to be a growing kind of separation.","Do you feel like that some of the challenges in the U.S. and the wholesale channel and promotionality going on over here, do you feel like these issues are going to stay confined to the American market, the North American market? And there's \u2013 Europe and Asia are structurally different industries and those challenges can be avoided in those markets? Or do you think they eventually flow globally, kind of from an industry level?","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","I'll try to answer that question, Omar. Some of that is looking at a crystal ball. But what I would say, what we see in our international business, where really things are not necessarily that much easier, our brands are doing extremely well. The thoughtful approach to segmentation and really placing the right product collections in each of these distribution channel partners' doors. And how we're using our retail and digital platforms to build our brands' breadth and depth with consumer is helping us outperform the marketplace.","Here in the U.S. it's clear that we've got ourselves in a really uneven and inconsistent performance. But there are retailers and there are brands that are doing well in this marketplace. We're going to settle through retail closures. We all read the same reports.","But I think the thing that we all need to really remember is that strong brands that have a very authentic connection with consumers, that are delivering unique products that provide consumers the opportunity to enjoy the experiences that they look for, position brands to succeed in this marketplace.","We'll navigate this because of the strength of our portfolio. And it's really the learnings that we take in our European and Asia markets that are helping us fine tune our approach to segmentation and the use of the various product collections in those channels that's giving us confidence that we'll navigate it.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Yeah. I'd just add on to that, Omar. There are some fundamental differences. The U.S., we all look at the same numbers, right? The U.S. is over-stored as a general statement, much more than what you would see in Europe and Asia. So that's one issue.","Also remember the relative time in market and maturity of our brands are less internationally. So we have a lot of room to run there, just from penetration and an expansion standpoint. So if you think about our business vis-\u00e0-vis those markets, that's how we look at it.","And lastly, in the U.S., while its macro trends are certainly true, and again we've tried to say we will see disruption and choppiness as certain contractions and consolidations happen. There are clear winners out there, too, right? And we are winning with those winning retailers. And that's another reason why from a strategic standpoint, we've really pivoted and focused on our D2C and particularly our digital business.","And you might remember from the Investor Day, 85% of our growth is coming from digital and digital partners. And of that 15% that's essentially in international.","So in the next five years, we're not expecting much on a net basis from wholesale in the U.S. We will be winning disproportionately with some vendors. And we're also expecting that there will be continued consolidation that's going to occur over the next five years","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","That's really helpful, guys. Could I also ask a question about Timberland? That business continues to strengthen a little bit. Do you feel like you've got the right strategy and plan in place for that brand? Or is it really just more of a market level issue? Where that kind of active lifestyle has shifted away maybe from that rugged outdoor aesthetic to more of the athletic, athleisure aesthetic and you just kind of have to wait for that cycle to play out? Thanks.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Omar, I mean, there's clearly a cycle that we're all seeing right now with the retro athletic. But to the point on Timberland, we absolutely believe we have the right strategy. And the proof point is what we see going on with our European business, who was much quicker to diversify across multiple franchises, specifically SensorFlex and the launch of AeroCore and have really brought down the percent to total of the boots, the total boot collection.","We were slow to do that here in the United States market. And that work is underway. Jim [Pisani] did I thought a good job really of being able to explain that at the Investor Day. That work is underway.","Concurrently, we've really elevated our apparel product creation, sitting now in our Stabio office, leveraging the strength of our apparel machine there. We're really seeing that investment pay out in our European marketplace. As that starts to come here to the U.S., we have confidence that that will be a growth driver.","But we're also unlocking women's growth. And you'll remember the three focuses for Timberland are their men's business and the diversification across new franchises, women's and apparel. And again, the women's business and the strength that we're seeing with products designs in Europe that we're now bringing back into our Americas marketplace gives us confidence that we have the right product as we begin to be more diligent around segmentation and really diversifying those collections appropriately.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Thanks, Steve. Thanks, Scott. That's really helpful. Good luck.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Yeah.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Thanks, Omar.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","See you, Omar.","Operator","We'll go to Erinn Murphy, Piper Jaffray.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to focus a little bit on innovation behind The North Face brand. It feels like for the last three years to four years, it's been concentrated around FuseForm, ThermoBall in particular. I guess first question, how much white space is left for these platforms to run? And then is there anything you can share with us on kind of what's next? How your thinking about better balancing the spring versus the fall line? Thanks.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","No, Erinn, very good question. If you remember back in the Q4 call, I've talked about we need to own some of where The North Face finds itself today. We've leaned heavily on ThermoBall for the last three seasons. FuseForm, an interesting technology, and material innovation is important for our outerwear and ski wear.","But what we need to be doing is really being much more thoughtful around multiyear line plans and product lifecycle management, married to our innovation platform. There are a number of innovation projects underway, specifically around materials but also design concepts for outerwear, footwear, equipment, and some very specifically in Sportswear. As now as we bring new leadership into both the overall brand and product, we're lining up that multiyear model with our innovation platform.","And there's some exciting things coming this fall. I don't remember if I saw you at the Outdoor Retailer show. But there was an introduction of a new portion of our Summit Series collection engineered for ski mountaineering. But that also is having influence on some of the broader apparel product. And you're just seeing better designed product, more thoughtful use of materials, color, and fit. That we have a lot of confidence will open up the lens for our core consumers, but also broaden the lens for new consumers.","And were seeing this prove out in our European business. I've talked about that a lot, but it's no secret that our European business is very, very successful right now. And it is the focus on product, the segmentation of that product into specific channel partners and our own stores. But it's also the quality of the leadership and really driving those very specific choices and being able to, season after season, build that momentum through really thoughtful product line management.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess, Scott, for you. Just going back to how you were kind of articulating the guidance, you talked about significant SG&A leverage in the back half. Can you just expound upon that? I guess if sales in the second half \u2013 you're obviously planning for a big acceleration as well.","So if, whether it's environment or further bankruptcy, the sales weren't as high. Let's say they were in the low single digit range or mid-single. How do we think about kind of what the leverage you have on the SG&A would be in the back half? Thanks.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Yeah. So first of all as CFO, I think every cost is variable. So that's probably kind of underneath your question, but \u2013 and so what does our guidance imply? So we said about 14% operating margin. And with the margin expansion that would imply an increase in SG&A. And you see that's relatively higher in the first part. And we see \u2013 we leverage that in the second half, and it comes down.","First of all, I'd say we have a pretty good line of sight to the second half of the year. Right? And so we're not expecting a tremendous volatility. We see our order book. We see the trends. Now there's always some variability possible. But we have a lot of confidence in the second half. So that's the first comment I'd make.","So secondly, we're also \u2013 we outlined a strategic plan in our Boston meeting. And we are investing behind those priorities. So the point I was trying to make by significant leverage is, obviously as the top line accelerates, we're going to see leverage, right, in the second half.","We're also taking a lot of \u2013 a hard look at all the nonstrategic SG&A. We have a transformation project that we're going on \u2013 that we're undertaking here. And I'd call it more of a philosophy than a project actually. And we're challenging every spend item that we have in the P&L and saying, if it's not directly related to bringing our strategy forward, then we're empowering our leaders to take a hard look at that.","And the fruits of that labor are, we're going to \u2013 we're seeing and will continue to see leverage in those nonstrategic areas. Our thought is that is a fuel that we put right back and reinvest against those strategic priorities.","So again second, relative as the top line grows, we're going to see second half leverage. Remember in the first half we have a bit of a perfect storm. Right? We're opening our D2C \u2013 we're opening D2C stores. We see relative low wholesale growth for all the reasons that we detailed in our prepared remarks and some of the questions. We see that accelerating in the second half, and that's where you start to see that leverage.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. Thank you, guys, and best of luck.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Thanks, Erinn.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Thanks, Erinn.","Operator","We'll go next to Bob Drbul of Guggenheim.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Hey, Bob.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Bob.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","I was wondering if you could spend a little time just on Vans? The trends that you're seeing especially in the U.S. and the competitive set? Their inventory levels?","And then the second question that I have is on the inventory levels in the business. So like with wholesale revenues being down 4% and inventories I think were up 2%, can you talk about how like wholesale inventories are for you guys heading into the remainder of the year? And how you're planning the wholesale part of the business versus your D2C part of the business, given that your expectations are for a significant pickup in the second half of the year?","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","So, Bob, I'll take Vans and then let Scott grab that second question. So from a Vans standpoint here in the U.S. \u2013 but it, really it applies to how the Vans businesses is managing itself across each of the regions \u2013 is just a really strong, broad, diversified set of products, starting first with footwear. And not depending on a single style but really leveraging the Classics and then there within Old Skool, bringing new innovations in their Pro Skate collection.","We're looking at new launches in apparel, launched a new Authentic Chino this spring, helped brought to market through our innovation platform. Just how we use the different franchises that we have across each of these apparel and footwear collections in their segmentation strategy. And how we bring those to life in our stores and digital I think really separates Vans from the rest of the marketplace.","And it's their intense focus on their consumer and the focusing on those emotional elements of music, art, and street culture. And how we are connecting digitally with our consumers. Our customs platform, which we launched last year, continues to accelerate, as we expand (50:08) the offer and the means by which consumers can upload content to have us then transfer that onto footwear.","They're just bringing a lot of new ideas each season across each of these different categories of product. And doing it consistently across the globe and tying that to the experiences that they have through marketing and events, really separates them from the rest of the marketplace and I think kind of puts them in a category in many ways in their own right.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Yeah. And so, Bob, versus you \u2013 or kind of your inventory related question. So a couple things. Number one, we do have pretty good line of sight to the balance of the year. So as it relates to the quality of our inventory, we feel good about that. Right? We don't see any issues and from a quality standpoint.","Also remember that the marketplace is substantially cleaner as we look at it. Now there's a few \u2013 there's always a few pockets here and there. But as an overall statement, we would say that retail inventories are in good shape. And we don't see any issues on a go forward basis.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll go next to Kate McShane of Citi.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Scott, with your guidance for Q2 of $0.27 to $0.30, I know you said the visibility to Jeanswear is tough, because you don't quite know where it's going to break. But what are you assuming for Jeanswear in order to get to that EPS growth?","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Yeah. So we're looking at down mid-single digits on a currency neutral basis in the second quarter. That's what our current guidance implies. And again what we're saying is we've seen some variability frankly in the first quarter. It was the timing shifted a little bit from us, and it was a little more severe than we had anticipated. We had some offsets, which helped us get back on an overall basis. And so we would \u2013 that's really what's behind the comment. Just a little uncertainty on how the timing of all this is going to wind through the process.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Okay. And would you say what you're assuming is a base case scenario? Or...","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Well, if you back up, if you go to the high end of our range, that's essentially in line with what we said in February. Right? So we're saying we see a path to \u2013 and remember all this is excluding LSG. So the guidance we gave in February included LSG. We've kind of given you the roadmap on how to model, taking LSG out of it. So excluding that impact, the $0.30 would be right in line with our previous outlook. And we're saying there could be as much as a $0.03 variation on that, based on the timing of Jeanswear.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then my second question is, I know there have been some management changes in the Outdoor coalition and I think North Face as well. I just wondered if you could walk us through some of the newer hires that have been made? And if there are still any bigger positions that still need to be filled?","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Sure, Kate, I'll do that. There have been some changes in our Outdoor business. Last year we made a change at Timberland in Jim Pisani, who presented at the Investor Conference, is our new leader there. Very excited about the leadership that he's bringing to that team.","I think The North Face is where we have two openings of significance, our President and our Head of Product. We are very close to naming a new President for The North Face brand. And with that shortly thereafter with that individual's participation we'll make that move on [Head of] Product.","The good news is we have some really steady strong sets of hands in that business. Scott Baxter, out head of that group is working day to day with our North Face brand. We've recently moved Arne Arens from Europe, our GM of our European business is now our GM of the Americas. Arne has presented at the Investor Conference. Very strong history with our brands, strong leadership, and deep, deep understanding of our brand.","So really feel confident about where we are in our North Face kind of time line. And the \u2013 really the search that we've utilized to identify that new leader.","Now we also placed a new President at Smartwool. And Travis [Campbell] comes to us from a relatively similar background, very strong general management skills, passion for this category and the outdoors. And he's bringing really good leadership to that brand. So those would be those openings that we've had and feeling good about where we are.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jonathan Komp, Robert W Baird.","Jonathan R. Komp - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yes. Hi. Thanks. Scott, if I could ask just a clarification on the guidance for the full year first of all. I understand 2016 coming lower when you exclude the LSG business. I'm just wondering the thought on holding the earnings decline rate for 2017. I would assume that you might have some proceeds from LSG that you could put to productive use through buying back stock or something like that. So any comment on either the proceeds or kind of the assumptions behind holding the growth rate?","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Yeah. No. Good question. So we talked about returning $1.6 billion to shareholders this year, which includes a $1 billion repurchase. Obviously, we had some line of sight to what's going on with LSG. And so we were assuming those proceeds in that $1 billion buyback. So we are not intending to increase the $1 billion at this time.","Jonathan R. Komp - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then on the gross margin cadence through the year, I just wanted to ask about some of the puts and takes. I mean, obviously the first quarter was strong. And I think might account for your entire full-year projected gross margin increase. So I'm just wondering for the next three quarters what some of the puts and takes you see there.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Yeah. Yeah. I'd say it was really strong by the way. So, yeah, we saw mix was really strong in the first quarter, about 80 basis points. And that's close to what we see for the year, a little less than that for the year. And our rate was up 110 basis points.","Several factors there. So we do see some price benefit. It's about 1% for the full year. And that's a little bit more toward the first half. Cost, the same. We see cost benefit in the first half. That actually turns the other way in the second half and for the year. And that's to kind of a small number. Those are some different \u2013 those are two shaping things.","And then finally, if you just think about that mix number as it evolves. So as our Jeanswear business accelerates, as our Image business accelerates throughout the year, you're going to see some of that mix come back the other direction. So off to a really good start one quarter in.","The other thing I would just remind everybody at this point, we're one quarter in and we got a lot of real estate ahead of us. So could we have been a little conservative? Maybe. But looking at the balance of puts and takes, we think that's a prudent place to be one quarter into the year.","Jonathan R. Komp - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","And just to follow up, your prepared remark about sacrificing a little growth for quality near term. Is that more backward looking in the last quarter or two? Or do you see that continuing?","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Well, I think you'll see a continuation of that philosophy. Now the reality is, a lot of that is behind us now in terms of, we're not doing much off-price. There's not much included in this outlook for 2017, because we've already cleaned a lot of that up.","In general, what we've said is, we would prefer to dispose of things through our own outlets. It's more brand appropriate. And that's really why they're there. And so if that means holding a little inventory and selling it through in a more brand enhancing way, then we're going to make that choice.","Jonathan R. Komp - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Yeah. Just to follow up on that too. I think you're starting to really see \u2013 I said this in my prepared remarks, but we believe we're really starting to see that philosophy pay off. And of the best proxies for that is gross margin. And we're really encouraged to see that strong gross margin rate in the first quarter. We talked about focus on fundamentals. That's one of the markers that shows that the strategy is paying off.","Operator","We'll go next to Sam Poser, Susquehanna.","Sam Poser - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you for taking my question. I've got two questions. One is more housekeeping. Can you give us some idea of the JanSport and Licensed sports revenue by quarter for last year, so we can really model this properly?","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Yeah. So we gave you the quarter and the full year in the table and we've said it's $0.03 to $0.04 per quarter from an earnings standpoint. So while I guess we didn't break out exactly the by quarter, you can assume based on that that it's fairly evenly spread through the balance of the year.","Sam Poser - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. And then I mean \u2013 and then secondly, I mean, I guess my question is, is with the U.S., the sort of mature U.S. market for some of your larger brands. One, within your guidance for Jeanswear and in general, how many store closures domestically do you have built in to like the current guidance and the five-year guidance?","And then secondly, what gives you the confidence that the European influence will move appropriately to the U.S.? I mean, what direction \u2013 are you sure it's going that way? Or is it just that the international businesses are less developed, started? Like the Timberland business overseas doesn't have the reliance on the Classic boot. How do you get a gauge on what's pushing what which direction, I guess?","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Yes. I'll start with the kind of the numbers side of that question, Sam. So we're not going to get into the specifics of what we've put in or what's in, what's out. But just generally, just to reorient the comments I made earlier. We're really not expecting in the five-year plan any net wholesale growth in the U.S.","And within that we will see growth for sure, but we know it's going to be choppy. We may have a year where we see a little growth. Then we may see continued bankruptcies. And we're sure that's going to happen. We have modeled it behind the scenes. But that's not \u2013 for reasons I think you can appreciate, that's not something that we're going to talk about, what we're assuming on some of our customers in a public forum.","Just know that again when you think about where is our growth going to come from? It's going to come from our D2C, our digital, and that includes our digital partners as well, and our international wholesale. That's what's driving the next five years from our standpoint.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Yes. Sam, we absolutely see further consolidation here in the U.S. market. And really we've built our plans with that in mind. And to Scott's point, that net neutral number wholesale here in the U.S. market.","The comment around Europe and the influence that we see from our international business, it's not necessarily style or designs that we have in those marketplaces. It's more the discipline around thoughtful segmentation, elevated product, really strong experiential marketing within our own environments and our wholesale partners, and the way our leadership teams, in specifically Europe, are driving the business in a very methodical, professional way. It's those disciplines and the need to elevate product, our focus around design and innovation, and what that means to product and brand experience, that's what I'd ask you to take away.","And those disciplines being utilized across our business. It's the disciplines that sit within our Vans North America business here. It's one of the reasons they're so successful in putting together quarter after quarter positive results. It's taking that discipline, making sure it's well placed in each of our large brands, and just having the disciplined conversations to give us confidence in the long term sustainability of our growth.","But this is \u2013 to be honest with you, Sam, this is one of the reasons we made management changes, is to really get that leadership in place. The movement of Arne to our U.S. business, just bringing that focus, that leadership presence to these key brands gives us confidence that everything we've been talking about from a longer-term standpoint is absolutely within our line of sight.","Sam Poser - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thanks. And one last thing. I mean with The North Face brand, when you talk so much about all the technical attributes. There was an earlier question regarding some of the different technologies that you've had over the years and what you have.","I mean how much of this is technology related? And how much of it is style related? I mean if your stuff looks good and keeps you warm and protects you and breathes appropriately, isn't that sort of expected? And then the changing of styling and compelling other people to buy new stuff, is this technology \u2013 and I've read this in the notes about other companies. Is this technology the icing or the cake when it comes to the brand?","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Wow, Sam, that's a question at a guy who really loves technology. So I'll have to be careful about how I manage this answer.","It's both. It's style first. We know that when a consumer walks into a store, they notice color, followed by style. That brings you over to look at the product. And then how you interact with it is where your \u2013 again some of the style components of the quality of the material. Can I understand what the technology is in the garment? Is it relevant to my needs?","It's why we have moved to this consumer focused business unit approach, is having more of a clear understanding across those four brand territories of what the consumer needs are. Style and function, equally balanced, and really having the discipline of building thoughtful collections for each of the channels of distribution. So we can put the very best designed product with all of the right features and functions out there. So that when you do use the product, that it performs to the highest level of expectation. But at the same time you feel good and look good in that product. So it's really a balance of both","Sam Poser - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you very much and good luck.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Thanks, Sam.","Operator","And that is all the time we have for questions. At this time I would like to turn the call back over to Steve Rendle for any additional or closing comments","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","So thank you, everybody, for joining us. We're excited to share with you how we've begun the year. I hope what you take away is our growth drivers remain very much intact. And our three largest brands, delivering against expectation, and in some cases doing a little bit better. Our D2C and digital platforms performing well. And international continuing to deliver strong results.","And all of that balanced with our fundamentals, as we look to improve how we operate, the gross margin expansion that's giving us the confidence and the fuel to invest behind our strategic choices, as we pivot to become more consumer and retail centric. And really giving us a much more agile and efficient approach to our go-to-market. So thank you.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Lance Allega, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Lance Allega","Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us today to discuss VF's third quarter 2013 results.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind participants that certain commentary included in today's prepared remarks and the Q&A session may constitute forward-looking statements under definition of federal securities law. Forward-looking statements include management's current expectations, estimates and other projections about our business, results of operations and the industries in which VF operates. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these projected statements in the forward-looking statements are discussed in the documents filed with the SEC.","Additionally, participants on today's call may discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and you'll find an appropriate reconciliation in our press release, which was issued about an hour ago, and at our website that vfc.com.","Joining us on today's call will be VF's Chairman and CEO, Eric Wiseman; Bob Shearer, our CFO; and our Group Presidents, Scott Baxter, Steve Rendle and Karl Heinz Salzburger. Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions, and we'll ask that you limit your initial questions to 2. [Operator Instructions]","I'll now turn the call over to VF's Chairman and CEO, Eric Wiseman. Eric?","Eric C. Wiseman","Thanks, Lance. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Let me begin by saying that we're very proud of the solid results we achieved in our third quarter, especially earnings that far exceeded our expectations. While we faced some headwinds associated with the challenging economic environment and consumer buying behavior that was a little inconsistent market to market, I have great confidence that we'll finish 2013 strong and post another record year for VF.","I'm more excited now than I've ever been by the long-term growth prospects for VF. In June, we laid out a detailed 5-year growth plan supported by a sharp focus on 4 powerful strategic actions: leading through innovation, connecting with consumers, serving those consumers directly and expanding geographically. We're already making meaningful progress that's consistent with and sometimes ahead of our expectations. Our powerful ecosystem of brands and platforms, combined with proven strategies and great execution, enable us to consistently deliver on our growth objectives.","Every day at VF, every brand at VF works tirelessly to deliver innovative products, to find better and more creative ways to connect with and inspire our consumers, and we're always working to engineer new ways to be even more efficient and effective across our operations. In the third quarter, we grew revenues by 5% to $3.3 billion, reflecting strength in all global regions and across both our wholesale and direct-to-consumer businesses. The retailer calendar shift negatively impacted these growth rates by 2 percentage points. At the brand level, 14 of our 15 largest brands grew revenues on a global basis, and the one that missed was due to that retail calendar shift. So I'd say that's a pretty good success rate.","Gross margin once again exceeded our expectations, reaching 47.6%, a 90-basis-point improvement that we've seen across nearly every business. This improvement was primarily driven by our favorable mix shift toward higher-margin businesses with some contribution from lower product costs. In fact, taking a look at mix in our higher-margin businesses, the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition reached 60% of total VF revenues in the quarter. International reached 40%, and Direct-to-Consumer reached 19%, all trending up and tracking well against our 5-year goals.","Operating margin expanded 50 basis points to 17.6%, driven by gross margin expansion and underlying cost control. And speaking of costs, on the last call, you heard me say that if we were to see further gross margin expansion in the second half of the year, we'd remain opportunistic and consider investing those dollars to support our 5-year commitment to our shareholders, and that's exactly what we're doing. In fact, we think a challenging environment is the ideal time to upshift and hit the gas pedal a bit harder on marketing and product initiatives, supporting and helping to drive traffic to our wholesale partners, and of course, our own Direct-to-Consumer business by strengthening our connection with consumers, and creating even more meaningful engagement with our brands is key to our long-term success. Of course, this is not a new strategy for us. We did it at the same time last year and 3 years ago, exactly on this same day, we announced nearly $50 million of additional investments in The North Face, Vans and our business in China. And based on our strong results, particularly in those 3 areas during the past 3 years, we know this is a strategy that works and works quite well at VF.","Since the last time we spoke, we've committed to an additional $40 million of marketing investments in the second half of the year. In the third quarter, we spent $10 million. And in the fourth quarter, we'll spend another $30 million to help drive our business into 2014 and beyond. On an EPS basis, this is about $0.25 per share in the second half.","Looking at the balance of the year, I'm particularly proud of the fact that even with these additional investments, our $10.85 adjusted earnings per share guidance is unchanged. And the 13% growth over 2012, this result is directly in line with our long-term earnings growth target.","We're also returning more to our shareholders with the announcement of a 21% increase in our dividend. This marks the 41st consecutive year of dividend increases, a 4-decade record of returning value to our shareholders. And we announced a 4-for-1 stock split this morning, an action that reflects the confidence we have in our ability to generate consistent sustainable growth and the opportunity to make VF shares attractive to a potentially broader range of investors.","In summary, we've got solid momentum across our largest brands and the financial resources to make additional investments to support this momentum and drive revenue gains while still delivering another outstanding year of results for VF shareholders.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve, Karl Heinz and Scott, who will take us through VF's top 5 brands. And Bob will close us out with a deeper look at our results. Steve, over to you.","Steven E. Rendle","Thanks, Eric. Third quarter global revenues for The North Face were up 3%, which is right on track with what we expected. Our D2C business was really strong, increasing more than 25% during the quarter, with balanced growth in all 3 regions. As expected, our wholesale business was flat. You'll recall from last quarter's call that in addition to order shifting from Q3 to Q4 because of retailer caution, our wholesale partners' calendars also shifted 1 week from September into October. Combined, these shifts pressured our third quarter results and moved revenue into this year's fourth quarter.","Absent the calendar shift, which totaled about $40 million in revenues for The North Face, third quarter revenues would have been up nicely at a high-single digit rate. As you'd expect, you will see this benefit in our fourth quarter results when revenues should approximate a low double-digit growth rate.","Revenues in the Americas region were up at the same rate as global North Face, 3%, with flat wholesale results that were held back by the calendar shift. D2C performance in the quarter, however, was very strong with 30% growth. In both channels, we were really encouraged with the trends we're seeing in apparel, footwear and equipment demand as we head into the cooler months ahead. In fact, when I think about The North Face business and the position we're in, especially in the context following 2 challenging winters here in the U.S., we're the best positioned to succeed in the outdoor industry.","Given a terrific innovative product lineup, supported by a strong integrated marketing campaign, exciting programs with key wholesale partners and strong D2C momentum that we see continuing well into 2014, we are incredibly confident about the future.","A great example of this work is Thermoball. As one of our biggest product innovations for this upcoming season, early reads on Thermoball have exceeded our expectations. In addition, due to very strong sell-through we've had in our own D2C, we're rolling out an exclusive in-store concept at 300 Dick's Sporting Goods locations, featuring Thermoball as part of an overall brand shop in their seasonal outerwear pad.","On the marketing front, our new Never Stop Exploring campaign will be strengthened by the incremental investments that Eric mentioned. This emotional brand campaign does an incredible job of personalizing the meaning of outdoor exploration. Using all mediums, TV, print, digital and in-store, we're extremely confident this will intensify our connection with a wide range of North Face consumers.","So all factors considered, we're right where we expected to be, and there is significant momentum in the Americas business moving into the fourth quarter, lining us up for a strong finish to the year.","Now let me turn it over to Karl Heinz to discuss the North Face's International business.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. In Europe, the North Face business was down at the low single-digit rate. It was impacted by the opening of a new distribution center for the region. Fourth quarter revenue is expected to grow at the mid-teen rate. In the third quarter, momentum in our D2C business continued with revenues up nearly 20%, including more than 60% growth in our e-comm business.","We're also seeing good early seasonal response to new product introductions with Thermoball being cited by wholesale partners as the best-selling insulator product among multiple points of distribution. On top of that, our European-specific designs continue to be a big hit as well with almost half of our product lineup now personalized for the unique local needs of this discerning consumer. No one is better positioned than we are to execute this strategy, which is a competitive advantage we're quite proud of as it builds long-term authenticity and creates confidence and loyalties with our consumers.","On the marketing front, we recently launched our first pan-European inter-sport marketing campaign in 10 countries and 600 doors to TV, billboards, cinema, print and in-store. The featured product that takes center stage to the campaign is the exploration to a climate jacket, a premium outdoor piece with a GORE-TEX shell that is exclusive to winter sport. This represents meaningful collection points and a lot of good momentum in Europe going into the fourth quarter.","Turning to Asia Pacific. We had a solid third quarter with revenues up 11% in the region driven by mid-teen percentage growth in China. And for the first time ever, we're about to launch a major national TV campaign known as the Explorer for The North Face [ph]. In fact, in the fourth quarter, we are doubling our marketing investment for this powerful brand in China, which will build consumer brand awareness and engage them in the outdoor market. Indeed, this is a very good example of incremental marketing spend you've heard us talk about today.","Now back to Steve to talk about Vans.","Steven E. Rendle","Vans continues to be a very strong performer. Global revenues for Vans in the third quarter were up 16% with high-teen D2C growth and a mid-teen percentage increase in our wholesale business.","In the brand's largest region, the Americas, revenues were up at a low-teens rate during the quarter with both the D2C and wholesale channels showing strong double-digit momentum on the heels of a solid back-to-school season. Vans' wholesale distribution discipline has been a key growth strategy for the brand for a decade and continues to prove its worth in 2013.","Within footwear, growth across all aspiration channels has been significant with positive trends across all tiers, including double-digit growth in core board shop, boutique, lifestyle and family footwear channels.","Vans also launched 2 new Pro Skater shoes using innovative performance characteristics, including WAFFLECUP, DURACAP and UltraCush in signature athlete models that have received strong adoption in core board shops. And just recently, we celebrated the anniversary of the LXVI launch at Foot Locker with a revised in-store branding execution and expanded the product categories to include the OTW and Classics collections.","And I'm also happy to report that the actions we've taken across Vans apparel are gaining traction and expanding share. Vans apparel has cracked the top 10 men's brands in 8 of the 11 categories in Q3 of 2013 as measured by ActionWatch, which measures independent board shop trends, a key indicator of brand aspiration that creates downstream, wholesaler and consumer adoption. As recently as 2011, we were absent in these apparel rankings.","And in apparel, we've moved into colder and wetter climates such as Canada and the Northeastern U.S. where product differentiation is important to retailers and expected from our consumers.","Turning to D2C. We're in the process of finalizing enhancements to our D2C channel that will roll out early next year to improve the consumer experience and facilitate deeper connectivity. For our retail stores, we'll be implementing a new POS platform in the first half of 2014. And on the e-comm side, we're working on a new platform and enhanced content, which is set to launch sometime in the first quarter. These relationship-building initiatives will further enrich and expand Vans' deep consumer connectivity.","Vans' strength in engaging its growing customer base through specific consumer activation platforms once again proved itself a value during the third quarter. Our first Vans U.S. Open of Surfing was a huge success with 750,000 attendees, 1.3 million web visits and 1.2 million media impressions over the course of 9 days. Our House of Vans platform extended our music activation strategy through various events in Q3, including pop-up House of Vans events in Canada and Mexico, 2 of the regions that we targeted for geographic expansion in 2013.","Finally, we wrapped up the 19th year of the Vans Warped Tour in North America and sent them on their way to 6 dates in Europe and 6 dates in Australia to end out the year.","Now over to Karl Heinz for some international highlights.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","In Europe, Vans revenue was up 25%, underscoring the strength of the brand. We are confident that we will deliver another year of remarkable results in Europe. On the product side, we are focused on optimizing our cold weather footwear strategy by expanding our product offering and growing Vans' share against competitors.","On the D2C front, we opened our first store in Dublin during the quarter, which coincided with our e-comm launch in Ireland. With this launch, we now have Vans e-comm platforms in 7 key countries across Europe, which is a nice growth since December 2012.","Vans Asia Pacific business grew at the high single-digit rate during the third quarter. In Asia, we continue to support local initiatives to ensure that the brand remains inspirational to youth culture and relevant to the region, a strategy that is working very well for us. In China, our best-selling apparel categories are those that have been locally developed. We work closely with key local influences to sell the Vans story and are constantly gathering and assessing local consumer insights to ensure our brand story also resonates with consumers in the region.","So overall, really solid results representing strong momentum through the first 3 quarters for Vans, momentum we expect to see continue into the fourth quarter and beyond.","And with that, let's move on to Timberland.","Steven E. Rendle","Global revenues for Timberland were up 2% in the third quarter, right in line with our plans. This result included positive growth in our D2C and wholesale businesses, a balance we're very encouraged by. The work we've done during the past 2 years at Timberland is really paying off.","In the Americas, we saw revenues up in the mid-single-digit range during the third quarter, which was in line with our expectations. Results in this region were driven by sales of boots in D2C and wholesale as somewhat more seasonal weather began slightly earlier than last year. We continue to see strong results from core and new programs.","For example, core styles in the premium boots and hiking categories performed really well with our wholesale partners and our own D2C locations. Plus, as you know, we officially relaunched our apparel offering in North American market. Timberland's new rugged and refined apparel is available at select Nordstrom locations, through key specialty independent retailers and at Timberland stores.","The early reads on the product, particularly in the outerwear category, have been very encouraging. As we mentioned before, we'll take what we've learned from this year's relaunch to shape next year's go-to-market strategy. The collection's early acceptance has us very confident that our current plan has us set in the right direction to achieve our long-term goals.","We also launched our Best Then. Better Now advertising campaign to coincide with Timberland's fourth -- 40th anniversary of the yellow boot. To kick off the campaign, we invited more than 350 editors, stylists, bloggers and influencers to an interactive style workshop where they got to experience firsthand the new positioning of this iconic brand. We also launched a newly designed homepage for the Timberland brand, which offers an enhanced consumer experience, one that has already nearly doubled the average time consumers spend on the site. And we also launched the When Your Feet Hurt, Your Work Suffers campaign for Timberland PRO, featuring the Hyperion work boot. And speaking of PRO, that collection continues to post consistent gains in this important sector with a mid-teen comp during the quarter.","We're also pleased to report that our target operational initiatives designed to drive conversion are continuing to take hold, resulting in another quarter of strong growth in the Americas for Timberland's D2C business. In short, we continue to make significant progress with Timberland and remain confident that we have set the right path for stronger long-term growth. We couldn't be more confident in our ability to grow this brand. The product is stellar. Our distribution is well positioned, and we're telling our amazing stories.","Now let's take a look at Timberland's International business.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","In line with expectations, revenue in Europe were flat, reflecting a slight increase in our wholesale business, offset by weaker D2C sales where we continue to work on resetting key locations across the continent.","While overall market conditions have remained relatively soft, our comparisons have continued to improve. In fact, in the fourth quarter, we expect to see mid-single-digit growth for the brand. Similar to the Americas, both core and new categories in Timberland are performing well and our apparel has seeing favorable responses, particularly in bottoms and outerwear.","We also are celebrating the brand's 40th anniversary as a way to connect consumers to the Timberland story. We participated in Bread and Butter trade show for the first time and showcased our collections and celebrated our anniversary. The event was a great success with almost 3,000 visitors. Through media, we reached an additional 15 million consumers. We're now working to translate this experience to events at stores throughout Europe.","In Asia, revenues were up 9% in constant dollars, and we saw strong growth across the region in both women's and men's footwear. On the men's side, growth came from the boot category, driven by the 40th anniversary marketing campaign. In women's, classic styles led the way, with the boot category doubling over last year. In addition, women's apparel saw strong results, driven by sweaters and wovens. Overall, we are really placed with our progress in Timberland's International business and have put ourselves in a great position for a strong 2014.","And with that, I turn it over to Scott to take a look at Jeanswear.","Scott H. Baxter","Thank you, Karl Heinz, and good morning, everyone. Global Jeanswear posted solid results this quarter with revenues up 4%. This increase was driven by mid-single-digit growth in the Americas, which included a high single-digit increase in the mass channel, along with strong results in Europe. Q3 was also a highly profitable quarter for Jeanswear, posting a 21.2% operating margin. This strong profitability was due primarily to gross margin improvements and some favorable mix shifts.","Third quarter global revenues for Wrangler were up 8%, driven by strong results in Europe and a high single-digit increase in our Americas region. We remain sharply focused on conveying the Wrangler message of innovation, authenticity and value to our consumers to enhance the way we engage with the brand.","During the quarter, we launched 2 new ad campaigns that aim to do just that. Drew Brees, Brett Favre and Dale Earnhardt, Jr. are now featured in ads shown during NFL and NCAA broadcasts. So great connection points into the heart of that consumer. We've also just finalized a campaign aimed at Hispanic consumers that will launch during the fourth quarter.","We saw solid results in our Western business, driven by momentum in our Premium Performance Cowboy Cut Jeans. The initial sell-throughs of our new Premium Performance Cowboy Cut with advanced comfort has exceed our expectations. We're also working with our innovation team on a pipeline to develop and implement solutions for the Western consumers' needs. We know this is a very important and growing consumer segment for us, so we are creating more innovative products to give them what they want, when they want it.","Of note, we recently launched a comprehensive new Wrangler Patch campaign, featuring our advanced comfort products featuring Trevor Brazile, the #1 ranked cowboy in the PRCA. Our Americas non-U.S. business continued to be one of the fastest-growing regions for the Wrangler brand, posting solid growth during the quarter with revenues up at a high-single digit constant dollar rate with particular strength in Latin America. Karl Heinz?","Karl Heinz Salzburger","It's been a while since I've been able to say this, so I'll treasure it a bit. Our Wrangler business in Europe was up about 10% in constant dollars compared with last year with [ph] improvement in profitability that contributed strongly to the overall global Jeanswear results. We are seeing improved sell-through in our product, driven by our focus on denim performance. Specifically, consumers are responding well to our water-resistant fabrics and multi-pocket functionality. And we continue to experience strength in Germany, Poland and Russia, some of our key markets in Europe.","Now back to Scott with Lee.","Scott H. Baxter","Thank you, Karl Heinz. The Lee brand grew 3% on a global basis in the third quarter. Revenues in the Americas region grew at a mid-single-digit range with balanced growth across all channels. Our strong revenue growth was driven by a combination of new product launches and our new fall marketing campaign. We've also made several strategic enhancements to lease in-store visual presentation, which makes it easier for consumers to find our attractive new products.","We are pleased with the early results of our men's casual business, which is being driven by the introduction of our Total Freedom pant. Based on early selling, this pant is being expanded to 340 additional doors this fall. And taking advantage of what appears to be an emerging casual pant trend, we've begun testing the Weekend Chino across most accounts in the fourth quarter.","Turning to our department store business. Our Lee Platinum label products continue to grow and are now available at nearly 400 key department store locations and a major test coming with another retailer partner this fall.","The Slender Secret jean and the Monaco trouser have been real standout performers for us. Early sales results are quite strong and these programs will be expanded in 2014. We are definitely excited to see increasing momentum in this brand as we welcome more consumers to the Lee story.","Now back to Karl Heinz to discuss Lee's International business.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","In Europe, Lee men revenues were up at the low single-digit rate in constant dollars with strength in Northern Europe. We are pleased with the continued momentum in our new Stretch Deluxe women's product, as well as in the performance of our overall women's category. In addition, we have enhanced our marketing efforts to drive more traffic in targeted regions and around specific channels. Sales of our new men's collection, Blue Label, continue to exceed our expectations as customers respond favorably to the product's outstanding fit and comfort.","In Asia, sequentially, our results continue to improve and our gross margin benefited from lower product costs, which led to improved profits. And in line with expectations, we have continued to make progress against a wholesale denim inventory overhang that has affected the denim category in China, and we expect to return to growth in the fourth quarter.","Our Fall\/Winter Collection has received a positive response, particularly the premium Stretch Deluxe women's product, as well as the Urban Riders line. In China and India, we recently launched our first sustainability program, E Think [ph], with an environmentally friendly and fashionable product collection. We are confident that we're in the right track with this business and that we'll see healthy growth once inventory levels return to normal.","Now here's Bob to take you through our financial highlights.","Robert K. Shearer","Thanks, KH. Well, all in all, I'd say we delivered a really solid third quarter, particularly in light of an environment that's not exactly robust. How do we do it? A powerful brand portfolio, a highly effective strategy focused on innovation and consumer connectivity, strong platforms, and of course, outstanding execution on the part of our passionate team around the world.","Let's take a look at how we did. Total VF revenue grew 5% in the third quarter or 4% if you exclude the impact of foreign currency. As Eric mentioned, the retailer calendar shift negatively impacted these growth rates by 2 percentage points. On a regional basis, revenues in the U.S. were up 3% with growth in both the Direct-to-Consumer and wholesale channels. Total International revenues were up 7%, driven by 13% growth in the Americas, now that's the non-U.S. region; a 7% increase in European revenues, where the economic environment remains challenging; and 2% growth in the Asia Pacific region where China was up 10%.","Our Direct-to-Consumer business had another great quarter with revenues up 14% and strong performances from The North Face, Vans, Nautica, Kipling and Napapijri brands. We continue to be really pleased with the contribution our D2C business mix, both in terms of sales and earnings. We're adding more stores. Our profitability is improving, and the earnings per share contribution continues to grow substantially from this business. And we expect that momentum to continue with even greater growth and positive results from nearly every brand in our portfolio during the fourth quarter.","Now let's take a look at our gross margin performance. Our gross margin rate for the quarter was 47.6%. That's a 90-basis-point improvement over last year. The drivers of this improvement are the same, a continued favorable mix shift toward higher-margin businesses with some additional contribution from lower product costs. And in line with year-to-date trend, we saw gross margin improvement in almost every business, which I'd say is quite impressive, especially given the environment in many parts of the world. Indeed, a big accomplishment.","Our SG&A ratio as a percent of revenues rose 40 basis points to 30% in the third quarter. And as you saw in the release, our marketing spend rose by 80 basis points in the quarter. That implies we're seeing leverage elsewhere in our expense structure, and this is really an important point. Our management teams have done a great job of controlling expenses, which is allowing us to make substantial investments behind our brands around the globe. And as we've proven numerous times in the past, that's provided us with a lot of momentum going into the following year.","In fact, with the incremental marketing investment that we just announced, the ratio of our marketing spend to revenues will increase to 6% in 2013, clearly an all-time high for us, and in this environment, precisely the right thing to do. In terms of dollars, our marketing spend will now increase by about $100 million in 2013 over 2012.","An incremental expense started in the third quarter with significantly more coming in the fourth. During the third quarter, we invested about $10 million more in marketing than we previously planned with a heavy focus supporting our D2C businesses. In the fourth quarter, we have approved plans to spend an additional $30 million in these incremental marketing investments.","So all in, during the second half of 2013, we intend to spend about $40 million, worth about $0.25 a share, more than was originally planned to support our highest growth businesses. With a focus on The North Face, Vans and Timberland, 80% of the spend is in Outdoor & Action Sports. And about 70% positioned outside the U.S. and heavily D2C weighted, we're confident this will be money well spent.","Let's move on to operating margin, which improved 50 basis points to 17.6%, driven by our strong gross margin performance and underlying expense control. Keep in mind that the incremental marketing investment that I just discussed impacted the quarter by about 30 basis points. Taking this down to the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share grew 11% to $3.91 from $3.52 in last year's same period.","Now let's take a look at our coalition results, starting with our largest contributor to growth, Outdoor & Action Sports, which reached 60% of VF's total sales in the quarter. Total revenues grew 6%, which was in line with expectations and driven primarily by Vans, along with positive performances from nearly all brands in the coalition. The North Face, also in line with expectations, was up 3%. D2C was up more than 25%, while the wholesale business was essentially flat.","Now as you may recall from our second quarter comments, we said that the revenue cadence for The North Face in the second half will look at bit different than what you've seen in the past. Retailer caution was expected to push out what would have been third quarter orders into the fourth quarter. That, coupled with the retail calendar shift, which moved what normally would have been September shipments into October, resulted in our expectations of low single-digit growth in the third quarter. And that's exactly what we delivered. If you take the retailer calendar shift out of the equation, The North Face would have been up at a high single-digit rate. And taking that one step further, overall Outdoor & Action Sports -- outdoor sports revenues would have been up 8% versus the 6% reported.","Operating income for the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition was up 2%, and operating margin declined 90 basis points to 21.4%. Now putting that into perspective, the $40 million shift in revenues and the high gross margins that would have been attached to that, along with the incremental marketing investments, had quite an impact on the reported results of the coalition in the quarter. Of course, this coalition's fourth quarter will clearly benefit from the calendar shift.","Jeanswear posted a great quarter with revenues up 4%, driven by strength in the Americas and European regions, while revenues in the Asia Pacific region were down as we continue to work through higher inventories for the Lee brand. Now putting up some great revenue numbers where our Jeanswear folks really hit it out of the park was in profitability. Strong international performance, along with some lower product costs, drove a 20% increase in operating income, resulting in a 21.2% operating margin. And that improvement was in both Wrangler and Lee and across all of our regions. All in all, a really nice quarter for our Jeanswear folks.","Next up is Imagewear where revenues were flat versus last year. Now while the comparisons in Imagewear remain challenged due to softness in certain parts of the business, we are looking forward to a much stronger fourth quarter when we expect low double-digit revenue growth. The good news is operating margin in the third quarter increased 110 basis points to 14.3%, driven by improved gross margin due to lower product costs.","Now on to Sportswear. Revenues were up 1%, which was in line with our expectations. D2C was up more than 25% and offset by a mid-teen percentage decline in wholesale sales as a result of the same retail calendar shift we talked about for The North Face. Excluding this shift, revenues would have been up at a high-single digit rate.","Kipling delivered another quarter of outstanding performance with global revenue growth of 22%, with the U.S. business being up nearly 40%. And taking a look at profitability, we're very pleased to have achieved operating income growth of 30% and operating margin expansion of 350 basis points to 15.5%.","Our Sportswear team is headed for one terrific year. And finally, revenues for our Contemporary Brands coalition were up 1% in the quarter to $105 million. The softness in our Contemporary Brands business is primarily attributable to continued weakness in premium denim in the high-end department store channel. Operating income fell 30% to $9 million in the third quarter, and operating margin fell 390 basis points to 9%.","Now moving along to some balance sheet and cash flow highlights. Over the years, we have consistently demonstrated highly disciplined inventory management, and the third quarter is no exception. In fact, our inventories were flat to last year despite our revenue gains, reflecting our ongoing commitment to operational excellence.","In other good news, our pension plan is now nearly fully funded, and with respect to cash from operations, we remain on track to exceed $1.4 billion in 2013. We also paid off $400 million in debt associated with the Timberland acquisition. And to that point, our debt ratio is now in line with pre-Timberland numbers. As I said last quarter, we expect to be fully out of commercial paper by the end of the year. All of this points to a very healthy balance sheet and one that is ready to support future investment.","And as detailed in the press releases that went out today, our Board of Directors approved a 4-for-1 split of common stock payable in the form of a stock dividend. Why the decision to split our stock? Two things really: our consistent strong financial performance and our confidence in that continuing; and the desire to make the shares attractive to a broader range of investors.","","And of course, I have to comment on our dividend. Our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $1.05 per share, which is an $0.18 or 21% increase over last quarter. This represents the 41st consecutive year in which we increased our dividend, something we are very proud of and that shows our commitment to our shareholders. 41 years, it's pretty rare, for sure.","So let's cap things off with some comments on our full year outlook. Revenues should still approximate $11.5 billion, a bit of rounding that may very well come down to the wire. We're looking forward to a very strong fourth quarter with revenue gains that should approximate 10%. The quarter will benefit from the retail calendar shift that I previously discussed, as well as this year's new store openings and expectations for a very strong e-com performance.","And also, I have to comment on our gross margin. With the very strong results achieved in the first 9 months of 2013, we're now looking for our full year gross margin to approach 48%, up approximately 150 basis points over 2012. That means in year 1 of our 5-year plan, we've made huge progress against our target of 49.5% by 2017, which takes us to the bottom line. Given the significance of the $40 million incremental marketing spend, which is worth $0.25 per share, we're pleased to report that we can invest for the future and still achieve our long-term earnings growth target of 13%.","So in closing, VF is headed for another terrific year in 2013. Our operating performance is strong. We're investing in our brands to ensure future growth. We're able to provide our shareholders significant returns through yet another meaningful increase in our dividend. And as well, the 4-for-1 stock split reflects the confidence we have in our future.","And with that, I'll turn it back to Eric.","Eric C. Wiseman","I've got no additional comments. I know you have questions, so let's get to that session, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So, Bob, you mentioned the outdoor coalition EBIT margins in the quarter. They were a little bit lower. Can you just clarify for me, excluding the shift that we saw on the wholesale side with margins a bit higher, and will we be back to positive territory on the margins there when you pick up that shift in the fourth quarter?","Robert K. Shearer","Yes, Michael, there were 2 things. Number one, almost all of the $10 million of the incremental investment was in Outdoor & Action Sports, almost every single dollar of it. So that's one thing, right, so that would have gone right to the bottom line. And in addition to that, the shift, the shift in revenues, as you can imagine, we lost all of that gross margin, right, in the quarter. And our expense structure, the SG&A structure, for example, would have changed very, very little. So all of that gross margin, pretty much all of the gross margin would have flowed through in the quarter, so it would have made a very, very different -- a very different picture for the quarter. So sure, when we get those gross margins into the fourth quarter, it will look differently than it did in the third.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And, Bob, you also said that -- I think you said on the third quarter, around the last conference call, that third quarter gross margin increase would be less of an increase than fourth quarter. But I think the guidance implies it to be a little bit high -- I'm sorry, a little bit lower in the fourth quarter. Now is there anything that's changed in the formula? Maybe you can give us a little bit of how you're thinking about the change in the formula in the third quarter -- fourth quarter versus what you're thinking last quarter?","Robert K. Shearer","Yes, Michael, really not a lot different. The -- yes, the gains in both quarters, at this point in time, look to be -- look to actually be pretty similar. So the third quarter was a little bit stronger than we anticipated. And right now, if you do the math, it says that the fourth quarter is going to be slightly above the 48% level, so we're going to see the gain there as well, and it's driven mostly by the mix shift that we've been seeing pretty consistently.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Can you talk about some of the changes underway and progress at North Face and making the brand a bit more transitional, less winter focused? And how are some of your retail partners adjusting? What's the best way to think about the order flow going forward as we get into next year?","Steven E. Rendle","We think the shift that we see taking place at The North Face, we've talked about in some of the calls here in the past, and it starts first with the activity-based model, which really came online a little over 4 years ago, where we moved the brand into an expanded set of activities and, with that, an expanded focus on some new incremental categories. This shift was very focused on moving the brand to more of a fourth quarter brand. And as we said, it really lines up well with how we've seen these last 2 warm winters. As we have gone into spring selling with 2 new collections, we've seen this strategy really take hold. We'll be launching a new training apparel collection within our performance activity under the name of Mountain Athletic. That has been received extremely well by our retail partners and also supported by our Ultra Protection footwear collection, where there is both training as well as light hiking and hiking footwear, again, coming out of that focus of the activity-based model. So feeling very strong about how we're evolving the brand through this new perspective, and these are trends that we've seen, coming out of 2013, we think give us great momentum into 2014.","Matthew R. Boss - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And then Timberland's revenue performance seems to be inflecting mid-single digits in the Americas. Can you talk about progress there and how you're thinking about that brand into next year and, also, opportunity on the margin side with Timberland?","Steven E. Rendle","Yes, so why don't I start with that, answering this question, and I'll past it over to Karl Heinz. So in the Americas, as we mentioned here in the notes, we've seen really good performance with our footwear business, specifically boots in light hiking and many of the new casual styles in Q3, giving us really great confidence that the work done over the past 2 years is right on track. The relaunch of apparel here in the U.S. market, early reads, specifically with our outerwear, is giving us really good confidence that we've got the right vision for this strategy. And most importantly, what this is showing us is that we're on track to shift the perspective of that American consumer to think of Timberland more of a lifestyle brand versus what has been historically a boot brand. So really, really confident and excited about the momentum we have coming out of '13 into '14.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","So this is KH. Starting with Europe, I think the good news is we see it coming also. We had a couple of tough quarters at the beginning of the year. We are flat this quarter, and we expect growth in the Q4. So the brand has, for sure, momentum. We have some work to do, but we see it coming. Also, the spring indications we have are very positive. Asia continues simply to grow. We always had consistent growth in Asia. It's a very strong retail model there, health is apparent, so it's a good picture there.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jim Duffy with Stifel.","Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","A couple questions. Can you speak to the spring backlog for the forward order businesses? And then secondly, the Jeanswear operating profit has carried a pretty heavy load through the first 3 quarters. Bob, could you speak to the prospects for Jeanswear margins going forward and your thoughts on the coalition mix, to contribution to profit?","Steven E. Rendle","So, Jim, on the spring backlog for next year, we stopped quantifying our order books for The North Face about a year ago, so we really aren't prepared to comment on that. What I can tell you, though, at this point, the momentum, we've talked about coming out of Q3 into Q4, the positive reception of these new collections, Mountain Athletic, the Ultra Protection footwear and some of the new equipment products that we are selling into the market, really confident and are in line with our long-term plans and expectations.","Robert K. Shearer","And, Jim, I'll speak to the Jeanswear piece. Yes, the third quarter -- you're right, the third quarter Jeanswear numbers, and particularly the profitability, was a little stronger than we had anticipated, and it's driven by a couple things. One, the gross margin was a little bit better than we thought but -- in particular, the European business. Karl Heinz mentioned that he hadn't had a chance to mention that for a little while. But the European jeans business really, really had a nice -- had a very, very strong quarter for us, and that helped us. In terms of -- I think your question, Jim, was as we look at the fourth quarter and in terms of the overall profitability and mix for Jeanswear, specifically for Jeanswear, that the improvement will start to flatten out a little bit, although we do expect some expansion in the fourth quarter. And we expect also margin expansion in some of the other businesses where we've been seeing that today, and then we saw it in the third quarter, for example, in Imagewear, Sportswear as well, and Contemporary. So that's how the year will shake out.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two questions. First, I was hoping you could give us a little more color, broadly speaking, on what's going on in China. It looks like Vans maybe slowed down versus previous trends, just looking at the APAC up only high-single digits. And then Lee, you're now expecting a return to growth in the fourth quarter, but is there a sustainable improvement that you see in the Jeanswear business happening in China? And then maybe just a little more on the Timberland outlook and maybe just some broad color on what exactly you guys are seeing going on in the consumer market over there. And then the second question is, if we could get a little more detail on the marketing investments. You mentioned the TV in China. I understand the focus on Europe in the key brands. But is it TV and print in Europe? Or what -- maybe a little more color on what you guys are going to be doing in the fourth quarter.","Eric C. Wiseman","So, Robbie, I'll get us started a little bit on this. The first question, I think, was what's going on in China, and it's pretty widely publicized that the Chinese market, while it has slowed down overall in apparel and footwear, it's still the fastest-growing consumer market in the world for apparel and footwear. And our third quarter is -- we had a couple unusual things going on with the timing of shipments in the North Face. And the Lee question that you asked really gets to an inventory build that we've talked about before, and the denim category in total in China, that the industry is working through an inventory glut, and we said that we'd expect to return to growth in the fourth quarter, but that's just the beginning. The good news is that consumer takeaway in the specialty stores where we sell Lee jeans has still been strong. It just -- we came into the year with a big inventory build. Timberland in Asia, as Karl Heinz just said, continues to be strong. That business has been on a growth track. It is based primarily in Japan, and we've had some currency translation issues in our reported results. But we continue to grow and have expansion opportunities throughout the Asian region. And on to the marketing investments, it's $40 million. The really good news is when you commit late in the year to increase your marketing, it's all going to go against the consumer. We're not creating new ads, there's no production costs, the spend is really just increasing our voice. So for example, with The North Face in China, as Karl Heinz mentioned, we've more than doubled our investment there in The North Face. We originally planned to do some TV in just a few markets. With this additional investment, we've doubled the number of markets that we're going to be doing local TV advertising, and we've added a significant national TV advertising campaign that will reach everywhere in China. So it's all spent directly against the consumer. And there is a mix between what's being spent online and digitally versus TV and print, but I don't have those details for you, Karl Heinz has one other point.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Yes, I just want to -- I didn't cover it all, but I think you have a specific question on Vans in China. You picked up relatively slow growth in Q3, this is true, but there was some timing involved. You might recall, last year, we reported explosive growth in Australia. We got a big order from a distributor there. And it's just a timing issue. So Vans will be going back to growth -- strong double-digit growth in Q4, as it had been in Q1 and Q2.","Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And, Karl Heinz, the 25% Vans growth in Europe, how sustainable does that look?","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Well, you heard us saying in the past, we reported the growth on Vans, which was substantially higher, right, 40%, 50% in the past calls, that was high. We have now a business model where we believe the 20% is sustainable for the following reason. We started Vans with high initiatives, with high marketing initiatives in one specific market, which is the U.K., where we reached a great success. From there then, we moved on in other countries with a little bit less risks, so Germany, France, Italy would be great examples and Scandinavia. So we still have a long way to go in terms of penetration and market size. Our competitor there is also bigger than us. So we still see opportunities going forward with Vans.","Operator","And we'll go next to Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","On your dividend, with the balance sheet in such good shape and your debt ratio back down below Timberland levels and your explicit target to get to 40% payout ratio just sort of rolling up your algorithm earnings growth we're still easily below that, can you talk about how you think about the timing to get to 40% payout and why not up the dividend a little bit more?","Robert K. Shearer","Sure, I'll start on that. The -- in our 2017 plan, what we indicated there was that we would work back up to the 40% by that point in time. It's just something that we'll constantly evaluate. We'll be at about 34% in 2013, and with our plans, we'll move that up a couple -- 2 or 3 percentage points each year is what we would plan to do. And we're still -- we remain very acquisition-minded, it's always the trade-off, and looking at all the pieces and balancing all the pieces to the right level. So once again, if we're not seeing acquisitions flow through, we'll look at a number of different things in the past. We've upped our buyback program, if it made sense to do so. What we've been pretty consistent in saying is what we're not looking to do is stockpile a lot of cash in the balance sheet. So we will put it to work in the most effective means that we determine as we go forward. So sure, we'll look at changing that dividend payout or even increasing it based on all other factors.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And given the volatility we've seen in the consumer backdrop, are you feeling any better or worse about the pipeline of acquisition opportunities out there?","Eric C. Wiseman","I don't think we're feeling better or worse. The honest truth is after we acquired Timberland just over 2 years ago, we took a good year, 1.5 years off and focused on creating the value that we promised through Timberland. And as you see in our results, from an earnings per share contribution basis, Timberland is running ahead of schedule. So thrilled with that, feel like we have Timberland moving in exactly the direction we want it to move, and then we're very proud of the work that team is doing. And now we're looking again. But it is bumpy. They tend to come in waves, and we're always looking for the next opportunity. And I can't think of a week that's gone by when we haven't had a discussion at one level or another about businesses that we'd like to have join our company, but I can't say anything more specific than that.","Operator","And we'll go next to Christian Buss with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Christian Buss - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your comfort level with inventories at retail and your expectations for order patterns over the course of the quarter from your customers.","Eric C. Wiseman","I'll take a shot at that. It's Eric here, Christian. We've talked about, particularly in the -- using the Outdoor industry as an example, the industry has approached this season very cautiously, and that means that they've bought conservatively because the last 2 winters have been so difficult. So we think it's hard to generalize for global company with 30 brands, but if there was a generalization, it would be that the inventories at retail are in pretty good shape, with the one exception of the denim -- being the denim category, jeans category in China. Other than that, we don't see any issues. And we are positioned to respond to an increase in demand. Our inventories are really clean, right? We ended the quarter with inventories flat on last year, and the math would suggest we're going to grow around 10% in the fourth quarter, and we're starting with flat inventories. So our inventories are clean, and we think the retailers are pretty clean as well, in general.","Operator","And we'll go next to Kate McShane with Citi.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","With regards to the marketing spend, can you walk us through how soon you saw results from the higher marketing spend when you increased this a year ago and then also 3 years ago? I would assume that one of the objectives of increasing marketing spending in Europe is similar to what you did in the U.S. 3 years ago.","Robert K. Shearer","Yes, Kate, it is similar. And the way we look at it is that it's certainly -- we do believe that it will help sell-throughs in the current year. But we believe that most of the benefit would be a next year type of thing. So we look at these as a little bit longer term. We -- as we thought about making these investments, we thought a lot about our -- the plans that we laid out for 2017 and the growth rates over that period of time and what it took to achieve those. So that was really the driving force -- rate driving force in terms of making these investments, so a little bit longer-term view. But -- so again, specifically to your question, I think I'd say that we'll see more benefit in 2014 than we might in 2013.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, great. And part of the benefit, I know, to gross margins was lower product costs. Will you see a similar level of that impacting Q4 gross margins as you did in Q3?","Robert K. Shearer","In the third quarter, of the 90 basis points, 50 was mix. So once again, as we've been saying, very, very consistently, we see that mix somewhere in the 50- to 70-basis-point range. And so that implies in the third quarter there was about 40 basis points of improvement coming from cost reductions. As we look to the fourth quarter, so once again, we're looking at about 60 to 70 basis points of improvement, that's what the math implies in our gross margin, and most of that will be driven by mix. Not quite the same level coming from costs, but there may be maybe 10 or 20 basis points versus the 40 that we saw in the third quarter, so a little bit less, and the mix -- though the mix benefit will hold.","Operator","And we'll go next to Eric Tracy with Janney Capital Markets.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I guess if I could -- you talked a lot about China broadly and some on Vans. I guess back to North Face, Eric, I think you started to say a little bit of a timing shift there in 3Q, but just wanted to get a little more color there because it does seem to have moderated a bit. And given the stepped-up sort of marketing spend, is there anything sort of structural going on in the region there that we should be thinking about or just more of a timing issue?","Eric C. Wiseman","No, Eric, it was purely a timing issue. We will get back to growth in the 20% range in the fourth quarter. And The North Face in China was the single biggest investment that we're making. Within the $40 million, The North Face brand in China is our single biggest investment. We have unbelievably low awareness in China and an unbelievably big opportunity, and we hope to move the needle on awareness and sell-through this winter to set us up for a great 2014 in China.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then -- and I guess, Bob, following on, on the gross margin, obviously, a lot of sort of structure levers here at work given the mix shift towards higher-margin D2C international. Anything that really -- potential headwinds going into '14 that potentially somewhat mute that? Anything, be it currency, be it structural, that we should be thinking about?","Robert K. Shearer","No, not really. We've been pretty consistent in saying that it does feel that we're at a point where we've seen some cost increases and we would expect some level of cost increase then in -- as we look at 2014, and we'll have a lot more to say about that. But no, relative to our story, as I said in my comments, we made huge improvement this year towards that 49.5% goal in 2017, kind of halfway there, actually, in this 1 year. And we continue to expect that we'll move forward towards that 49.5%, and mix will clearly be a significant piece. And relative to any cost increases, with the strength of our brands, we're in a great position to offset those challenges with pricing. So we'll have a lot more to say about that as -- in February.","Operator","And we'll go next to Mitch Kummetz with Robert Baird.","Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","A couple things. I don't mean to beat gross margin with -- up too much here. I'm just -- on Q4, Bob -- Q3 mix was a 50-basis-point benefit. Q4, I mean, in theory, shouldn't mix be a greater benefit? You've got shifts in the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition that are more favorable in Q4 than Q3. And then I think to your point, you're looking for 10% revenue growth in Q4 and a lot of that coming from D2C, which is, obviously, a high-margin business. So when you guys are saying 50 basis points of mix benefit in Q4, is that just you guys being conservative? It seems like in theory, mix should do more for you there.","Robert K. Shearer","Well, we said -- so we said 50 basis points in third quarter, and yes, there's 50 to 60 basis points of -- coming from mix in the fourth quarter. And then filling in the gaps there, we're looking for 60 to 70 basis points, once again, that's what the math would imply, so 10 to 20 basis points coming from costs. So yes, Mitch, you're right, it should be a little stronger on the mix side, and it will be.","Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then just on kind of Q4 assumption, you guys mentioned some things on the last call, I just want to be clear that you guys are still looking kind of for the same items. I think last quarter, I think, Eric, you had mentioned that you're looking for sort of modestly or planning for modestly better weather in North America versus last year. And I think specifically, I think Steve mentioned reorders on The North Face up high-single digits, and I can't remember who said this, but I think you're seeing sort of global comp up high-single digits in the back half, and I'm wondering if you can just say what that was in Q3 and kind of what your Q4 outlook for comp is. I just want to go down on some of the assumptions to kind of get to Q4 guidance.","Eric C. Wiseman","Yes, we're not really -- we don't really give guidance -- comp store guidance, Mitch. But I'll -- let me try to help you some. If you look at our fourth quarter and you do the math, it says that we need to grow about 10% in the fourth quarter to hit the number. Now remember, we had a 2% shift out of the third quarter into the fourth. So you back that up and there's been a -- you start with -- so how does that compare to the third quarter? The third quarter, we were up 5%. And you add 2% to that, you're 7%. So what we're looking for, 1-percentage-point improvement, and that should come. We're going into the quarter with 100 more doors, owned and operated doors, than we had this time last year. Our e-commerce business is our fastest-growing business. And we're spending a lot of money to drive product through our wholesale customers. So all of that, plus a modestly better winter, we're not -- our guidance, as we said all year long, we assumed a more normal winter. We did not assume a blizzard winter. That's really a U.S. discussion because Europe had a good winter last year. Does that give you enough helpful color?","Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, that's helpful. I appreciate that.","Operator","And we'll go next to Kimberly Greenberger with Morgan Stanley.","Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on the gross margin outlook. I'm wondering if you can just help us understand the puts and takes into 2014. Would you expect some of the mix benefits that you're seeing this year to continue into 2014? And then secondarily, on the cost side, it sounds like you're starting to see some slight increases in cost on 2014 orders. Is that coming in labor, materials, both? If you could just help us understand that, that would be great.","Robert K. Shearer","Yes, Kimberly, we'll be really happy to lay all that out for you in February in terms of the puts and takes for 2014, but it's just -- it's too early for us to do that at this point in time. And you're right, so I did mention, I think, in terms of VF Corporation, and our competitors would say that it looks like there's some cost pressure coming at us in 2014. We're still working through that. Frankly, a lot of that is going to have to do with the supply and demand rule is always at play in terms of what we'll ultimately pay for, for products. So yes, the cost increases are coming a little bit across the board. There's some in fabrics, there's some just in our overall source costs impacted by labor. So there are a number of factors, I'd say, that will probably impact that, but we'll have a lot more to say about that when we talk about 2014 in February.","Eric C. Wiseman","But, Kimberly, you are right in your assumption about -- when we laid out our 2017 plan, we said that our growth getting to $17 billion would come disproportionately from growth in our International business, growth in our direct-to-consumer business and growth in Outdoor & Action Sports, all of which have higher margins. And we've talked about that contributing somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 basis points, so I think, Bob, too, annually, over time, and how we're going to get there?","Robert K. Shearer","Yes, that's right.","Eric C. Wiseman","And we're not changing that outlook for the future.","Kimberly C. Greenberger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Terrific. That's very helpful. And I was wondering if you could just comment a little bit on Asia with the 2% growth here this quarter. Obviously, China, at high-single digits, is quite good. But is Jeanswear the business that's holding down the Asia growth or is there something else going on there?","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Kimberly, this is KH here. You're right, we had this year our weakest quarter. We had Q1 and Q2, which were up double-digit. And we expect Q4 to be again up double-digit. Actually, it would become our strongest quarter. You said it right, we had issues with jeans, which I did say in my script we expect the overhang to be finished and be positive again in Q4. We had also some issues with currency. Timberland's biggest market is Japan, and we had some pressure with the yen. And a similar thing happened in India with the rupee. So I would say there was more extraordinary noise, and we still see big and great opportunities in China.","Operator","And we'll go next to John Kernan with Cowen and Company.","John D. Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","A lot of my questions have been answered, but I was just wondering from a strategic perspective and given all the cash that could potentially be on the balance sheet next year and your leverage ratios coming down, would you potentially look outside the U.S. for an acquisition? I mean, historically, I think most of your acquisitions have been U.S.-based brands, but would you look to Europe and Asia for potentially acquiring a brand as well?","Robert K. Shearer","Sure, John. Yes, and we have in the past. So the answer to that question would be yes. Certainly, yes. In terms -- and particularly, I'd say, probably a little more Europe than Asia at this point in time, possibly Asia down the road, but at this point, Europe. So sure, we look for brands that ideally we could take across the globe, but also we've looked for brands that have been primarily centered in a region like Europe. And if we can grow them across Europe and get the kind of returns that we and our shareholders are looking for, we would certainly entertain that as a possibility.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","And, John, Napa and Kipling are 2 great examples. We rarely talk about this brand, but I think we did mention Kipling lately, it was the fastest-growing brand in sight we have for 2 quarters. So we're very happy with that performance.","Operator","And our last question will come from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","A lot of them have been answered, but Karl Heinz, I was hoping if you could just maybe comment on how you're feeling about the health of the consumer in Europe right now and maybe just parse it out between Northern and Southern Europe. And then secondly, as it relates that you mentioned briefly the Bread & Butter show and your Timberland brand being showcased there, if you could just speak a little bit more about kind of the appetite -- or the increasing appetite for that brand. Are you seeing kind of new accounts that were being drawn towards the brand or just current accounts going deeper within the product offering?","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Thank you for the question. So let's start with the first part, right, the sentiment in Europe. There's no big changes, I would say, in Europe. There are couple of big indicators showing. We are slowly going the right direction, which is good. But I wouldn't say -- there's no radical change to our last call. Having said that, we act to the portfolio of brands, and we act geographically in different areas, so we are clearly using that. And we are pushing where we see bigger opportunities. Emerging market in Europe, which is basically Russia down to Turkey, is a big opportunity, but so are the larger ones like German, Austria, Switzerland, that block. So I would say all in all, no big change, but we are doing pretty well with our brands. Specifically Bread & Butter and Timberland, this was our first time we went to that show with Timberland. We did go with other brands there in the past. Timberland was the first time. I think the response was shockingly strong for us. We did not expect such a response. In terms of participation, we had 3,000 people at the booth, which normally it doesn't happen. But we also did some additional activities around the 40-years history of Timberland. And to make it short, we see Timberland coming in Europe. I said that in the script, we expect Q4 to be positive, first time this year. The sellout data we see are good, especially in footwear, men's footwear, but also on apparel. So all in all, we see the brand coming, and we expect a great 2014.","Eric C. Wiseman","If that concludes our questions, I'll close with a quick comment.","We're focused right now on execution around our holiday season. It's a big season for us. And we're very focused, while investing more in our big brands, to create momentum as we approach 2014. We'll give you the wrap-up of all that on Valentine's Day. Looking forward to talking to you then when we talk about our fourth quarter performance and our 2014 plans. Take care.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's conference.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Joe Alkire, VP of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Joe Alkire - VF Corp.","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to VF Corporation's fourth quarter 2016 conference call. I'd like to remind everyone that participants on the call will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These uncertainties are detailed in documents filed regularly with the SEC.","Unless otherwise noted, amounts that our participants refer to on today's call will be predominantly in adjusted and currency neutral terms, which we defined in the press release that was issued this morning. We use adjusted and currency neutral amounts as lead numbers in our discussion, because we feel they more accurately represent the true operational performance and underlying results of our business.","You may also hear us refer to reported amounts, which are in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reconciliations of GAAP measures to adjusted and currency neutral amounts can be found in the supplemental financial tables included in the press release, which identify and quantify all excluded items and provide management's view of why this information is useful to investors.","During the third quarter of 2016, we announced that we had completed the sale of our Contemporary Brands coalition. Accordingly, the operating results, assets and liabilities of the Contemporary Brands businesses were moved into discontinued operations, and results presented on today's call are based on continuing operations.","Joining me on today's call will be VF's Executive Chairman, Eric Wiseman; President and CEO, Steve Rendle, President of our international business, Karl Heinz Salzburger, and our CFO, Scott Roe. Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call for questions. Eric?","Eric C. Wiseman - VF Corp.","Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone. On January 1, after 21 years at VF and nine years as CEO, I moved into the role of Executive Chairman of the board. At the same time, Steve became our President and CEO. In light of our new roles and this transition, and consistent with how we worked together for years, Steve and I are going to tag team today's call. I'll provide an overview of our 2016 results, and Steve, Karl Heinz and Scott will provide you with greater detail about the year and the company's point of view as we move into 2017.","So, here are the highlights of 2016. Revenue at $12 billion was up 1%, and importantly, the quality of our sales improved versus a year ago. Our international business remains strong, despite significant currency pressures, with international revenue up 6%, including double-digit growth in the non-U.S. Americas and in China. Our direct-to-consumer business continued its strong momentum, with growth of 9%, including more than 20% growth in e-commerce and double-digit increases in our Outdoor & Action Sports and international.","Vans became VF's largest brand, as revenue growth around the world continued. For the full-year, Vans was up a solid 7%, with growth accelerating throughout the year, reaching 15% in the fourth quarter. Gross margin, a key measure for us, improved 120 basis points to 49.4%, including record fourth quarter performance. And in line with our expectations, earnings per share was up 7%.","And while the environment in the U.S. was characterized by ongoing channel disruption in several high profile bankruptcies, VF's global business model and diverse brand portfolio enabled the company to deliver solid results during the year, including cash flow reaching $1.5 billion, returning $1.6 billion to shareholders, and demonstrating our operational excellence by keeping inventories in check.","At VF, our fundamentals are strong and our ability to win with consumers is unchanged. And while segments of our wholesale business in North America struggled in 2016, our global direct-to-consumer business and our business outside the U.S. remained strong. We're taking steps to address our challenges in North America, while sustaining the global business model that will continue to create and deliver near and long-term value.","Now before turning the call over to the team, I want to thank them for making my time in the CEO's chair everything I'd hoped it would be. While there are many things that I'm proud of, there's nothing I'm more proud of, we're confident in, in this leadership team. The company is in very capable hands.","Steve, my friend, with that I literally turn it over to you.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Thanks, Eric. It's clear that the pace of change in both our industry and the broader consumer landscape is happening at an accelerated rate. As we look ahead to 2017 and beyond, we will be an agile and consumer-centric organization. We will embed more of our value creating capabilities directly adjacent to our brands, while supporting cross-enterprise efforts with the right balance of brand-based and centralized teams and resources.","Looking to 2017, we will focus on Vans, The North Face, and Timberland. We expect their collective growth rate will be in the high single-digit rate. We will demonstrate a special focus on reigniting growth in our North Face and Timberland brands in the Americas. And we expect that in 2017 international growth rates in Europe and Asia will nearly double, as we distort our capital investments toward our largest and most profitable growth opportunities, with a particular focus on China.","In the months ahead, we will capitalize on and leverage our collective confidence in workwear across VF. This is a catalyst for growth as we see strengthening of the industrial sector and increased spending on infrastructure. Given our strong performance in e-commerce and to fuel accelerated growth, we will meaningfully invest in digital as part of our global focus on direct-to-consumer, and we will amplify our investments in the design of products to enrich the consumer brand experience.","And to a question that is likely on your mind, yes, we remain committed to being an active brand portfolio manager, and we will continue to focus on M&A to create value. That being said, we will be disciplined and we will not take action simply for the sake of taking action. And, of course, the quality of our talent matters. We will leverage VF's deep bench of global talent by placing proven leaders in the right jobs, at the right time, in the right place.","So with that, let's move to a more detailed discussion of our brands performance in 2016, first the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition. Revenue was up 2% during the quarter, which was slightly below the outlook we provided last October. The shortfall was due in part to our strategic decision to ship less North Face product into the off-price channel in the Americas. While this decision came at the cost of reported revenue and earnings growth in 2016, we believe it was the right decision for the long-term health of our brand. As a result of these actions, coupled with retailer caution, channel inventories are well-positioned heading into 2017.","During the quarter, our D2C and international platforms remained strong, with revenue growth in the mid-teens. Wholesale revenue decreased at a high single-digit rate, as low single-digit growth in our international business was more than offset by a mid-teen decline in the Americas, due primarily to the inventory actions just mentioned.","Moving to our brands, I'll begin with The North Face. Global revenue was down 7% during the quarter, with a mid-teen increase in D2C, offset by more than a 20% decline in wholesale. And excluding the specific inventory actions we mentioned earlier and the impact of bankruptcies, global revenue would have increased at a low single-digit rate, with a significant improvement in the quality of sales.","In the Americas, revenue was down at a low double-digit rate during the quarter, with a low double-digit D2C growth, offset by a 30% decline in wholesale, mostly due to the inventory actions and the impact of bankruptcies previously mentioned. As many of you are aware, the fall\/winter season got off to a slow start in October and November. Performance improved in December, and that trend has continued into January.","I want to take a minute to explain the $80 million impairment charge to the lucy brand. This was a direct results of our decision to merge the lucy women's product engine with that of The North Face brand. During the course of 2017, we will wind down the operations of our lucy business, and beginning in 2018 lucy product will be positioned in The North Face brand as part of the Mountain Athletics collection.","lucy has developed tremendous customer loyalty by delivering exceptional product in a very attractive consumer segment. However, brand awareness is low, the trademark is limited to North America, and the performance has been uneven over the last few years. We believe the combination of lucy's strong product portfolio with The North Face's brand awareness and distribution network is just the right catalyst to accelerate our TNF Mountain Athletics growth rate over the next several years. It's a great example of our One VF approach to active portfolio management.","Now I'll pass it on to Karl Heinz, who will provide The North Face details in Europe and Asia.","Karl Heinz Salzburger - VF Corp.","Our North Face business in Europe had another strong quarter, with revenue up at a high teen rate, driven by an almost 30% increase in DTC and a low double-digit increase in our wholesale business. Growth was balanced across geographies, channels, and product categories.","The work the European team did two years ago to reset the model has put the brand on a strong path. We will apply those learnings to accelerate growth in the Americas. In Asia, fourth quarter revenue was down at a mid-single-digit rate. Our retail business had low double-digit growth, which was offset by more than 20% decline in wholesale.","The quarter was weaker than expected, as the outdoor environment remained highly promotional in China. We are consolidating our retail partners, more aggressively managing inventory in the marketplace, and elevating our distribution in the region. While this shift will cause early 2017 performance to be relatively flat, we expect strong momentum to return in the second half of 2017.","To wrap up The North Face, revenues for the year were down 1% globally in 2016 to $2.3 billion. Excluding the inventory actions and the impact of bankruptcies, The North Face was up at a low single-digit rate. For 2017, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single-digit range, up mid-teens in Europe, and a mid-single-digit increase in the Americas and Asia.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Switching to Vans, VF's largest brand and our fastest growing brand in 2016 and during the fourth quarter, up 7% and 15%, respectively. It proved to be a terrific outcome, as we celebrated Vans' 50th anniversary year. The brand's continued success in a very inconsistent retail environment is impressive and clearly demonstrates the deep understanding the Vans team has of its consumer. Congratulations to the Vans team across the globe on a job really well done.","For the quarter, Vans America's growth was balanced across the region and channels. Our strong momentum continued with 17% growth, including more than 20% growth in D2C and low single-digit growth in wholesale. D2C comps were up at a high teen rate, including 40% growth in our e-commerce business.","Looking at product, our All Weather MTE collection, which is designed for the elements and leverages Vans as a four-season brand, doubled its revenue compared with last year. And Vans upgraded custom footwear platform, which allows consumers to create their own unique Vans shoes through patterns, colors and the ability to upload their own art, is off to a strong start.","Karl Heinz Salzburger - VF Corp.","As expected, Vans European business returned to growth during the quarter and was up at a low single-digit rate. Our DTC business remains strong, with more than 20% revenue growth. Wholesale declined at a mid-single-digit rate, as inventory levels in the channel continued to moderate. We saw a significant increase in sell-through in our iconic silhouettes, and our Toy Story collaboration was a big success. Now that inventory levels have normalized, we expect high-single-digit growth in 2017 from Vans in Europe.","In Asia, Vans revenue continued to impress, with more than 25% growth. This was fueled by almost 50% growth in DTC and a low teen increase in our wholesale business. E-commerce was particularly strong in China. Key product stories, such as the Toy Story collaboration, sold out almost immediately.","In 2016, Vans global revenue was up 7% to $2.3 billion, exactly in line with our expectations. Looking at 2017, we expect Vans revenues to increase at a low double-digit rate, driven by a high single-digit increase in both the Americas and Europe, and up high teens in Asia.","Now on to Timberland.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","For the quarter, Timberland global revenue increased at a mid-double-digit rate, which was squarely in line with our expectations. This result was driven by a low double-digit increase in D2C and a low single-digit growth in wholesale. Revenue in the Americas increased at a low single-digit rate, including a low double-digit increase in our D2C business, which was partially offset by a low single-digit decline in wholesale.","Similar to The North Face, our core brand business was impacted by a slow start to the season, excess inventory in the marketplace, bankruptcies and overall retailer caution. We were pleased to see momentum in our D2C business in Q4, our biggest quarter of the year, highlighted by continued traction with our new SensorFlex platform and limited release programs. Timberland PRO increased at a high single-digit rate, as we saw improvement in the industrial sector.","Karl Heinz Salzburger - VF Corp.","Timberland revenue in Europe was strong, with revenue up at a low double-digit rate, with high teen growth in DTC and mid-single-digit growth in wholesale. DTC saw strength from SensorFlex, which doubled in size in the quarter. In our apparel category, we saw a 20% increase sparked by winter outerwear and sportswear collections. And finally, our Classic and six-inch boots sold in record numbers, driven by The Original Yellow Boot campaign, which celebrated Timberland's heritage.","Revenue in Timberland's Asia business was up at a mid-single-digit rate, lifted by a high teen increase in our wholesale business. DTC declined at a mid-single-digit rate, as strong e-commerce growth was offset by softness in the Hong Kong and Japan markets.","In 2016, Timberland revenue was up 1% globally to $1.8 billion, in line with expectations. As we look to 2017, we expect Timberland to grow in the low single-digit range, with mid-single-digit growth in Europe and Asia and modest growth in the Americas. And given the improvement in the U.S. industrial sector, we expect our Timberland PRO business to increase at a mid-single-digit rate.","Now on to Jeanswear.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Our global Jeanswear business declined 4% during the quarter, as low single-digit growth for Wrangler was offset by a low double-digit decline for the Lee brand. On a global basis, low double-digit growth in D2C was more than offset by a mid-single-digit decline in wholesale.","In the Americas, Wrangler increased at a low single-digit rate, offset by a high-teen decline in Lee. Slower than expected traffic in the mass and mid-tier channels, combined with aggressive retail inventory management from key retail partners, drove softness during the quarter. Given market dynamics, we expect continued disruption and repositioning in these channels in the near-term, and we expect more moderate growth during the course of 2017. Our brands remain strong and we are focused on leveraging the growth opportunities in front of us.","Karl Heinz Salzburger - VF Corp.","In Europe, Jeanswear was up low single digits, with low double-digit growth in Lee, which was partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in Wrangler, primarily related to the timing of shipments. In Lee, the Scarlett for women and denim for men continue to be strong drivers. In Wrangler, the brand is showing positive momentum with new product initiatives, including our 70th anniversary Retro Glory capsule, a first-ever global collection.","In Asia, Lee was about flat during the quarter and Wrangler declined at the high teen rate. Both Lee and Wrangler's results in the region were impacted by the uncertainty related to currency issues in India. We saw strength in China, in particular in e-commerce. Revenue for the women's business increased more than 25%, (17:46) BODY OPTIX.","For the year Jeanswear revenue was in line with 2015, with low single-digit growth in Wrangler offset by a low single-digit decline in Lee. For 2017, given channel headwinds in the Americas, we expect Jeanswear revenue to be in line with 2016, as low single-digit growth in Europe and Asia is offset by a modest decline in the Americas.","Now to Imagewear.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Imagewear revenue grew 15% during the fourth quarter of 2016, driven by a more than 20% increase in our licensed sports goods business and a mid-single-digit increase in workwear. LSG had a record year, thanks to the Cubs snapping their 108-year World Series drought and, as expected, workwear returned to growth this quarter, posting a mid-single-digit increase on the heels of improving industrial sector fundamentals.","We are increasingly optimistic about the growth opportunity of VF's most capital-efficient business as we head into 2017. For the year, Imagewear increased 2% to $1.1 billion, in line with our outlook. For 2017, we expect revenue for the Imagewear coalition to increase at a low single-digit rate, driven by the workwear business.","Our Sportswear business was down 17% in the quarter due to weakness in both wholesale and D2C. Revenue at Nautica was down 20%. However, adjusting for the strategic decision to license the women's sleepwear and men's underwear business, the brand was down 14%. The brand continues to grapple with significant pressure in the department store channel.","Kipling's North America business was down 2% due to similar category and channel pressures. Kipling's international business was up 7% and globally the Kipling brand achieved mid-single-digit growth. For 2017, we're expecting revenue to decline at a high single-digit rate for this coalition, principally associated with the channel pressures faced by the Nautica brand.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Thanks, Steve. Before I dive into the results, let me provide some context around the unusual items that impacted our fourth quarter. First, as outlined in the news release, we took an $80 million pre-tax non-cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the intangible assets related to the lucy brand. This was a direct result of our decision to merge the lucy women's product engine with that of The North Face brand, as Steve mentioned earlier.","During the fourth quarter, we also incurred $58 million of pre-tax restructuring charges. In light of the divestiture of Contemporary Brands, the ongoing strategic review of our LSG business, and the lucy initiative just mentioned, we are realigning our cost structure. In totality, these actions will allow us to operate with increased efficiency, speed and agility, and set the foundation for even greater leverage of our platforms going forward.","Lastly, we elected to take a $51 million pre-tax non-cash pension settlement charge during the quarter in order to reduce the size and volatility of our U.S. pension plan, which has been closed to new participants since 2005. The company offered former employees an option to receive a lump sum distribution of their vested benefits paid out of planned assets. This action reduced our total pension liability by $225 million. The pension was fully funded as of December 31, 2016.","So now with that behind us, let's take a look at our fourth quarter results. I will focus on adjusted results excluding the unusual items just mentioned.","Revenue was up 1% on a currency-neutral basis to $3.3 billion. While this was a little below expectations, the quality of the business has improved dramatically as compared to a year ago. We are acutely focused on the fundamentals. Gross margin is up. Cash flow is strong. Inventory is under control, up less than 1% versus last year. These facts give us confidence that the actions we're taking to improve and protect the long-term health of our brands, our channel, and our business model are beginning to show progress.","Direct-to-consumer revenue was up 12%, including a mid-teen increase in the Outdoor & Action Sports and a low double-digit increase in Jeanswear. Our international D2C business was particularly strong, with a mid-teen increase during the quarter. Wholesale revenue was down at a mid-single-digit rate in the quarter due primarily to inventory actions and the impact of bankruptcies and difficult conditions in the Jeanswear business in North America. And on a geographic basis, the Americas was down 2%, EMEA up 7%, Asia was up 8%, including low double-digit growth in China.","Gross margin on an adjusted basis was especially strong, 49.8%, up 160 basis points, which included a 90 basis point negative impact from changes in foreign currency. This was a record outcome for the quarter. Our gross margin drivers remain intact and, while inventory actions that we outlined cost us a little bit of revenue and earnings growth during the quarter, we are clearly benefiting at the gross margin line from the higher full price sell-through, as evidenced by almost 250 basis point increase in gross margin on a currency-neutral basis.","SG&A as a percentage of revenue was up 250 basis points on an adjusted basis to 34.5%. While we remain diligent with respect to overall expense control in light of the growth environment, we continue to distort investment toward our strategic priorities, digital and stores, product innovation, demand creation, and technology.","Fourth quarter adjusted operating margin declined 90 basis points to 15.3%, the majority of which was due to a 60 basis point negative impact from FX. So now carrying all this to the bottom line, our adjusted EPS grew 8% on a currency-neutral basis to $0.97 in the quarter. That's in line with the outlook we provided in October after you consider the impact from FX, as the dollar continued to strengthen throughout the quarter.","To recap the full year, 2016 grew 1% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by 6% growth in our international business and 9% growth in D2C. This was despite the impact of bankruptcies and reduced sales to the off-price channel compared with 2015. These two actions alone accounted for almost 2% of top-line growth.","Adjusted gross margin was up 40 basis points to 48.6%, including an 80 basis point headwind from changes in foreign currency. Our gross margin improvement was driven primarily by a 50 basis point benefit due to mix shift toward our highest margin businesses, as the expected benefit from lower product cost and price was essentially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency.","SG&A for the year was up 130 basis points, as we continue to balance appropriate short-term expense control with investments in our long-term growth priorities. Full year adjusted operating margin was 14%, compared to 14.9% in 2015, and includes a 50 basis point headwind from changes in FX.","So that brings us to a full year adjusted EPS, which was $3.11, a 7% increase over 2015 on a currency-neutral basis. And we ended the year with a strong balance sheet and a capital structure that continues to provide us with great flexibility. Our strong operational discipline was on display, as we ended the year with less than 1% inventory growth. In 2016, we generated almost $1.5 billion in cash from ops and returned more than $1.6 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","So now turning to 2017 outlook. We expect full year reported revenue to be up at a low single-digit rate, including about a 2 percentage point negative impact from foreign currency. By coalition, on a currency-neutral basis, Outdoor & Action Sports is expected to increase at a mid-single-digit rate, with Vans up low double digits, The North Face up mid-single digits, and Timberland up low single digits.","Jeanswear revenue is expected to be about flat, with low single-digit growth in Wrangler and Lee international. Imagewear revenue is expected to increase at a low single-digit rate and Sportswear is expected to decline at a high single-digit rate. Building on a strong 2016 performance, we expect accelerated growth in the international business, up at a high single-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis.","By region, in Europe, we expect a high single-digit increase in revenue. In our Asia region, revenue should be up at a high single-digit percentage rate, including low double-digit growth in China. And in our Americas non-U.S. business, we're expecting revenue to grow at a low teen percentage rate.","Our D2C business is expected to be up at a high single-digit rate on a currency neutral basis. For the year, we expect to add approximately 50 stores. Comp sales growth is expected to be in the mid-single-digit range, including more than 25% growth in e-commerce. We expect our reported gross margin to approximate 2016 levels at about 48.6%. Changes in foreign currency are expected to negatively impact our gross margin rate by about 70 basis points. Excluding the impact of FX, our gross margin improvement is primarily mix related, as we anticipate a relatively stable product cost environment for the balance of 2017.","Our operating margin is expected to remain relatively flat on a currency-neutral basis at approximately 14%, as our gross margin improvement is partially offset by continued investments in our strategic growth priorities, those being digital and stores, demand and product creation, and innovation. We expect our tax rate to be in the low 20% range. And moving to the bottom-line, we expect currency-neutral EPS to be up at a mid-single-digit range in 2017, or down at a low single-digit rate compared to 2016 adjusted EPS of $3.11.","With respect to the first half outlook, we expect first half 2017 earnings per share to decline at a mid-single-digit rate on a reported basis, up low single digits currency-neutral. As a reminder, the first quarter of 2016 benefited from about $0.05 of earnings per share due to discrete tax items, the majority of which related to the early adoption of the accounting standard for equity compensation. We do not expect discrete tax benefits in the first quarter of 2017.","So in closing, the structural shifts taking place in the retail environment are creating difficult conditions in some geographies and categories. While we expect these conditions to persist in the near-term, we believe our strong portfolio of brands, our operational discipline, and strength and diversity of our model, will allow us to continue to deliver strong returns for our shareholders. We look forward to laying out our long-term strategic and financial aspirations in more detail during the Investor Day on March 30.","And now with that, I'll turn it back to the operator and take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go first to Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Hey, Mike.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","First, I just wanted to ask a couple of questions on the model. The key one I'm wondering about is if second half of the year \u2013 thanks for the help with the shape of the year, but the second half of the year guidance is for revenues to accelerate about mid-single digits excluding currency. I mean, is that \u2013 how much \u2013 as you guys build that up, how much of that is based on the easier compares for the winter that we just came off of versus a more realistic view of your thoughts on the long-term run rate of revenues that the portfolio can deliver today?","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Yeah, Michael, Scott here. So, I guess, first of all, it's true. Your modeling is \u2013 you're in the right ZIP code from the actual numerical growth in the second half. What we're seeing is acceleration, particularly in the big three, in the second half and that's based on our line of sight. Our top three brands are growing, as we look forward, high single digits collectively, and that's supported by the order books that we see. From the Jeanswear business we also will see some modest acceleration in the second half. As we're working through some of the repositioning in the first half, we'll see a return to growth in the second half. So those are the proof points that give us confidence in the second half that we'll see relatively better growth.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","And can it continue at that pace after we kind of roll off of the strange comparisons here in the second half of this year?","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Yeah, are you talking beyond 2017? Or \u2013 yeah, I mean, we're confident in the growth, particularly in the big three going forward.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Yeah, Michael, I would add just real quick. I mean, if you think about what we saw in 2016 and the compares that we have coming into 2017, we do see a much cleaner marketplace in that Outdoor segment. There was a tremendous amount of off-price goods, some fueled by ourselves and other industry brands, other portions coming out of the bankruptcies that the marketplace had to absorb. It's our opinion that those goods have been, for the most part, sold through and we have a much cleaner marketplace for ourselves to sell into. We also have a higher level of confidence on the product quality that we are selling into the marketplace with our big three brands, giving us great confidence that that collective high single-digit growth rate Scott mentioned will be there. And we see no reason why these big, powerful brands cannot continue at those rates with the additional focus that we're bringing to our product, the design, and the experiences that these brands bring to consumers.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And if I could just ask one last follow-up. I just want to make sure I understand the guidance for the year for overall is mid-single-digit revenue growth ex-currency, and then that translates to mid-single-digit EPS growth ex-currency.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Right.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","I'm a little surprised that mid-single-digit revenue growth doesn't translate to more leverage in your model, just based on some of the earmarks you gave us before and your comment that you're going to build about 50 stores next year, which is a little bit lower of a growth rate as we think through like the SG&A. Are there other components in the algorithm that have changed that a mid-single-digit revenue growth rate wouldn't translate to some leverage in the organic earnings growth rate?","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Well, I guess, no, fundamentally. Michael, one thing, I guess, you heard too from a tax rate standpoint that we're seeing an increased tax rate. That's really couple reasons, but mix is driving a lot of that as we see the recovery of U.S. profitability. Obviously, that's at a higher tax rate and that creates a little bit of a headwind, but structurally, no change. The low single-digit revenue growth is also backed up by increased gross margin, as we see that mix benefit coming through.","We are investing in the growth priorities from an SG&A standpoint, with digital and stores being one of those. Now we said 50 stores is the number of net adds. Keep in mind, we're investing against our biggest brands, where we have a proven profitable brick-and-mortar business. We are also pairing some of the underperforming stores, and particularly the actions related to lucy, as well as other parts of our fleet.","I'd just point out, you look at our average lease term is a little over four years. That means, in any given year, about a quarter of our entire fleet can be adjusted. And as we've seen some tough performance in a few areas, we're taking advantage of that and we're paring down some of the underperforming stores as we look into 2017.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Look forward to see you guys in the end of March. Thanks.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","And we'll go next to Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Hi. Thanks. Good morning.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Hey, Omar.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Could you give us an update in terms of kind of your strategies to deal with some of the U.S. wholesale challenges that the whole market is experiencing? And how much you think \u2013 how you're kind of planning that channel long-term too? Is it kind of a slow, steady decline? Are you going to try to right size your footprint in those channels? And then how are you also thinking about digital marketplaces as alternative kind of wholesale channels, if you will? Thanks.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Yeah, hey, Omar. So when you think about the overall environment, certainly it's uneven and inconsistent. If I were to start, our international business is experiencing really solid growth. We came out of fourth quarter up 7%, and that is really outpacing the economic growth rates in both Europe and Asia. And we see that continuing into this year up high single digits. And our D2C, our own retail brick-and-mortar and our e-commerce had a really solid fourth quarter, up 12%; in particular, our e-commerce we saw plus 20%. And we see that continuing into the 2017 period as well.","And the environment that we are really focused on here is the U.S. marketplace. It continues to experience channel disruption and, in some cases, channel compression. And we don't really see that changing. Our exposure to some of these \u2013 like the department store channel is less than 3%. And when you look at the mid-tier mass and department store together, it's less than 20%. These are important customers for us, and we are working with them to certainly improve our performance and, hopefully, in so doing, help improve their performance.","But we'll continue to focus with our brand portfolio, especially these big three on our specialty channels and where our brands really come to life to where our consumers shop. And the digital piece is very, very important. Clearly, our own sites, but we have a whole host of online partners that we work with to represent our brand in the same manner that we do within our own sites, and we see that continuing to increase in importance, but also not at all discounting the importance of the brick-and-mortar experience that these brands of ours need to provide to the consumer.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Thanks. And then maybe could you talk a little bit in more detail? I mean, the D2C performances you mentioned was very good and it sounds like e-commerce was certainly a big piece of it. But what were some of the keys there or specific areas of strength that you think drove that channel, which is obviously especially important, given the wholesale channel's challenges?","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","In case of D2C, our teams have applied a lot of emphasis around store productivity, and through product segmentation, certainly how we're using our stores as the premier expression, how that \u2013 then the product flows through our wholesale partners. But as we think about how we use our stores, being really thoughtful about regional assortments, using the data that we have through prior year's selling, putting the right product in those right locations, and really using our supply chain to optimize product flow and fulfillment.","The in-store service component, the experience level, if you were to visit a Vans store anywhere in the U.S. or, for that matter, in the globe, I think you'd see a very consistent approach to how our brand comes to life, how the products were assorted, but most importantly, that service element that comes to life with our in-store staff, and that's been a big part of our performance this year.","And then the digital piece, we've spoken a lot in the past about our One VF platform, where we've created a very robust content and commerce engine that many of our brands are on, and we use that to really drive that online experience, but also provide as seamless of an experience as possible and leveraging our supply chain to deliver those products in a quick and efficient way.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Thanks, Steve. Good luck, guys.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Thanks, Omar.","Operator","We'll go next to Bob Drbul with Guggenheim.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Hey, Bob.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Eric, congratulations. Good luck.","Eric C. Wiseman - VF Corp.","Thanks, Bob.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","I've got a couple of questions. I think the first one is just a bigger picture question I think for Steve. When you look at the profitability and the operating margin of the outdoor coalition, I think anchored by The North Face, can you just give us your take on how sustainable that level of profitability is for the business?","And then the second question I have is on the Timberland business, can you talk a little bit about how the apparel business is performing at Timberland?","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Absolutely, Bob. So the first question, the profitability of our Outdoor & Action Sports business, I will tell you that I think that profitability is absolutely sustainable, and that starts, first and foremost, with the quality of the products and the gross margin that we're able to obtain through just a year-over-year improvement of the products we offer and the pricing that we look to, to provide \u2013 to drive that gross margin.","Levering our SG&A, making sure we're investing in those key areas, product, design, the marketing and the digital aspect takes great, great attention, and then being able to leverage really those back-end functions across the VF platform, really managing that model that we've talked about for years, really is bringing benefit. And when you think about the power of a Vans business with its D2C footprint, North Face with its D2C and digital platform, and Timberland really emerging and seeing better and better D2C improvement, that also gives us great confidence that that operating margin, profitability model is sustainable.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Yeah, Bob, Scott here. Just to add on, in the last several years too, we've had an incredible amount of FX headwinds, which have pressured us particularly in our European business. And while we do have pricing pressure and we've been able to overcome that over time, we see \u2013 typically when you see big FX impacts, like we have over the last two years, we grow into that over a couple seasons, right? So we're taking significant price increases, we have in the last two years and we will continue to. I would expect and we will see our profitability through gross margin continue to rise as we absorb those FX distortions. Think about Brexit alone last year was a significant impact in our largest UK market. We'll get over that, but it takes us a little while to price into that.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","And then I'll grab your Timberland apparel question, Bob. Our Timberland apparel business on a global basis is good. We've seen really strong growth in our European business. It was up 20% this last fall. We've been reshaping and repositioning our apparel engine to our Stabio, Switzerland, office and leveraging the strength of that sportswear platform anchored with Napapijri, and that's a large part what our Timberland team has been able to see those results in Europe.","That collection is now coming globally and we need it, because here in the U.S. our performance has not been up to the expectations that we've had. We've seen good sell-through in our own retail environments, and we'd like to see better sell-through with our wholesale partners. And that is exactly why we've taken a step back, looked at how to really come to life with apparel as we see the success in our European business. That will become the global anchor for the apparel platform and we think that will really give us a point of difference, not only here in the U.S., but also in Asia, and be able to stand out against the other choices in the market.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. And if I could just have one more follow-up. On The North Face business, when you look at how the business and the brand performed in 2016, do you think that there's competitive challenges that the brand is facing today in the U.S. specifically?","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","If you're going to unpack the TNF performance, we saw really strong international growth this last year. Our European business was up high teens in Q4 and for the full year. And I think another great validation point for us is our D2C is strong, and our e-commerce platform really represents the business well.","I would tell you here in North America, Bob, probably the biggest issue that we saw in 2015 was that tremendous amount of excess inventory that was in the marketplace, and I said part of that was our doing. But it was the industry's doing coming out of 2015, had a really big impact on the marketplace and the ability to represent new goods with so much last year's product in the marketplace. That is exactly why we made the decision to pull back on the move of excess inventory at the expense of revenue and earnings, because we think it's very important that as a leader we do our part to have a clean marketplace for ourselves.","I would tell you, Bob, some of this that we see with The North Face is our own doing. We, as we've looked ourselves in the mirror, do not think we've put the strongest product offer into the United States marketplace. And we've done a lot of work over the last six to eight months to rectify that and put ourselves in a better position. The four brand territories that these new specific business units that we have in place is adding greater clarity of focus and helping our design teams really bring the right product to life in each of those brand territories.","And I guess the validation point, as we looked at our European business over the last two years, it's come from a similar slowdown. Tremendous amount of work done, first, on our leadership team, the market segmentation, and the quality of the product, the amount of new product that this team brought to market, combined with really strong go-to-market disciplines. That's brought us into that high teen growth rate, and that model, that template is being picked up and brought to our U.S. business, and I think this is where our strength's really come to bear. We'll be able to move quickly to get these changes in place and get that elevated level of product that certainly we've been used to and the marketplace expects back here in the U.S. market.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much. Good luck.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","And we'll go next to Jim Duffy with Stifel.","Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Hey, Jim.","Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Eric, I wanted to thank you for your help with everything over the years. Congratulations to you.","Eric C. Wiseman - VF Corp.","Thanks a lot, Jim. It's been a pleasure.","Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Steve, my first question is a big picture question building on Omar's line of questioning on distribution channel strategy. So in North America, the landscape is dynamic as ever, good indications it's over-stored. Are there brands where you think it's the right decision to pull back on some distribution?","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","I guess, if you think about the distribution strategy, that's a every season, every year opportunity for our businesses to look at the channel partners that they work with and how we are segmenting our products and really thinking about what partners to place our products in. I wouldn't say, Jim, there's anybody that we would back out of. I would say, each of our groups are focusing on their key partners, and that's true for Vans, that's at North Face, that's at Timberland, SmartWool. And I think probably more attention is being put into the right assortment, the right levels at the right times of the year, so really leveraging that retail discipline and becoming more retail centric looking at the quality of flow and the frequency of new delivery. I think that's more of our focus than pulling back on or limiting any of our partners.","Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, helpful. Thanks. In the Outdoor category, you're showing good discipline with respect to populating the off-price channel. We heard of order cancellations this year from many brands. What's your confidence that competitors are showing the same discipline to help with pricing integrity looking out to second half of 2017?","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Jim, I can't speak for them, but all I can do is speak to ours. We have a history of really understanding how to supply the market in a \u2013 at a proper level. Those disciplines are back in a very strong and important way. And I think as we manage our own house effectively, we think that will really help us access that open-to-buy that we're deserving of and working with our partners, driving our sell-through and gross margin contribution to their business.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Jim, just to build on that, it doesn't directly answer your question, but one thing that we've seen throughout this year and expect it would continue is more conservative buying from the channel in general as well. So as you look back maybe into the end of 2015, where everybody got maybe a little over their skis and we had a glut of inventory in the market, we don't see that type of appetite as people are keeping it a little more cautious. So, again, we don't have full visibility to what everybody is doing, but in general there's more caution in the environment, which means \u2013 should mean less inventory in the system.","Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks, guys. I'll leave it at that.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Thanks, Jim.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","See you, Jim.","Operator","And we'll go next to Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie.","Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to follow-up on your outsized growth in the DTC business. Can you talk about a bit about the economics between the DTC and the wholesale businesses? Can you dissect the DTC contribution to the EBIT margin line? And how much variance is there to that line item, especially with the outsized growth in e-commerce?","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Well, that's a lot of questions. So you can probably appreciate, we're not going to get into that kind of \u2013 that level of detail, but what I can tell you is that, first of all, our most profitable segment of our business is our digital e-commerce. And it's also our fastest growing, and that's where we're doubling down a lot of investment. We would expect that to continue to grow and even accelerate, as was part of our outlook. So that mix benefit will continue to help our profitability improve. Honestly, within our fleet, we have a bit of a bell curve, right? We have our biggest brands, which is where the majority of our retail sits, continues to perform very well. It's accretive, it has been and will continue to be a key strategic driver of our growth.","We have some other formats that, frankly, aren't performing as well, and that's one of the reasons that 50-store net guidance is a little different than what you've seen in the past. It's about half of what we've done over the last \u2013 even a little less than half of what we've done over the last several years. And that's because we're focusing on those formats that work and leaning into those, and we're taking a little more cautious and aggressively reducing our exposure to those formats that don't work. And by formats, I'm talking about brands with relatively underperforming retail.","Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay, very helpful. And then on the international business, it looks like you're going to continue seeing outsized growth in that business for 2017. I think it was 38% for 2016 in terms of revenues. How do we think about that business going forward as a percentage of total contribution? And then on Europe, I think Europe is still, like, twice the size of Asia, and then with the comments on China this morning, how do you think about the Asia business going forward?","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","So I'll give you some of the numbers. You must have an amazing model by the way, I got to tell you, that's impressive (52:52). We would expect our international growth to continue to outpace U.S., just because of some of the macro conditions, and frankly because we're so underpenetrated relative to the opportunities that we see, China being the biggest single example. So we'll talk more about that in 30 days or so at our Investor Day on how we see international, but suffice it to say, we continue to see it outpacing the overall growth and mix higher in the long-term.","Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great, and looking forward to the Investor Day.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Thanks, Laurent.","Operator","And we'll go next to Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Hey, Lindsay.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Hey, Lindsay.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Steve, I wanted to start with, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that the industry is going through an extraordinary pace of change and you're looking to adapt in areas that you're focusing on, included investing in your brands, direct-to-consumer and international, which \u2013 that was what I wrote down \u2013 which seems to have been the areas where you've been focused on for the last five or 10 years also. So I guess my question is, as you think about adapting to the new environment, what's really changing about your approach? Is there anything that we should expect that's really very different or where we should see more significant shifts or investment?","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Well, we certainly look forward to spending a lot of time unpacking that question at our Investor Day. A lot of the conversation will be just around that. We spent a great amount of work over 2016 updating and refreshing our VF strategy, strategy that we'll talk to you about here in 30 days. But in that, Lindsay, it really was about how do we evolve what has been a very successful model. There's really no revolution to be had here. It's really about evolving those skill sets that we have here corporately, but more importantly make sure that fit in our brands in the most productive way. And as we think about going forward, our D2C capabilities really are an important aspect of our strategy and how we want to distort our energy in digital. That's not new news to you.","We think we are very well advantaged with our platform that we use to interact with our consumers, but also as we stand up, stronger and stronger analytics practice to use the consumer data that we have and the shopper data that we're pulling out of our stores to help inform how we interact with our consumer, how we think about the products that we create, and when they want those products presented to them. Our innovation platform has been something we've been investing in quite a bit over the last few years, and that will continue to be an important part of where the new ideas for new franchises, but also we have a digital lab that sits in Northern California as well that really is keeping our teams and the businesses and our systems teams here in Greensboro really up-to-date and moving at the right pace to make sure that we've got the right technology in \u2013 really come in the front of us to be able to evolve and stay fresh.","But I think the thing that we're really focused on here as we look at the disruption in the channels and, more importantly, how the consumers today are looking for brands to come to life to them is really elevating our emphasis on design. We've spent a lot of time and energy with some outside partners working with our top brands on elevating our design capability specifically for product, but how we link that product to our experiences, be it in store, online, or anywhere where our brands come to life. Vans is probably one of the best expression with their House of Vans or the different events that they have going across the globe. It's just how do we have the most robust design and the clearest expression of our brands that pull the consumers to us in this very cluttered and high-energy marketplace.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Shifting to costs, you have a restructuring charge, cost realignment charge that you took and I was curious if you could help maybe dimensionalize how you're thinking about cost savings in fiscal 2017 or beyond from that initiative? And also whether we should be looking for similar to 2016 savings from a favorable costing environment or maybe how you approach to pricing?","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Yeah, Lindsay. So, first of all, the savings from the actions I think we said in our prepared remarks that, frankly, we're a little bit smaller, right? So we sold our Contemporary business. We're looking at options for LSG. And as part of that, we also took a look at our cost structure to right size that in light of it. So you can think about more or less the leave behind costs as you exit the unabsorbed overhead has been right sized in 2017, so that there's no impact from being a little bit smaller as a company. There will be continuing benefits into beyond 2017. We don't see the full impact of all those, but the majority of it really is just offsetting those leave behind costs.","And I just make a general comment too. Continued cost hygiene is part of our culture and we'll continue to look at our cost structure going forward, because we see that as a no-regret action as a way to redeploy investment back into those strategic priorities that we've outlined before. I'm sorry. There was a part two \u2013 oh, you asked about cost, right? I assume product cost is...","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Product cost and pricing.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Yeah. So we've got about 1% price assumption in our next year and we see some modest price increase, mostly around labor, labor costs and some of that's relative to the mix from a sourcing standpoint. But it's relatively modest, a little bit of commodity timing as well, but cost is really not a big issue as we look at 2017, and more or less the two balance out, price and cost.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thanks very much.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Thanks, Lindsay.","Operator","We'll go next to Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Good morning, everyone, and congratulations, Eric, and best of luck.","Eric C. Wiseman - VF Corp.","Thanks a lot, Dana.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","As you think about the runway for gross margin gains go-forward, given the gross margin opportunity, how do you dimensionalize it either by coalition? And from what buckets does this gross margin improvement come from would you say? And lastly, any thoughts on the border taxes and how \u2013 adjustments there, how do you think about it? Thank you.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Yeah, hey, Dana. So, first of all, where does the gross margin mix come from? We've talked about this 40 to 50 basis points over for a very long time now, and it's pretty simple. It's our \u2013 high-margin businesses are our fastest growing. So it's D2C, it's international, it's Outdoor & Action Sports. We see no reason why that would \u2013 those would not continue to be our fastest growing businesses and they do indeed have our highest gross margin. So that's really the answer. Also as we've made some of the portfolio moves, that's also \u2013 that mix has also been beneficial from a gross margin standpoint.","Eric C. Wiseman - VF Corp.","And then, Dana, I'll take your tax and trade point there. I would tell you, we're very supportive of a reduction in U.S. corporate income tax rate, but we see some problems with trying to cover that gap with a border adjustment tax. We've sought counsel with third parties that we work with to really try to understand all the different elements of what's being proposed, and we've built a number of scenario models to help us understand those impacts. And we've taken that information and the approach that we're using here is to connect with key legislators and policymakers to help educate and influence their understanding of the impacts on our business, and through that create that relationship for the coming months.","Because we're kind of at this point where we're going to monitor and observe, because honestly until there's a piece of legislation, there's really nothing to us to react to and it's more speculation. So it's really about understanding and paying very close attention, working with our advisors and doing this educate and influence approach with the key legislators and policymakers that we think is important for them to hear from businesses like ours on what are the issues and how would we frame it to have it be more optimal for business.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","And, Dana, I would just say, we can find scenarios at the extremes that are either really good or really bad. It depends on which tweet you happen to look at. But from our standpoint right now, we believe there's likely to be pros and cons, and it's virtually impossible to weigh what that would mean, given the fact that there's really no concrete legislation out there right now for us to model against.","Dana Lauren Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Thank you.","Eric C. Wiseman - VF Corp.","Thanks, Dana.","Operator","And we'll go next to Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thanks. Good morning. A couple of questions from me. I guess, first on the Lee business in North America with the disruption that you're seeing, is that concentrated to one or two accounts? And then, when did you start to really see that unwind in the quarter and when should we start to kind of expect some stabilization in that business?","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Hey, Erinn. Where we've seen the concentration of issues for our Lee brand is in the mid-tier channel, and it is most recently more gender-specific. Our men's business is performing really well and we've put a lot of time and energy over the last 12 months looking at the quality of the product, the fit, the function, the innovative materials that we're using. And as we placed those at retail, we've seen really strong results.","Where we've really seen our issue and we're taking the same approach we have with our men's business for the last 12 months, is in our women's business. And we \u2013 a little bit \u2013 like I said in The North Face, need to look in the mirror and have we've done our very best to put the right product in the retail formats that we have available to us with our mid-tier partners to help them maximize their sell-through. So it's really localized to mid-tier and in the women's business.","And I think the good news, if you can find the good news in a business that's seen this kind of impact, is we know exactly what to do and have deployed some new resources to our team in Kansas City to help really elevate and accelerate that product creation.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.","So in terms of the turn, I mean, are you anticipating second half just based on how you shape the guidance for the year or do you think it's going to be more prolonged to get some of the product or company, or, I guess, execution issues improved?","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Yeah, no, I think that's a fair assumption, Erinn, is that we'll see sequential improvement as we go through the year, as we're able to quickly respond and then place this better product. Like I say, I would tell you, we've got a lot of great resources as we look across the globe. Our Lee business in Asia has been very, very successful the last three years. I think you've heard us say that we're the number one brand in China, and that's come from innovative materials and design, specifically in the female marketplace, and we're bringing a lot of those learnings to our teams here in the U.S. and applying that to the product creation cycle very quickly and partnering. Well, I think the key thing is partnering with our mid-tier retail partners specifically to get this product in place and on floor to begin to get that sell-through.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.","And then one follow-up on The North Face. Are you guys looking at any new accounts from a distribution perspective to help offset some of the bankruptcy disruption in North America? And then where are you guys at with, I think, Todd's replacement for that brand? Thanks.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Right. So I think, Erinn, for The North Face and if that's a U.S. specific question, it's probably less about new retail partners. I think we're well positioned today with where our brand is positioned, and yes, we've absorbed some pretty significant bankruptcies this last year. But every year our team is looking at their distribution strategy and really using that to inform the strategies that go back into these four new brand territories. And it's about really getting stronger presence of our Mountain Sports, our Mountain Athletics, more of our lifestyle collection, and then the Urban Exploration business that we have in Asia, bringing that across the globe. It's really looking at how to expand our footprint and use our distribution strategy more effectively to get these four consumer usage expressions into the marketplace, and at the same time looking to expand categories and maximize the penetration of each of those categories in these four-brand territories.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay. And then just last on gross margin. I know there's been a couple questions on this, but just \u2013 what I'm trying to understand on a 70 basis points organic gross margin gain, you talked about that benefit being almost entirely mix. I think in the recent past you've talked about mix being closer to a 50 basis point benefit. So is this just the dynamic of the accelerating mechanics of wholesale being down, DTC being up? And then I guess with all of the challenges in the space, why not put some type of assumption for markdown dollar support in the guidance on the gross margin side? Thank you.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Yeah, so \u2013 I mean, it's really \u2013 I mean, mix is mix, right? So it's the acceleration of our strongest businesses with our highest gross margin. I mean, we talked about our international business being up significantly. We're almost doubling our growth rate in Europe and Asia, for example, right? Our e-comm is growing at 25% and we're seeing step improvements in The North Face and Timberland growth rates as well. So those are really the factors that are driving our mix as well as the quality of the sales, right?","Our first quality sales continue to improve. We said it, but just to reiterate that, we walked some top and bottom line. We could've reported significantly higher sales and earnings in 2016, and even 2017, if we sell more in the off-price. We've made the strategic determination that's not good for our brand, that's not good for the channel. And that hurts us a little bit in the short term, those optics, but the quality of those sales, we believe, is sustainable and really the right place for us to be long-term.","Now as it relates \u2013 I think part of your question was, should we put markdown dollars? Well, of course, we always have markdown dollars, but when you look at year-on-year, it's not significant in the gross margin walk. We also have price, cost. I mean there's a lot of factors in there, so I'm simplifying the walk for you a little bit. But if you boil it all down, essentially it's mix that's driving the gross margin improvement year-on-year.","Yeah, can I build one more thing on that too? We also talked about the other side of that, which is the currency. I just want to reiterate how significant currency is in 2017. Just from a gross margin standpoint, it's 70 basis points. When we look overall from an earnings standpoint, there's almost $0.25 of EPS negative impact from currency in 2017. So the underlying currency-neutral growth rate is, obviously, accelerating significantly. But we have that significant headwind that we and every other global multinational has to deal with.","Operator","And we'll take our last question from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo.","Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I know this has been asked a few times. So the outlook seems prudent in the first half, and then there's an assumed ramp towards the back half, which makes sense. But I guess my question is, can you be a little bit more specific about where the biggest deltas are by brand in the outdoor and active coalition? And I guess meaning, is it broad-based inflection you're baking in across all the brands or is it more weighted to specific areas?","And then just the second question is, do you think you have more visibility this year versus 12 months ago, maybe due to DTC growth or international opportunities? And I only ask because it's almost exactly how you planned out 2016 to ramp as well, and clearly there were some issues that took place in 2016. So I'm just to trying to understand, has your visibility improved maybe relative to where we were a year ago? Thanks.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Well, I guess I'll start on that. So maybe starting at the end first, we \u2013 I would just reiterate the quality and the sound fundamental line of discussion that we've had. So we're exiting this year in a different place than we did a year ago, right? The marketplace is healthier; our business is healthier. And we're up against comps, frankly, that are kind of weak in the second half, right, as we saw some of the disruptions that we saw this year. So that's just a general comment.","As we think about our businesses, we've mentioned throughout what's stronger in the second half. The European business for Vans accelerates in the second half. Just I hope it wasn't lost. We returned to growth in the fourth quarter in Vans Europe after several quarters of working through an inventory imbalance, and that business is roaring back, right? As we look going into next year, inventories are in line and we're going to see sequential acceleration throughout the year, and particular strength in the second half. And that's just been a \u2013 that's a great global story.","The other probably notable one is The North Face will be relatively stronger in the second half, as again, we have a relatively better offer and we're also copying some of the actions that we took this year and you saw the decline. So I guess a little bit easier comp coupled with better execution and better product.","Finally, our work business, again, we highlighted that throughout the call. We're really at an inflection point. This business is poised for a return to growth. We've seen this cycle, those of us who've been around here for a while. Our work business tends to be a nice leading indicator and we're starting to see evidence that the work cycle is up trending. Just as a point of view, our bulwark, our oil and gas related business has been under pressure for \u2013 gosh, I don't know \u2013 a year at least. But oil rig counts are up significantly, Steve, I think...","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","60%.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","60% year-on-year, and that's great evidence of what will be coming in the future in the work business.","Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","That's great. That's really helpful. Can you just also comment on North Face specifically first half versus back half? What's embedded in your outlook based on the bookings that you're seeing?","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Yeah, we didn't give that level of detail. Just know that it's relatively stronger in the second half.","Ike Boruchow - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","All right. So in closing, before I close, I want to thank Eric for the leadership he's provided all of us at VF, for the focus and hard work that he's brought to the position of CEO and, for sure, the results in his wisdom and insights that have generated. Eric, I'm personally thankful for the time and energy that you've put into mentoring me over the years, and most specifically during this transition.","I guess I'd like to reinforce just a couple points. Our big three brands will collectively grow high single digits in 2017, and you heard us talk a lot about continuing to invest in our largest opportunities, opportunities like international, workwear, and our digital and brick-and-mortar platforms. We are sharpening our focus on innovation and elevating our design capabilities to drive even stronger product and brand experiences, and we think that will be a significant differentiator in the years to come. We will continue to be very disciplined about our distribution and being very thoughtful around product creation for each of our distribution partners. And as always, we will remain committed to delivering shareholder value.","So with that, I thank you all for joining us today and we look forward to seeing you or many of you at our Investor Day in Boston on March 30.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Joe Alkire. Please go ahead.","Joe Alkire","Good morning, and welcome to V.F. Corporation\u2019s third quarter fiscal 2020 conference call. Participants on today\u2019s call will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These uncertainties are detailed in documents filed regularly with the SEC.","Unless otherwise noted, amounts referred to on today\u2019s call will be on an adjusted constant dollar basis, which we defined in the press release that was issued this morning. We use adjusted constant dollar amounts as lead numbers in our discussion because we believe they more accurately represent the true operational performance and underlying results of our business.","You may also hear us refer to reported amounts, which are in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reconciliations of GAAP measures to adjusted amounts can be found in the supplemental financial tables included in the press release, which identify and quantify all excluded items and provide management\u2019s view of why this information is useful to investors.","During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the company completed the spin-off of its Jeans business, which included the Wrangler, Lee and Rock & Republic brands, as well as the V.F. outlet business into an independent publicly traded company under the name Kontoor Brands. Accordingly, the company has removed the assets and liabilities of the Jeans business as of the date noted above, and included the operating results of this business in discontinued operations for all periods presented. Unless otherwise noted, results presented on today\u2019s call are based on continuing operations.","Joining me on today\u2019s call will be V.F.\u2019s Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Rendle; and Chief Financial Officer, Scott Roe. Following our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open the call for questions. Steve?","Steve Rendle","Thank you, Joe and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter performance was strong, and our year-to-date results are at the high end of our long-term growth objectives, and we are on track to deliver solid performance this year, and we are well-positioned for continued growth and value creation in fiscal \u201821.","Before we review our third quarter results and adjusted outlook for the year, I would like to take a moment and comment on the news we disclosed Tuesday morning regarding our intent to explore strategic alternatives for the occupational work portion of our work segment, hereafter referred to as occupational work brands.","Scott will cover the specifics, but I would just like to highlight a few messages from the announcement materials. Driving and optimizing our portfolio continues to be a top strategic priority for V.F. and exploring strategic alternatives for our occupational work brand is the next natural step in that process. Our decision reflects management's continued focus on transforming V.F. into a more consumer minded retail center kind of enterprise with a portfolio of more growth oriented outdoor, active, and work brand. First, it is important to note that Dickies and Timberland Pro brands are part of our review. We remain fully committed to these brands as well as our worthy work purpose territory.","There are fundamental differences between the occupational work brands and the Dickies and Timberland Pro brands including the ability to connect directly with consumers, distribution footprint, supply-chain infrastructure, and financial profile.","The leadership teams within our occupational work brands have done an excellent job building these businesses over many years putting V.F. in an ideal position to find the best future owner for these brands to better enable their next phase of growth and success. In terms of timing, the review process is underway and we will keep you appraised as things evolve over the next few months.","Now, let's review our third quarter results and the current state of our business. As we head into the final quarter, we remain confident in our ability to deliver another strong year at the high end of our long-range plan. Year-to-date organic constant dollar revenue and EPS increased 8% and 16% respectively driven by our two largest brands and our International and D2C growth platforms.","Our strategic growth drivers performed well over the holiday season, and we are well positioned as we look toward fiscal 2021. For the quarter, revenue increased to 6% or 7% excluding the occupational work brands just discussed. While our revenue performance for the quarter was generally in line with our long-term algorithm, it was slightly below our expectations due primarily to the performance at Timberland, more challenging conditions in our occupational work brands as well as a mixed holiday season in the U.S.","Despite the revenue shortfall, the quality of our growth remains strong as evidenced by 100% [ph] basis points of gross margin expansion, 12% operating income growth, and 14% EPS growth. Our performance during the quarter highlights the diversity and resiliency of our operating model and the momentum we have across our strategic growth drivers.","Now, let me turn to performance of our largest brands. Vans continues to deliver strong balanced performance across all regions and above its stated long-term growth objectives. Revenue for Vans increased 13% in the quarter and importantly growth remains well diversified across product categories, channels, and geographies.","Heritage Footwear increased 8%, Progression increased more than 30%, and Apparel increased 14%. Following another quarter of broad-based momentum we are again raising our fiscal 2020 outlook for Vans. We now expect revenue for Vans to increase about 15% for the full year well ahead of its long-term target.","Moving on to the North Face. Revenue increased 8% in the quarter led by our international business. Growth was balanced across both our D2C and wholesale channels globally, and we saw a solid performance in our Urban Exploration and Mountain Lifestyle Product territories as the brand continues to attract new consumers and capitalize on growth opportunities beyond the core Mountain Sports.","Footwear also increased at a high-single-digit rate during the quarter. In Mountain Sports, strong performance internationally was somewhat offset by more mixed results in the U.S. market.","While limited in scope, the performance of FUTURELIGHT well exceeded our expectations during the key holiday season and continues to cast a strong halo for the brand.","The disruptive innovation has been available to consumers for about four months now and we're seeing four times the sales volume in our Pinnacle Summit, Steep and Flight series products, which feature the FUTURELIGHT technology.","Given our holiday performance and additional visibility through the end of the year, we now expect revenue for the North Face to increase about 9% at the high end of its long term growth objective. Despite early signs of success this year, our results in Timberland were disappointing this holiday season as revenue decreased 4% in the quarter. Solid momentum in apparel, outdoor footwear, and China was not enough to offset challenging conditions in men's footwear in the Americas and Europe, particularly in our classic business.","Men\u2019s, non-classics, and women's performed relatively better as our diversification strategy continues to evolve. As a result of the third quarter performance and improved visibility through the rest of the year, we are lowering our revenue outlook for the Timberland brand in fiscal 2020 and now expect full year revenue to decline between 1% and 2%.","And last but not least as expected, the Dickies brand had a great quarter as revenue increased 13%. Growth was strong across all key strategic growth drivers highlighted by 68% growth in China and 16% growth in digital with category momentum across icons and new seasonal product.","After a flat first half we had high expectations for the Dickies brand heading into the back half of this fiscal year and the global teams delivered. The brand launched its Yours to Make marketing campaign this quarter, the largest in brand history driving significant brand heat in consumer engagement.","We expect another quarter of double-digit growth providing us with strong momentum as we head into fiscal 2021. We continue to be bullish about the growth opportunities at Dickies in our even more confident in our fiscal 2020 revenue growth outlook of 5% to 6%.","Over the last few quarters, we have discussed the more uncertain geopolitical and macroeconomic environment and the impact it has had on our business results and forward outlook. As we exit the holiday season I'd like to briefly provide our perspective on business conditions across our largest markets. U.S. economic backdrop remains generally solid led by a healthy consumer and low unemployment. That said we believe performance across retail and our sector was mixed during the holiday season.","Our inventory levels at retail were in good shape heading into the fall winter period, sale through performance in certain categories was slower than expected which has led to elevated inventories in select areas and in more promotional environment.","In Europe international trade and the BREXIT uncertainty have impacted business confidence and investment. However, consumer confidence and spending remains relatively strong.","Our EMEA business accelerated in third quarter and our outlook is generally bullish across the region.","In Asia our brands continue to perform very well in China despite continued unrest in Hong Kong. The recent phase 1 trade deal between China and the U.S. should yield a more constructive consumer and retail environment.","As I talked about in Beavercreek our strategy is to become more consumer minded retail centric and hyper digital in all that we do. Transforming how we operate is essential to our ability to create value for shareholders and stakeholders. We are in the early stages of our journey and as our work progresses we increasingly gain clarity on what's required to achieve our vision.","As we exit fiscal 2020 and transition into fiscal 2021 we will focus our investments on four key programs. The first is to gain a deeper understanding of new and existing consumers. We will further focus our investments on driving proprietary real-time consumer and marketplace knowledge to establish emotional connections, guide personalization, inspire must-have products and create consumer centric experiences that enable lifelong loyal relationships.","The second is developing a more digitally enabled responsive go-to market approach. We will increasingly leverage more end-to-end digital platforms, go-to market processes and best practices and manufacturing innovations that help our brands create and deliver high-value product high-value products and experiences to consumers whenever and wherever they want.","The third is a more seamless integration across physical and digital touch points. We will work to provide a seamless and consistent brand experience across and between all consumer touch points be it digital, physical, owned and partnered and strategic wholesale accounts. The fourth is the construction of more robust engagement models that help build and create enduring relationships.","We will invest in leverage best of breed marketing and technology platforms and enable our brands to drive new consumer acquisitions and build stronger loyalty through personalized engagement.","A transformation journey is a multi-year endeavor. Investments over the past two and a half years have laid the foundation that will now begin to build on. We have an aggressive agenda and look forward to providing more details and updating you on our progress against these programs as the years unfold.","Before turning the call over to Scott I'd like to highlight that on December 5, we\u2019ve launched our latest sustainability and responsibility report made for change. This report outlines our aspirations for advancing environmental and social improvements across our enterprise and communities worldwide. Included in the report we publicly announced new ambitious science-based target and commitments around our use of sustainable materials and reducing green health gas initiatives.","Details behind these commitments highlights in the last reporting year and the value this work as to our business since stakeholders can be found in the reports. Insisting without commitment to be a purpose lead enterprise V.F. has establishes a clear position as a leader in the work to come back global climate change.","Looking ahead in with our made for change strategy providing the roadmap we will strengthen our role of a company that is leading meaningful initiatives that not only lessen our impact on the planet but also drive purposely profitable growth for our business and brands.","And with that I will turn it over to Scott.","Scott Roe","Thanks Steve and good morning everyone. We were pleased with our strong third quarter performance and we remain on track to deliver revenue and earnings growth above our long term commitments.","Before we review our third quarter results and adjusted outlook in more detail I would like to make a few comments related to the announcement made Tuesday morning of our intent to explore strategic alternatives for the occupational work brands.","In summary, we intend to sell the brands comprising our work segment excluding the Dickies and Timberland programs. The occupational work brands include V.F.\u2019s legacy Imagewear business as well as several brands acquired with William-Dickie transaction.","As a reminder this is primarily a B2B wholesale business and represents the majority of V.F.\u2019s existing own manufacturing footprint. These brands tend to be more cyclical in nature and have minimal exposure to V.F.'s international and D2C growth platforms. From a financial standpoint the occupational work brands contributed about $865 million of revenue and $130 million of adjusted operating income in fiscal 2019. As Steve mentioned the review process is underway, and we will provide further details as the process unfolds over the next few months.","Now let's review our third quarter results. Overall, our performance was strong. The brands and platforms that are core drivers of our long-term growth objectives performed well during the holiday season and the fundamentals of our business remain intact. While parts of the portfolio did not fully meet our expectations in aggregate we were pleased with our results despite of mixed holiday season in the U.S.","Our performance in the third quarter highlights the diversity and resiliency of both our portfolio and operating model, two things we spoke about in detail during our investor day at Beaver Creek.","For the third quarter total V.F. revenue increased 6% organically and if you exclude the occupation of work brands the growth rate becomes 7% a four point higher driven by our largest brands. Growth was relatively balanced by channel in the third quarter as D2C increased 7% including 17% growth in digital and a 6% total comp and wholesale increased 4%.","Moving on to our performance by geographic region. Revenue increased 9% internationally and 3% in the U.S. including the occupational work brands. Strength internationally was driven by 15% growth in Asia, including more than 30% growth in China which benefited by about 5 points from the timing of shipments ahead of the Chinese New Year holiday.","Our EMEA business also delivered another solid quarter with 7% organic growth led by 13% D2C growth including an 11% comp and 30% growth in digital.","Our fundamentals remain strong as gross margin expanded 100 basis points organically driven by continued favorable mix shift towards higher margin businesses and the timing of foreign currency transaction gains.","Operating margin also expanded a 100 basis points representing 12% growth in operating profits despite a 9% increase in strategic investment spending and excluding the occupational work brands operating profits increased by 15%.","And to round out the P&L EPS increased 14% to $1.23 which includes the occupational portion of our work segment.","Moving to the balance sheet inventory excluding the occupational work brands increased 8% or 12% for total V.F. Our inventory is a little elevated. However, we're comfortable with the quality and expect inventory growth to be in line with top-line growth by the end of the year.","Leverage at the end of the quarter remains below our long-term target of 2 times as we balance cash returns with capacity to pursue our M&A agenda. We\u2019ve returned approximately $700 million to shareholders this quarter through dividends and a $500 million share repurchase. While M&A is our top capital allocation priority cash returns to shareholders remain a key component of our TSR algorithm.","Now turning to our updated fiscal 2020 outlook. As you saw in the release this morning we are adjusting our fiscal 2020 outlook following our performance this holiday season and increased visibility for the full year. We now expect revenues to be about $11.75 billion representing 7% growth on an organic constant dollar basis. Excluding occupational work brands our updated outlook represents growth of over 8%.","By brand we\u2019re raising our outlook for Vans to about 15% which compares to our prior expectation of 13% to 14% growth. We're tightening the outlook for the North Face to about 9% growth. We now expect Timberland to decline between 1% and 2% which compares to our prior expectation of 1% to 2% growth.","And lastly we're holding our outlook for Dickies at 5% to 6% growth as the business continues to gain momentum. We expect our strategic growth platforms D2C and international to continue to perform well through the remainder of fiscal 2020. We now expect growth in D2C to be between 10% and 11% versus our prior expectation of 12% to 13% growth and from a geographic perspective we now expect our international business to increase about 9% which compares to our prior outlook of 8% to 9% growth.","We continue to see gross margin expanding 80 basis points to 54.1% and operating margin expanding 90 basis points to 13.8%. We now expect EPS to approximate $3.30 representing about 18% growth. This compares to our prior outlook of 332 to 337 which represented 19% to 21% growth. Relative to our prior outlook the reduction in EPS was driven by the performance of Timberland brand and the occupational work brands partially offset by strength in the Vans brands.","As we head into the last quarter of the fiscal year we are on track to deliver revenue and earnings growth at or above the long-term commitments we laid out in Beaver Creek in late September. Three of our four largest brands are performing at or above their long-term growth objectives and as a reminder our top two brands the Vans and the North Face account for over 80% of our growth in the long range plan.","Our strategic growth platforms International and D2C are strong and well-positioned to sustain their growth momentum heading into fiscal 2021 and given our intended actions with our work segment we're taking another step to optimize our portfolio, simplify our business and elevate our focus on our largest properties and growth opportunities. The fundamentals of our business are strong. We are executing well and we remain confident in our long range organic plan and our ability to deliver on our mid teen TSR commitment. And our balance sheet is primed and positioned to capitalize on M&A opportunities that have the potential to drive incremental growth and value creation to our organic plan.","So with that we will now turn the call back to the operator and take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Bob Drbul from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now live.","Bob Drbul","Hey guys. Good morning. Just two questions for me. I guess the first one is on the Timberland performance, can you just talk to sort of the turn in Timberland or sort of what needs to happen within that business and sort of the timeline on it and then the second question I have is just can you expand a little bit more on your inventory levels and sort of maybe inventories in the channel in terms of what you see heading into calendar 2020? Thanks.","Steve Rendle","Sure. Good morning Bob. This is Steve. So, Timberland just to be really frank with everybody here, we are not pleased with our performance. We're disappointed and our assumption is you are disappointed as well. Where we find ourselves is this is an iconic brand with deep, rich heritage, and we remain very committed to the strategy that we laid out to you all in Beaver Creek. A lot of foundational work has been done around the brand to really understand the consumer and put together the brand architecture that helps drive the most important aspects of our strategy, which is elevating our product. We've talked to you a lot about diversity. Diversifying our product offer, we absolutely need to do that to move beyond classics in our men's business to the non-classics, but we have to continue to see good growth in our women's apparel and pro businesses.","And concurrent with that is we have to find a way to more intimately connect and engage with consumers as we drive the new brand foundation forward. We are not where we'd like to be, but I think we are very, very convicted that this brand is one that our skills can absolutely unlock and the diversification strategy that we have in place absolutely gives us confidence that it can be done, and I think it's interesting if you look at the results this quarter, our apparel business was strong. Our Pro business was strong. Our women's business contributed, and in aggregate those businesses are about half of the total Timberland revenue.","What we need to continue to grow is in the men's classic and non-classics. Then we laid out that vision in Beaver Creek of the work that needs to be done with the new design teams, the new merchandising skills to drive that turnaround, and we remain very convicted but don't let me leave you thinking that we're at all pleased. We're disappointed and continue to work very hard with the leadership team there at Timberland and we have to put this business in the right place.","Scott Roe","Yes Bob, as it relates to the inventory levels, I think you're talking about retail inventories, and Steve's comments and mine as well talked about a mixed holiday performance, a little softer than our expectation in a few areas, and the knock-on effect of that is inventory levels are a little elevated. We also know that the promotional environment started a little earlier and went deeper than we were in some cases, and so what we've laid out is a plan for the balance of the year to address that. We think that's baked into our guidance, and as I said in the prepared remarks, our expectation is both from our inventory and from a retail inventory they will exit this year in good shape. So back in three months, and we'll give you an update on how that progressed.","Bob Drbul","Great. Thanks very much guys.","Steve Rendle","Thanks Bob.","Operator","Thank you. And our question today is coming from Dana Telsey from Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is now live.","Dana Telsey","Hi, good morning everyone. As you think about the performance by region, certainly it seems like EMEA and China did well. Any breakout by brand on what happened in the Americas by channel whether it\u2019s wholesale or direct in terms of what you're seeing. And then just on Vans, what we should be looking for there going forward? You took up the guidance to 15% for the full year. What should we look forward as we go to fiscal \u201821? Thank you.","Steve Rendle","Hey Dana, this is Steve. I think you obviously captured our international business was quite good. Europe continues to do well in an environment that isn't necessarily that strong. Our Asia business led by China continues to perform very well. Here in the U.S. to our prepared remarks, we saw an uptick in the promotional activity starting pretty early and specifically with our cold weather brands. And the results there really hit the North Face and Timberland, and we saw a drop in traffic in our retail, in the notes that you can see it in our slides, we did see a reduction in growth within our brick and mortar.","In the case of Vans, we had good e-commerce pickup, but we saw weakness in the North Face and Timberland on that e-commerce side and we do really relate that to the early promotional activity. We did not respond, I think if you remember back three or four years, we did quite a bit of work around rightsizing the channel for distribution, shoring up the promotional activity that we participated in, and we really took the long view and wanted to preserve the integrity and quality of our brand position, and within our own environments we did not chase that that promotional environment. Yes, some might argue that we should have but we really do believe that from a long view shoring up that that quality integrity of the brand position is very, very important.","Also, we\u2019d tell you in the case of our North Face business, we are rebuilding a team, they just went through a very significant relocation, and in that our D2C digital teams are new. We believe we\u2019ve got a very strong if not stronger team and our ability to now really engage and drive that particular platform will be back in our control as this team settles into their new position and understands the total brand strategy that they're driving. ","Scott Roe","And then, relative to your question on Vans, I guess the big picture answer is we really don\u2019t see anything fundamentally different. Right, we just did a 15% which we know is ahead of our long-range plan but we also talked about the soft landing or control descent, whatever you want to call it.","But we planned on and we really don\u2019t see anything fundamentally different on a forward basis.","Dana Telsey","Thank you.","Steve Rendle","Thank you, Dana.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Binetti from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live.","Michael Binetti","Hey guys, thanks for taking our questions here. I wanted to ask about Vans and actives, the active segment margins for a second. You're down a little bit in the quarter. But you guys went through a huge period of growth with Vans, and the margins been down in this quarter after been up a lot in the first half of the year.","As we look ahead to next year in your fiscal '21, how should we think about the margin compressionally sounds third quarter. I know you have some tough comparisons lapping the first half of this year and then I know the longer terms structural drivers like D2C and the international drive this high over the long term.","So, if you could see that being the case that you get into second half of your fiscal year next year but I'm thinking more in the near term, does the margin need to normalize a little bit in the first half of next year while you lapped those big comp growth rates and margin expansion from the first half of fiscal '20.","Steve Rendle","Yes Mike, well great question. So, the third quarter you really have to like broaden out and look at the full-year picture because there is some timing quarter-to-quarter. What you should expect for the full-year is that the margin growth rate will more or less approximate the topline growth rate. And that was the way we planned this business because we're investing back into the growth of Vans and that was something I think we've been talking about for a while here.","And looking at the great news that this business is given its growth margin profile, that is really the fuel that allows us to continue and invest back into the business. So, as we look forward, we don\u2019t see anything structurally different and I'm not going to give guidance for next year at this point.","Michael Binetti","Right.","Steve Rendle","But those gross margins and that growth rate will continue to fuel the investment capacity to allow us to invest back into the brand.","Michael Binetti","Okay. Let me back up and ask about some of the Beaver Creek stuff for a second. I'm trying to roll forward the algorithm you laid out just a few months ago at the Analyst Day. Given what we know about the occupational group at this point, so if our starting point was a seven to eight year, sorry a 7% to 8% revenue CAGR for five years.","Does that, does the sale of occupation move us up to the eight to nine range for the next five years and I know the occupational business had higher margins about 15% in the overall company. But I guess we don\u2019t know what the gross margin or SG&A improvement was baked into the plan relative to the corporate algorithm.","So, could you just help us think about how the sale influences the plans for about 40 basis points at EBIT margin expansion for year and EPS of 12% to 14% per year?","Scott Roe","Yes so again, we're not going to revise the long-term algorithm. I'd say Michael, well it's not materially different. And if you think about the go-forward, we are you know we know today that certain things are developing somewhat differently. Timberland is a little slower in its acceleration currently that's move into the right.","On the other hand, you're right the sale of occupational will have a tailwind from a growth standpoint but I guess at this point we're not changing our full view and we don\u2019t really see a material difference.","Michael Binetti","Okay, thanks a lot for your help.","Steve Rendle","Yes.","Operator","Thanks. Your next question is coming from Erinn Murphy from Piper Sandler's. Your line is now live.","Erinn Murphy","Great, thanks. Good morning. A couple of questions from me. I guess, first just on the North Face. I think you guys indicated that the men's business performed much better than the women's. Can you just kind of expand on what drove that with the competition and the women's side that maybe it was a little bit softer.","And relatedly with the FutureLight, excuse me, you've had it for four months in your direct channel. Can you just talk about the role out strategies over the next 12 months? Our wholesale account starting to book for spring where should we see it kind of show up?","Steve Rendle","Oh great. I'll take your question. So, good callout. Our Men's business in the North Face is good. We saw a solid growth across really all three of the brand territories, not sports, not like an urban ex but really I think that it was not like in urban ex where we saw strong growth.","Our women's business in the Americas underperformed. And to my earlier comments around the early move to promotional environment, we believe it's had an impact on our business. Potentially, there was some increased competition and that may have taken some of that but I think it really comes down to our market segmentation strategy and how we set our businesses up to succeed.","And going forward, the North Face really take learning that at this quarter and apply it to next fall is I think about the wholesale and retail mix of those core women style. Women, continues to be one of the primary growth drivers that Arne laid out in the Beaver Creek conversation and it's a very important aspect of the long-term growth.","We really see this is a point-in-time not, not a long-term trend and one that we feel confident we'll not be one that we see.","On the FutureLight question. We're really happy with how where we are we're seeing that in the prepared remarks. Four times the sales of the Summit, Steep, and Flight Series, where FutureLight products were represented. We really have and able to really reposition the brand with these collections with that core consumer.","What we found is that the educational element of FutureLight is a significant task. In the future we've invested heavily around driving the brand and driving the education but this is such a disruptive innovation and how the garment feels, how the garment performs is markedly different than anything that we've seen and been able to use over the last 30 years and the work to drive that education that understanding will continue into fiscal '21, fiscal '22 as the product line continues to expand.","You will see an expanded offer in spring '20 going on market in rainwear and moving in this more approachable price points. The Dryzzle rain jacket at 229 will be the opening price point with FutureLight that is a very strong historical seller and we think this will be yet another moment to raise the awareness, inform the consumer. And as we do that, continue to set ourselves up for future expansions in the coming fall and years after.","Erinn Murphy","Thank you, I appreciate that. And then just one quick follow-up for Scott. Scott, just on the digital growth, I think you guys referenced why it was weaker in at 17% with Timberland and North Face. But how do you see digital growing in the fourth quarter and as we get into 2021 should it return back to the longer term CAGR of 24% to 25%? Thank you.","Scott Roe","Yes, I think Steve unpacked what we understand at this point are the drivers or why we saw the moderated performance. We are obviously taking some actions. I mentioned some of those in terms of promotion also just in the way that we're communicating and the feedback loop.","One of the things that we have is good insight and to consumer feedback and we're making adoptions where we can. So, we'll see some improvement but not all the way back to the long-term algorithm. Going forward we see where we see no reason why we can't achieve that again the reasons for the underperformance I think Steve unpacked earlier.","Erinn Murphy","Yes, okay. Thank you, all.","Scott Roe","Okay.","Steve Rendle","Thanks, Erinn.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Sam Poser from Susquehanna. Your line is now live.","Sam Poser","Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I just want to follow-up, I've two questions. One to follow-up on Timberland and what's really what's being done there to sort of invigorate the I would call it the core heritage business of that away from what other classic yellow boot type businesses. And when will we potentially begin to see that in earnest given the current deceleration and miss of plan?","Steve Rendle","Yes, and good morning Sam. So, fair question and one that I actually expected from you. So we, in my earlier comments around Timberland and the classic business, with as what Tina laid out in Beaver Creek, you know we've done a lot of work over the last couple of years of really understanding the consumer and its really helping us reframe and rethink the brands, brand architecture and how that drives the creative aspect of the business.","We've -- as we laid out, we've added new design talent, Christopher Raeburn coming on. The team's, they surround him, they're merchandising organization. Some that we have to do is not only diversify the product but we have to elevate the products. We need to really think about the aesthetic, we need to think about the finish, we're opening up some new sourcing avenues accessing better manufacturing which will put an elevated offer from both materials in aesthetic into the consumer frame.","The samples that we're seeing right now give us confidence, that's why earlier on I said we remain very convicted that this is a brand that we can drive. And I think to your point on timing, it and you're not going to see it in the dramatic way in fiscal '21. To Scott's comment, we don\u2019t see fiscal '21 as a year where we're going to see breakup performance across the full assortment.","We do think our apparel business will continue to drive good double digit growth as we're seeing right now. Our Pro business will continue to be a good performer. Our Women's business here in the America's is good and we'll continue to drive that. But the energy around the men's classic in the non-classic diversification will be a major focus.","And it will really be that following year where we think you will start to see the evidence and the proof points of that work. And yes, really driving off that rich heritage tapping into that outdoor heritage and new styles is that you know so well you know will be really top-of-mind for us.","Scott Roe","Yes Sam, I just like to add on to it. As we think about where we're at in this brand and what the near-to-mid-term looks like. Just to build on Steve's comment, remember part of our strategy is to build the diversified offer, the more lifestyle offer that we have some evidence of that as Steve mentioned about the apparel.","But that really enables our D2C growth. But the reality is this brand today has about 25% of the overall distribution setting in D2C. So, that large wholesale footprint particularly in the U.S. coupled with the performance we just had at the holiday.","And the attendant inventory overhang that comes with that means we're going to struggle to grow next year as many of the wholesalers base their next year buys and the order books are set based on the performance they just saw. So, I think we have to have a sober assessment of where we're at.","And next year, we're not giving guidance per se but we will struggle to grow as we look at next year in the Timberland brand.","Sam Poser","Thank you. And then secondly, can you give us some idea of the percent of sales within the occupational work business by quarter just to help us sort of forecast forward within without that business. And can you give us some idea of how you're foreseeing the occupational business to be on a year-over-year basis in full-year '20 now that we're almost through at a vis-\u00e0-vis the release from last year's revenue.","Steve Rendle","Yes. So, on the first part, there is some seasonality but it's fairly balanced on a full-year basis, Sam. And I'm sorry, could you repeat the second part of your question?","Sam Poser","Can you give us some idea, it was 835 million or 65 million last year. Can you give us some idea where you're thinking that's going to end up this year or where is your standing?","Steve Rendle","Yes, flat to slightly down is where we see it for the balance of the year.","Sam Poser","And what would be the peak quarter of sales for that business?","Steve Rendle","Yes, and I'm not going to get into that level of detail I just refer you back to my earlier comments Sam on the paper with this.","Sam Poser","All right. Thanks so much. Good luck.","Steve Rendle","Thanks Sam.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Omar Saad from Evercore ISI. Your line is now live.","Omar Saad","Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. I wanted to ask about the spin-off. Actually the spin-offs at this point now with Kontoor in the rear-view mirror and the announcement around the work where decision to sell that business obviously you are reshaping the portfolio to align with kind of the core competency of the company and the long-term goals but it also seems like you may be clearing the decks a little bit here. Does it make it easier to do a larger acquisition in the future once this look at our last piece is done in terms of the portfolio reshaping? Is that an appropriate way to think about it? Maybe you could frame it for us. And then I had a second question on Urban Exploration. It was in the North Face what you learned in the quarter. How we should think about that component within the North Face over the next, over the long term? What the opportunity is there? Thanks.","Scott Roe","Great. So Omar I'll start here. So I don't think we're in a position to talk to you about the size or magnitude of the acquisition that our last two dispositions maybe putting us in a position for but what I would tell you the M&A remains that number one priority for capital allocation. We think we have been very clear with our total addressable market where we see the opportunity and as we simplify and focus our portfolio around brands that really can connect more intimately with consumers and have a direct contact through owned distribution and key partners and it gives you a good sense of where we're looking and where we think we can add value to our portfolio but absolute size would be difficult to really call out for you right now.","Steve Rendle","Yes and I just build on the focus and simplification of the model really helped as you think about future activity. So one just data point X or at the end of this transaction our portfolio at 12 brands will be roughly half of what it was just a couple of years ago. But really aligned with that long-term growth algorithm that we laid out in Beaver Creek portfolio brands we can really drive that algorithm but also benefit and drive our focus around transformation.","So on your question on Urban X Omar I think the learning is there is that the brand you are continues to be able to appeal to and attract new consumers leveraging the rich heritage of some of those key icons like the new tee, you see extreme here being pulled out of the archive. So that what they're finding is this is a real rich area to leverage that historical set of brand icons done in a way that really promotes the rich heritage and authenticity and supports the more technical side of mountain sports. So we see good growth and not only here in the U.S. but from a global standpoint it's a real strong part of that go forward strategy.","Omar Saad","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Thanks. Our next question is coming from Alexandra Walvis from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.","Alexandra Walvis","Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. My first question is on the occupational work where to split Scott you shed some comments on this in the opening remarks but I wonder if you could help us out with where we should and shouldn't expect there to dissynergies from that split?","Scott Roe","Yes. So there will be some of it there's. I wouldn't characterize this business as moderately integrated. So we will have some dissynergies just to put a number on it and that we're in the neighborhood of $30 million is our expectation now. Against that likely there will be TSA and of course we'll get after those costs over time depends on the bio and the circumstances but just to give you some sense of the magnitude. The other thing I would clean out is with this action then it greatly simplifies or focuses our supply chain as well from a manufacturing standpoint. We talked about this gets us out of the apparel manufacturing. So as you can imagine that gives opportunities for simplification and cost reduction as well.","Alexandra Walvis","Great, that's helpful. And then if I may have a question on the North America backdrop. So you shared a lot of comments on the more promotional environment in the holiday period. So to the extent that is possible is there a way of passing through how much of the weakness in North America was a softening in underlying consumer confidence or spending versus the impact of warmer weather trends versus what would have been pretty good winter last year? Do you guys have any thoughts on on that split?","Scott Roe","Yes. Alex, I don't think it would be really difficult I think a really pinpoint what were those key drivers you called out some of them. I think the U.S. consumer you know remains strong. What we saw in our product category specifically cold-weather product was a slow start to the season. The quick move to promotional environment. Certainly did have an impact but I could also say that when brands are deeply focused in understanding the consumer needs and putting the right products in front of the consumers at the right time you can absolutely see the sales lift that we planned for.","So we're not going to focus on any one of those key drivers. If we remain very focused on our consumer understanding how that will help us drive a more retail centric approach to our go-to-market strategies and continue to elevate our digital skills we could be able to really engage and drive deeper connections with our consumers.","Alexandra Walvis","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thanks. Your next question is coming from Matthew Boss from JP Morgan. Your line is now live.","Matthew Boss","Great. Thanks. So on gross margin what was the benefit this quarter from the FX transaction gains and just the expectation for the fourth quarter? And how best to think about the impact on the fourth quarter gross margin as a whole from the more promotional backdrop and elevated inventory that you cited?","Steve Rendle","Yes Matt. We didn't break that out per se that but certainly FX did benefit the third quarter and it does turn negative really for the first time this year in the fourth quarter and of course that on an ongoing basis.","So what I will say is this if you look at our implied guidance the fourth quarter would say that are implied margin in the fourth quarter is down a bit. Underneath that the structural gross margin mix remains strong. It's there and that will continue on an ongoing basis.","The two factors one you mentioned is the FX and this we're talking about transactional FX which relates to had just been in place over the last 12 to 18 months or so and that's something we've been talking about for a long time. That now turns negative and a quarter. Also while tariffs not a big impact overall or even for the year. We do see for the first time the negative tariff impact in the fourth quarter.","Now interestingly on a go-forward basis based on where we're at right now tariff seem to be about a push year-on-year and again really relatively small in the overall scheme of things. So that's what's going on a gross margin. The change in the FX, cadence underneath it. You got it continued mix benefit which is structural and will continue and then a little bit of noise on the tariff. One final thing I alluded to this in my earlier comments as well relative to the inventory being a little elevated in certain pockets we've also factored in to be a little more market appropriate from a promotional cadence standpoint and that's also baked into our guidance as you look at the fourth quarter.","Matthew Boss","Great and then just to follow-up on the portfolio pruning. So I guess maybe larger picture how should we be thinking about the strategy moving from pruning to M&A and how would you prioritize maybe best particular categories of increased interest on the radar, I think within that core addressable market that you outlined at the analyst day?","Steve Rendle","Yes. So you went right where I was going to start which is that those TAMs the total addressable market is where we're focused and remember the three lenses that we look at both the portfolio that we have and the portfolio targets that we evaluate, it's really pretty consistent and straightforward. We're looking at is it strategically as it is it an attractive segment of the market financially does it meet the characteristics that we're looking for and from an ownership standpoint that we bring something to the party? Is it consistent with our purpose and does it meet the profile of the target investor that we're going after? So I think in that is a pretty good explanation of the actions that we've taken and also gives you a pretty good indication of the kind of areas that we're looking from an acquisition standpoint. ","Matthew Boss","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jim Duffy from the Stifel. Your line is now live.","Jim Duffy","Thanks. Good morning. Guys two lines of questioning for me. First we've heard a lot about the U.S. market dynamics in the quarter. Can you speak Asia, is there a way to size the impact of the Hong Kong disruption? And can you speak to what you're seeing relative to expectations in other countries?","Scott Roe","Maybe I'll put some numbers on it first. So our Hong Kong business is important. It's been a good business but it's not that large in the scheme of things. I think we said it in a 100 million range overall and that has been significantly impacted through the year and we really haven't seen much of a change in trend relative to Hong Kong.","Interestingly, we'll start to lap that. We're just having that conversation internally here. As we get into the New year, we'll start to lap when we started to see those issues. The good news for us, is that China in the region has really been strong and you saw 30%, that's somewhat artificial and we said there was about 5 points due to the timing of Chinese New Year. So, there's a lot of quarter-to-quarter noise in that. But still if you like, we've been in that 25% plus kind of growth range consistently in China and that's really driven the strength of Asia and really why we're at the top end of our long range estimates overall.","Jim Duffy","Great. I wanted to dig in some on the inventory. Can you guys speak in more detail on the geographic and brand level inventory picture? It seems inventories most out of balance for the vocational work business in Timberland. Can you talk about plans to get the inventories back in line and the financial impact? And then Scott is that cleaned up in the fiscal fourth quarter? Is there some lingering impact as we go into fiscal 21?","Scott Roe","Yes. So you're talking about our inventory obviously and so if you look at the ongoing core inventory we're up like 8% and as we think about going forward we said we'd be balanced between revenue and sales. So long way of saying we think we are okay from an inventory standpoint by the end of the year. Any actions that may be taken we believe are baked in the outlook and so we'd say pretty good. So obviously what that means if we're plus 12 for V.F. the occupational businesses is really elevated.","Now it's unique model because in that business you have specific customers. You have to, it's all about service. You maintain the inventory and most of these agreements actually have a clause it says should there be access at the end of the program that then they will buy that, they'll take that inventory.","So it's good inventory. We just have too much of it is the short answer and as you can imagine given the actions that we recently announced taking radical or very costly short-term actions to try to reduce the inventory wouldn't make a whole lot of sense because it's good quality inventory and eventually it's going to be used. So hopefully that gives the picture.","Jim Duffy","It does. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jonathan Komp from Baird. Your line is now live.","Jonathan Komp","Yes, hi. Thank you. Steve maybe just a follow-up more related to Timberland and portfolio management actions. I guess it's very clear your history when parts of the business aren't meeting your strategic and financial goals you've been very quick to take action but in the case of like Timberland where very clearly if it's strategically but it's not necessarily hitting your financial goals. Could you maybe just talk more philosophically about kind of your patience and willing to see things out and any thoughts there?","Steve Rendle","Sure. Well, I would start our willingness to look at the vestiges really has come online the last three years. So as we have made driving and shaping our portfolio our number one strategic choice and really focusing now on the parts of the market that we laid out with the total addressable market in Beaver Creek, how we characterize our brands as global activity-based lifestyle brands that connect can connect directly with consumers with their predominance through their own and digital channels. That frame has helped us really look at what brands we feel we're best at or said differently where are we the best owner and where are we not the best owner and what we've trimmed are really good brands but the brands that don't really align with that long term view.","To the point on Timberland it absolutely aligns with the consumer, the position the marketplace and ability to connect with consumers. My earlier points that we're disappointed in our ability to execute in our conviction around the strategy that we have been working on really over the last 18 to 24 months that Martino articulated in Beaver Creek, we don't have endless patience. We certainly have a very focused approach and clear sets of KPIs that we will look for our brand teams all brand teams to deliver on a year-over-year basis but I really want you all to leave this call knowing that we are still deeply committed the Timberland brand.","We understand where the issues are, my comments around the not only the diversification the products but the quality in the aesthetic of the product across all of the different growth drivers. We will keep you very close on how we're how we're doing there. We will give you the proof points as the strategy starts to take hold but we do not have endless patience and it is really around the proof points in the KPIs that we work with on a year-over-year basis with our brands. This will ultimately drive the decisions long term.","Jonathan Komp","Okay. That's a very helpful and then just separately as you look out to 2021 I think this time last year you gave some high-level thoughts on a few of the brands for the year ahead. You didn't give that this year so I'm just wondering maybe outside a Timberland just at a high level. Is there anything across the brands that you would think is kind of beyond or different than maybe closer to the long-term plan that you've laid out when you look across the brands?","Steve Rendle","You know Jonathan not really. I mean we fundamentally believe we're not in a different environment. We see the long-range plan that we just talked about in September as intact. Now obviously a few pieces are moving as I mentioned. I think on Binetti\u2019s question structurally you're going to see with the sale of occupational that's a tale end growth what we just talked about in Timberland is bit of a headwind but overall we don't see ourselves in a fundamentally different place.","I just like to remind you as you think about this year and the guidance change or the outlet change that we just talk through the uptick in Vans, the adjustment in Timberland essentially are a wash and what's left is the occupational reduction. So using different words if it weren't for occupational we'd still be in the range that we talked about three months ago and I would say that's really the big picture. So if you look at the ongoing algorithm for V.F. which will obviously exclude the occupational work group we say yes evolved a little differently but more we don't see anything fundamentally different on a go-forward basis. But three months will be back. We will give you guidance for next year and clean up the details.","Jonathan Komp","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Ike Boruchow from Wells Fargo. Your line is our live.","Ike Boruchow","Hey, thanks for taking the question. Scott two questions for you just to follow-up on one more time on the inventory; the slower than expected growth. In that category is that all cold weather? Is that outerwear? Is that outerwear and footwear? I'm just kind of curious if there's any more color you can kind of give there and then any more color on the types of channels where that inventory where the slow-moving inventory was. Was that broad-based? Was it your DTC. Was it your department stores? Just and any more color there would be really helpful.","Scott Roe","Yes. Really I'd say I give it mix, this is the answer. I mean certain categories we saw relatively better sell through and others we saw not quite as strong. Some of the more insulated colder weather jackets as Steve mentioned women versus men's and really again of course Timberland having such a large classic business some of that classic booth inventory. Those are the main areas that I would say, listen even retailer is a retailer. Some are in great shape. Some have relatively more and we look at it over. Overall we would say slightly elevated. Not a disaster, not a huge issue but a little more than we would like to see and that's why we're taking some of the actions that I mentioned earlier and again to the best of our knowledge we've got it built into our outlook and we have a good path to exit in good shape. Obviously, not all those leverages are within our control and in three months we'll give you an update on how that played out and give you an indication of where we stand going into next year.","Ike Boruchow","Got it. Thanks Scott. And just one quick follow-up just when we think about what you're trying to monetize the workwear asset for should we look at the Dickies transaction to give us some kind of guidance. I know you can't tell us what you're trying to sell it for but I just kind of curious the framework that maybe you're using when you think about that?","Scott Roe","Yes. Of course I'm not going to negotiate against myself here. But yes you can look at comparable transactions. I would say this interestingly the interest for this asset has been exceedingly high and frankly higher than we expected. So both on the sponsor side and the strategic side. So we're optimistic. Let's see what that plays out. We'll have visibility of that in the next couple of months.","Ike Boruchow","Thanks Scott.","Operator","Thank you. We have reached end of our question-and-answer session. I like to turn the floor back over to Steve for any further and closing comments.","Steve Rendle","Great. Thank you everybody for joining us this morning. This is going to reiterate our third quarter performance is strong and our year-to-date results are at the high end of our long term growth objectives and we're on track to deliver solid performance for this year.","As we look at the market signals that we continue to monitor, our focus on transforming to become more consumer minded, retail centric and more hyper digital in how we operate our business could not be more timely. The moves we are making with our portfolio will allow us to have greater focus not only by management but also how we invest against our brand properties but also our transformational agenda to put us in a much stronger position in the future as we drive against the LRP that we laid out for you all in Beaver Creek.","We look forward to catching up with you all in May and giving you insight into how we look at fiscal 2021 and our continued drive against that long-range plan. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.

Following our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open the call for questions. Steve?","Steven Rendle","Thanks Joe, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our third quarter 2017 conference call. Our third quarter results were a bit stronger than expected. With broad based strength across core growth engines. International, direct-to-consumer, our big three brands and Workwear. Our focus and investment in support of our 2021 strategies driving accelerated growth and value creation across key pillars of our portfolio. We are in the early phases of this strategic journey we began earlier this year and while the rapidly changing consumer landscape and dynamic retail environment around the world is sometimes difficult to predict, we are confident that the choices and capabilities embedded in our strategic growth plan will enable our strong portfolio of diverse global brands to connect more deeply with consumers and fuel accelerated growth. ","Third quarter revenue increased 4% as our momentum continued to accelerate. As a reminder, our growth rate during the quarter was reduced by about 3% due to the shift in timing of our fall order book, which we discussed during our last call. Our big three brands, Vans, The North Face and Timberland, grew at a combined rate of 6% in the quarter. Our international business grew 10%, including 14% growth in Europe and 9% growth in China. Direct-to-consumer increased 17% with more than 35% growth in digital. Our Workwear business grew 11% and our digital wholesale accounts a key growth driver for VF during the next five years increased more than 20%.","Gross margin improved 180 basis points in the quarter, excluding a negative 80 basis points impact from FX. The continued strength of our gross margin demonstrates the power of our diversified model and the discipline and focus we place on quality growth. Adjusted EPS increased 10% to $1.23 in the quarter. This is ahead of the outlook range we provided in July. ","Based in our strong third quarter performance and confidence in the balance of the year, we are once again increasing our full year outlook, raising our dividend for the 45th year in a row, while at the same time, committing an additional $25 million to fuel growth. Combined with the $40 million we announced in July, we have now committed $65 million of additional investment behind our strategy relative to our initial outlook in February.","We will continue to evolve VF and our brands to become more consumer and retail centric. You are beginning and I stress beginning to see that comes to life in our results. We will reshape our portfolio and align ourselves with our financial aspirations. We\u2019ve made progress thus far in 2017, but we are not finished. We see many unique catalysts to ignite accelerated growth and value creation during the next several years and we look forward to updating you on our progress. ","And finally, before getting into the specific brand results, as you know, we formally welcomed Williamson-Dickie to VF family on October 2nd. Our integration teams have worked in a collaborative matter since we announced the transaction. The teams and those that support them, I extend a sincere thank you. While, it\u2019s early, I couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the chemistry within the teams and even more confident about the value creation synergies, we see within our existing Workwear platform, it\u2019s great to have the Williamson-Dickie people part of VF. ","With that lets review our third quarter results and dive deeper into our top five brands, Workwear and Sportswear. Beginning with The North Face brand, as expected global revenue decreased 3% driven primarily by the order book timing shift that we discussed during our prior call. As expected on a more normalized basis global revenue increased 3%. ","D2C results were strong and increased at a low double-digit rate with mid-single digit comps and more than 20% growth from digital, wholesale was down 6% however excluding the order book shift, wholesale would have increased at a low single digit rate. By region, revenue in Americas as expected declined 10%, high single digit D2C growth including more than 12% growth in digital was more than offset by a mid-teen decrease in wholesale which was influenced by the order book shift. Without the shift, revenue in the Americas was down about 1%","Turning to product performance, lifestyle, accessories and fall transition products such as rainwear and lightweight piece generated solid growth in the quarter. In August The North Face brand launched its Walls Are Meant for Climbing campaign and partnered with climbing gyms around the world to inspire athletes to climb new heights and explore the outdoors. The campaign intended to unite our global communities to the sport of climbing, is the perfect embodiment of The North Face spirit of exploration ","In Europe the brand\u2019s momentum continued with revenue growth of 17% including mid teen growth in wholesale and high teen growth in D2C. Our digital business was particularly strong growing more than 50% in the quarter. ","Consumer demand for The North Face brand remains exceptionally strong across the region with double digit growth across all major product categories, and building on our success in Asia the urban exploration product territories now in select markets across Europe and initial sell through results have been exceptional. Given the broad-based momentum we have in the region we expect growth to accelerate further as we move into the fourth quarter and into 2018. ","As expected, Asia returned to growth and was up 4%. D2C increased at a mid-teen rate with almost 30% growth from digital and wholesale increased at a low single digit rate. Our fall season is off to a solid start with the strength from the GORE jacket and our urban exploration product territory. Now the outdoor market in China remains highly promotional our brand is strong and we expect accelerated growth as we move into the fourth quarter. There is no change to our full year outlook for The North Face brand as we continue to expect growth to be at the high end of the mid-single digit range. ","Now to our largest and fastest growing brand Vans, which achieved record setting growth in the quarter. Revenue increased 26% with strength across all regions, channels and product franchises. ","Revenue in the Americas grew 22%, Europe increased 39% and Asia Pacific grew 23%. D2C increased more than 30% including almost 30% comp growth and 60% growth in our digital business. Wholesale increased 19% with mid-single digit growth in the Americas and more than 35% growth internationally. We offer big congratulations to our Vans team around the world. The consistency and depth of the brand's performance is truly remarkable. ","The ongoing energy and behind the Vans brand continues to grow with strong momentum across nearly all product categories. Vans icons including the old school and black and white checkerboard designs more than doubled in the quarter. The new Ultra range franchise launch exceeded expectations in our Back to School period with 50% sell through in D2C and about 75% sell through at wholesale, even with the higher average selling price. ","We also launched our Customs 2.0 platform in Europe, helping to ignite accelerated growth on our digital platform in the region. During the quarter, Vans opened a new aspirational boutique store, The General in Brooklyn, which showcases its elevated product as well as the Vans Customs platform with fabric samples and everything else you need to build a custom pair of Vans. This space exemplifies what Vans is all about, inspiring, created self-expression with consumers in communities it serves.","Some of you may be wondering whether this level of growth for Vans is sustainable. Let me just say, the confidence we have in our largest brand is high. The brand is stronger than it has ever been with broad-based growth across all regions, channels and product categories. Retail inventory levels are in great shape and we remain disciplined with respect to inventory management, merchandising and assortment planning. ","While we see a strong growth trajectory for this brand as we move into 2018, the year-over-year comparisons is going to be difficult. Then again over the past six years, the Vans brand has grown at a mid-teen rate. So, the comparisons have always been somewhat difficult. Based on the strength of our third quarter performance, as well as increased growth expectations for the fourth quarter, we now expect about 15% growth for the Vans brand in 2017, up from our prior outlook at the high end of the low double-digit range.","Switching to Timberland, global revenue declined 2% driven by the same shift in timing of the fall order book that impacted The North Face brand. As expected the timing shift reduced global revenue by approximately 5% in the quarter, high single digit growth in D2C, including more than 35% growth in digital was more than offset by a mid-single digit decline in wholesale.","Timberland brand revenue in the Americas declined 7%. However, on a normalized basis, revenue increased at a low single digit rate. High single digit growth in D2C was offset by a high single digit decline in wholesale due to the order book timing shift previously mentioned. From a product perspective, our non-classics business increased at a low double-digit rate as our diversification strategy begins to take hold. Our new platforms such as SensorFlex and AeroCore saw more than 75% growth and our women's product also continues to appeal to consumers with 20% growth in D2C. And our Timberland PRO business remained very strong with more than 30% growth. ","In Europe, Timberland brand revenue increased 3% which was also influenced by a shift in timing of the fall order book. Results were driven by mid-teen growth in D2C and low single digit growth in wholesale. Our digital business was very strong increasing more than 50% with strong results from our new locally designed women's platform. Our momentum across the region is strong and our growth broad-based with high single to low double-digit growth across both footwear and apparel.","Timberland Asia business declined 5% driven by the timing of shipments. Mid-single digit growth in D2C was offset by a low teen decline in wholesale. Our outerwear was particularly strong supported by the M65 Jacket campaign. There is no change to our low single digit growth outlook for the Timberland brand in 2017, which includes high single digit growth in the fourth quarter.","Moving to the Wrangler brand, revenue increased 4% during the quarter with high-teen growth in D2C and mid-single digit growth in wholesale. Revenue in the Americas increased 6% while revenue in Europe declined 2% and Asia declined 10% because of the ongoing weakness in India. Our third quarter results for the Wrangler brand were in line with our expectations, however, our visibility in the U.S. Jeanswear business remains low and we continue to expect quarter-to-quarter variability in the near term. That said sell-through at retail improved late in the third quarter giving us the confidence that the initiatives put in place by a key customer are showing early signs of success. ","From a digital perspective, we\u2019re seen strength across our digital wholesale partners, as well as our own wrangler.com business, which increased more than 20%. Our ongoing efforts to elevate the brand may extend more deeply into new channels, such as department stores and specialty retail, also continue to gain traction. ","Turning to product, our limited release capsules and collaborations have done exceptionally well from our born ready collection, which features unique pieces, it\u2019s celebrated Wrangler's rich heritage to our collaboration with designer Peter Max. And hopefully some of these [indiscernible] Wrangler brand are prominently featured in a store front in Herald Square. There is no change to our 2017 outlook for the Wrangler brand, which includes low-single digit growth in the fourth quarter.","Now to the Lee brand. Revenue declined 8% as 15% growth in D2C was more than offset by a low-double-digit decline in wholesale. The Lee Americas business was down 14%, as the brand continues to grapple with ongoing wholesale channel pressures and consolidation. While, our women\u2019s business remains challenged, our men\u2019s denim business is performing well and was up at a high-single-digit rate including strong performance from our Xtreme Comfort khakis and Extreme Motion Denim products. ","Lee Europe was up 7% with more than 20% growth in D2C, including 40% growth in digital. Wholesale increased at a mid-single-digit rate. ","In Asia, revenue declined 4% driven by continuing weakness in India. ","Our women\u2019s business in China increased at a double-digit rate powered by our BODY OPTIX and Jade Fusion innovation platforms. Based on Lee\u2019s third quarter performance as well as slightly weaker than expected growth outlook for the fourth quarter, we are revising our 2017 revenue outlook for Jeanswear. We now expect full year revenue to decline modestly versus our previous expectations without flat revenue. ","Turning now to Imagewear. Revenue was up 8% in the quarter; the core image business was up 4% excluding the impact of jersey revenue connected to the sale of LSG. Bulwark had another strong quarter and importantly red cap returned to growth as the recovery in the industrial sector continues. ","Looking at our Workwear platform, which includes our image business, as well as Timberland Pro and Wrangler RIGGS footwear revenue growth accelerated 11% with double-digit growth from our three largest brands. Timberland Pro increased more than 30%, Bulwark was up 12% and Wrangler RIGGS Workwear generated 17% growth. We continue to expect our Imagewear and Workwear businesses to increase at a mid and high-single-digit rate respectively in 2017. ","Looking at Sportswear. The business continues to stabilize with improvements across the wholesale and D2C. Revenue for Nautica was about flat, while the Kipling Americas business achieved low-single-digit growth. The new management team we put in place earlier this year has worked hard at restoring profitability and their efforts are clearly showing results. ","Thank you to everybody on the Nautica team. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Scott. ","Scott Roe","Thanks, Steve. Before I get started, let\u2019s review a few housekeeping items that influenced our reported third quarter results. First, we took $105 million pre-tax non-cash goodwill impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the intangible assets related to the Nautica brand. Despite recent improvements and financial performance, our strategic assessment of the brand determined the assets to be impaired which resulted in the related charge. ","Second, we incurred about $5 million of pre-tax acquisition-related expenses associated with the Williamson-Dickie transaction. On a combine basis, the two items just mentioned negatively impacted our reported earnings by $0.26. ","Now, let\u2019s review our third quarter results, my comments will focus on our adjusted results excluding the impairment and acquisition related expenses just mentioned. Our third quarter results were strong with broad based strength across international and direct-to-consumer platforms, outdoor and action sports and Workwear. Revenue increased 4% to $3.5 billion and excluding the order book timing shift for The North Face in Timberland brands, our underlying growth rate was approximately 7%. ","Revenue for our big three brands was up 6% on a combined basis led by very strong results from Vans which was up 26%. The underlying passion for Vans across the globe is truly unique. What gets us most excited is how this deep emotional connection coupled with the tribal nature of the Vans family will continue to drive exceptional performance. While we don\u2019t expect to maintain these stellar growth rates indefinitely, these results give us confidence in the vision we have for this brand and the growth targets we laid out in Boston. ","As expected, The North Face and Timberland brands declined 3% and 2% respectively. However, both brands grew at a low single-digit rate normalizing for the order book timing shift. Our Workwear business increased 11% and importantly our Jeanswear collation continued to sequentially improve driven by Wrangler which returned to growth in the quarter and was up 4%. ","International increased 10% as our growth continues to accelerate. Our Europe business was particularly strong, up 14%, and just to put some context around the strength we are seeing in Europe, our big three brands grew 17%, wholesale was up at a low teen rate including almost 30% growth from our digital partners. Direct-to-consumer increased at a high teen rate including more than 40% growth in digital and we achieve double-digit growth across almost every mark, every major market. ","Our European business is clearly firing on all cylinders and as one of our most profitable platforms, when combined with an efficient tax structure enables us to drive significant value creation. The broad base strength we see across the region will carry into 2018, so a big thank you to the European team. ","China remain strong and was up 9% with particular strength in Vans, D2C and digital. Our direct-to-consumer business was up 17% led by more than 30% growth in digital. Our Outdoor Action Sports, Jeanswear and international businesses all achieved at least high teen growth with double-digit comps in our global brick and motor business. Our efforts to the [steward] investment towards store experience and digital while focusing on the productivity of our fleet are showing results. ","Wholesale revenue was in line with last year, however excluding the order book shift, wholesale was up at a low single-digit rate. International delivered high single-digit wholesale growth and our digital wholesale accounts grew more than 20%. ","Gross margin remains strong at 50.1% up a 100 basis points which includes an 80 basis point negative impact from changes in FX, that is 180 basis point increase currency neutral which is pretty much in line with our first half results. ","Our stronger than expected gross margin was a result of more favorable mix and better full priced sell-through. Our gross margin is the by-product of our disciplined and focused approach on quality growth. Gross margin expansion is a core element of our diversified value creation model and provides us flexibility and fuel to accelerate investments and drive growth behind our largest opportunities.","SG&A as a percentage of revenue was up 240 basis points to 33.2% in the quarter. Our ratio was distorted a little bit by the order book timing shift, which resulted in about 40 basis points of deleverage. ","Let me take a few minutes now and walk you through the remainder of our SG&A increase. More than half of that increase was driven by investments in D2C, demand and product creation, innovation and technology. In fact, most of the increase was in D2C and particularly in digital, which is where we have momentum and stronger profitability, and when coupled with our higher incentive compensation compared to a weaker performance a year ago, we've accounted for more than 90% of the change. ","Based on our increased confidence, we've committed an additional $25 million of investments in demand creation and strategic priorities this year. That is in addition to the $40 million we announced last quarter. So relative to the initial outlook we provided in February we\u2019ve committed $65 million dollars to transform VF into an agile, digitally enabled consumer centric organization.","Now to answer a question likely on your mind, excluding the impact of Williamson-Dickie, we do expect a more moderate pace of SG&A growth in Q4 and as we head into 2018. There is no change in our long-term SG&A, or operating margin targets we communicated in Boston and if anything, we're even more confident in our ability to achieve these targets as we sit here today.","Third quarter adjusted operating margin declined 140 basis points to 16.9% including an 80 basis point negative impact from changes in FX. So, on an adjusted basis, EPS increased 10% to $1.23. Relative to the range we provided in July, our third quarter earnings benefited by about $0.07 from FX and a lower tax rate.","Turning to our balance sheet, our inventory increased 1%. Our inventory are in good shape and from the days outstanding perspective, it\u2019s starting to come back in line. Given our strong third quarter results and increased growth trajectory we see for the balance of 2017, we are once again raising our full year outlook. Our updated outlook now includes the following.","Reported revenue is expected to be up 6%, about 5.5% on a currency neutral basis to approximately $12.1 billion. That compares to our previous expectation of $11.85 billion. Our increased revenue outlook is driven by our core growth engines, Outdoor & Action Sports, most notably Vans, D2C, particularly digital and broad-based strength across our international business. Our revenue outlook continues to contemplate about $200 million contribution from Williamson-Dickie.","Gross margin is expected to approximate 50% which includes 50 basis point headwind from FX. This represents 50 basis point improvement relative to our previous outlook of 49.5%. Adjusted operating margin is now expected to be about 13.4% versus the previous estimate of 13.7%. This includes a 50 basis point negative impact from changes in FX as well as the impact of an additional $25 million investment. Excluding the impact of Williamson-Dickie, we expect our adjusted operating margin to be about 13.6%. Adjusted EPS is now expected to be $3.01, up 1% on a reported basis or up 6% on a currency neutral basis, relative to the 2016 adjusted EPS of $2.98. Our outlook includes the $0.05 of additional investment, as well as a $0.02 contribution from Williamson-Dickie. As a reminder, our prior outlook was $2.96. ","Finally, we now expect our cash flow from operations to reach about $1.5 billion. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders and our dividend and share repurchase program are key components of our diversified value creation model. Based on our performance and the confidence we have in our strategic growth plan, our Board of Directors approved a 10% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.46 per share. This marks the 45th consecutive year, we\u2019ve increased our annual dividend. With this increase our calendar 2017 dividend, we\u2019ll reach $1.72, a 12% increase compared with the prior year. When combined with our share repurchase, our cash returns to shareholders in 2017 will approach $1.9 billion, that\u2019s an 8% yield based on our current market cap. ","So, with three quarters behind us, we are confident in our increased growth outlook and have strong momentum as we move into the fourth quarter. Our core growth engines are delivering double-digit growth, our gross margin is strong, our fundamentals are intact and we are investing in our future and given our momentum and the confidence we have in our growth plan, we\u2019re putting money to work behind our largest brands in growth platforms, while returning additional cash to shareholders. ","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to the operator and we\u2019ll open the call for your questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we\u2019ll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie Group. Please state your question. ","Laurent Vasilescu","I want to follow-up on the wholesale business for the fourth quarter. Besides the $100 million shift from 3Q into 4Q, are there any additional shift between the fourth quarter and next year\u2019s sub quarter? ","And then secondly for the fourth quarter stripping out Williamson-Dickie\u2019s revenues, should we assume wholesale revenues on an organic basis will be up mid-single digits year-over-year?","Scott Roe","That\u2019s about right. On the second part of your question Laurent, it should be up about that rate. And no, there is no other big shifts other than order book timing between Q3 and Q4. ","Laurent Vasilescu","And then I wanted to follow-up on the Williamson-Dickie acquisition. Since the acquisition was announced in August, curious to know if you gained any additional learnings you might want to share on the call. ","And then finally since Williamson-Dickie was an all-cash transaction, can you remind us, how much leverage you want to take on, if you choose to pursue an additional acquisition?","Scott Roe","So, I\u2019ll take the second part of that first and before Steve comments on what we\u2019ve learned. We said that we\u2019re guarding our rating, which is generally two times EBITDA, debt-to-EBITDA, two times. However, for the right acquisition we\u2019re willing to stretch that even to the point of one step down rate, if we had the right opportunity. So, if you do the math, that ought to imply, a lot of capacity. ","The other thing is with our strong cash flow, our metrics snap back into line pretty quick here. So, we\u2019re really -- we have dry powder even today and as we look at the contribution from Williamson-Dickie and the rest of our portfolio, we\u2019re backing in kind of historical levels in a very rapid manner. ","Steven Rendle","And then Laurent, on what we\u2019ve learned with Williamson-Dickie so far, I mean we\u2019re really still early but we couldn\u2019t be at here. We have down there a passionate committed team that looks and acts a lot like VF and are really integrating well with our Imagewear team and the broader Workwear team. Brands are great, we\u2019re very excited about what we\u2019re learning about Dickie\u2019s and the [indiscernible] fitted as globally, and what we think we can do with it here in the United States and the synergies that we\u2019ve called out from the beginning absolutely are there and committed teams working across 12 major work streams getting after just that exactly.","Operator","Next question is from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Please state your question. ","Dana Telsey","Good morning and congratulations. As you can think about the strength of the gross margin, how do you think about the puts and takes? Is there anything to note by brand or collation that could be lasting going forward that we should watch for? ","And just lastly for the incremental investments any color on where that\u2019s going, how are they seasoned and your outlook on it. Thank you.","Scott Roe","Yeah, good morning Dana. So, a couple of things on that related to gross margin. The story on gross margin really hasn\u2019t change its mix and the mix is our fast-growing businesses are highest gross margin and you saw in this quarter results particular strength in D2C and digital which that coupled with international and particularly Europe really have popped the gross margin in the quarter. But as we look forward, we expect those same drivers to continue, right. So, it was a little exaggerated in the third quarter also because our wholesale business for all the reasons we\u2019ve talked at for the long time was a little bit down from the timing standpoint, but overall, we see that mix driving forward in the next year and beyond.","Steven Rendle","And then Dana on the demand -- on how we\u2019re looking at the investments, about half of the investments that you\u2019ve seen is deployed this year are around demand creation and that\u2019s very much focused on Q3 and Q4 specifically towards D2C, our digital platform, but also driving broader brand awareness that benefits not only our broader brand but our wholesale partners. ","We\u2019re also investing on many of our strategic priorities, in the roadmaps that we\u2019ve put in place specifically around data analytics, what we\u2019re doing with our digital platform, there are investments around advanced manufacturing and some of the innovation work we have going on there and clearly pushing dollars towards our design capability within our big brands. ","Scott Roe","Dana, also asked about what we\u2019re seeing in the holiday, what\u2019s our outlook from a holiday standpoint.","Steven Rendle","Fair enough. Okay. So, I\u2019d say Dana, we saw October start a little bit slow but as we see the weather turn in our favor, we\u2019ve seen really acceleration and that\u2019s very much a North America comment. We\u2019re bullish, our order book really reflects how our wholesale partners are thinking about setting up their floors more in line with consumer demand, that\u2019s here in the United States, but it\u2019s also true that how we\u2019re working in Europe and Asia and you really think we\u2019ve got good assortment sitting on the floors at the right time, inventories that are good check, and really now it's about driving sell through and that\u2019s where that demand creation investment has been put forward to help to drive that.","Operator","Our next question is from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI. Please take your question.","Omar Saad","Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. So, if you could talk a little bit more detail about Vans, I mean, the performance there really stands out as you know. Maybe you can go a little bit deeper in some of the strategies that are working, how you\u2019re executing to generate such consistent strong performance globally in a broad-based way? And then maybe tie in digital and social media, if that an important element to what\u2019s going on with that brand and if there are learnings that you\u2019re developing around Vans that you can apply to some of the other assets in your portfolio? Thanks.","Scott Roe","Great, Omar. Vans' performance is fantastic and the congratulations you put out to our team. So, I think know what the primary -- one of the primary reasons this brand is doing so well, it is the team that works on this brand across the globe and their intense focus and deeper understanding of who their consumer is. And we talk a lot about our expressive creator and who they are, what's important to them and how to reach them with our demand creation, and that really is about the social media in the digital platform. ","I think key things that are driving these results, Omar, it starts with product, the way our business team there, it really manages franchises and really things through the integrated marketplace, lands, placing the appropriate products in the right locations. And then the appropriate amount of newness, be it, new [color ways], the collabs that we do season to season, or the Ultra range that we launched this fall that are completely new product, higher price point, is continuing to move the brand further down its path. ","I would tell you, I think probably our single strength natural product, it\u2019s our D2C and how our brands stories are told within our own environments. You can see that here in the U.S. and across the globe and as we start to really mature and improving that area, we are starting to see us bring a segmented approach to boutiques that come and meet around The New General in Brooklyn to how that complements our street front and mall-based stores and how that all links together with our digital platform. It really is a well-oiled machine, very focused in deep understanding of the consumer and it really is about the digital connectivity and the storytelling that we tell to the digital platform that we think, is one of those key strategic advantages.","Steven Rendle","Yeah. I will just add-on Omar that -- when you think about our investments and where we're making our investments, a lot of the digital platform inspiration has come out of Vans team, not all, but a lot of it. And as we make our investments, we're investing in [via applied] platforms, so that that learning and that capability can be -- that we can take advantage of that across the entire enterprise. ","It would be hard for any one brand individually to fund this kind of investment and that's where we think the power of the portfolio when we have this is kind of how we approach these things. And this is one of our key strategic choices that we've made as we outlined in Boston. A close relation to that is also the customs platform, again piloted in Vans, but absolutely applicable for the wider enterprise and we see, this as continuing to grow throughout the organization. ","Operator","Our next question is from Camilo Lyon with Canaccord Genuity. Please state your question.","Camilo Lyon","I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the FX impact. Seems like there was a pretty large swing from last quarter to this quarter as it relates to the overall guide for the year since it gets about 150 basis points swing to positive. Could you help us frame how that benefit could continue into 2018 and how we should be thinking about that component as that\u2019s been a pretty big bag [indiscernible].","Scott Roe","Yes. So obviously, first of all, we don\u2019t try to get cues as it relates to currency. We got a basket of currency we\u2019re looking at and best of our knowledge, we call that, essentially where it is for the balance of the year and that\u2019s reflective and the outlook that we just talked about. As you look into \u201918, I guess couple of things. Number one remember that we had with a pretty long tail here, so we\u2019re going out 12 to 18 months. So, a lot of this has already been baked at slightly different rates as you look into next year, so you just got to remember that. Also from a translation standpoint, of course wherever the currencies are right now, that looks like, that\u2019s a tailwind, hopefully that will be the case. I would also just caution you to not focus too much on one factor, right. As we look into next year, cost is up a little bit in the fourth quarter, for example, we\u2019ll see that knock into next year. Yes, currency looks like, it\u2019s a tailwind, but you got to look at the balanced picture and we\u2019re not at the point of giving guidance for 2018 at this point. ","Camilo Lyon","And then just two other quick questions. Number one, just on the incremental investments that you\u2019re able to, book back into this business. Should we consider this a pull forward of planned investments or is this resetting a level -- higher level of expense that likely gets free after next year. ","And then even more broadly speaking about the advanced manufacturing capabilities, can you just remind us, where you\u2019re adding those initiatives and how we should start to see and when we should start to see some of the benefit that you\u2019d expect to deliver from faster, more speed like manufacturing initiatives?","Scott Roe","Yes. Camilo, I\u2019ll take the first part of that. Here is what I would say relative to the investments. And remember, we laid out a strategy and behind that strategy a roadmap of investments. And if you think about the shape that we talked about at the plan in Boston, in general, we\u2019re going to see investments a little more front loaded and you\u2019re going to see our top-line continue to accelerate. So, it\u2019s not so much. Yes, we are moving faster down a path. Our intent is to continue to invest, to invest around these priorities. So, while, it may not be the exact same thing, right, we\u2019re making innovations in our digital platform for example, you don\u2019t have to do that twice, that will be the next thing, when you think about customs, mobility, a lot of the innovation initiatives, we\u2019re going to continue to make those investments. ","Also, as it relates to demand creation, there is two sides to your question number one, if we should have a three-signal event and be in a very different place, could we stop these investments sure, we could. We think about demand creation we look at in [MROI] and we always are judging that the payback is there and whether we are willing to make that investment it is a discretionary investment that we can make a choice on, but our intent is to continue to invest in demand creation, in fact our plans said we intend to increase demand creation as a percentage of sales and grow it faster than sales. ","So, our intent will be to continue, obviously there is variability if we should have a fundamental change in the market, but we don\u2019t anticipate that nor is that our intention to modulate. ","Steven Rendle","And Camilo on the advance manufacturing portion of your question. I mean this is an exciting area and we\u2019ve talked a little bit, not to a great degree because of much what we\u2019re doing here we consider to be fairly proprietary. But I think it\u2019s fair to say, we have gone through and continue go through really in-depth end-to-end analysis of our total timeline around product creation and breaking down where those elements for us bring innovation and improve speed, efficiency and really affectedness. ","So, on the upstream side, that\u2019s really looking closely at our design and development capabilities and where can we bring technology to improve speed. But the advance manufacturing piece which is really little bit less than a half of the total time of our timeline is about looking at how do we breakdown material manufacturing and other things that we can do around improving speed at material finishing, adjacent to our production facilities and within the production facilities we\u2019re looking at a whole host of technologies to improve efficiency. ","I would tell you our supply chain is already very automated, if you were to go into our Jeanswear facilities here in the Americas you\u2019d see a highly automated and efficient model. We think there is improvements to be had there, especially as we can marry up material finishing closer to where we produced. But a lot of things going on inside the black box that we\u2019re standing up here in North Carolina to really test out our theories, prove it and then scale it as we can, not only in our own production, but with key partners. ","Scott Roe","One final thought too Camilo, as you think about all these investments whether be advance manufacturing or other priorities, our first commitment is to the shareholder, right. And we\u2019ve made commitments and we ensure that we\u2019re delivering against those and we\u2019re always trying to balance delivering our commitments to the shareholder with advancing and future stake growth. And that\u2019s a big part of our conversation on an ongoing basis. ","Camilo Lyon","Is there a brand that would get the frontend benefit of those initiatives on the manufacturing front that you\u2019re focusing on or is that a complete portfolio benefit as it starts to rollout?","Scott Roe","We\u2019re looking pretty broadly at this point, Camilo, across our portfolio of apparel, footwear and equipment. There are certain categories that probably lend themselves more than the other, but right now we\u2019re more focused on breaking down really the phases of how the product is produced and then we\u2019ll marry that back in to for sure our big three. We\u2019ll see the biggest focus, but there are some brands within our portfolio that are particularly well suited as incubators for us to test, learn before we look to scale to the big three.","Operator","Our next question is from Sam Poser with Susquehanna. Please say your question.","Samuel Poser","Good Morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple of things. When we look into next year, this is just more housekeeping, are you going to sort of restate everything to -- are you creating any Workware segment or how should we\u2019ll be thinking about that with the Dickies acquisition?","Scott Roe","Yeah, at this point, Sam, we haven't decided to change any of our reporting segments, obviously that's ongoing evaluations that we're looking at a line of portfolio changes. At this point we haven't made that decision.","Samuel Poser","Thank you. And then, secondly, one of the things I was seeing, just reported in news was that, you\u2019re getting some placement sort of a Paris Fashion Week with some of The North Face products and so on. Can you talk about that due direction and how you work to exploit that? Is that part of the whole city stuff you are doing out of China? Could you give us some color there?","Steven Rendle","Yes, Sam. What you have read there is exciting, that's part of our urban exploration territory, that's part of the really breaking down the consumer, use education into the four individual elements. But urban exploration really is coming from Asia in partnership with our Japanese partners, but also the team in China, and what you saw in Paris Fashion Week was a collaboration with a group called [indiscernible] and you are really innovative, it takes on some of our core heritage mountain jackets, long in lengths and all actually made through our technical standards. But what you see their Sam is, our ability to speak to a broad segment of consumers through that technical lens of The North Face, and making sure we stay true to the heritage and the performance, but also bringing the right product that allows that consumer to express themselves as they look at the brand individually.","Samuel Poser","Just the last -- and following up with that when do you see that expanding, when does that roll to the States and become sort of a broader, you talked about it -- sort of broader quote, you spoke about it at the Investor Day earlier in the year, in a general sense?","Scott Roe","Absolutely. So, we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we've got some stores that we're placing in Europe this year. We do have a test environment in San Francisco where our team there can really work with that store on a day-to-day basis. But I think we've really come to a point where we're comfortable with how the brand is expressed within a retail environment. We think that's something we can now pick up and move and you\u2019ll start to see that. We start our own D2C expression coming into all markets -- I mean a little bit bigger way in next fall. But there's an urban exploration component to each of our regions, the work that we do within our urban environments here in the U.S are in many ways coming out of that collection. But specifically, the Asian piece you'll see here more so next year.","Operator","Our next question is from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Please state your question.","Bob Drbul","Good morning. On the North Face, I guess the first question is, can you give us an update in terms of the trial that you're planning within a zone sort of where that stands today. ","And the second question on the North Face is. With the Americas performance where it is, what do you think the inventories are for the North Face brand at retail, in the retail levels right now throughout the channels?","Scott Roe","Great. Bob, so take your Amazon question first, it\u2019s early. And I would tell you, we\u2019re being very thoughtful. How does Amazon fit into that integrated market strategy, this brand has, what\u2019s the right segmented offer that can be used within that environment to speak to the consumer and sell-through at the rates that both of us would like to see. ","Early, it looks good. We\u2019re having significant progress in helping clean up the unauthorized dealers that are on that site and in many ways, have been some of the market pricing dynamics the brands dealt with. So, it\u2019s early, we\u2019re confident, they are a long-term partner, they\u2019re an important partner on a global basis for sure. ","To your inventory at retail, it\u2019s relatively clean. And the outdoor industry specifically for the North Face has been on this venture for a little over 12 months, we exited last year better than year before. Retailers have really focused, along with ourselves on really bringing product to floor based on where the consumer is shopping for those particular product categories and ways of product. ","So, we\u2019re very -- feel really good about, where the inventories are. We\u2019re feeling good about the flow of merchandise and it\u2019s really -- are looking at this year in a very positive manner versus last year. ","I think if you were to contrast North Face, which is very seasonal and we\u2019re paying a lot of attention about the flow, contrast out with Vans, which is really a year round business, there is a lot of earnings from them, as well as Jeanswear on how we should be flowing specific to consumer demand that our North Face team has been tapping into and really now designing through these four territories specific collections based on each of the season and the given need and environmental conditions where the brand can really succeed. ","Bob Drbul","Got it. And I guess just, on the flow, when you think about the acceleration of the Vans business from Q2 to Q3, have you been able to adjust the inventory, the manufacturing plans to meet that high demand going into the holiday season?","Scott Roe","Yes. The short answer is yes. We have a relatively shorter lead time as it relates to footwear. We have a really well developed and diversified supply chain around those categories. And so, the other thing remember, part of this acceleration was in Europe, we saw in the first half, we were still fighting through some of those inventory and balances that have gone on for a couple of years and we\u2019re seeing the acceleration in the second half. We saw that comment, right. It\u2019s a little bit stronger than what we\u2019ve even saw. But for the most past, we saw it coming. So, we had our supply chain teed up. I would just give a call out. They\u2019ve done a fantastic job at meeting demands given this is a high-class problem to have, but it\u2019s a real challenge for those guys to keep up with it and I am putting our people up against to anybody in our industry, because they are delivering, right. We\u2019re meeting demand and we see it in the results. ","Operator","Next question is from Jim Duffy with Stifel. Please state your question.","Jim Duffy","Couple of questions for me. First, great strength in the D2C business, e-commerce is accelerating and the numbers imply positive comp at retail with the 1,500 some outdoors across the globe. Can you guys comment on what you\u2019re seeing with respect to traffic and conversion and maybe highlight some of the differences between regions and the brands?","Steven Rendle","Yeah, Jim you captured it well. our D2C businesses is strong and that\u2019s a big part of our strategic focus, it\u2019s where we are absolutely driving investments not only in creating that traffic, but investing behind operational scale. So, specifically your question on traffic, we are seeing with some of our businesses traffic up year-over-year, certainly see good traffic gains in our European business. But I think we\u2019re really getting the performance is on conversion in lot of advances going on to in-store productivity from having a right product at the right time in each of the stores to the quality of the sales experience and our ability to really service consumers quickly and efficiently. ","So, it\u2019s really a combination of both, but I would tell you it\u2019s really that an operational piece, it\u2019s doing that in, we\u2019re also the investment that we\u2019re making in our one commerce platform that are allowing consumers to look at product online, purchase, pickup in store, return to store, we\u2019re just starting to really simplify and take the tension out of that that purchase decision across all of the formats and that\u2019s driving that traffic, that\u2019s driving that conversion in those results. ","Scott Roe","I\u2019d just add-on a little bit Jim to thinking about the numbers that you mentioned the 1,500 stores. We, a little more than a year ago came out with the slightly different take on our approach and we\u2019ve slowed the number of net openings, we\u2019re up -- we said about 50 that\u2019s more or less half of what we have been running over the previous years. But within that, we\u2019re still opening about hundred stores and we\u2019re aggressively editing our fleet based on performance. And part of what you\u2019re seeing also is the actions around just improving the quality of the fleet underneath the like-for-like initiatives that Steve just outlined. In fact, for the first time sequentially compared to the prior quarter our number of stores is actually down by two in the third quarter, up versus the year ago, but down by two compared to the prior quarter.","Steven Rendle","And then to build on that Jim. I mean the types of stores that our businesses are now looking to open, it\u2019s no longer sufficient to have a standard box that we move across the regions, it\u2019s being very thoughtful around what type of store based on the consumer and the market Vans opening a boutique in Brooklyn is a great example of tailoring a retail environment to build that connection, but also bring the right product to the consumer in the communities that they live. Each of our brands are looking at those smaller formats, the more street front locations, the mall locations and really modeling the appropriate type of store. And each of these stores really are starting to take on a smaller square footage increasing that productivity profitability.","Jim Duffy","Great. My next question is related with the strength that you\u2019re seeing in D2C and the challenges with some of the wholesale partner landscape. Is there any specific effort to deemphasize wholesale volumes or any categories or specific channels which you\u2019re deeming less strategic going forward? ","Scott Roe","Yeah. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m directly answering your question, but I\u2019ll just remind you as we laid out our view, we said, when you look at wholesale there\u2019s not a lot of wholesale growth on the net basis overall and really, we said, would be flat in North America with the wholesale growth coming outside of that, underneath that our digital wholesale growth is substantial. So, what that means is, we\u2019re expecting wholesale to be down low single digits in North America over the next five years. ","But within that, Jim, we\u2019re winning with the winning formats. We have great customers that are big partners with us and they're growing, we're growing. There's others that are in a little more difficult position. So, yeah, we\u2019re moving our exposure to the more troubled areas. We're minimizing that, some of that through portfolio and some of that through just where we're placing our emphasis. But, in general, remember that hourglass of the distribution channels were generally focused on the top and the bottom portions of that -- of that hourglass because that's where we see the relative higher growth as we look over the next five years.","Operator","Our next question is from Ike Boruchow with Wells Fargo. Please state your question.","Ike Boruchow","Hi, good morning, everyone. Let me add my, congrats. Scott, I think this is for you, so, it looks like you either hit or beat your plan within the Jeanswear closing for Q3. So, I'm just trying to understand what you see in Q4, maybe that causes you to be a little bit more conservative on that segment to that point. Can you help explain why Wrangler bounced back nicely in the U.S. while Lee worsened further from the run rate you saw last quarter?","Scott Roe","Yeah. So, first of all, as we said that is the best thing in this and in a couple of areas, it\u2019s tough for different reasons. But, yeah, Wrangler nice to see sequential improvement and we seem to be generally moving through the plan as expected, despite our [indiscernible] visibility. And I would say, no real change that situation. To be honest and in the Lee business we had a tougher than expected performance and particularly on the women's side. Our men's business is showing real strength, I think Steve mentioned that in the prepared remarks. We have a several styles and innovation that are really resonating but on the women's side, it's been a tougher picture for us. And based on what we see going forward, some of that is channel related, some of that is our own issues, frankly. But as we look forward, we took a more cautious view in the fourth quarter and partially reflecting in some of the results we saw in Q3 as well going forward.","Ike Boruchow","Got it. And there's a quick follow-up, Scott, I think you commented today, AUC was higher in the quarter, I think it's the first time you said that in a while, I think it was a tailwind to the first half. Can you just give a little bit more color about the dynamics on the costing side, where the inflation is coming, this maybe -- is that is ahead that we need to think about for next year?","Scott Roe","Yeah. So, if you remember, just zoom in back to the beginning of the year, we talked about -- we had some tailwinds from a cost standpoint through the first half, that turned to a headwind, starting in Q3 and going into Q4, we said Q4 would be the relative largest of the year. But, on balance, it was net zero and cost frankly isn\u2019t a real big factor for this year. So, also remember that we make commitments in arrears. So, when you're thinking about things like leather or cotton [loose], those commitments that we are seeing in the P&L today, commitments that were six months or so previously committed. ","So, based on where costs are today, hard to predict. I wouldn\u2019t expect cost to be a major issue from what I can see right now going forward. But again, I caution you not to hover too much on those factors. ","Just, it\u2019s a good reminder, as you think about currency and as you think about costs, we\u2019re looking at -- we\u2019re making longer term commitments, we\u2019re hedging, where it\u2019s appropriate and we\u2019re balancing all this into our merchandising and our pricing discussion. So, as we\u2019re balancing that mix, we don\u2019t see any fundamental change in the trajectory of our margins. And I would suggest that\u2019s the way you should look at it. ","Operator","Our next question is from Mitch Kummetz with Pivotal Research. Please state your question.","Mitch Kummetz","Two questions. First for Steve, just on the Vans business, the wholesale distribution. I think you guys mentioned that Americas was up mid-single-digit. Did like recently kind of from, what I would call more traditional athletic retailers, they\u2019ve called out Vans as a strong brand for them. I\u2019m kind of curious how you\u2019re managing any expansion with those types of retailers. Any concerns with overexposing the brand maybe or alienating any more traditional accounts. If you are growing with those types of retailers?","Steven Rendle","Our Vans business is better than most. The thoughtfulness that they put into their distribution strategy and how they segment product across the different choices that they have. This is something that they spend a tremendous amount of time thinking about. We are in all of those great retailers that sell footwear, athletic footwear to the athletic lifestyle footwear. And we\u2019re not looking to aggressively open up doors. But I think we are very broad based in thinking about the Vans consumer, from the boutique consumer to the broader application and being very thoughtful around who the partner is, what are the right doors, what\u2019s the right assortment? And then really managing with our partner sell-through. So, we can keep the right level of newness flowing into those doors to continue to drive that forward growth. ","Scott Roe","And just going to add on, too, Mitch. If we, when we look at the numbers behind this growth, it\u2019s really broad based as Steve mentioned. It\u2019s by geography, it\u2019s by channels and it\u2019s by multiple product categories including apparel. So, it\u2019s really broad based, you\u2019re not see in one particular style or group that\u2019s driving the entire broad, the entire brand it\u2019s really broad based. And that\u2019s gives us confidence as we look forward. ","Mitch Kummetz","And then Scott on the D2C, from a margin standpoint. I know, you talked about it being a benefit to the gross margin. I\u2019m hoping, you could maybe elaborate on the impact from an EBIT margin standpoint. I mean in the quarter, essentially D2C was all your growth and I want to say, if I do my math right, probably digital was third or more of that. Is there any way you can kind of speak to the margin profile of D2C and digital from an EBIT standpoint, that way we can have some sense as to how that kind of impacts your overall operating margin on a go forward basis as I assume that you would expect that to continue to be a big driver of the top-line?","Steven Rendle","Yes. Particularly on the digital side and so we haven\u2019t disclosed our relative profitability, I\u2019d say there is never a lot of our profit growth in 2017 has come from our D2C as you can imagine and I\u2019m talking about operating profit. With that gross margin expansion comes SG&A as obvious as it relates to brick-and-mortar but remember we moderated our brick-and-mortar a bit, we\u2019re focusing on more on conversion in comp and we will continue to open stores just not quite at the rate as we have in the past, and we\u2019ve got specific focus on digital which is our single most profitable format that we operate. ","So, as you think about it forward, it\u2019s a great question. I\u2019m probably not going to fully satisfy you with you my answer, just know that from a return standpoint it\u2019s accretive when we look at our return on capital and again our fastest growing component to that which will continue to mix up is digital versus our most profitable format. ","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back to Steve Rendle for closing remarks.","Steven Rendle","All right. Just really, quickly couple of things. As you all like to remember, Eric Wiseman will retire from our Board of Directors effective October 28. I would like to take a moment and again thank Eric to the leadership he\u2019s provided all of us here at VF.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Lance Allega, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Lance Allega","Thank you, operator, and good morning to everyone. Thanks for joining us today to discuss VF\u2019s second quarter 2015 results.","I\u2019d like to remind everyone that participants on this call will be making forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in documents filed regularly with the SEC. I would also like to remind everybody that unless otherwise noted, amounts that our participants refer to on today\u2019s call will be in currency neutral terms. By our definition which is detailed in our press release issued at 7 am Eastern Time this morning, currency neutral amounts exclude both the impact of translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars and the impact of currency rate changes on foreign currency denominated transactions. You may also hear us refer to reported amounts which are in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include translation and transactional impacts from foreign currency exchange rates. We\u2019ve chosen to use currency neutral amounts as a lead number in our discussions, because we feel it more accurately represents the true operational performance and underlying results of our businesses and brands.","Reconciliations of GAAP measures to currency neutral amounts can be found in the supplemental financial information included with the press release, which identify and quantify all excluded items.","Joining us on today\u2019s call will be Eric Wiseman, VF Chairman and CEO; Steve Rendle, President and COO; Scott Roe, our CFO; and VF executives, Karl Heinz Salzburger and Scott Baxter. Following our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open up the call for questions and ask that you please limit yourself to two questions per caller. Thanks.","And now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Eric.","Eric Wiseman","Thanks, Lance. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.","Our second quarter results add another proof point to VF\u2019s long and proven track record of delivering consistent profitable growth to our shareholders. Our ability to serve consumers and retail partners and to continuously expand on the momentum we created has never been greater.","In the second quarter, currency neutral revenue was up 10% an acceleration from our first quarter results, including growth in all channels and every region of the world. By coalition Outdoor & Action Sports accelerated beyond last quarter\u2019s results with 16% growth including double-digit increases in nearly all 10 of the brands in the portfolio.","Our Jeanswear coalition continued its momentum with a 4% revenue increase in the quarter, a result we\u2019re particularly proud of. In fact with the strengthening confidence in that business, we\u2019ve elected to take up our full year guidance -- our full year growth expectation to mid-single-digit currency neutral increase. There is definitely momentum happening at Jeanswear.","Eight of our 10 largest brands grew during the quarter including particularly strong results for Vans, Kipling, Napapijri and JanSport, 10% growth from The North Face and Timberland and their smallest quarter of the year and another solid result from Wrangler. Across our portfolio, the fastest growing brand of the quarter award goes to Eagle Creek with 28% growth, just named as Consumer Reports top luggage brand for 2015; a big congratulations goes out to the team in Carlsbad.","VF\u2019s direct-to-consumer business had a strong quarter as well with 13% revenue growth. Our international business which was also up 13% grew 11% Europe, 12% in the Americas region and 17% in the Asia Pacific region.","Reported gross margin was 48.3%, down slightly due to the negative impact of foreign currency. Earnings per share, was up 22%, which in fairness was helped by about $0.02 from the expected lower tax rate but even so, without the tax benefit on a currency neutral basis, our EPS was up 17%, a very strong result in our smallest earnings quarter of the year, so strong in fact that we took up our full year EPS to $3.22 which represents 15% currency neutral earnings growth, well ahead of our 2017 planned growth rate.","Taking a look at the first half of 2015 and there is a lot to like here. We had the strongest first half organic revenue growth since 2012; double-digit growth in Outdoor & Action Sports, direct-to-consumer and international; renewed momentum in our Jeanswear business, including strongest first half revenue performance since 2011; and double-digit increases in operating income and EPS. Needless to say, I\u2019m extremely proud of the progress we continue to make against our near and long-term objectives.","We\u2019re delivering meaningful innovation across our portfolio, connecting even more deeply with our consumers and are tirelessly working to serve them wherever and whenever they shop and engage our brands around the world. Operationally, strategically and financially, we are stronger than we\u2019ve ever been. Powerful brands, powerful platforms, one VF with the single minded focus on delivering consistent, sustainable and profitable growth to our shareholders.","And with that I\u2019m going to turn the call over to Steve, Karl Heinz and Scott Baxter to take us through our coalition and brand results and then on to Scott Roe to review our financial results. Steve, over to you.","Steve Rendle","Thanks, Eric.","Let\u2019s start with Outdoor & Action Sports. With revenue up 16% on top of the 10% growth we had in the first quarter, we\u2019re really pleased with the momentum that business continues to create and sustain. This quarter\u2019s growth was balanced with mid to high-teen increases in both our wholesale B2C business. And with double-digit growth in almost all 10 brands in this portfolio, we\u2019re firmly on track to achieve our 2015 currency neutral growth target.","So, let\u2019s run through the three largest brands, starting with The North Face. Second quarter revenue for The North Face was up 10%, with strength across all channels and regions. We continue to see excellent global growth in our DTC business with revenue up 20% for the quarter.","Turning to each region, in the Americas revenue was up at a low double-digit rate. The wholesale business grew at a high single-digit rate and B2C was up at a mid-teen rate including continued strength in our e-commerce business. With the successful of The North Face website to VF\u2019s new e-commerce platform, we\u2019re really pleased to see increased traffic and conversion particularly in mobile.","One of the highlights of the quarter was our Mountain Athletics collection which saw strong growth including great initial results from our newly launched women\u2019s product. To promote Mountain Athletics, we launched the \u201cI Train For\u201d campaign, which featured a 30 second TV spot as well as digital and display ads that encourage consumers to share their personal journey and goals. We\u2019ve also been holding twice a week, free outdoor workouts in five major cities across the nation, reaching consumers training for everything from bucket list ski adventures, cross-country treks or elusive summit to those training to perform better in everyday life. Athletes everywhere have responded well to these sessions led by expert trainers. Still in its early days, the Mountain Athletics business is picking up momentum and is clearly helping The North Face move to a year around brand.","During the quarter, we successfully re-launched our iconic Hedgehog hiking footwear collection, which was a very strong revenue driver. We also continue to see great response ThermoBall with incredibly strong comp and balanced men\u2019s and women\u2019s growth. The collection has quickly become a very meaningful four-season franchise.","Now, to Karl Heinz.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Thank you, Steve and good morning everyone.","There is a lot of positive momentum going on outside the Americas, starting with The North Face. Its international business was up high single-digit percentage, driven by almost 30% growth in D2C revenue. In Europe, revenue was up the mid single-digit percentage, driven by strength in our D2C business. We also saw strength in our Mountain Athletics, Hedgehog, and ThermoBall collections. It\u2019s a great global response from consumers.","During the quarter, we had the very unique event that further engaged consumers in the region. The North Face Lavaredo Ultra Trail race in June, so more than 1,000 participants running 75 mile, 19,000-foot elevation game course to the Italian Dolomites.","In Asia, revenue increased at the low teen percentage, a significant growth in the DTC business. Here we continued our TNF 100 Trail Run series which drew great interest with over 12,000 participants in for Vans across the Asia Pacific region. We also rolled out our TNF road show to four locations in mainland China during the quarter and connected with more than 15,000 consumers in the province. [Ph] We continue to have great momentum in The North Face business worldwide. And as we look ahead, we are right on track to deliver low double-digit global growth for the full year.","Now let\u2019s turn to Vans.","Steve Rendle","Vans posted its 23rd consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, which coincidentally was their growth rate for the quarter as well, 23 and 23. Now that I like a lot. There was strength across all products and channel including greater than 20% growth in both wholesale and retail which featured an impressive double-digit comp. In the Americas revenues was also up more than 20% with similar growth rates in the retail and wholesale channels. We often get asked how does Vans continued to do it? And the simple answer is the strength of our team and the strong connectivity the brand has with their consumers who are often more loyal fans than consumers. This authentic connection is earned with youth culture and then translated back through Vans with innovative trend setting products and demand creation that\u2019s both inspirational and experiential. This powerful loyalty focuses our execution and keeps us at the center of action sports, music, art and street culture.","There were two very exciting successful product collaborations this quarter. The first was with Disney, bringing iconic characters and Vans\u2019 off-the-wall culture together across all product categories. It started with the kickoff event at Disneyland and led to really strong sell-through at both D2C and wholesale. This launch now ranks as Vans\u2019 most successful collaboration in the brand\u2019s history. Second was Vans most influential high end vault product in recent memory. The collaboration with the Takashi Murakami, the Japanese pop art icon who is a long time Vans\u2019 buff himself. The launch kicked off in men\u2019s fashion week in Paris and was widely held as the must attend event of the week. Boutiques around the world saw long lines, even people sleeping in front of stores and limited edition products sold out in a matter of hours.","In addition to connecting with consumers through great new products, authentic and relevant consumer activations continue to be a signature of the Vans brand. The Vans Warped Tour kicked off in June bringing music, Vans culture and fans together in more than 40 stops across the U.S. and in the UK in October. And tomorrow, we\u2019ll kickoff our third year of headlining the Vans US Open of Surfing in Huntington Beach where the world\u2019s elite in surfing, skateboarding and BMX reach for the podium amid a festival wide celebration of creative expression, artist exhibits and installation.","Now, to international.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Vans international business was up at the high teen percentage, driven by more than 35% growth in DTC and a mid teens increase in wholesale. In Europe, revenue grew at a mid teen percentage driven by more than 20% growth in DTC and double-digit growth in our wholesale business.","We continue to be focused on elevating our story telling and energizing our product offering and we certainly achieved those goals during the quarter. The region also saw record response to the Disney and Murakami products collection.","In Asia, Vans continued to outperform with revenue growth of more than 30%, driven by a 60% increase in DTC and more than 20% in wholesale. Tier 2 [ph] saw strong gains across all product categories and great results from the collaborations launch in the quarter.","We also continue to bring unique cultural events to the region including the celebration of the global Go Skateboarding Day, which brought together more than 25,000 skateboarders in eight countries. We are thrilled with the continued momentum internationally for Vans. We remain on track to achieve our mid-teen growth target for the full year.","And now onto Timberland.","Steve Rendle","Timberland continues to build its relevance as the year round outdoor lifestyle brand with its adaptive style that\u2019s made for the modern trail. And with the revenue increase of 10% in the second quarter, driven by a high-teen increase in global wholesale sale, we continue to be really happy with the progress the brand is making against its long-term growth target.","In the Americas in a quarter that typically represents less than 15% of Timberland\u2019s annual revenue, the brand was up at a mid-single-digit rate with a low-teen increase in the wholesale. Boots and hikers in both men\u2019s and women\u2019s led the way. In men\u2019s it was exciting to see the success of the casual growth in collection. We\u2019re really starting to break through with true spring product.","In women\u2019s, casual and classic boots as well as new spring sandals helped that business more than double in the quarter. As you know, we are big proponents of engaging with our consumers and helping them connect with each other. In the quarter, we launched the new timberland.com web platform with an updated look and interface that marries content and commerce. There are also great new features like Shop the Look and Quick Shop to inform style choices, inspire expression and expedite the purchase experience.","To round this out, a hash tag in my element page has created a unique community by encouraging consumers to share photos showing how Timberland helps them live their lives to the fullest. It\u2019s a great element that was recently recognized by L2 Think Tank as one of the eight brands making the right moves with user generated content, alongside some great companies.","On the Timberland PRO side, we continued our When Your Feet Hurt Your Work Suffers media campaign and saw particular strength in our PRO Boondock and PRO Powertrain collections. It is clear that this consumer continues to turn to Timberland to provide great innovative products for their on the job need. So, double-digit growth in the first-half and now on to the fun part of the year, definitely a lot of great things ahead for Timberland in 2015.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Timberland\u2019s international revenue was up a mid-teen percentage. In Europe, revenue was up close to 20%, strong growth in wholesale. In the men\u2019s business, SensorFlex and Cupsole products continued a strong momentum for the footwear business and the pattern was driven by positive momentum in shorts, pants and denims. The women\u2019s business in Europe was also particularly strong.","Turning to Asia, revenue increased at the high single-digit percentage, led by strong wholesale growth. Growth in the footwear business was driven by men\u2019s casual styles and sandals and chukka styles continue to drive strong growth in women\u2019s. We also revamped our Design Your Own Footwear Customization web page which has seen positive early results. Consumers are loving the enhanced experience and features, which include extended style and color options.","We remain on track to grow global Timberland revenue at the low-teen percentage rate for the full year.","Now let\u2019s turn to Scott and Jeanswear.","Scott Baxter","Thanks K.H. and good morning everyone.","Our global Jeanswear revenue increased 4% on a currency neutral basis with positive results for both Wrangler and Lee. Overall, we have been very pleased with Jeanswear\u2019s performance. Our confidence in the business continues to grow. So much so that as Eric mentioned, we\u2019re increasing our full year outlook to a mid-single-digit increase based on our first-half performance in what we see in the second half.","In the Americas region, Jeanswear revenue was up at a mid-single-digit rate, reflecting healthier demand for jeans and strong results from our shirts, shorts and casual products.","Revenue for Wrangler in the Americas was up at a high single-digit rate. A few product highlights included our No Iron Ultimate Khaki which was launched with our first ever casual focused other Fathers Day campaign. Our western business saw continued success with our Cool Vantage jeans, an innovation that maximizes breathability in hot weather and on the workwear side Wrangler Riggs exceeded our expectations for the quarter and with plans to roll this product out to additional doors in the third quarter, we\u2019re excited to see this collection gain better visibility and traction.","Turning to Lee, similar to the first quarter, the Americas business was down at a low single-digit rate with the mid-single-digit increase in the U.S. market offset by weakness in South America. In the States, we continue to see momentum in our modern series product for men and in women\u2019s the introduction of shorts, capris and jackets made with performance fabrics has been well received. We also recently signed ESPN\u2019s Mike & Mike as spokesman for the Lee brand and are excited for that campaign to launch next month. So there is a lot of great tractions in the Jeanswear Americas business and we\u2019re excited to get into the second half of the year.","K.H.?","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Our international Jeanswear business was up a mid-single-digit percentage driven by a low double-digit increase in Asia and flat results in Europe. In Europe, revenues for Wrangler were down at the mid-single-digit percentage due to ongoing weakness in Eastern Europe. In the quarter, Wrangler had a very successful collaboration with Leatherman which drove great brand awareness and consumer engagement. Lee posted its ninth consecutive quarter of revenue growth in Europe with a mid-single-digit increase, driven by new women\u2019s product and continued response to our Contemporary offering. So, good momentum there.","In Asia, our Wrangler business was up more than 20%. We continue to focus on the denim performance range and we launched Sun Shield product in key market as well. We also launched our Proud to Be Blue Line, which celebrates the Wrangler heritage. At Lee, we saw a low double-digit growth including great response to our innovative Jade Fusion denim, which manages hit and moisture much better than regular denim. Taken together we have great momentum with our Jeanswear business globally, expected to continue throughout the year.","Now, back to Scott on Imagewear.","Scott Baxter","Thank you, K.H. Imagewear revenue was flat for the quarter with a mid single-digit increase in our Licensed Sports Group business being offset by a low single-digit decline in our workwear business. In our LSG business, we launched our new Cool Base jersey for all 30 MLB clubs to a great response, with a strong activation campaign, featuring celebrities from the worlds of sports and music. And on the workwear side, Red Kap showed good growth driven by shop pants and shorts. However, Bulwark had a meaningful slowdown due to reduced oil and gas exploration. For the full year, we continue to expect mid single-digit growth for this coalition.","And now, back to Steve.","Steve Rendle","Our Sportswear business was up 1%, reflecting a low single-digit decrease for Nautica\u2019s business and a 20% growth from Kipling but apart from Kipling, which clearly had another great quarter, the numbers behind Nautica don\u2019t paint the full picture. Along with the strategy in brand positioning reset that\u2019s well underway including a deep consumer insight study, the work we began a few quarters ago to increase AURs and pursue more full price revenue in lieu of promotion driven sales, is working. It\u2019s also clearly showing up in our profitability. And with that said, we are maintaining this coalition\u2019s revenue outlook of mid single-digit growth for the full year.","And to wrap up our coalition comments, revenue in our Contemporary brand business declined 5% as the overall Contemporary category especially here in the U.S. remains that. Globally a low double-digit increase in international revenue was more than offset by a low double-digit decline in the Americas region. In U.S. despite the top line performance, we did see sequential improvement in our jeans business with sales stabilizing in the quarter. That said however, given the year-to-date results, we are now expecting revenue for this coalition to be down at a mid single-digit currency neutral rate for the year.","And now on to Scott with a deeper dive into our results.","Scott Roe","Thanks, Steve. I echo Eric\u2019s comments by saying that our second quarter and first half year results speak to the continued strength of our diverse portfolio of brands and our business model. We remain focused on a executing our strategic plan, which includes delivering innovative products, maintaining a strong connection with our consumers, and strategically investing in our brands. And as a result, we have delivered yet another solid quarter that supports our long-term growth commitments.","In the second quarter, on a currency neutral basis, our revenue rose 10% which is an acceleration of the 8% increase we saw in the first quarter and at 9% year-to-date that\u2019s solid growth for the first half of the year.","By channel, our direct-to-consumer business grew 13% in the second quarter, reflecting strong results across all regions including a high teen increase in Europe and more than 20% growth in Asia. This performance was laid by our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition with The North Face, Vans, Kipling, and Lucy leading the way.","In our wholesale business we also saw strong results, with revenue up at high single-digit rate with Vans, Timberland, Wrangler, JanSport, Reef and Lucy among the highest growth rates in the quarter.","Gross margin for the second quarter was right in line with our expectations at 48.3%, down just 10 basis points the last year\u2019s result. This decrease included 50 basis points of mix benefit, which was offset by 60 basis points of foreign currency and rate. And to unpack that a bit, our mix benefit just like in the first quarter was somewhat tempered due to the higher Jeanswear revenue. Now, keep in mind, even though Jeanswear carries lower gross margins, it is still VF\u2019s most profitable coalition. So, we\u2019re okay with that flow through.","Foreign currency changes on a year-over-year basis, including an average euro rate of 1.11 in this year\u2019s second quarter versus 1.37 rates last year, accounted for the majority of the headwinds. And finally, recall that the majority of our product costs with ties to commodities like leather, cotton and oil-based derivatives will only begin to see benefits flowing through the P&L in the second half of the year, more specifically in the fourth quarter.","Now turning to SG&A, our SG&A ratio to revenue was up just 10 basis points due to continued investments in D2C almost entirely offset by leverage. In fact, we\u2019re operating a 139 more stores now than we did at the same time last year and that\u2019s our model: Make investments to drive top line growth, find leverage elsewhere in our expense structure and improve profitability.","Our operating income grew 1% and operating margin in the second quarter was 8.9%, down 30 basis points due to the impact from foreign currency headwinds. Excluding currency, operating income was up 10%, resulting in an operating margin of 9.2%.","Looking down into that profitability by coalition, reported Outdoor & Action Sports operating income rose 3% and operating margin was 9.7%, 50 basis points below last year. This decline was entirely due to the impact of changes in foreign currency rates as about 40% of the coalition\u2019s revenue came from regions outside of the U.S. On a currency neutral basis, operating income was up 17%, slightly ahead of revenue growth.","Operating income from Jeanswear was up 4% in the second quarter and operating margin increased 70 basis points to 17.2%. Excluding the impact of currency, operating income was up 5% also ahead of revenue growth. We are really pleased with the global strength we\u2019re seeing return to this business.","Imagewear operating income was flat with a 10 basis point increase in operating margin to 14.2%, held back a bit because of the unfavorable changes in foreign currency. Without the impact of currency, operating income was up 2%.","Sportswear operating income was up 41% while operating margin improved 290 basis points to 10.2% as the move towards higher quality sales began to gain traction. And Contemporary brand\u2019s operating income was down significantly as this category remains challenged.","And now on to the bottom line. Our EPS grew 22% on a currency neutral basis. And as Eric mentioned, the result was helped by about $0.02 due to a lower tax rate which included settlements of prior year\u2019s tax audits. While we expected this tax settlement as part of our annual outlook, the fact that it came in our smallest EPS quarter, certainly shows up nicely. And even if you take it out, we were still up 17% on a currency neutral basis. On a reported basis, EPS was up 11%.","Turning now to some balance sheet highlights. Our inventories were up 8%, which is in line with our expectations ahead of the second half of the year when we were realized about 60% of our revenue. And finally, our Board of Directors declared a $0.32 quarterly dividend, payable in the third quarter.","Now let\u2019s turn to our full year outlook beginning with the top line. We continue to expect currency neutral revenue to be up 8% in 2015, consistent with our 2017 commitment. On a reported basis, we expect revenue for the full year to be about $12.7 billion. Based on first half performance, we did make a couple of changes to our full year currency neutral revenue expectations for two of our coalition. As previous mentioned, we\u2019re taking Jeanswear up to mid single digit increase from our previous expectation of low single digit growth and we\u2019re taking Contemporary brands down to a mid single digit decline from the previous nearly flat outlook.","Our gross margin expectation for 2015 remains about 49.5% on a currency neutral basis, reflecting the 70 basis-point increase over 2014. The primary driver of our gross margin expansion remains the favorable mix shift to our higher margin businesses which we\u2019ve seen for so many years. This is a trend we expect will continue.","Taking a look at currency assumptions, we\u2019ve elected to keep our euro to U.S. dollar assumption at 1.10 [ph] for the balance of the year. At this rate, a $0.05 move would translate into a revenue impact of about $60 million and an EPS impact of $0.03 to $0.04 for the second half of the year. Outside of the euro, which represents 40% of our foreign currency basket, other currencies have continued to devalue against the U.S. dollar. So with this additional pressure in the second half of the year, full year reported gross margin could be about 49%.","Moving now to the bottom line. We expect earnings per share on a currency neutral basis to increase 15%, up from the previous expectation of 14% as compared to last year\u2019s adjusted EPS of $3.08. On a reported basis, despite the negative impact from foreign currency, we now expect EPS growth of 5% to get us to $3.22 versus last year\u2019s adjusted EPS. This compares to our previous EPS guidance of $3.20, which reflected a 4% growth outlook. This places us even further ahead of our 2017 place and in fact is a nice stairstep acceleration in the first three years of our plan, plus 13% in year one, 14% in year two and now plus 15% in year three. That\u2019s not too bad.","Now, let\u2019s see how we see the second half playing out. For the third quarter, we expect currency neutral and reported revenue to increase at nearly the same rates as the second quarter. Now keep in mind the third quarter is the biggest international quarter of the year and therefore our most significant FX exposure. In fact, given current rates, we see the potential for about 70 basis points of foreign currency headwinds impacting our operating margin in the third quarter.","For the fourth quarter, we see revenue growth at a slightly lower rate than the third quarter as we will be up against a comparable period in 2014 that included a 53rd week. The fourth quarter will also see the strongest margin and profit comparisons for the year when D2C is at its peak, the negative impact of currency moderates, and we begin to see the impact of lower product costs.","So to wrap it up, there are a lot of green lights as we look out across our portfolio and our execution only continues to get stronger. The initiatives and investments we have in place combined with the power of our diverse portfolio of brands are positioning us to achieve growth targets that we view as pretty strong, when you stack us up against the industry as a whole. Equally as important is our proven track record of delivering steady earnings growth that we believe clearly illustrates the strength of our business model and consistent return to our shareholders. After posting a strong first half, we now have an even greater level of confidence as we enter the second half of 2015.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ed Yruma with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Ed Yruma","I guess first on the Jeanswear business, obviously nice performance there. How do we think about the drivers of that business? And then second, the instrumentality from a margin perspective. I know it\u2019s lower gross but are there certain benefits as that growth rate accelerates? And then finally, with the Nautica reboot, you\u2019ve done these a number of times. I guess how should we think about timing and cadence of that process?","Scott Baxter","So from a Jeanswear standpoint, we\u2019re seeing denim trend up a little bit so that\u2019s been real positive for us. You\u2019ve seen that this is the third quarter in a row that we\u2019ve had mid single-digit increases. But if you think about Jeanswear, this is the culmination of a lot of things.","First of all, it is our new innovative products that are coming to market. We\u2019ve been on an innovation process pipeline now for about five years and you\u2019re starting to see some of that come out of our pipeline. You are starting to see things like Cool Vantage, which we just kicked off here about 45 days ago to tremendous success. That\u2019s part of the pipeline, that\u2019s part of the creation that we\u2019ve had and that\u2019s starting to come out and we are seeing really good success. You are also seeing expanded distribution, Ed. You are seeing that our consumers want to see our products in different and more channels because we\u2019re just really connecting with them. An example of that would be in the mid-tier where you are seeing Wrangler really do very, very well. In addition to that, we have really gotten our demand creation platform harmonized with our businesses.","So, we are pretty excited about what is going to happen in the second half of this year because we are kicking off in the Lee business Mike & Mike from ESPN. And then we have a really strong Advanced Comfort platform coming up from Drew Brees on the Wrangler side.","And I think for me the big benefit has been the real strong leadership that we\u2019ve seen from our team at both Wrangler and Lee and just the excitement around our products and our people and our innovations.","Scott Roe","I guess just on the model, it is a great model is the short answer. We have relatively lower margins when you compare to average VF but it\u2019s a very efficient machine and we see","a lot of leverage. So when we get the top-line moving, that leverage drives profitability. And remember, it\u2019s already our most profitable coalition at almost 19%.","Steve Rendle","Then on your Nautica question, real quick. We\u2019re really at the front end of this work. As I mentioned, we\u2019ve just finished our consumer segmentation study and that\u2019s beginning to inform everything to do with our brand positioning and our brand strategy which flows through our product and go-to-market strategy. So from a timing and what can you expect is really over the -- I think you will continue to see improvement over the next 12 months to 18 months as our team really locks onto this new model, new strategy and the product machine is able to start putting the differentiated product into the segmentation strategy.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti","Eric, I guess jump ball Eric or Scott. You guys had much better trends in the revenue growth in the quarter in constant currency. I\u2019m curious why you didn\u2019t feel like taking up the revenue growth overall for the year. Maybe you could help connect that decision to what you are seeing in the backlogs for the fall and holiday, and maybe if you see the same trends in the direct-to-consumer business you are seeing in the enthusiasm for the backlog in your wholesale customers. Is that what you would look at and say okay, we\u2019ve got room there to then maybe raise the guidance for the year at that point?","Eric Wiseman","Michael, it is a great question and something we talked about a lot. The math works; you know how this works that all the numbers between 7.5% and 8.5% round to 8% as we report our numbers. So, there is $127 million gap there on $12.7 billion business and we actually -- our revenue outlook is a little stronger but the number is still eight is the way to deal with that I think. So, we\u2019re very encouraged by how the back half looks. Scott mentioned in his comments that the back half \u2013 we\u2019re up against the back half that had an important 53rd week last year. So that\u2019s part of the dynamic as well. But we are seeing growth in both our wholesale and retail business around the world in our big brands and it\u2019s very encouraging as we have a lot of our bookings in for fall and we have pretty good visibility to the numbers.","Scott Roe","Maybe just building on that, as you try to model this out, obviously the top line as Eric said is incrementally better. Given our FX environment and our history of tightly controlling expenses, that means we are driving leverage. And so the couple of pennies that we took up in terms of bottom line, that\u2019s really where that\u2019s coming from.","Michael Binetti","And Eric, it seems like you\u2019re ready to have a basis point argument with me on revenues there. So thanks for that. If we just look at the gross margin line and start thinking ahead to 2016 a bit, you guys have told us about -- you guys have mentioned a couple of times how you\u2019re getting close to your five-year margin target early but obviously FX has gotten a lot different since then. Maybe you could help us think about the 60 to 70 basis points of mix you guys get every year, how should we lay currency on top of that as we look at next year, and then also any comment you could give us on how you\u2019re thinking about price increases as you get into that FX pressure?","Eric Wiseman","I think that was like five or six questions, Michael.","Michael Binetti","Perhaps.","Eric Wiseman","And you know the first answer I\u2019m going to give you which is we\u2019re not going to give guidance into \u201816 at this point but there is a few things I can say, Michael. So first of all, currency has impacted us this year, as we said about 60 basis points and that\u2019s essentially offset by the mix benefit that we see and then a little bit of input cost is the rest of the delta to get there for 2015. But pricing has always been a part of our quiver of arrows I guess as we attack things like commodity price and currency and there is no reason to believe that wouldn\u2019t be true in the future.","The other thing I always like to point out on this topic is, in any given season, more than 50% of our products are new, each time. So when we talk about price, it\u2019s really merchandising to a known value as opposed to necessarily raising the price on a like for like basis.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi.","Kate McShane","My first question was on the roll out of your brands in China. And just has there been any change in strategy there given the environment?","Karl Heinz Salzburger","No, no change in strategy. I think we all heard the news recently; there was some noise in economy. And our strategy stays unchanged. I always say that very consistently, this is a marathon; it\u2019s not a short-term race. We actively work at the moment with four brands which are our major focus. I said it in the past we still have opportunities in a number of stores. I gave the number compared and benchmarked big players. We still have a lot of room there and also we had a relatively good quarter. Our comps are strong; so it\u2019s really good feedback from China at the moment.","Kate McShane","You may have given this, I may have missed it. But did you give a comp growth number for your DTC business in your prepared comments?","Eric Wiseman","We did not but I\u2019ll make a brief comment on that. As we look at our D2C business in total, we think we\u2019re going to grow low to mid single-digit in our brick and mortar stores and we have talked about high-single-digit comp growth in our overall D2C. And that\u2019s really pulled up by the rapid growth of our e-commerce business which has been and continues to be up over 30%. So when you put those two together, low to mid-single-digit comps in brick and mortar and up 30% in e-com, we get to a high-single-digit comp number in our D2C business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Boss with J.P. Morgan.","Matthew Boss","So, on your longer-term objectives, split adjusted 2017 earnings target would be about 4.50 in earnings. Are you -- I guess higher level, are you so comfortable with this? And if we don\u2019t see an acquisition which you have some embedded in that, are there other levers to think about to be able to get us there?","Eric Wiseman","Sure. When we announced the 4.50 earnings per share target, we said at that time that we weren\u2019t really relying on a big contribution from acquisitions to get to that number. The fact is we aren\u2019t and as Scott pointed out, our three-year trend in EPS growth, we were assuming a 13% compounded EPS growth to get there and our numbers are 13, 14 and we\u2019re now guiding to \u201815 this year on a constant currency basis. What\u2019s changed is when we gave the 4.50, we said we were expecting no change from FX, FX wouldn\u2019t affect that. We pegged at whatever the rate was at that time and obviously we have an FX headwind this year.","What\u2019s going to happen for the next few years from an FX standpoint, I can\u2019t comment on, we don\u2019t know. But organically, we are driving greater than the planned organic growth rate in our EPS. So, how you think about that? I don\u2019t know what to tell you because I don\u2019t know what the foreign currency exchange rates are going to be for the next 30 months. We\u2019re exactly halfway through our five-year plan sitting here right now.","Matthew Boss","And then just a follow-up, so as the balance sheet continues to build here, anything new to think about on the capital allocation front, more so if we didn\u2019t see an acquisition by say the midpoint of next year, is it fair to think about maybe a larger or more consistent share repurchase? Would you look to return cash to shareholders maybe in a different fashion?","Eric Wiseman","Matthew, I would say this: There is no change in our position which has been consistent. Acquisitions remains our number one priority, dividends is the following and then we have said consistently we won\u2019t let cash accumulate; we\u2019ll return that to shareholders as we\u2019ve done over $1.3 billion over the last couple of years. So, if we had cash accumulate as I said, we would absolutely not let it sit there, we would find a way to return that back to shareholders.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Duffy with Stifel.","Jim Duffy","My question is a big picture question about the portfolio of brands as a whole. A few brands nicely ahead of pace relative to 2017 targets, a few laggards; I suppose that\u2019s the benefits of having a portfolio. We are seeing DTC ahead of pace. The world has changed quite a bit in the past few years with the pace at which consumers are embracing shopping directly with the strong brands. Given this kind of new world order, can you provide some updated perspective on strategies to shape the portfolio, how you think about those brands that are laggards? That\u2019d be helpful.","Eric Wiseman","I\u2019m going to respond to that in a couple of ways, Jim. One thing we are seeing is that our D2C business worldwide is running at a -- is going to be a bigger percentage of our company than we originally thought. It\u2019s grown about 200 basis points as a percentage of our total revenue over the last couple of years. We did have an accounting change there that affected that but it\u2019s looking like that could continue to -- that could hit 30% of our total revenue in the next couple of years. So that is different, consumers are engaging with us as I said earlier to an earlier question, primarily through our e-commerce sites which are very compelling, getting bigger and we have them in more countries.","As regards to the shape of the portfolio, it\u2019s something that we look at all the time and we want to be in a position 5, 10 years from now where we have a compelling and a relevant portfolio. I can\u2019t comment specifically about how we\u2019re thinking about adding to that portfolio or subtracting to that portfolio. It\u2019d be an appropriate comment to make. But it is something we manage.","Jim Duffy","Can you speak in any general terms about things you would be more likely to add to the portfolio or the characteristics of how you\u2019re trying to shape the portfolio, what you\u2019d like to emphasize and what are some things you are less interested in emphasizing?","Eric Wiseman","You have heard us talk over time about our focus on the Outdoor & Action Sports space and those activity-based brands are where we are best and growing the most and investing the most. We invest disproportionately them in brand spend and we invest disproportionately them in new stores and new stores and e-commerce sites because we like the characteristics of them and the stickiness with consumers when we are helping them live out their lives doing the activities they like to do.","So, you will see us invest in that type of thing in our portfolio beginning with an emphasis on Outdoor & Action Sports.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Glick with Buckingham Research Group.","David Glick","Scott, just a question -- I just want to make sure I understand your comments on the gross margin and profit progression for the balance of the year. You said that FX was a little bit greater in Q3, but also you have some of your higher margin brands have a higher penetration as well. Should we think about the gross margin progression Q3 being kind of similar, maybe a little bit better relative to last year in Q3 and then the big increase over last year in Q4 and the same for EBIT and EPS? Is that the right way to think about it?","Scott Roe","I think that\u2019s generally right. We are not being that specific, but I think in terms of the shape you listened well.","David Glick","And then tax rate is still around 24%, is that fair?","Scott Roe","That\u2019s right, about 24%.","David Glick","The last question on Jeanswear, it sounds like you have a lot of new product initiatives. And I am just wondering, is this part of a broader improvement in the overall denim market? There\u2019s certainly been a lot of discussion about that. Obviously, you guys are doing a lot of things right but I am just wondering has the demand sort of bottomed out in the category and really starting to recover overall? Is this a rising tide in addition to some of the strategies you guys are successfully implementing?","Steve Rendle","David, I think it\u2019s a little bit of all of what you said. The market is definitely improving. We have seen a little bit of additional demand around denim. But I think the single most important thing is our folks are really doing a good job as far as helping accelerate that demand with their consumers and with our wholesale customers. We are bringing products to market that the consumer really likes. We\u2019ve got our new Heavenly Touch, our Advanced Comfort, our Dream Jean and even I mentioned earlier talking about the Cool Vantage; 9t is","a product that hasn\u2019t really been addressed in the marketplace before and we brought it all the way through our innovation pipeline over the last three to four years, came to market with it here and it\u2019s been a tremendous success.","So, it is not just that, it\u2019s the additional piece and the additional piece is when you bring a product to market that the consumer finds that they have a need for, you have success. And we\u2019re really listening to the consumer with our insight process and we are bringing those things to market and the consumers finding them. And we just have to have a bigger voice; going forward from a demand creation and you heard me talk about some of the things that we are doing there to go ahead and highlight those products and highlight our brands. So, as you combine both of those factors, I think it is really good for our Jeanswear business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie.","Laurent Vasilescu","So, two weeks ago on -- The Wall Street Journal highlighted that VF Corp is one of the brand leaders out there looking at Africa as the next frontier from a sourcing standpoint. Can you provide any insights regarding your geographic sourcing strategy going forward? And how should we think about labor cost pressures this year and longer term from a gross margin standpoint?","Eric Wiseman","For as long as I\u2019ve been here and I have been here for 20 years, our supply chain strategy about sourcing product has always been to have a balanced portfolio of countries that we can create our products in, not chasing lowest cost but chasing the best business model for us. As a result of that, we are spread pretty wide in terms of the regions of the world and number of countries that we have facilities in that we either own and operate or that we source from including a small presence in Africa. Africa is a place that interests us. It is emerging on the scene and as the article said it is kind of a new place for the apparel and footwear industry to go to and we are there in a very small way trying to learn what role that may have in our future.","I am going to take a step back from that and as we look from -- look for places to source; cost is not the first place, thing that we look for. We have to first have the quality of products made. If the products -- it doesn\u2019t do us any good to get an inexpensive product that doesn\u2019t have great quality, that\u2019s bad for our brands. Second thing we look for is working conditions. We won\u2019t source products in a place that doesn\u2019t have good working conditions for the people that work in those factories.","The third thing we look for is service. So now we have quality of the products, good working conditions and a place that can service our demand and then the last thing we look for is cost in that order. And to the extent countries can tick those boxes in that order, we go there.","Laurent Vasilescu","Continuing on the sourcing theme, can you provide an update on The Third Way of manufacturing? I think the last time we heard about the third way was during the 2013 Investor Day, so hoping to get a little bit of an update on that initiative in terms of the potential for gross margins going forward.","Eric Wiseman","The Third Way is -- giving a Reader\u2019s Digest version, one way to produce is in factories that we own and operate; the second is in a factory that\u2019s purely a third-party relationship; and the third way is in a factory where we have a strategic alliance with the factory bringing everything we know about making product into a factory that\u2019s owned and operated by somebody else. That was an idea three or four years ago. We have some of those set up around the world and we have one of those set up or a couple of those set up now in Bangladesh. And it is a place where we find that we can take an attractive -- a potentially attractive factory in a market that meets all the criteria I said, and make it even better because we are pretty good manufacturing operators ourselves, have a lot of tricks up our sleeves and we share them with some of those factories and that model will continue to see more of that. I can\u2019t speak to what percentages of our products come out of that today but it\u2019s a growing percentage.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana Telsey","Can you talk a little bit about as you think of marketing investment for the back half of the year, how does it differ by coalition, what should we be seeing? And just lastly on the jeans side, mid-tier department store performance, how did that look and was there any change?","Scott Roe","Our demand creation is growing a little bit faster than our top line. So, just in terms of modeling it out, we continue to make those investments but importantly we are also improving the effectiveness of those investments. We are making those dollars work better. I will give you one simple example, we have had 14 global media agencies and we have embarked on our project to really look at rationalizing that, getting more leverage, the power of one VF. And as a result, we have taken that 14 down to 3 and that\u2019s resulting in tens of millions of dollars of savings over several years. And that\u2019s really a way to just put those dollars to work in a more effective way.","Steve Rendle","From a mid-tier standpoint Dana, I think there are two things I would like to talk about. One is we brought Wrangler to the mid-tier and it has been extremely successful. What I mentioned earlier is our consumer is asking for our product in different channels and that just tells us the strength of the brand that we have and we brought that product to that channel. It has resonated extremely well and we are rolling it out across the channel across the United States with great success.","And then on the female side, we are bringing real innovation to the channel. So not just around denim. I think the thing that\u2019s really interesting and really exciting for the Lee brand is we are bringing some different fabrications and some different performance type products that have been really successful from a female standpoint and the consumer has really liked that in that channel too. So that\u2019s a little bit on the male and a little bit on the female within the channel but we feel really good about what is happening in the second half and what we have in our innovation pipeline going forward.","Eric Wiseman","It\u2019s absolutely fair to say that how to do this because I want to talk about a specific mid-tier retailer. But is the mid-tier sector healthier than it was two years ago? You bet it is. Is it healthier than it was last year? Yes, it is. Where is that going to go? I don\u2019t know but those retailers in that space have been working really hard to become relevant and to get momentum and they are getting some traction.","Operator","Our next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad","I wanted to follow up on Michael\u2019s question on FX. I know you are not giving guidance for next year but just wanted to get a better understanding of kind of the key drivers on the transactional side as your hedges roll off for later this year, next year. Is it price, merchandising by far the two biggest components, levers you can pull to manage through that? Is there supply chain efficiencies or product costs coming down or raw materials? Just help me think how to order that and are you still comfortable that you will largely be able to handle that issue, that FX issue?","Scott Roe","Omar, as we\u2019ve discussed in the past, the answer is all of the above are true, all those are levers. And I always just -- when we have this discussion, I always encourage people don\u2019t isolate too much on one single component of our input cost because the reality is the markets are pretty efficient, we see commodities now trending down, we see currency going the other way. It\u2019s really hard to predict how all of those factors are going to come together. But that\u2019s why we have hedging programs and that\u2019s why we enter into longer term relationships and contracts so that we can see those coming and design and merchandise around those known input costs.","And pricing is absolutely a lever. I made the point earlier in the call that it is not necessarily like for like items although that will be part of the equation but really I would say merchandising and the mix and the innovation that we are bringing to market that we get paid for, all those things together mix to allow us to maintain our margins. The other thing I always say too is while the speed with which currency change this time is a little unprecedented, the fact that it is changing and the relative amount is not unprecedented. We manage this every quarter and the best evidence of our ability to do it going forward is the fact that we have done it for many years in the past.","So, I think a lot of those factors are going to come to bear, Omar. And we see our model is intact and we see no reason why we wouldn\u2019t be able to overcome these headwinds.","Omar Saad","Eric, I want to ask a question, I heard you mention Eagle Creek is one of the fastest-growing brands. You\u2019ve got a number of smaller brands in the portfolio that don\u2019t get as much attention, Napapijri and I know Kipling is doing really well, Reef is one we haven\u2019t heard about in a while. Should we think about these smaller brands; are they all seem to be coming together and starting to reach a critical mass maybe not individually but as a whole as kind of another leg of growth, organic growth for the company? Is that the right way to think about or are they still too small as we think about the broader portfolio?","Eric Wiseman","Yes, you\u2019re right, we tend to focus on our big brands because our big brands move the needle for us and that\u2019s how we talk on these calls. We have a lot of smaller brands that are doing fantastically well. A brand like Kipling which was a brand we don\u2019t talk about much, it was a small brand; it is approaching the size that Vans was when we acquired it. So it is becoming not such a small brand and it is growing. It is one of our fastest growing brands consistently over the last four years. So that\u2019s just one. Napapijri is another one that you called out. We are having great growth in that brand. Eagle Creek is a very small brand for us but a really important brand in the outdoor luggage space and for Consumer Reports readers to have discovered it and name it the Best Luggage Brand of 2015 is remarkable. And I couldn\u2019t be more proud of that group. And we think all those brands have runway and collectively they are an important part of our growth story.","Omar Saad","Can you give us a sense of the size combined Napapijri, Kipling, Reef, Eagle Creek and any others that I am missing in that genre?","Eric Wiseman","I couldn\u2019t do that accurately in my head on this call. It might be a conversation we have later.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","I wanted to ask about Mountain Athletics and just get a better sense of number one, what kind of distribution that initiative is getting? And maybe Steve, you could talk to clearly breaking into training and sort of outside of the outdoor part of action would be a pretty big new category to tap into. And I was just curious from your consumer insights work what your consumers telling you that how you would position North Face in that category in order to really take off?","Steve Rendle","Mountain Athletics is a very important new line extension, new collection that The North","Face has been focusing on. It is really important in being able to spread The North Face beyond its second half concentration into becoming a true 12-month out of the year brand. And our consumer insights is what really has led the team to the way it is positioned. And you heard me talk about in my comments; it is about training for the activities that are relevant to The North Face consumer. It could be that ski adventure, climbing, a long hike that someone has been focused on or if you are just part of that focused consumer group in your everyday life, it is a method of training that really resonates with you.","We see the distribution opportunity being very consistent with where the brand is distributed today. Specialty retail is an important part but where we are seeing very good placement and very good sell-through is in the sporting goods channel. The department store piece, which is smaller for the brand absolutely has seen good placement. And then our own D2C and specifically e-commerce where we are able to really present the brand, present the collection and the theory behind Mountain Athletics training, we have seen really good strong growth on a quarter-by-quarter basis.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","And Lindsay, just to give you an international point of view, we just launched it a little bit later than in the U.S.; it is in the market right now and the sellout data are phenomenal, really doing well.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","And just a follow-up for both Timberland and Vans, can you talk about how momentum has been in apparel versus footwear? Are you seeing increased strength in apparel as you focused on that offering or is it kind of balanced growth?","Steve Rendle","So, I will start with Vans. As you saw, they had a spectacular quarter yet again and that\u2019s broad-based. It is across all categories, all genders and all channels and regions. So, apparel is growing as a very important element of that brand\u2019s go-to-market strategy and the collaborations that they have brought to market. Disney wasn\u2019t just a footwear collaboration; it came to life in apparel in a really unique and fun way. And at Timberland, continues to be a big focus for us. As I have said before, we are just beginning to get placement and penetration here in the U.S. market. Our greatest go-to-market presence is within our own retail. And it is an important focus. It is part of the three areas that we have committed to really drive, men\u2019s footwear, women\u2019s footwear, and men\u2019s apparel. So really happy with both businesses\u2019 apparel growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mitch Kummetz with B. Riley.","Mitch Kummetz","So Eric, you\u2019re now expecting stronger 8% growth this year. I think the only coalition that you formally raised the growth rate was Jeanswear. I am curious on Outdoor & Action Sports. The plan is double-digit growth. Are you now kind of assuming stronger double-digit growth for the year given how strong that coalition was for the quarter?","Eric Wiseman","No comment on outdoor growth for the back half of the year. I will remind you, Mitch that particularly at The North Face, the 53rd week last year was extremely helpful. You might remember in the first quarter of this year we talked about the slowdown in the growth rate of The North Face. It was because they traded the first week of January for the first week of April. And obviously The North Face model first week of January is more important than the first week of April. But we are up against that in our growth rates for fall. We are not taking our guidance up on outdoor or action sports but we are very pleased with where we are positioned right now.","Mitch Kummetz","And then Scott, just on reconciling the earnings guidance again, the sales assumption is essentially the same although again maybe a little bit stronger 8% growth. Gross margin has come down a little bit. EPS bumps up a couple of pennies. Is it really on the SG& A side that we should see kind of the improvement? I think you mentioned tax is the same. Does share count come down at all and does Jeanswear impact kind of the model since you are now expecting more Jeanswear growth for the year and that\u2019s lower gross margin, lower SG&A?","Scott Roe","I think it was all in there, Mitch, but you nailed it. It is really leverage on SG&A is really what you need to make your model work because all of the other factors -- shares are the same; we said about 24 on the tax rate. Obviously we talked about the gross margin. So the difference is that higher volume is driving leverage. And remember that Jeanswear business, that\u2019s their model, relatively low margins based on the channels they play in. And they drive volume and that drops right to the bottom line. That\u2019s why we see that 19% or so operating income for Jeanswear.","Operator","Our final question comes from David Weiner with Deutsche Bank.","David Weiner","So, just my two questions, I guess first, I was hoping regarding Europe, you could maybe give a little more color by geography? If you could do that, maybe kind of what is working better or if there are any regions that are kind of lagging if you will? And then in the U.S., are there any callouts in terms of stores that are located in heavier tourist markets? Are you being impacted by tourist inflows into the States?","Karl Heinz Salzburger","David, maybe I start with Europe. As you heard us saying, we had a strong quarter, up 11%. I guess the good news is most of our brands in the portfolio were growing so from a brand point of view. That\u2019s the first point. The second one, we see good strength in most of the geographies. It\u2019s not just bumping in one area so all over. In Southern Europe, particularly strong; it is good in the Scandinavian piece and the UK, also the Greater German area; and even Greece. I looked into Greece. Even if it is small for us, we have a subsidiary there but that\u2019s a few percent up to last year\u2019s which is really surprising considering what\u2019s going on in that market.","David Weiner","The Greek comp. Okay.","Eric Wiseman","That\u2019s going to put us over the top for the year, I am sure.","Steve Rendle","And then David, to your tourist question. We have seen those large tourist markets of Southern Florida, New York and to some degree Las Vegas, impacted by that international tourist. What is interesting is the offset is we\u2019re seeing really strong comps in our international retail as that consumer stays home. I think the important thing to remember, the D2C is a smaller percentage of our total revenue, strong wholesale base and very balanced and broad platform by which our businesses drive their revenue.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","David, we are happy that we get a few American tourists more now in Europe.","Eric Wiseman","Thank you all for your time and attention this morning. We\u2019re thrilled with how the quarter played out with currency neutral growth of 10% on the top line and 22% on the bottom line.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lance Allega, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.","Lance Allega","Thank you operator, and good morning to everyone, and thanks for joining us today on our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results earnings call.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind everybody that participants on the call will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in documents filed regularly with the SEC.","Participants may also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. Where applicable, you can find presentations with comparable GAAP measures in our press release, which was issued at 7 AM Eastern Time today and on our website at vfc.com.","Joining us on today's call will be Chairman, President and CEO, Eric Wiseman; Bob Shearer, our CFO; and VF Executives, Scott Baxter, Steve Rendle and Karl Heinz Salzburger. Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call for questions and ask that you please limit yourself to two questions per caller. Now, I'll turn the call over to Eric.","Eric Wiseman","Thanks, Lance. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Our fourth quarter and full year results demonstrate the strength of VF\u2019s business model, our powerful brands and the powerful platforms that support those brands to consistently deliver strong returns to our shareholders. Consistency is in VF's DNA. It is part of how we manage our business. It is what we expect from our people and it's consistency that our shareholders have come to expect from us. We take pride in it.","One year ago, we laid out expectations for 7% to 8% revenue growth and 11% to 13% EPS growth for 2014. And while this past year has presented plenty of challenges we achieved our top line target and actually exceeded our bottom line goal delivering record returns to our shareholders.","Last year, we spoke about momentum and 12 months later it is the same story, outstanding performances from our four largest brands as well as some notable up and comers and the powerful platforms that became demonstrably stronger during the year. And before we dive into a few highlights of the quarter and the year, let's first touch on a non-cash accounting manner. During the past few years, our Contemporary Brands business which represents about 3% of VF\u2019s total revenues has operated in a challenging environment.","In this morning's release, you saw that we concluded that the carrying value of our 7 For All Mankind, Splendid and Ella Moss brands has declined. As a result, in the fourth quarter we took an after-tax impairment charge of $307 million which is about $0.70 of EPS to reduce the carrying value of those brand's assets on our books. Bob will take you through more detail on this in a few minutes.","With that said, on an adjusted or underlying operating performance basis, our fourth quarter results were quite strong and contributed to another fantastic year for VF. For the full year, total revenue grew 8% and reached $12.3 billion led by 13% growth in our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition or up 14% if you exclude the impact of foreign currency. Our international business grew 9% or 11% if you adjust for currency. Our direct-to-consumer business grew 19% and included high single-digit comps.","Our full year gross margin improved by 70 basis points to reach 48.8% all which led to an adjusted earnings per share of $3.08 which is up 14% over last year's $2.71 and it's ahead of our annual long-term earnings growth target. And finally, share buybacks during the year when combined with 22% increase in our quarterly dividend rate returned more than $1.2 billion to our shareholders.","Looking forward to 2015, foreign currency, currency adjusted, currency neutral, these are terms you are going to hear us and many U.S. companies with sizable international businesses talk about likely for many quarters to come. And while the rapid strengthening of the U.S. dollar may continue to cause reported results to shift depending on how the euro, the pound, the peso and yen, move throughout the year, the important news is, our fundamental business is incredibly strong and the momentum we've established will continue.","In 2015 we're teed up to deliver another year of record financial results for shareholders. For the full year again, on a constant or currency neutral basis, we expect revenues to be up 8% which is in line with our 2017 organic growth rate target. That growth rate is of course an even stronger rate if you factor in the 53rd week we had in 2014 and similar to last year we expect Outdoor & Action Sports, International and our DTC business to remain the most significant drivers of growth.","We expect gross margin to improve by at least 40 basis points to reach 49.2% including some negative FX headwinds. This puts us just 30 basis points shy of our five-year 2017 goal at the end of only the third year of our five-year plan. Operating margin should reach 15% versus the adjusted operating margin of 2014, once again despite negative currency influences.","We expect our currency neutral earnings per share to grow 12% versus the adjusted EPS of $3.08 in 2014. We're also pleased to report that we expect once again to return more than $1.2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends this year. That sounds like a lot to deliver and it is, but we are confident we will achieve these goals.","Let me summarize what has driven and will continue to drive our strong performance. First, we will lead in innovation by increasing our pipeline of compelling new products and technologies. Second, we will deepen connections with consumers by creating consistent and compelling engagements. Third, we will serve consumers directly reaching them across multiple channels wherever and whenever they shop, and finally, we will expand geographically taking advantage of our scale in every region and channel that we operate in.","So in closing, with year two of our five-year plan in the books and year three looking quite strong ahead of us, I'm happy to say that the performance of our underlying operations is on track with our long-term targets. We have never been more bullish about VF's business. Our company theme is consistent; powerful brands, powerful platforms, one VF.","And one last thing before I pass the call over to Bob, I'd like to offer a few words about my experience with him on this his last earnings call before his retirement. It has truly been an honor to work with this man. He is my friend and my thought partner and my counsel. He possesses extraordinary talent, intelligence, discipline and unique leadership capabilities.","During his nearly 30-year tenure at VF he has been undeniably instrumental in the success and complete transformation of our company. He has been an invaluable author of our business playbook and our operational principles and enforcer of financial discipline and honestly he is just a good person. He is a person with the head for success and the heart to succeed and he will truly be missed.","I can attest that Scott Roe has some big shoes to fill and I have worked with Scott for almost two decades at VF. Scott knows VF. He is battle tested and an extraordinary leader. I have every confidence in him and his ability to make significant contribution as VF's next Chief Financial Officer.","And with that, I'll turn the call over for the last time to our great friend and the Chief Financial Officer the Wall Street Journal ranked as number eight in the universe, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Bob Shearer.","Bob Shearer","Well, thanks Eric for the kind words and also the unique opportunity to serve alongside you throughout much of my time at VF, I just have way, way, way, too many good things to say about VF in my experiences during an earning call, but I will say that I couldn\u2019t be more proud of being part of the incredible transformation this company has successfully put in place. What an honor it's been for me. And I've also enjoyed working with all of you on this call over the years and I'll miss that for sure. But first, I am still the CFO, so back to the business at hand.","Our fourth quarter results and overall performance in 2014 once again illustrate the strength of the VF business model and how our operational excellence enables us to deliver on our growth objectives year after year. Fourth quarter revenue increased 9% led by exceptional results from our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition as well as our International and direct-to-consumer businesses.","For the quarter, foreign currency fluctuations hurt the revenue comparison by about three percentage points while the incremental week that Eric referenced helped by about that same amount. Our gross margin reached a record 49% in the fourth quarter with an 80 basis point improvement driven mostly by the continued shift of the revenues toward our higher margin businesses and a small lift from an accounting change made earlier in the year related to retail concession fees.","SG&A as a percent of revenues in the fourth quarter increased 20 basis points. This increase was primarily due to that same accounting change as retail concession fees are now included in the SG&A line rather than netted against revenues.","And now a bit more on the fourth quarter impairment charge we recorded for the 7 For All Mankind, Splendid and Ella Moss brands and our contemporary coalition. As you know, the contemporary space has certainly been a challenged one of late, because of and related to that, we determined that the fair values of these brands were below their respective carrying values. As a result, we recorded $396 million pretax non-cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill and intangible assets related to these brands which equates to $307 million after-tax or $0.70 of diluted earnings per share.","So while we continue to view 7 For All Mankind, Splendid and Ella Moss as vehicles for growth from today's levels our projections did not support balance sheet carrying values, hence the charge.","Now getting back to the P&L, and as discussed in the press release, there were further amounts that exclude the impairment charge I just discussed as adjusted amounts. So adjusted operating income grew 14% and adjusted operating margin was 16.2% compared with 15.5% in the fourth quarter of 2013, which brings us to the bottom line and adjusted earnings per share of $0.98 which is up 20% over last year's quarter. Including the impairment charge fourth quarter earnings per share was $0.28.","Recapping now on full year basis, revenue growth for the year was 8% which included about one percentage point of negative impact from FX and about one percentage point of benefit in the 53rd week in 2014. This growth was primarily driven by exceptional strength in our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition which was up 13% for the full year or 14% currency neutral. Our international business, which was up 9%, 11% currency neutral and our D2C business which was up 19% included high single-digit comps and more than 30% growth in e-commerce revenues.","Gross margin improved by 70 basis points. Our gross margin expansion story continues reflecting the continued revenue mixed shift toward higher-margin businesses and our intense focus on this critical measure of our brands' strength. Gross margin expansion has and will continue to be an important part of our financial story. Our highest margin businesses are our fastest growing. In 2014 Outdoor & Action Sports represented nearly 60% of total revenue, international 38% and D2C 26%.","SG&A as a percentage of total revenue was up 30 basis points and increased to almost completely to the change in concession accounting. In fact, if you look at our underlying operations, we were able to continue to increase the investment in our expanding D2C business and marketing investments while leveraging and maintaining strong cost controls across other areas of the organization. As we've said in the past, expanding gross margins, investing in growth, in D2C and marketing and cost leverage in other areas of SG&A were up, that's our model today and looking forward that will continue to serve us and our shareholders well.","We also entered the year with our capital structure providing great flexibility. In 2014 we generated nearly $1.7 billion in cash from operations and returned more than $1.2 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and that's almost twice the cash return we delivered in 2013. Inventory levels are in great shape up just 6% at year end and well below the rate of revenue growth and finally our return on invested capital improved to 18.6% up 100 basis points which we're pleased to report is tracking head of our 2017 target.","So with 2014 behind us, let's talk about the year ahead and I'll start with the fact that we're positioned for another year of outstanding performance across the globe. As you've heard given the size and importance of our expanding international businesses there is some noise in our 2015 outlook related to foreign currency fluctuations mostly related to translating foreign currencies into dollars for reporting. So I'll do my best to sort through the operational side of our business versus expected reported results including the currency implications.","First, in terms of definitions. I'll refer to currency neutral amounts, which assumes that there will be no foreign currency rate changes from 2014 to 2015. That way you can understand the true operational growth in our businesses and brands. Now as in the past, by far the majority of the currency impacts actually more than 80% result simply from translating foreign currencies into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. However, in 2015 given the recent and rapid strengthening of the U.S. dollar against nearly all currencies outside of the U.S. there is some, although limited transactional impact as well.","For example, most of the impact on the transactional side results from the recent decision of the Swiss Government to move away from pegging their currency to the euro. Because our European businesses are headquartered in Switzerland, that means in U.S. dollars, our reported headquarter expenses increased. The reason these transactional impacts are not more significant is that we have a strong and efficient hedging program that offsets nearly all of these influences, but when currencies move so quickly and\/or unexpectedly, well we still covered nearly all, but not quite all of the risk and of course in a more normal currency environment, like we've had over the past number of years, those transactional impacts are just not significant.","Our European business is by far the most significant of our international operations or exposure to the euro represents our biggest currency challenge. In our outlook for 2015 we have used an assumption of euro 1.13 to dollar relationship and as you know, the euro relationship to the dollar has been quite volatile as have most foreign currencies of late. With perspective around what additional movements of the euro to dollar relationship would mean to our P&L, a $0.05 move in the euro on a full year basis and that's important would have been an impact on the revenues of about $125 million and $0.05 per share on our EPS.","And that works both ways. In other words, with strengthening and weakening of the dollar of course as we go through the year that impact declines as the total exposure lessens. And keep in mind that other currencies have also devalued against the U.S. dollar similarly to the euro, however, the euro remains our biggest exposure.","Okay now with that out of the way, move on to 2015 and I'll start at the top with revenues, which we expect to grow 8% on a currency neutral basis, up 3% reported. On a currency neutral basis our plans include growth in every region as well as our wholesale and D2C channels. Now keep in mind that the additional week in 2014 holds back the comparison by about one percentage point.","All of that implies another strong year of revenue growth for our brands and importantly, we're looking for another year that stays right on track on a currency adjusted basis with our long-term targets as outlined in our 2017 objectives. So leading the way will be our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition, which is expected to deliver another great year led by continued strength in VF's biggest brands, The North Face, Vans and Timberland.","Actually we expect strong growth from most brands within this coalition. We anticipate low double-digit currency neutral growth for the coalition up at a mid single-digit rate reported. On a currency neutral basis, we expect low double-digit growth from the North Face a mid teen increase at Vans and a low teen increase at Timberland, all of which are in line with the annual growth targets we set in our 2017 plan. So another great year in store for outdoor and action sports.","In Jeanswear we expect a low single-digit revenue increase on a currency neutral basis and improvement over 2014. Reported growth for Jeanswear should show a low single-digit percentage increase.","We are looking for mid single-digit growth in both our Imagewear and Sportswear coalitions for the full year and finally we're expecting revenues for the Contemporary Brands coalition to be nearly flat, not anticipating any significant trend changes in the Contemporary category.","We expect the strong momentum in our international and direct-to-consumer businesses to continue in 2015 as well, with international revenues expected to be up at a low double-digit percentage rate currency neutral or low single-digit growth on a reported basis, and by region in Europe our largest international market, we expect high single-digit percentage growth on a currency neutral basis. Reported results in Europe are expected to show a decline by a mid single-digit percentage rate for the full year.","In our Asia-Pacific region, on both the currency neutral and reported basis we expect revenues to increase at a mid to high teen rate. And lastly, we expect our Americas and that's the non-U.S. business to be up at a mid-teen percentage rate currency neutral or up at a mid-single digit reported rate. Our D2C business which finished 2014 with $3.2 billion in revenues is expected to be up at a mid-teen percentage rate currency neutral or up at a low double digit reported rate. Growth in D2C is expected to be driven by approximately 150 store openings or 125 net of closures and high single-digit comp sales growth including a 30% increase in e-commerce revenues.","Now turning to margins. In 2015 we expect our gross margin rate to improve by 40 basis points to reach 49.2%. That would bring us to just 30 basis points shy of our 2017 gross margin target with two years to ago and in fact our 49.2% expectation for 2015 includes about 30 basis points of headwinds due to foreign currency rate changes. So from an operational standpoint it says we expect to be on our 2017 numbers a couple of years ahead of target. Independent of foreign currency the expansion in gross margin of 60 to 70 basis points from the favorable mix shift that we've seen for many years remains intact and as always there is no reason that should change going forward.","Now staying on the gross margin topic for just a minute. I'm pretty sure you have at least a few questions on input costs for 2015. Now let me start by saying that overall the impact of pricing versus product cost on gross margin is about neutral and the impact of each is relatively small. That is the impact of pricing increases and product cost increases are both minimal. Given our ability to improve our gross margins through a favorable mix, we view that as good news.","There are many components to our gross margin story related to product costs. First, you've all been reading about the cost of cotton coming down. As a reminder we buy finished fabrics like denim. We don't buy cotton, however, the cost of cotton will ultimately impact our cost of cotton based fabrics because of the lag time of cotton flowing through our production cycle it will be the second half of the year when we see a benefit of the cotton cost reduction, primarily in our Jeans business.","Next up, leather. We generally find it advantageous to lock in our leather buys over a longer-term. Right now we're locked down to the third quarter of 2015. Because of this timing we locked in costs for leather in 2015 is higher than our cost in 2014 even though today's costs have declined somewhat from those higher levels.","Regarding oil, we don\u2019t buy oil directly, but the cost of oil does impact some of our synthetics and other production costs. We lock in our synthetic costs over an even longer period about a year in advance. Accordingly our costs for synthetics were locked in prior to the recent cost reduction in oil. So the costs in 2015 are about flat with 2014.","So from a materials costs standpoint all of that nets to about flat costs in 2015 versus 2014. And finally it won't surprise you that labor costs are on the rise, we estimate in our own plans by as much as 3% to 5% and on source products by an average of 10% to 15%. Generally we're able to mitigate much of the higher labor costs in our plants, but not so with external costs. The increase in labor cost is generally the reason for the limited overall product cost increase that I mentioned earlier.","So there are a lot of puts and takes on product cost for us this year. Our input costs are diverse like our business. Our supply-chain folks do a great job of finding the lowest cost with high quality around the globe. That's a competitive advantage for us for sure as we continue to look for gross margin expansion and 2015 will be no exception.","All right, so taking a look at SG&A. Overall our model should remain intact. We will continue to invest in our brands and product innovation as well as our growing D2C businesses and leverage our growth against other costs. Foreign currency rate changes will put some pressure on our reported SG&A ratio to revenues like the change in the Swiss franc that I mentioned earlier. However, despite that, our SG&A ratio will remain relatively flat with 2014, bringing us to operating margin, which we anticipate to reach 15% in 2015 on a reported basis held back by about 30 basis points related to currency changes in both the gross margin and SG&A areas.","Taking this to the bottom line, we expect our earnings per share on a currency neutral basis to increase 12%, up 4% on a reported basis and keep in mind that the inclusion of the additional week in 2014 holds back this comparison by a couple percentage points. A few other housekeeping items. We're assuming a 24% to 24.5% effective tax rate and capital expenditures of approximately $225 million.","Now in terms of revenue comparisons throughout the year in 2015, on a currency neutral basis we're expecting relatively consistent growth comparisons. Revenue comparisons on a reported basis in the second half of 2015 will be slightly stronger than the first due to one, the bigger negative currency impacts expected in the first half of 2015 versus the second, meaning foreign currencies were stronger against the U.S. Dollar in the first half of 2014 than the second and two, the seasonality of our overall business waiting through the second half including our expanding D2C businesses.","With respect to earnings gains in 2015 and this is on a reported basis, that same negative impact from the timing of currency movements of 2015 versus 2014 will mean tougher earnings comparisons in the first half versus the second and especially in the first quarter when foreign currencies in 2014 were at the strongest levels against the U.S. dollar and our international business mix is particularly high.","Our outlook for cash from operations deserves some discussion. Our outlook of $1.3 billion of cash from ops in 2015 includes two significant factors. First, in early January '15 we contributed $250 million to our pension plan versus only $50 million in 2014. Our pension plan is now fully funded and this is a very efficient use of our cash based on the assumption of earnings on those funds impacting our pension expense and the additional week or the 53rd week in 2014 was a big week for cash receipts, considering that many retailers make their payments on account right after their month-end, which meant we received their cash in our year 2014. That represented over $200 million of incremental cash that would not be expected in 2015.","And related to how we'll put that cash to use for our shareholders, well our priorities are unchanged. Our first priority of course remains on the acquisition front. Regarding share repurchase is in 2015 we expect to mirror our 2014 spend and buy back about $700 million worth of our stock early in the year. That combined with our annual dividend, which was increased by 22% in the fourth quarter of 2014 we'll return more than $1.2 billion of cash to our shareholders in 2015.","So now, with year two behind us and year three underway, I'll underscore just how very confident we are in our ability to achieve our 2017 goals.","And with that, I'll turn it over to our coalition leaders to provide more detail on 2014 and what to expect in 2015. Let's kick it off with Steve Rendle.","Steve Rendle","Starting with Outdoor & Action Sports coalition. Fourth quarter revenue was up 13% or 16% on a currency neutral basis. This strength was broad-based with strong growth in wholesale and D2C as well as double-digit growth in nearly every brand including The North Face, Vans, Timberland, Kipling, Napapijri, Reef, lucy and Eagle Creek. What a portfolio and what an engine it is firing on all cylinders and housing VF's next billion-dollar brands.","Now let's take a look at VF's three largest businesses. Starting with The North Face. Fourth quarter global revenues were up 12% or 14% on a currency neutral basis. Global D2C revenues were up 30% and included double-digit comps. So, continued fantastic strength in that business.","In the Americas, which represents about 70% of TNF's full year sales, fourth quarter revenues were up at a mid teen rate with D2C growth of more than 25% and a high single-digit wholesale growth. 2014 had one of the strongest product offerings in TNF's history, innovations that defined new subsets of the outdoor performance category, products that expanded our reach into all four seasons of the year attracting new consumers and a precursor to what we believe is one of the most revolutionary fabrication technologies in more than a decade.","Let me give you some highlights. Our ThermoBall line has continued on its incredible growth trajectory. At the end of only its second year ThermoBall has clearly established itself as the consumer choice for transitional weight outerwear. The line was a top seller throughout the year and ended 2014 with global revenue exceeding $100 million. 2015 will see an even more robust expansion of this high-performance innovation and we really feel like we're just getting started.","Launched last spring our Mountain Athletics training collection continued to drive growth throughout the year giving consumers an increasingly broader offering to stay in The North Face brand when they are training to be on the trail, rock, ice and snow. The collection increased momentum throughout the year in both our own retail stores and with wholesale partners and we expect this momentum to increase even more in 2015 when we extend the product line to include a women's collection.","One of the biggest innovation stories for 2014, although available only in a limited release was FuseForm. FuseForm is a revolutionary technology that allows us to weave two fiber types into a single fabric. By being able to simplify manufacturing, reduce weight and deliver a consistent aesthetic that maximizes breathability and durability, we can engineer garments to perform where and how an athlete needs it. The FuseForm Brigandine jacket as part of our Steep Series range showed great results in the fourth quarter and one Outside Magazine\u2019s 2015 Gear of the Year. This along with the launch of the Dot Matrix jacket this spring gives us great confidence that we've just raised the bar once again.","The evolution of our ability to connect with consumers also took a significant leap forward in 2014 through a number of print, digital and TV initiatives, creating meaningful and emotional engagements with the brand. In November we launched the amazing Your Land campaign, which highlights the inspirational and emotional reasons to explore the outdoors. Since then we received more than 7.4 million YouTube views and driven more than 2.1 billion impressions and more than just a marketing campaign this effort has raised over a quarter million dollars that goes directly to help conserve our national parks, right to the very heart of the brand's DNA.","In 2014, The North Face past $2.2 billion in revenues, up 11% on a reported basis or 12% currency neutral. We're truly seeing great momentum in this brand around the world and are well-positioned to realize another strong year.","Looking at 2015 we expect The North Face's global revenues to see low double-digit currency neutral growth right in line with our 2017 plan. On a reported basis, revenue should be at a mid single-digit growth.","Now, let me turn it over to Karl Heinz Salzburger, to walk you through TNF's results in Europe and Asia.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Thank you and good morning everyone. The North Face international business was up at the high single-digit rate on a currency neutral basis in the fourth quarter. In Europe, which is about 20% of the brands full-year sales, fourth quarter revenues were up at low single-digit rate currency neutral. For the full year, revenues were also up at low single-digit currency neutral rate reflecting a tough microenvironment and a general weakness in the outdoor market. In 2015 we are expecting a slight improvement in currency neutral revenues due to our strongest ever product offering and successful go-to-market strategies.","Asia, revenues were up more than 25% in the quarter, where we continue to make good progress building brand awareness. This is evidenced by the incredibly strong launch of our Thermoball product during the year and great initial response that retailers are showing for FuseForm. Our online business also remains a key driver of growth with sales up more than 80% for the quarter.","We saw very strong results in Hong Kong for the year, great momentum with our Taiwan distributor and great momentum in China, where sales were up nearly 20%. We're pleased that we are creating deeper, lasting connections with the Asian consumer and look forward to building on this momentum. Taken together, The North Face is in a leading position as we wrap up year two of our five-year plan and remain on track with our financial targets. Now, let's turn to Vans.","Steve Rendle","Vans showed strong performance in the fourth quarter with revenues up 17% or 20% on a currency neutral basis. This marks the brand's 25th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, a big result that helped Vans become the second $2 billion brand in VF's portfolio.","In the Americas which is about 60% of the brand's full-year sales, fourth quarter revenues increased 20%, slightly ahead of our expectations, connecting with consumers through the creative expression in action sports, music, art and street culture is something the Vans team does extremely well and the fourth quarter was no exception. A great example was the 32nd annual Vans Triple Crown of Surfing, which took place in the North Shore of Oahu. Surfers from around the world entered their year on Hawaii's iconic waves and this year 10 million people who couldn't make the trip viewed the action live online. We also garnered more than 100 million social media impressions and press coverage in more than 50 countries worldwide. This is a clear indication that a lot of people choose the Vans brand as the epicenter of youth culture.","In 2015 there's no slowdown as we'll continue to build on this momentum with events such as custom culture, the Vans Warped Tour and House of Vans to drive home Vans unique Off the Wall culture. And of course a few product highlights. We recently introduced weatherized footwear designed to keep you warm and dry in the outdoor elements. So just like The North Face moving forward toward a four season offering so was Vans and that's important because consumers shouldn't have to step out of their vans because of weather. It's their flag. It expresses their creativity and now they have more choices for different climates and really exciting the response thus far has been incredible and we have plans to significantly expand this collection in the back half of 2015.","We're also introducing a new footwear concept, Classic Plus that will feature restructured trend focused product. We're really excited about this concept and can't wait to talk more about it in the coming months. Global revenues for the Vans brand in 2014 were up 17% on both a reported and currency neutral basis. This increase is ahead of our 2017 plan and clear evidence that is the world's largest youth culture brand we are firing on all cylinders globally and our momentum is strong.","In 2015 we expect Vans global currency neutral revenues to be up in a mid teen rate consistent with our 2017 plan. On a reported basis, revenue should be at a high single-digit growth rate, strong brand, strong plan and a fun year ahead. KH ","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Vans international revenues were up at 18 percentage rate on a currency neutral basis in the fourth quarter. In Europe, which is about 30% of the brands full year sales, currency neutral revenues were up at high single-digit rate in the quarter. Vans continued to deliver amazing consumer experiences with many events and interaction to London's House of Vans. This venue has quickly become a fantastic destination for youth culture to experience the brand. We look forward to using this showcase in an even greater way in '15 and just like in the Americas we're also focused on growing our relevant, innovative products such as weatherized footwear and apparel as well as updating classics to reflect current trends and getting very strong response from our efforts. Our e-commerce business also has been a great success story for Vans as we reach even more consumers.","In Asia, we are seeing strength across the board. The quarter's revenues were up more than 50% with particular strength in China and Korea. Like Europe, we are seeing strength in our weatherized lines and continue to get traction against our localized products, specifically apparel.","In terms of brand activation we completed an incredibly successful House of Vans store across three countries, our Vans China retail road show across several cities and an Asia Pacific skate tour. We also opened up an experimental retail store in Seoul, Korea that brought the House of Vans elements of live music, local artist galleries and special edition product into our retail environment. Definitely been busy making some great connections with our consumers in 2015 and look forward to building on this momentum for 2015.","And now on to Timberland.","Steve Rendle","Four quarter global revenues for Timberland were up 11%, up 15% on a currency neutral basis. In the Americas, which represents about 40% of the brand's annual sales, revenues were up nearly 25% in the fourth quarter, driven by incredibly strong growth in our wholesale business. This represents the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in the Americas momentum we look forward to building on in 2015. This is a testament to great brand strength driven by strong consumer reception for our products, high customer demand for future collections and our intense focus on amplifying our connection with the outdoor lifestyler consumer.","On the product front growth continues to be really well balanced across our all footwear and apparel categories with particular strength in casual and outdoor footwear for men and women. Our Pro Boondock family of footwear also continued its solid momentum.","On the apparel side sales are driven primarily by outerwear from shirt jackets to insulated product to beautiful leather bombers really strong and balanced growth. In marketing, we continue to build brand heat in relevance with our core target the outdoor lifestyler consumer.","In Q4 alone Timberland created a shared more than 350 pieces of engaging style rich content anchored by the highly successful Mark Maker's Influencer Program. We gained extensive coverage of our new fall collections and influential print and digital outlets garnering some 800 million media impressions. In 2014 full-year global revenues were up 13%, up 15% on a currency neutral basis, which is actually ahead of the 2019 plan we set in September. With $1.8 billion on the top line in 2014 this marks the brand's highest ever revenues, something the team is very proud of and they should be.","Looking at 2015, we expect Timberland's global revenues to see low teen currency neutral growth rate right in line with our 2017 plan. On a reported basis revenue should be up at a mid single-digit growth rate. Now back to KH.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Timberland's international revenues were up at the high single-digit percentage rate on a currency neutral basis in the fourth quarter. In Europe just about 40% of the brands full year sales fourth quarter revenues were up at the mid single digit rate currency neutral. The quarter was driven by strong sales of SensorFlex, our newest technology platform as well as Cupsole for men, while casual boots were strong on the woman's side.","During the quarter, we continued to grow our footprint in the region opening two new stores and 20 franchise locations. We also rolled out our new e-commerce site design, which drove a big jump in conversion and an increase in sales. We expect growth in the region to continue in 2015.","In Asia, fourth quarter revenues increased at double-digit rate currency neutral. In this region the classic yellow boot performed well in all markets and we saw great early success with the launch of the Britton Hill line. Additionally, apparel had a particularly strong quarter with great results from our men's outerwear including rainwear and jackets. We are more confident than ever about the Timberland brand. The global team and efforts to significantly move this brand forward are working well and they're just getting started.","Before I move forward, I'd like to talk about two brands that are based in Europe and continue to perform exceptionally well, Kipling and Napapijri. Kipling's global business posted an 18% increase in 2014 global revenues, just on top of the 29% growth it posted in 2013. This marks the second year in a row that Kipling has been Vans fastest growing brand. Napapijri finished strong in 2014 with fourth quarter revenues up nearly 30% or more than 40% currency neutral and really winning Vans fastest growing band of the quarter award. For the full year Napapijri was up at low double-digit rate. Both of these brands have fantastic long-term potential and might one day join the billion-dollar brand category. And now back to Steve.","Steve Rendle","Turning to our Sportswear and Contemporary businesses. Sportswear's fourth-quarter revenues were up 4% driven by growth in the D2C channel. Nautica's revenues were flat, with low teen growth in D2C including significant e-commerce strength, partially offset by a mid single-digit decline in its wholesale business. Kipling's North America business continued its run of double-digit gains posting 25% growth including a 35% increase in D2C sales and a mid single-digit growth in wholesale during the fourth quarter. We continue to expect Kipling to achieve strong double-digit growth throughout the year.","Revenue in our Contemporary Brand coalition was down slightly in the quarter, were up slightly on a currency neutral basis due to as we've already discussed category and channel challenges. Where we control the brand ourselves, in other words in our own D2C businesses, we did see a double-digit currency neutral revenue increase. Our data shows that we're not only maintaining, but also gaining market share from our competitors in a pressured category.","Now, I\u2019ll pass it to Scott to discuss our Imagewear business.","Scott Baxter","Thanks Steve. Our Imagewear coalition posted revenue growth of 4% in the fourth quarter, up 5% currency neutral, consistently solid top and bottom line growth from our Imagewear group all year long. Both our workwear and Licensed Sports Group businesses contributed to the growth. Our workwear business was driven by new product introductions at Red Kap and Bulwark, for example the iQ product at Bulwark as well as strength in the core business. LSG saw double-digit gains in the quarter from its MLB business due to strong postseason sales.","And now, onto the Jeanswear business.","Fourth quarter global revenues for the Jeanswear coalition were up 3% or up 5% on a currency neutral basis. For the full year 2014 global Jeanswear revenues were flat at $ 2.8 billion on a currency neutral basis. Revenues were up 1%. In the Americas region, revenues were up at a similar rate as the global results and were driven by particular strength from the Wrangler brand and its Western Specialty business. Revenues for the Wrangler in the fourth quarter were up at a low single-digit rate or up at a mid single-digit rate currency neutral.","Customers have responded very well to our recent new product introductions including the Advanced Comfort in Heavenly Touch lines as well as our no iron khaki pants. Our Western specialty business had a very strong quarter with revenues up 13% driven by strong holiday sales in Western retail and mid tier accounts as well as the successful launch of men's Rock 47 jeans targeting fashion conscious Western consumers. We have also elevated the brand with our expansion into the mid tier department store channel and are planning to add more doors in 2015.","Our marketing campaigns during the quarter were a big success including great response to our TV and print strategies. We launched a premium performance of Vans Comfort campaign featuring rodeo champion Trevor Brazile at the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo Competition in December, where Trevor won his 12th All Around World Championship. On the digital front, the Wrangler Network App had its best quarter yet with fans connecting with the Western lifestyle wherever they are.","During the fourth quarter, revenues for the Lee Brand were up slightly. A result we're pleased with given ongoing channel and category challenges. We continue to see success with our Modern Series products and expect this momentum to build in 2015. We are also working to reinvent some of our more traditional products such as our core and premium select men's jeans and are excited to bring new finishes to the marketplace in 2015. Department store expansion also continued during the quarter and will continue well into 2015. ","In 2015 we expect low single-digit growth for our Jeanswear coalition on both a reported and currency neutral basis and while it's clear that we'll continue to face difficult conditions in our Americas business, particularly in the U.S. mid tier and department store channel, we believe that we are weathering the storm well. Authentic and trend right product along with an intense focus on making sure our demand creation is industry-leading, puts us in a great position to win in 2015. Karl Heinz?","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Our international Jeanswear business which is about a quarter of the coalition's global revenues was up 9% on a currency neutral basis in the fourth quarter. By region, European revenues for Jeanswear were up 10% currency neutral and in Asia revenues were up at high single-digit rate on a currency neutral basis.","Our international Wrangler business was up at mid single-digit rate on a currency neutral basis in the fourth quarter. Innovative products continued to lead the way including great response in Europe from our denim performance programs and outerwear category supported by the latest campaign featuring Formula One Champion, Kimi Raikkonen. In Asia, the largest growth driver was also denim performance which was up 26% over last year including a standout performance from our Silver Shield antibacterial denim product.","Lee's international revenues were up at low double-digit rate in the quarter with strong growth in both Europe and Asia, particularly in the U.K., Scandinavia and China. In Europe Lee's 125th anniversary collection featuring guest designers is generating a tremendous buzz around the brand with all of our key accounts showing double-digit gains. In Asia, we also saw really strong performance from our 125th anniversary product along which strong sell through of our 101+ collection, great testament to the work we have been doing in the brand and the strong products that we are producing that resonate well with consumers. In summary, we're making great progress in our global Jeanswear business.","Eric Wiseman","And with that we concluded our prepared remarks and we're about to turn it over to the operator to open the line for question, but before I do that, I just want to share with you all that as Bob Shearer and I have discussed his departure from our company over the last six months, the one thing he said he is going to miss most is taking your questions. So I would ask you to load up and direct a lot of questions to Bob because it will just make his day.","Operator, we'll take questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first from Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti","Hey guys, good morning. Congrats on a great quarter.","Eric Wiseman","Thanks Michael.","Michael Binetti","And Bob, first of all, it has obviously been a great pleasure working with you all these years.","Bob Shearer","Thanks so much Michael.","Michael Binetti","Regarding the comments on gross margin, you guys obviously went into it a bit in the prepared remarks, but you're going to be 30 basis points shy of your 2017 target. I know you don\u2019t want to update your guidance with us here during Q&A, but maybe just a few thoughts on how you think about that after you pulled forward that expansion in your five-year window and I don't think you want us to assume that the gross margins flatten out in our models here quickly after that?","Bob Shearer","Yeah, Michael, you didn\u2019t have to take Eric seriously on that.","Eric Wiseman","Thank you, Michael. ","Bob Shearer","Yeah, Michael, the way to think about this going forward is pretty much what we've seen. You know, as I said in the comments that we just don't see any change in terms of that mix benefit being any different going forward. So that 60 or 70 basis points of benefit that we've seen from mix consistently year-after-year over the past number of years, we'd expect to see that kind of expansion going forward as well. So you know, barring any other unforeseen changes in product costs or pricing or something like that which we wouldn\u2019t expect at this point you know, we expect to see that continued expansion pretty much related to the mix just like we've been seeing.","Michael Binetti","Okay, and then maybe a followup if you could tells us a little bit about the backlogs for the big brands as we think about the organic revenue growth here and it looks like you expect it to accelerate a little bit in a tough global macro here? And maybe also your long-term guidance, I know it includes a little bit of SG&A deleverage [every year] [ph] is probably related towards the shift, towards more retail, but I think you've said most of the SG&A in 2014 was due to an accounting change. So as you lap that maybe there could be a little more room to step up marketing to drive the top line in 2015 or maybe just a few thoughts on marketing spend year-over-year? Thanks.","Bob Shearer","So, Michael, your question is mostly around what we see in terms of SG&A going forward, is that\u2026?","Michael Binetti","Well, I'm trying to figure out what you\u2019re seeing maybe in the backlogs to help the organic revenue growth rate accelerate into 2015, it's a tough world and then as a corollary may be there is some incremental marketing spend that helps drive that if you're comfortable with it?","Bob Shearer","Well I'll speak to that, I can speak to the marketing spend and what's planned. You know, we are looking obviously for another increase and as we said, what we've been really, really successful in doing in the SG&A area is we've been able to spend against DTC and as you know, that would naturally lift our SG&A ratio. We've also been spending more particularly in the dollar side and you also know that we've incrementally been increasing our marketing spend as a percent of revenue as well.","So, as we look at 2015 yeah, we expect to spend another $50 million or so against marketing. We'll keep the ratio relatively flat, just around the 6% mark, maybe just a little below the 6% mark. So it will give us some additional dollars and we have been spending those additional dollars and all the analysis that we've done and the analytics say that we've been getting a great payback from that and it is giving us that momentum that you mentioned. Anything more from that?","Eric Wiseman","Yes, so Michael, I will add a little bit on our big brands. We stopped giving really information or guidance on our backlogs a few quarters ago. What I can tell you is, is the backlog information that we have to-date is baked into our guidance for '15. But as we think about how to drive additional organic growth, I would tell you two things and you referenced marketing.","I think we continue to get better and better as marketers of these brands as we become more and more knowledgeable of our consumers and I think the TV campaign that The North Face put out this fall, This Land is Your Land, what you see the Vans do with events to the in-store experience that we're bringing across to all of these big brands really helps drive awareness and builds that loyalty. But I think probably one of the largest factors that we feel really strong about is our improving digital capability and what we're able to do online through communicating, but also transacting through our expanding VF e-commerce platform and all of these big brands have access and are growing in that capability.","Michael Binetti","Thanks a lot guys.","Eric Wiseman","Thanks Michael.","Operator","We'll go next to Bob Drbul with Nomura.","Bob Drbul","Hi, Good morning.","Eric Wiseman","Good morning Bob.","Bob Drbul","Bob Shearer, congratulations, best of luck.","Bob Shearer","Thank you, Bob.","Bob Drbul","Yes thank you for being my friend.","Bob Shearer","That's good.","Bob Drbul","Great job.","Bob Shearer","Thank you very much. Thank you","Bob Drbul","I guess this following Eric's lead on the questions Bob, can you talk a little bit about the expenses in Europe and sort of the European headquarters, you know sort of how that shrank through the P&L and how we should think about your positioning maybe in Switzerland specifically?","Bob Shearer","Yeah Bob, so back to some of the comments on currency, just to reiterate, you know, nearly all of the currency impact that we're talking about is related to translation, you know, which we don't hedge. We do hedge the transactional side and it's very seldom that you ever hear us talking about the transactional side and that's because we have a really effective and efficient hedging program that covers those risks.","To your point relative to the Swiss franc that was one that we kind of couldn't see coming, you know, which had always been pegged to the euro and so the change, the move by the Swiss government you know, caught us with some increase in our reported expenses. So what happens is the Swiss franc strengthened actually. We had to record higher dollars as expenses. So it\u2019s just an expense item, not revenues, just expenses went up just because of that move. And that's pretty much what we were talking about on the transactional side. It's almost all related to that. ","Now, you know, going forward and related to our headquarters in Switzerland we don't see that changing at all. Now we\u2019ll see what happens with the Swiss franc, but you know in terms of any operational changes or anything like that we wouldn\u2019t contemplate any changes.","Bob Drbul","Great, thanks. And just a question on Timberland, how much of the success has been the yellow boot and sort of how broad has the business really increased throughout the world?","Steve Rendle","Yeah, Bob, I'll take that. This is Steve. Certainly the yellow boot has played a part in Timberland's growth, but it is a high single-digit contributor from a revenue standpoint. It is not the primary driver. Our growth has been balanced across all categories, both footwear and apparel across wholesale and DTC, across men's and women's and really balanced across all of our regions. So, you know the boot though important really just informs the best then better now mentality that Timberland is putting against this brand as they expand the reach and accessibility of this brand. ","Bob Drbul","Thank you very much. Good luck.","Steve Rendle","Thanks Bob.","Operator","We'll go next to Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad","Thanks, good morning. Great job on the quarter guys. Bob, congratulation on a great career and thanks for all your help over the years.","Bob Shearer","Thank you, Omar.","Omar Saad","I wanted to ask another question on FX and Bob, you did a great job helping us understand the transactional impact on you guys hedge it, but how long are those hedges and how should we think about what happens to those dollar-denominated costs, whether it's on the SG&A side or on the cost of goods side, when those hedges roll off and I don\u2019t know six, nine, 12 months. Just kind of help me understand how the gross margin might look in '16?","Bob Shearer","You know, so what we do is our hedging actually covers us for 12 to 18-month period. So we go fairly long on that. Now over time you know, however, over a longer period of time, we have to look at leverage points for us like pricing. You know, so if currency rates stay where they are today you we'll look at pricing our goods to offset those I\u2019ll call them cost increases. So you know, we do have those that kind of flexibility, but that\u2019s a longer-term view.","So, we take a fairly long approach in terms of our hedging practices. So it covers us exactly to your point over the next 12 to 18 months and then on a longer-term basis we look at pricing. You know, for example to [hold] [ph] our margins improve. So over the longer-term if you look back over time that's worked really, really well for us. You know, what it gives us is certainty for the upcoming year and then it gives us the ability to make pricing adjustments over a longer period of time to hold and continue to grow our margins.","Omar Saad","Thanks, it's super helpful and then Eric, a question for you. You know that VF is always kind of looking for other brands to acquire and with the news around right after they are in Splendid, 7 and Ella Moss, may be you can take the opportunity to talk about kind of some of the learnings from those acquisitions and how it pertains to how you think about future brands that you may acquire?","Eric Wiseman","Sure, you are right. We are an acquisition minded company and we are probably as frustrated as those of you who want us to make acquisitions. We're probably as frustrated as you are about our lack of getting anything done recently. However, we remain very disciplined and when we find the right opportunity to make strategic and value creation sense for us we are in a great position to pull the trigger and go. We have a lot of capacity to acquire.","One of the things, that we do a postmortem on a decades worth of acquisitions every year with our Board of Directors. We review everything we've acquired in the last 10 years and look at their performance and there's always ups and downs. The truth is about what happened with these contemporary businesses is the impairment charge we took was mostly a reflection of the difference between our current assumptions and the assumptions that we made when we acquired and purchased these businesses.","We bought 7 For All Mankind in the summer of 2007 and our outlook for it didn't anticipate a lot of the environment that we've seen since then. That means we're standing today not where we thought we'd be and that's resulted in the accounting charge. It doesn't mean we're not committed to that space. We talked about our overall strategy is mainly needs of apparel shoppers whenever and wherever they shop. There is an important segment that shops in the contemporary space worldwide and we have great brands to meet their needs. We do expect as Bob said in his comments I think, from the standpoint growth and profitability improvement in those businesses.","Omar Saad","Does the strong dollar at all make the potential for maybe European acquisition look a little bit more attractive with the dollar up so much against the euro?","Eric Wiseman","Of course, yes it does.","Omar Saad","Thanks guys.","Bob Shearer","Thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to Kate McShane with Citi Research.","Kate McShane","Thanks, good morning.","Eric Wiseman","Hi Kate.","Bob Shearer","Hi Kate.","Kate McShane","Just following up on the question on the acquisition side Eric, you had mentioned that a little bit frustrating getting something done. Could you elaborate on that all, is it more to do with willing sellers, is it valuation, is it the competition for assets in the market?","Eric Wiseman","We are, there's a series of things going on there. We have certainly been involved in discussions with companies as we always have been. If I look back over the last 15 years that I've been involved in that process we always have a bunch of businesses that we're actively engaged in, but we can never anticipate when those discussions will result in an acquisition, using Timberland as is a great example. We were in discussion with them for decades and finally found the right moment for that one to activate.","We have very clear internally, we know where we are hunting. We've talked externally that it's primarily in the Outdoor and Action Sports base. I said primarily not exclusively. To the last question, yeah international is looking more and more attractive to us because of the strength of the U.S. dollar and we're continuing to have discussions with people. We just don't have anything we can talk about today.","Kate McShane","Okay, that's helpful, thank you. And maybe if I could ask a question about denim, on denim with the lower gas prices, are you seeing any positive impact from that and how should we think about the cadence of denim growth and is that some of your innovation initiative this year?","Scott Baxter","Hey Kate, this is Scott. How are you?","Kate McShane","Good, thank you.","Scott Baxter","Well, you asked about the gas prices and absolutely when you see gas prices contract like they have in the economy, that is absolutely helpful for us, especially when you think about the channels that we traded mid tier and mass that frees up a lot of income for the folks that are in those channels. And we have really big franchises with our Lee and Wrangler brand in those channels.","So, we saw some really nice momentum in both our Wrangler and our Lee brands in the fourth quarter, that's carried over here after the first of the year and it's not just the gas, I think there's a little bit of confidence that's going on in addition to the gas and also there's a little bit of a job recovery that's going on. So all those factors combined have really helped our business and we've seen some momentum and we're pretty happy with it.","And I think if you just couple that Kate, with the fact that our new products are really working, so we've had a series of new product introductions and some really innovative ones whether it's Advanced Comfort or No Iron Khaki or an Easy Fit or a Comfort Fit in the mid tier channel, those things have really worked and that's really helped us. So the consumer that's coming in that has a little bit more income right now, they're seeing some new products. They really like the new products like a Heavenly Touch and they are purchasing those new products. So it's been a nice combination for us here in the last five, six months.","Kate McShane","Okay, thank you and if I can just squeak out my congratulations to Bob as well and thank you for all the help. Thank you.","Bob Shearer","Thank you, Kate.","Operator","We'll go next to Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie.","Laurent Vasilescu","Congrats on a strong finish to the year. I believe during the 2013 Investor Day it was noted that the international gross margin was 700 bps higher than the overall company gross margin. I was curious to know where it stands today, what is the potential FX impact to the 700 basis points relative for 2015 and are you raising prices in Europe to offset U.S. COGS?","Bob Shearer","Yeah, the international gross margins are similarly as strong as they were if not little bit stronger. You know, one of the things we're seeing in 2015, what happens is from a gross margin standpoint, is as we translate our international currencies into dollars and results in fewer dollars it's a little bit more of a mix impact than anything else. So what we're not seeing, we're not seeing any decline on a euro basis for example in our gross margin rates. What we're seeing overall for VF Corporation is we have fewer converted dollars, translated dollars right, which impacts the overall mix. So our margins, our profitability on our international businesses is quite strongly.","We made the point in the past that the ratio of our overall revenues to international in our earnings contribution from international is very, very strong. It's the highest within the company. So again, it's a little bit more of a mix issue than anything else and not a rate issue. So I'm glad you asked the question because we want to make sure that that's really clear. That's where our hedging programs really help protect us against gross margin rates on a euro basis for example.","Laurent Vasilescu","Okay great and then on Timberland, Timberland Americas continues to be reporting very strong numbers, up 25%, last quarter was 22%. I was curious to know how we should think about the guide of 14% growth in the Americas? And then I think during the Investor Day it was noted that the operating margin at that point was around projected to be 13% for 2014.","I was hoping to know how that pended down, how we should we think about the long term guide on the operating margin?","Eric Wiseman","I\u2019ll take this question for you Laurent. So how should you think about the long term growth rate, we've have guided on a global basis up low teens. That certainly would hold true with our Americas businesses and we see it to be very balanced. Wholesale been a significant driver as the brand is really focused on placing the right products in the right channels segmenting the product and allocating their product and supporting that with really, really strong marketing.","Our D2C business will continue to grow. We are now at a place where we are comfortable opening new stores as we've right sized our model and we'll look to start building up full price to really balance out with our current outlook mix and then Timberland will be coming on the VF e-commerce platform here in the United States in the second quarter and we are looking for accelerated growth in the back half based on that enhanced content and commerce capability.","Operating margin, Bob will go ahead and take you there.","Bob Shearer","Sure, on the operating margin, you've obviously seen and we talked about it in our comments as well that our operating margins in Outdoor & Action Sports continues to expand. And while most of our businesses are growing particularly gross margins as well as operating margins on the Timberland component of that is a big factor.","We said earlier in the acquisition that we saw that as a significant opportunity at the time of the acquisition operating margins were in the 8% or 9% range and that's improved dramatically over time and we're just continuing to improve. So we're getting back close to that 20% operating margin that we enjoyed prior to the Timberland acquisition and we're moving back closer and closer to that. And we will continue see expansion in the operating margin at Timberland.","Laurent Vasilescu","Okay great, best of luck.","Bob Shearer","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robby Ohmes","Oh, thanks and Bob you will be missed and best of luck to what you do next.","Bob Shearer","Thanks very much Robby.","Robby Ohmes","Just a few followup questions, the first one I was wondering if you could give us any color on how the sort of followup, how the outlet store business is relative to full line, some others that have commented have seen more difficult outlet business? And then second question would just be, I think sports were, I think you guys in the release kind of highlighted the challenging U.S. department store channel, was that primarily Nautica or was that across brands and sort of how do you think about that channel for 2015? And then the third one and I'm sorry if I missed it, but did you guys comment on Lucy and if not sort of an update on how that brand is doing? Thanks.","Eric Wiseman","Do you want to start with the department store?","Steve Rendle","I\u2019ll take the Sportswear and Lucy question Robby and then we will catch you on the outlets on the back side. So the comment you saw on Sportsware related to the department store was primarily Nautica. They are most heavily penetrated in that channel. And certainly we compete for our consumers in that space and some of that sits on us with a better and better product that we put into that product and how we are able to represent that. But I think it has been pretty well documented that that channel through this year has seen some opportunities for improvement and we certainly worked very diligently with our partners to help drive our brands through those channels of distribution.","Our Lucy business, we could not be more proud of and excited. We have seen really consistent growth. We expect that business to grow in the mid single-digits coming into this year with more than 20% growth in our whole sale business and that is coming with our relationship that started with Dick's Sporting Goods at the end of '13. We're now in 365 Dick's Sporting Goods stores in the Women's performance or studio area and have seen really good growth as our team learns how to operate with a large dynamic retailer such as Dick's Sporting Goods.","We're seeing improvements in our own stores as we look to really improve our traffic in conversion through really growing awareness within those markets where we have stores. So, Lucy continues to get better and better and we think this push into the wholesales channel is certainly helping it gain more and more traction.","Robby Ohmes","Yeah, sorry, just the Outlets versus sole line and any color you can give us across your brands?","Scott Baxter","So Robby, I\u2019ll make a couple of quick comments. This is Scott on the VF Outlet stores. As you know, we have roughly 80 of those stores and we have seen some nice momentum in the fourth quarter moving into the first quarter from an outlet standpoint. That channel was very vibrant. The shoppers were actually moving to that channel and have really seen that there is value in that channel for our brands and value for the consumer there. So we've seen some momentum. It's carried forward this year and we are really happy and pleased with where our business is positioned there right.","Eric Wiseman","Robby it's Eric. I'm going to try to peal this back a little bit about the outdoor and full price. It's a complicated question because we have outlet and full price stores around the world. In the United States, most of our business other than the VFO business that Scott referred to is full price retail.","We certainly do have outlets stores, but most of our brands use them as a place to manage their distressed inventory. The exceptions to that actually are Nautica and Kipling both of which have primarily outlet store businesses and they are working really hard to make those stores, Nautica no full price stores. I am going to guess that 80% of the Timberland stores are outlet versus full price. So, their whole business model is making the outlet model work for them. They don\u2019t have a full price comparison. Where we have full price stores, which is primarily around our Vans and The North Face brands we have really strong full price business. We bring our very best stuff to those stores and that is where we see those as our way to develop the digital economy channel strategy.","We want to go into cities and have people be able to come into a Vans as a North Face store and really see everything that is true about the brand. Europe in general is a full price retail store market for us. We do have some outlet stores there, but they are almost exclusively for excess inventory sell off. So it\u2019s a different strategy than some people use for their outlet stores. Did that help you?","Robby Ohmes","That does. That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks Eric.","Eric Wiseman","Okay Robby.","Operator","We'll go next to Matthew Boss with JPMorgan ","Matthew Boss","Good morning guys. Eric, can you talk about the global consumer backdrop? I guess specifically have you seen any fundamental trend change at all in Europe and just promotional levels post holiday, how you are thinking about things?","Eric Wiseman","Yes. I am actually going to ask Karl Heinz to speak about the Europe consumer and what we're seeing with our brands. He spends more time there than as I do. It's home.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","I do spend more time, at the moment I'm here in the U.S. so I think Matthew there is a lot going on in Europe as you related. So I really reported that in the press from an economically point of view and political which I am not touching.","Having said that, it's not really helping consumer sentiment and making consumer spend, but having said that, as you heard from the release we do pretty well, and we see some come back from consumers surprisingly and especially from the southern European part, you know where we see our orders coming in pretty nicely and strong. So, all in all we are pretty positive about the performance of Europe and the outcome for the year, so which we expect as we said to be up. So, all in all I guess it\u2019s a better picture than last year.","Matthew Boss","Great. And then just any disruption that you've seen so far from the West Coast port strikes? And Eric I guess more importantly, just how this process works in terms of late orders kind of who is on the hook between the vender and wholesale partners, just any color you can provide?","Eric Wiseman","As a backdrop the West Coast port situation really began last summer. Our team has been navigating through that incredibly effectively, so much so that we haven\u2019t had any material misdeliveries or incremental costs. Have we had some misdelieveries? Yes. Have we had some incremental costs? Yes, but nothing that we need to call out anybody's attention.","We have diverted stuff to other ports. We've moved part of our truck fleet out there to get our through the docks and off the platforms. There's a lot of things we've done that just haven\u2019t been material enough to talk about. But it is a complicated situation. If it does go to a full on strike and shutdown it will be material to everybody. Now the question is, how material and the answer to that is, you tell me how long the strike will be and I\u2019ll tell you how material. If it is one weekend, if it's one weekend we'll get through it. If it's three months, well I don\u2019t think that's even possible for it to be three months. It would be really important. Most of the cost associated with that sit with us. If our orders are late getting to customers, customers don\u2019t have to take them so. That\u2019s we bear the risk, but I would tell we've had that risk now for eight months and we have managed it really, really well. Is that helpful?","Matthew Boss","Yes. That\u2019s very helpful. Congrats on a great quarter and Bob, sorry to see you go.","Bob Shearer","Yeah, thanks a lot, Matt.","Operator","We are going next to Jim Duffy with Stifel.","Jim Duffy","Good morning everyone. Hope you are all well. Bob, a sincere thanks for all your time and help over the years. Let's appreciate it.","Bob Shearer","Thank you.","Jim Duffy","My retirement gift I am going to direct my question to you colleagues.","Unidentified Company Representative","I'm sorry Jim, we can't hear you, you're breaking up.","Jim Duffy","Couple of questions, one on Vans and then a question for Karl Heinz on the outside category in Europe. The Vans growth has been phenomenal, domestic in particular. As you look to build on this, can I ask that you elaborate on some of the specific drivers and geographies to watch for looking into 2015 with the Vans brand? Help that will be appreciated thanks.","Eric Wiseman","Sure, I'll go and start that Jim and Cage can beat in for what's going on internationally. I think what we see currently driving Vans growth and what we see continuing to drive Vans growth is really broad based against all the tools that they have from a product standpoint just continuing to be the expert in the pool where category is specific to their consumer, bringing weatherized footwear this last year really showed us the opportunity to expand our offering to four seasons across the year and being able to complement that with apparel and accessories.","So, continued just dialed focus on the appropriate products on a year around basis in footwear and apparel. Really the partnerships that we have in wholesale here in the North America business are second to none in how our teams work with our partners to bring our brands to life and assort this expanded set of products. How we are able to bring to life in our own stores to really set that experiential tone for our consumers is a great strength and we've been very systematic in how our retail footprint has expanded geographically throughout the United States into Canada and most recently into Mexico.","And then you just think about our ability to connect digitally with our consumer. Vans is our most powerful social and digital brand and has been a big part of helping bring our VF e-commerce platform to life and how they use that to not only communicate and connect, but also transact will be another powerful tool that they have to drive growth.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Yes Jim and may be starting with Asia the outdoor market, you heard us saying we did pretty well in our up double digit both on the North Face and Timberland. So I would say that market is good. We had a few issues. There were some issues in China may be two years ago with the inventories, but that has sorted out.","So that is pretty healthy market. Europe is a little bit more complicated. It\u2019s a very fragmented market as you know, many brands don\u2019t do well, some do okay. We have been consistent growth in the past. We have growth rates now where we're not really happy about, but we are confident we can improve our growth rate especially in the North Face in the future.","There is a lot going on. You heard us saying with product innovation we have great market, go-to-market strategies. We show, we just did a show, actually the largest show in the Sporting Goods in Munich last weekend. There was a lot of noise and excitement about the North Face with our new approach we're doing better storytelling, a lot of product innovation. So going forward, I think even in a complicated market we are pretty confident.","Jim Duffy","And Karl Heinz, the challenges in Europe for the category, is that a weather dynamic or are there larger issues in that?","Karl Heinz Salzburger","I would say both. The weather was so-so. You heard that it was widely in the press. We had no winter up to December. We got I think some snow in January, so it is normalizing now, but the last two years were not so good from a weather point of view. Plus the economy, I think it's widely in press. There is a lot of noise going on in Europe at the moment, so that is not helping. But it can't be an excuse and we have to react and we are reacting and our product innovation is a strong answer to stimulate consumption. And you know, probably better and more digitalized approach and storytelling, which to make consumers spend on our brands.","Jim Duffy","Very good, thank you.","Eric Wiseman","Thank you.","Operator","We are going next to Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray","Erinn Murphy","Great, thanks good morning and thank you for sneaking me in Bob and I wish you all the best on you future endeavors.","Bob Shearer","Thanks so much, Erinn.","Erinn Murphy","May be you guys could talk a little bit more about the three innovation centers that you are developing. When is the first time that we should start to see some of the benefit across the various product lines? And then just secondly, a quick follow up for Karl Heinz in Europe. Can you just speak to any volatility that you are seeing from a tourist world perspective into the region? Thank you ","Eric Wiseman","Yeah, so Erinn, I\u2019ll start and then Scott can jump in. We are standing up three innovation centers this year. You have certainly heard and seen us right about this. From a technical apparel and footwear standpoint those teams are in place and we are adding capabilities as we speak. And the pipeline that they are working on with the brand has in many ways already been in motion over the last 12 to 18 months and you see some small things coming into the product mix like the FuseForm is an area where we are bringing that capability to life near term. But it really is a longer term play as we add this skill and capability to complement our business teams it will about 12 to 18-month push till you see some of the real new ideas that have been percolating this team is able to work on.","Scott Baxter","So, just a few quick comments on the Jeanswear innovation center. We hired a leader last year and we have taken some time and really worked with the outdoor and the foot work group and we have cohesive strategy now between the three centers that will be working real closely together going forward because we want to share ideas, we want to share innovations and we want to go ahead and work together on platforms. And our leader has gotten us to the point where we've hired some folks and we have a few more to go, but we've really focused on capabilities that are important for us going forward to ensure our success.","So getting the right people in place has been the key thing for us in the Jeanswear innovation center and I would say we are about 50% of the way there and we should be finalized here by early spring as far as having our key senior team all in place. We move into a physical location here this spring and then we are going to work on short term stuff to get the momentum going as we get in there. And that is just taking some ideation stuff that is actually happening right now within our Jeanswear group and having that team that is really capable working with those two groups to help them bring that to the goal line a little faster. And then that team will come into a cadence and they will start working on things that are a little bit more long term.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","And on the last question, I would try to answer it, it is I'm not sure I can, but so much happened just in the last 30 days with all the currency, the euro, the Swiss franc, the dollar, the Ruble, and pound, so it's really to say what is going to happen for sure. I mean it has, the country has become cheaper for you. So you are welcome to come to Europe and spend you money. You got to take your weight. So, I guess I would say it's early to say what's going to happen.","Scott Baxter","And I'd like to build, I'd be remiss if our Timberland teams are listening. When we acquired timberland they came with an innovation capability and it in fact it's that capability that we are adding to in products like our Anti-Fatigue footwear that you see across our PRO and tree business. The Sensorflex that we've spoken about this last year, those are technologies have come out of that teams, skill and capability and that is exactly what we are building behind and building so all of our footwear businesses are able to tap into that skill.","Erinn Murphy","Great, thank you guys and best of luck.","Scott Baxter","Thanks Erinn.","Operator","We'll go next to Mitch Kummetz with Robert Baird.","Mitch Kummetz","Yeah, thanks. Bob congrats and good luck. I've got a question for you if you don\u2019t want to answer you can always give it to Scott. So, how should we think about kind of quarterly gains of gross margin expansion this year? From you remarks it sounds like may be the cost outlook is a little better in the back half particularly on denim. But if I recall correctly, I think Jeanswear has got a pretty easy Q2 compare. So how should we think about that 40 bips over the course of the year?","Scott Baxter","Yeah, so Mitch, it has a lot to do with currency moves. So our bigger quarters for international businesses or our first and third quarters. So those will be the tougher comparisons when it comes to gross margin expansion. So, in other words the second and fourth quarters and that is where we will see the biggest gross margin expansion for the year.","Again as I said earlier, that is mostly because of mix. Our international businesses are the profitability including the gross margin rates are really strong and when there is fewer dollars a very strong gross margins it just impacts the overall gross margin rates. So, it is not a rate within the international side of business. It is really a mix overall for VF.","Mitch Kummetz","And just a quick followup on Vans in Asia Pac it looks like a 40% plus this year, still growing after a relatively small base. Talk about kind of the outlook for that business in 2015 and can we expect to see continued sort of momentum of that magnitude going forward?","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Mitch, I\u2019ll try to answer here. As you said, correctly we had really great numbers in the last quarters in Asia 40% to 50%. We just reported 50%. For sure we have great momentum. Going forward we see the advantage is really strong, it connects well with consumers. There is a lot of storytelling. So, we are pretty confident the momentum will continue. Will it be always 40% to 50% that is probably hard, but we are confident and we will look forward to very nice growth rates in the next quarters and hopefully years to come in Asia.","Mitch Kummetz","Okay, all right, thanks guys.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Thanks Mitch.","Operator","Due to time constrains, we'll take our final question from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Great, thanks for taking the questions. So starting with the first one, Bob it was really helpful all of the detail on currency and costs. I was hoping that if we would assess forward to when your hedges and forward purchases roll off and we're just sort of marking to market, whether you could dementionalize how much the foreign currency transactional pressure on you cost of goods would be relative to the cost savings that you are likely to see from lower cotton and may be some lower energy prices in your factory, whether one is much bigger than the other or they are neutral or how we should we think about that? And on that topic also whether you will be able to divert some of your sourcing to non-U.S. dollar dominated factories to help sort of offset the pressure?","Bob Shearer","Yeah, on the gross margin side as we talked about earlier, the puts and takes from material cost standpoint and labor all inclusive kind of nets out with pricing. So, that\u2019s true whether it is in the U.S. also on the international side as well. Again it's just really important that our rates, our gross margin rates on the international front are holding and actually growing somewhat in our international businesses just the conversion of this in the U.S. dollars that are impacting us overall and even the gross margin rate.","So, the commentary holds true that we talked about earlier relative to the inflict costs related to the international side as well as the U.S. side and that\u2019s because of hedging. So, we lock in those costs in essence over that 12 to 18-month period, we know what those costs are going to be, we lock it into our currency hedges and we don\u2019t get surprised.","Scott Baxter","In terms of changing relative to the dollars, not so likely. Frankly, given where we are again we will continue to hedge and our hedging practices will offset that. I think the question is more about if the rates stay where they are, what kind of actions do we take relative to our international business and again we discussed that earlier as well, but we'll have to look at pricing and some other levers, but that is a discussion relatively more to 2016 than 2015.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Great. And just a quick follow on, I was hoping you guys could talk a little bit about you strategy and accessories. There's been a really high quality category and you had some great momentum with Napapijri and Kipling. Can you may be just expand a little bit on what your plan is for accessories as a broad product category across your portfolio?","Scott Baxter","Yeah, Lindsay thanks for the question. What we are doing right now is, we are focused on the accessories businesses we have. We think Kipling is an enormous growth opportunity for our company and to put some context around that, it was less than $70 million business when we brought it and it is bigger than the $300 million business today and VF's fastest growing business in 2013 and '14 and it is planned to be our fastest going business this year because we have very capable people working on that business and we are investing in them disproportionally. Beyond that, we don\u2019t have any other big strategy to announce. We are focused on anything that strategy continue to work for us and Bob Shearer would add it\u2019s a very profitable business for us as well.","Lindsay Drucker Mann","Great, thanks so much.","Eric Wiseman","All right, thanks everybody. I'm sorry that we have to cut this call off. I know there were a few of you still waiting with questions. Several others have media interviews that begin in 60 seconds, so we need to run from this room and go handle those. I appreciate your interest in our company and your support. Thanks, bye-bye.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation."],"21642":["V.F.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Jean Fontana. Please go ahead.","Jean Fontana","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for VF Corporation's Second Quarter 2012 Conference Call. By now, you should have received today's earnings press release. If not, please call (203) 682-8200, and we'll send you a copy immediately following the call. Hosting today's call is Eric Wiseman, Chairman and CEO of VF Corp.","Before we begin, I would like to remind participants that certain statements included in today's remarks and the Q&A session may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements include management's current expectations, estimates and projections about business and results of operations and the industries in which VF operates. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements are discussed in the documents filed by the company in the SEC.","I would now like to turn the call over to Eric Wiseman.","Eric C. Wiseman","Thanks, Jean. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. With me today are Bob Shearer, our Chief Financial Officer; and our 3 group Presidents: Scott Baxter, Steve Rendle and Karl Heinz Salzburger.","If there's one message I'd like all of you to take away from today's call and release, it's this: VF is delivering. VF is delivering revenue growth. For the first half, we've grown organic revenues by 8% or 10% in constant dollars, and we remain very comfortable, holding to our guidance for 8% organic top line growth in constant dollars for the full year, given the current environment.","And VF is delivering international growth in the face of very well-publicized concerns about conditions in both Europe and more recently, China. In the first half of 2012, international organic revenue growth in constant dollars was 15%. So we're tracking right on plan with our goal of delivering 15% organic growth internationally in constant dollars this year.","Let me add a little bit more context here. In Europe, there is no doubt that conditions have weakened since last year, which is why we planned for lower growth this year. So how are we doing? In the first half, VF's European organic revenue growth in constant dollars was 14%. Since the beginning of the year, we've talked about low double-digit growth in Europe this year, and we're sticking to that plan today. Now we share everyone's concerns about conditions in Europe. And to be sure, we're seeing our share of both successes and challenges. But in total, VF is clearly benefiting from having a diversified portfolio of brands. We're continuing to monitor conditions there very carefully and are prepared to course-correct as needed should conditions change materially.","In terms of Asia, in the first half, organic revenues grew by 19% in constant dollars, and in China, we grew revenues by 25% on a constant dollar basis.","For the full year, we remain committed to growth of over 20% in Asia. Each of our major brands: Lee, The North Face, Timberland, Vans and Kipling is looking forward to strong double-digit growth despite overall slowing of the Chinese economy this year.","So how else is VF delivering? Last year, VF acquired The Timberland Company, the largest acquisition in our 113-year history. Today, we confirmed our expectation for $1.10 accretion in earnings per share from Timberland in 2012. I'm often asked, what surprised me, either positively or negatively, about Timberland in the 10 months since we acquired it, my answer is always the same. I've been really pleased with the depth of footwear product knowledge and innovation that resides within Timberland. I've been positively surprised by the amount of cost synergies we've identified, which points to more value creation for our shareholders in the future. And I've been positively surprised by and most appreciative of the ability of the people at Timberland and SmartWool to embrace change, a lot of change, and their commitment to achieving our shared vision for success.","Finally, I'd like to point out that VF is delivering -- well, actually, over-delivering on our earnings per share goals this year. In February, we established $9.30 per share as our target for EPS. In April, we raised that to $9.45, and today, we raised that again to $9.50.","What's the back story to this performance? In short, people, portfolio and platforms. We're proud of the great talent we have across our brands, with associates around the world committed to winning in any environment. We're clearly benefiting from our diversified portfolio of great brands that, particularly in times like these, help us manage risk while maximizing opportunities. And we're also clearly benefiting from well-established global platforms that allow us to leverage opportunities and share synergies across multiple brands.","We are thrilled with our strong performance year to date. We're also keenly aware of the many challenges posed by continuing slowdown in global economic conditions. We're scrutinizing costs across the board, and as you saw today, we're keeping inventories very tightly controlled. At the same time, challenging conditions offer great opportunities for strong companies with strong brands to invest and gain market share.","So we're continuing to invest in our highest growth, most profitable brands and businesses to support our top and bottom line momentum. In short, we believe we are exceptionally well positioned to navigate through these uncertain times and look forward to delivering another year of record results to our shareholders.","And with that, I would like to turn the call over to Steve Rendle, who'll review the second quarter performance of our top Outdoor & Action Sports brands. Steve?","Steven E. Rendle","Thank you, Eric. Second quarter global revenues for The North Face were up 14% or 16% on a constant dollar basis, including a 9% increase in the brand's DtoC business. We've seen solid sell-through of seasonal products across the majority of our regions and channels, and consistent with what we said 90 days ago, global fall order books for The North Face are up low-double digits against same period last year. In the Americas region, The North Face brand's second quarter revenues were up mid-teens, driven by strong spring and early fall wholesale shipments, new product introductions and in-store support at key accounts.","On our last call, I detailed the key growth strategies for The North Face in 2012, so I wanted to take a minute or 2 to highlight a few of these strategies in action. Job one is delivering the most innovative outdoor products in the industry, and we're hard at work doing just that. Following strong fall sell-in around 3 product initiatives: Flash Dry apparel, footwear created with our new cradle technology and the athlete-tested Meru Kit of outerwear and apparel, we're excited about the opportunities to amplify the brand's unique technology stories to better connect these products with consumers.","We've also begun to see measurable success around the brand's activity-based model, designed to extend the brand into areas complementary to its historically strong position in the outdoor industry. Within our own stores, our technical running apparel has been up 18% in the quarter, and our training yoga apparel was up 21% during the quarter, while mountain bike apparel continues to gain significant traction among both existing and new dealers and consumers. We're definitely just getting started, and we're very excited about what's in the pipeline.","At the heart of The North Face brand is our athlete-tested, expedition-proven, storytelling abilities that connect our brand more deeply with our consumers. This May, with live online and interactive updates, 6 North Face athletes successfully summited Mount Everest, generating 350 million impressions through social media and PR efforts. The National Geographic-sponsored expedition included working with on-mountain North Face product engineers and physicians from the Mayo Clinic to study the effects of the unique environment on the body and mind. These findings will be applied to future products, allowing us to push the boundaries of human performance even further in 2013 and beyond.","In our DtoC business, we launched the new The North Face iPhone and Android app, which gives consumers access to the latest product, news, blogs, expedition videos and a store locator to inspire and equip their next adventure. Additionally, we also added in-store inventory visibility, now available at thenorthface.com for all products.","To wrap up, looking at the second half of the year, with a strong global order book in front of us, driven by some of the most innovative product we've ever created, we're confident in our ability to deliver our full year goal of mid-teen constant dollar growth, approaching $2 billion in global sales.","To talk about The North Face's international business, here's Karl Heinz Salzburger.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Following very strong performance in the first quarter, The North Face international business continued its momentum in the second quarter, with mid-teen constant dollar growth in Europe and high-teen growth in Asia.","We are continuing to expand our DtoC presence in Europe, with the launch of new websites in Italy and Spain, bringing our total e-commerce presence to 8 countries and driving a 75% increase in online revenues. These sites, along with Ireland, Germany, Austria and The Netherlands, which I expect to go live in the second half of the year, position us well for the coming fall and winter seasons.","In the quarter, we opened our first store in Warsaw, which represents a great opportunity to expand the brand in Eastern Europe. Conditions on the wholesale side of the business are consistent with what we discussed in the first quarter, with retailers remaining cautious, committing to orders later than usual. The North Face continues to gain market share in Europe. We are confident that we are extremely well positioned to compete successfully even in today's difficult environment.","As in the U.S., we are using high-profile events to tell our brand story and engage consumers across each pillar of the brand's activity-based model. Examples include the famous Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc race where runners tackle a 166 kilometer route around Mont-Blanc, with over 9,600 meters of altitude gain. And in September, The North Face is sponsoring the Kalymnos Climbing Festival in Greece, where an estimated 700 to 800 climbers will participate alongside our athletes, the athletic types of events and experiences you'd expect from The North Face brand.","North Face in Asia also continues to see great momentum. During the quarter, we established a cross-functional digital team to implement a new e-commerce test in China this fall, expanding our DtoC reach. We are also focusing significant efforts around brand building to increase consumer awareness, a great example being a newly launched GO Outdoors video series, which, so far, has been viewed more than 12 million times online. Certainly, there's concern around slower economic trends in China, but great brands like The North Face have plenty of opportunities to continue to grow.","Now let's move on to Vans. Steve?","Steven E. Rendle","Last month, in New York, we held an investor day, highlighting Vans 2016 plan, which set the goal of adding $1 billion in revenues to our 2011 base of $1.2 billion. At the meeting, we ran through 4 key growth drivers: product innovation, consumer connectivity, DtoC growth and geographic expansion. The second quarter for Vans was a great example of each of these strategies in action.","Global revenues in the second quarter were up 25% or 29% excluding the impact of foreign currency. On the product front, on June 28, Vans launched a new footwear collection known as LXVI, which features several construction advantages that result in lightweight, flexible footwear, geared to the action sports enthusiast. The product, with prices starting at $70, launched globally at select footwear -- or Foot Locker locations, select specialty lifestyle retailers, select Vans retail stores and vans.com. And though it's only been 3 weeks, we're very encouraged with the early results.","Looking at the performance in the Americas region. Second quarter revenues were up at a low double-digit rate in constant dollars, driven by a balanced owned retail and wholesale growth. Our Americas DtoC business had a great quarter, with revenue growth of 15%, driven by strong results from our e-commerce business and owned stores. We added 7 new stores during the quarter, including our first in mid-Atlanta, a great example of building the brand outside the Western U.S., and initial reads are very positive.","From a consumer connectivity lens, with the 18th Vans Warped Tour 2\/3 of the way through, it's been another summer of connecting the brand through music, philanthropic efforts, social media and youth culture to interactively tell our story. The Warped Tour has been such a successful connection point that we're looking at ways to expand the event into Latin America and Europe as well, but more on that at a later date.","Now I'll pass it over to Karl Heinz, who will take us through some brief international highlights.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","In the second quarter, Vans continued its outstanding moment in Europe, more than doubling revenues on a constant dollar basis versus the same period of 2011 and grew revenues by more than 20% in Asia. In Europe, we continue to use the successes we have realized in the U.K. as a catalyst to drive momentum and brand awareness into existing and new markets around the region. All markets and categories were up significantly in the quarter, with exceptional strength in the northern and central Europe.","Now DtoC business. We opened 2 new retail stones in Rome and Warsaw, which showcase our new Vans retail concept. And very exciting for us is the simultaneous launch of 7 new e-commerce sites in the U.K, Germany, The Netherlands, France, Ireland, Austria and Sweden on July 16. It's important to note that this is the first time that Vans products are available directly from Vans in Europe, so this represents an excellent opportunity for us to enhance our ability to connect with our consumers through stories that are locally relevant to them and drive additional revenue growth.","Vans Asian business also posted great results in the second quarter. Of course, product is king, and so we are investing behind strengthening our regional product team. We're also excited about the test of a new retail store format in Shanghai. We have seen encouraging initial results. This global format adds a number of additional regional elements, which resonate well with local consumers.","Vans has also shown tremendous growth in a number of key distributor markets in Asia, most notably Australia, which further validates the regional growth opportunity we have in addition to the Chinese market. Clearly, our global strategy is working, and we're excited about our next chapter of growth. If you are unable to attend the Investors Day, I'd encourage you to check out vansisgrowth.com for a deeper dive into our 5-year strategy.","And now let's take a look at Timberland.","Steven E. Rendle","Global revenues for Timberland were up slightly on a constant dollar basis in the second quarter. In North America, revenues declined modestly as planned. Strategically, we remain focused on accelerating Timberland's product engine for maximum innovation, strengthening consumer connections, optimizing wholesale distribution and DtoC and growing business internationally. As we work to integrate the brand into VF organizationally, we're creating the necessary framework to enable better collaboration and communication while maintaining Timberland's strong global operating culture.","On the product front, we've made great strides in finalizing the Timberland apparel team and have begun constructing the infrastructure necessary to support next year's apparel launch. Simultaneously, we've activated an extensive consumer segmentation study to help us better understand the unique identity of the Timberland consumer. This will enable us to design and develop product that really resonates with the brand's global consumer. An example of this work is our spring 2012 Hookset footwear collection, built in accordance with Timberland's unique SPG formula, which stands for great style, performance and green.","Constructed from only 4 materials, all either organic or recycled, it is part of the growing Earthkeepers collection, the largest eco-conscious collection of footwear in the world. At the halfway point in the year, we're slightly ahead of our cost synergies target, driven by supply-chain leverage, inventory discipline and organizational initiatives designed to bring Timberland's cost structure into better alignment with our overall Outdoor & Action Sports portfolio. We remain tremendously excited about the global potential of this powerful brand, with much, much more to come.","Now I'll turn it over to Karl Heinz to take you through what's going on internationally with Timberland.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Revenues for Timberland's international business, consisting of Asia and Europe, was up 5% in constant dollars, driven by a mid-teen growth rate in Asia and a low single-digit increase in our European business. In Europe, we have seen great results from our very successful Earthkeepers line, building our women's business and accelerating our online selling across all countries.","And for the second half, we have planned to open 20 stores to our distributor network and 10 stores with our franchisees. Asia continues to experience stronger growth than the rest of the world, with positive results across all categories in men's and women's product. We are very pleased with the progress we have made with several markets, including China, where we are working to leverage with existing infrastructure.","We have also completed the successful move of our headquarters from Singapore to Hong Kong, integrating Timberland onto VF's Asian platform.","And with that, let's switch gears to the Wrangler brand.","Scott H. Baxter","Thanks, Karl Heinz. On a global basis, second quarter revenues for the Wrangler brand were down 1% or up 1% if you exclude the impact of foreign currency. The story here is one of timing. Recall that we had low double-digit constant dollar growth in the first quarter due to the shift of seasonal product from the second quarter due to the warm weather. That said, first half growth for Wrangler is right on track with our full year expectations.","In our Americas region, second quarter Wrangler revenues grew at a low mid-single digit rate in constant dollars, driven by strong performances in our Western Specialty and Latin America businesses, offset by a slight decline in our Mass Market business in the U.S. As you know, continuous product innovation has been the key driver of growth in our Jeanswear Americas business, and nowhere more so than our western businesses.","Here, we're happy to report that great momentum is building for our Wrangler 20X retro and premium performance Cowboy Cut styles, which continue to gain space. In terms of Wrangler's Mass Market business, results in the quarter reflect the seasonal shift in sales I referenced earlier. In fact, in the first half, revenues in our mass business rose 3%. Importantly, Wrangler continued to gain market share in the second quarter, driven by strong performance in both seasonal and denim products.","The Wrangler product innovation engine continues to deliver, with significant growth in men's tops and our Wrangler Five Star Premium denim line. We're positioned to win at retail this fall and winter with powerful in-store branding and an expanded floor space designed to showcase our product strength.","Outside the U.S. in the Americas region, Wrangler's Canadian business saw strong growth in its mass business, including strong comp store sales increases. And in Latin America, we're encouraged to see solid growth in Mexico, Argentina and Brazil, where the brand continues to gain traction.","In the Americas DtoC business, while still small, our e-commerce revenues grew by more than 70% in the second quarter, driven by the launch of a brand-new platform for wrangler.com. And with 60%-plus conversion rate, we're very pleased that the new online experience is resonating well with our loyal consumers.","Turning to Wrangler's international business. Karl Heinz?","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Wrangler's international business, consisting of Europe and Asia, was down 10% in constant dollars against last year's same period, reflecting the combination of continued growth in Asia, where the brand is relatively small, offset by a decline in Europe.","Our business in Europe remains difficult due to the macroeconomic environment, though, generally, we are performing in line with our peers. Positive performances, particularly in Russia, Turkey and Scandinavia, were not enough to offset challenging conditions in western and southern Europe.","Looking at the second half in Europe, we have action plans in place to stimulate sell-through and manage inventory relevant to market conditions.","And finally, let's take a look to Lee.","Scott H. Baxter","Thanks, Karl Heinz. Lee's business, on a global basis, was unusually challenging this quarter, with global revenues down 11% or 8% on a constant dollar basis.","In the U.S., following several quarters of strong growth, the brand is navigating through near-term difficulties created by changing dynamics in the mid-tier channel. In addition, Lee revenue comparisons reflect the shift of some seasonal products into the first quarter from the second.","So despite a double-digit revenue decline in the second quarter, Lee brand revenues in the U.S. are down only 4% in the first half. The good news is that Lee continues to gain share in both the men's and women's categories, and outperformed the jeans department averages of its key customers. Karl Heinz?","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Lee's international business, consisting of Europe and Asia, was up 15% in constant dollars, driven by strong momentum in Asia, where Lee is our largest brand and where revenues rose more than 50%, offset by a slight decline in sales in Europe.","Strength in Asia was due to ongoing investments to increase brand visibility, including a new marketing campaign in both China and India. We also focused on improving our distribution by optimizing store locations, including placing a greater emphasis on mall locations, which are taking share from traditional department stores.","In Europe, soft conditions contributed to lower revenues in the quarter. Weakness is concentrated in western and southern European markets, but bright spots include Russia, France and Scandinavia, where revenues are showing strong growth year-to-date. Lee's woman initiative in Europe, led by the Stretch Deluxe concept, are continuing to outperform expectations with bottoms up 15% year-to-date.","Now I'll turn it over to Bob, who will take you through our financial highlights.","Robert K. Shearer","All right. Well, thanks, all, for the terrific overview. Now I'd like to conclude today's call with commentary around our second quarter financial performance and our updated guidance.","First, I'll start at the top with revenues, which were up 16% or 19% in constant dollars. We achieved another quarter of strong organic growth, up 6% in constant dollars. And that's lower than the exceptionally strong 14% organic growth achieved in the first quarter. You'll recall that the quarter benefited from earlier shipments and stronger sales of seasonal products, that is, some sales shifted from the second quarter into the first due to the unseasonably warm weather.","In addition, our organic revenue growth was negatively impacted by the sale of John Varvatos, reducing the growth rate by about 1%. The first half organic revenue growth was 10% in constant dollars, giving us confidence in our ability to achieve our 8% organic revenue growth guidance for the year.","Our international and direct-to-consumer businesses remain important drivers of VF's current and future growth, and both are on track to achieve the 15% organic revenue growth targets we established at the start of the year. Eric touched on the strength we're continuing to see in our international businesses, Europe and Asia in particular, where our strong brands and marketing investments continue to drive superior performance.","In terms of our direct-to-consumer business, we're halfway through the year, and we have opened 58 new stores. The second half will be a heavier period of additional store openings and strong direct-to-consumer revenue growth, as we work toward a total of approximately 130 new stores by year-end.","Now a quick comment on the 3 businesses we haven't touched on: Imagewear, Sportswear and Contemporary Brands. So I'll start with Imagewear, which posted another quarter of higher revenues, but as noted in the release, the increase moderated from what we've seen in prior periods. In the second quarter, the Imagewear group was comping against an exceptional quarter of growth in the 2011 period, and that quarter included a number of new program shipments. While this was as anticipated, we remain confident in our achieving our guidance for mid-single digit revenue growth for the full year.","In terms of the Imagewear operating margin, the decline there is due entirely to the peaking of product costs for this coalition. Those costs are now moderating, and along with some pricing adjustments, we expect the Imagewear operating margin to return to mid-teen levels by next quarter. For the year, this coalition's operating margin should surpass that of last year.","I'll move to Sportswear, where the reported numbers, again, don't tell the whole story. The decline in revenues here is due to 2 items specific to Nautica: the timing of special programs, which have historically been difficult to predict; and lower distressed sales. Nautica's business outside of the special programs, including their regular wholesale and retail businesses, grew nicely by 5% in the quarter. And Kipling continued its growth momentum, growing by a double-digit rate in the quarter. For the first half, Sportswear revenues are up 4%, so here, too, we remain comfortable with our original guidance for mid-single digit revenue growth this year.","In terms of our Contemporary Brands business, keep in mind, the reported results now reflect the sale of the John Varvatos business. So last year's second quarter results include the Varvatos business, and this year's exclude the business from April on. If you take the Varvatos numbers out of each period, revenues were up 4% or 7% in constant dollars in the quarter.","For the first half, once again excluding John Varvatos, Contemporary Brands revenues grew by a healthy 10% in constant dollars, reflecting growth across all 3 brands: 7 For All Mankind, Splendid and Ella Moss. For the year, due to the Varvatos sale, total coalition revenues will decline by a mid-single digit rate. Excluding the Varvatos business from both periods, the coalition is on track to achieve high single-digit revenue growth in 2012.","Now let's move on to gross margin. We were really pleased with the 20 basis point improvement in gross margin during the quarter. We knew the improvement was coming, and we're really happy to report that it was a little earlier than expected. And keep in mind that last year's gross margin for the period included a 65 basis point benefit from a facility closure, so the 20 basis point improvement is more like 85 basis points from an operating standpoint. The better-than-expected improvement was mostly driven by our business that has been most cost-challenged, our U.S. Jeanswear business, which has been hit hard by the cotton cost increases over the last year.","Our U.S. Jeanswear gross margin improved by about 100 basis points year-over-year. We also saw healthy gross margin expansion in each of our Outdoor & Action Sports, Contemporary Brands and Sportswear coalitions. As you can imagine, that gives us great confidence in our ability to achieve the gross margin expansion expected in the second half of the year. Now as we've said in the past, that improvement should be strongest in the fourth quarter, which, in 2011, posted the highest cost of the year, especially in our U.S. Jeanswear business.","Now also impacting the fourth quarter specifically is our growing direct-to-consumer base, where gross margins are substantially above VF averages. In fact, for the year, we now expect gross margin to expand slightly more than the 70 basis points of improvement indicated in our initial guidance.","Our SG&A ratio as a percent of revenues rose to 38.4% from 35.7% last year. Now of the total 270 basis point increase, Timberland accounted for 240 basis points. You'll recall, Timberland's SG&A rate is much higher than that of VF's, and that is particularly so in the second quarter given Timberland's seasonally low sales level. Excluding Timberland, our SG&A ratio is up by a modest 30 basis points, due entirely to the impact of higher pension expense this year versus last year.","Our operating margin was 7.9% on an adjusted basis compared with 10.3% in last year's second quarter. Let's review the puts and takes here. Timberland negatively impacted the adjusted operating margin by 230 basis points due to the seasonal losses they historically generate in the second quarter, and the comparison is impacted by 40 basis points from higher pension expense this year. Excluding these 2 items, that is, on an apples-to-apples basis with the prior year period, our operating margin in the current quarter reflects some improvement over the prior year's quarter.","And one other item I wanted to point out on the P&L is the miscellaneous net line. The big swing here from last year is the inclusion of the $42 million gain on the sale of the Varvatos business. An additional benefit from the sale of the John Varvatos business is that it triggered an income tax benefit worth $11 million or $0.10 a share. And you'll note that the tax rate in the second quarter was unusually low at 15.1%, reflecting a reduction of 600 basis points related to this $11 million benefit.","For the full year, we now expect our tax rate to approximate 25%, including the favorable impact related to the sale. Recall, however, that as outlined in our release, both the $42 million gain from the sale of Varvatos and the related tax benefit are excluded from adjusted earnings, considering the unusual nature of the sale. That, of course, applies to our discussion of second quarter results, as well as our full year guidance.","And that brings us to the bottom line, an adjusted earnings per share of $1.11. Once again, I'll outline the puts and takes impacting the 2 quarters. Included in this quarter's adjusted earnings per share of $1.11 was a $0.12 per share loss from Timberland, which was a little better than we estimated on our first quarter release. Also impacting the current quarter's earnings is a combined $0.11 per share from foreign currency and a higher pension expense. On the other hand, earnings per share in last year's quarter benefited by $0.07 from a facility closure. Taking into account all of these items in both the 2012 and 2011 periods, the year-over-year positive swing in earnings, on a more comparable basis with last year, was $0.24 per share, underscoring our strong fundamental performance.","Excluded from the adjusted earnings per share are, of course, acquisition-related expenses and, as I previously mentioned, the John Varvatos gain, which were $0.03 and $0.32 per share, respectively. In April, we indicated that the John Varvatos gain would approximate $0.20 per share. The difference between that and the $0.32 relates to the tax benefit triggered by the gain on the sale, which, again, is a major contributing factor: the significantly lower tax rate in the second quarter.","Now a few comments on our balance sheet. Eric noted our focus on inventory control, which was pretty well demonstrated by the very low 3% increase in inventories, excluding Timberland, in the current period. Short-term debt was up over 2011 levels to support working capital needs, but by year-end, we expect to be completely out of the commercial paper market, given our expectation for another year of exceptional cash generation. In fact, given our strong working capital management, we've increased our guidance for cash flow from operations this year to a record $1.2 billion.","Let's close with a recap of our revised earnings guidance. Eric noted the $0.05 per share increase to $9.50 in adjusted earnings per share. In considering this increase in our earnings guidance, it's important to keep in mind that, as we said in the release, it covers an additional $0.07 impact of a decline in the euro-to-dollar relationship to the current rate, or to EUR 1.22 to $1. The prior guidance was based on the euro-to-dollar relationship of EUR 1.25. That means that because of the continued strengthening of the dollar to the euro, our guidance now includes a foreign currency headwind of $0.42 per share for the year, as compared to our prior estimate of $0.35.","The impact from higher pension expense is still expected to approximate $0.19 per share in 2012. We remain comfortable with the $1.10 in accretion from Timberland, right in line with what we said back in February. We're very encouraged by all the great work that's taking place at Timberland and look forward to even more progress as the months and years come.","In terms of revenues, if you do the math around our current guidance, it implies organic second half revenue growth in constant dollars of between 6% and 7%, versus nearly 10% in the first half. Keep in mind that revenues in the second half of the year include about 1 point of negative impact from the John Varvatos sale, and it also reflects our continued caution around current economic conditions.","To provide just a little color around the cadence of earnings growth we expect in the third and fourth quarters, first, I'll remind you that gross margin expansion will be stronger in the fourth quarter than the third, as product costs continue to decline over the second half. Also, keep in mind that our direct-to-consumer business, which is highly profitable and continues to grow, could be the strongest in our fourth quarter. That will likely push our revenue comparisons to be a bit stronger in the fourth quarter than the third. And also, because our international business is strongest in the third quarter, the negative currency impact is much tougher in the third quarter versus the fourth. In fact, over half of the $0.42 per share full year currency impact will be in the third quarter.","So that wraps up my commentary for this morning. All in all, another great quarter by VF. We've got momentum. Our brands are delivering globally. Investments in our brands are paying off. As a response to the challenging economic environment, retailers in all regions are placing bigger bets with proven brands like ours. Our international results in this quarter and first half are proof to that.","We're tightly managing our inventories and overall cost structure. Simply put, we have the brands and operating platforms to win in any economy and in any region of the world. And we're looking forward to maintaining our momentum in the second half of the year.","With that, back to Eric.","Eric C. Wiseman","All right. Thanks, Bob. Let's open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a little housekeeping quickly. How much of a drag was reduced distribution for Timberland in the quarter? I know you guys said you're going to be cleaning that up.","Steven E. Rendle","Yes, Michael, this is Steve. There was a minimal impact. As we look to rightsize that business, we are closing some of the distribution. Simultaneously, we're rightsizing the product segmentation strategy, getting the right products in the right channels. So some impact, but not 100%.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then I think, if I have the numbers right that you guys gave, I think you said China revenues grew by, I think, 19% in the first half but up 20% in the second quarter, so somewhat of an acceleration there. And then I think the guidance you gave for the year, 20% growth in Asia overall, was an acceleration from the 19% in the quarter. So if I'm right, you're looking forward to an acceleration in the back half, which would be continuation of acceleration in the second quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about what would be driving those solid trends? Just because we're hearing such volatile comments out of the macro environment over there.","Eric C. Wiseman","Yes, let me -- I know that we've thrown -- this is Eric, Michael. I know we've thrown a lot of numbers out there today. Our China business in the second quarter was up 34%, driven by our jeans business that was up 50% in the second quarter. Our full year expectation for China, on a constant currency basis, is up 24%. So with that fact reset, it suggests that we're not expecting the same overall growth rate. We've had a phenomenal first quarter, particularly in our jeans business, but we are expecting kind of growth in above 20% for the year out of our China business.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then could you just tell us what...","Eric C. Wiseman","Does that help?","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, it does. And could you just tell us what same-store sales were for the DtoC business in the second quarter, please, for our models?","Eric C. Wiseman","Yes. Worldwide, the stores that we own and operate were up mid-single digit in the second quarter. That's about where they were in the first quarter, and that's our outlook for the full year.","Operator","Our next question will come from Kate McShane with Citi.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just had a clarification question on the guidance you gave today of $9.50. Bob, did we hear you say that the tax rate benefit that you experienced in Q2 is not included in this new guidance? Could you just reconcile that for us?","Robert K. Shearer","Sure. Yes, what we're seeing there, Kate, is that that tax benefit that was associated with the John Varvatos gain, all of that gets excluded, right? The gain itself and also, that additional tax benefit that was worth $0.10 a share gets excluded in our adjusted earnings per share numbers. So yes, that incremental $0.10 is not in the $9.50. And just to, I guess, to carry through there, just the other point is -- what we said was, that our overall tax rate for the year looks to be pretty close to the 25% level.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, fantastic. And then, my second question has to do with the product cost timing for Jeanswear versus Imagewear. Can you just walk us through a little bit why Jeanswear was a little bit better than expected and the timing of the higher product cost for Imagewear and how we should look at those 2 businesses from a gross margin standpoint for the rest of the year?","Scott H. Baxter","Kate, it's Scott. I'll take you through that. It's pretty simple. The Jeanswear and Imagewear businesses are different in that we carry a higher inventory in the Imagewear businesses because of the differentiation in the models. The models are a little bit different, so therefore, we carry the higher inventory. And you're going to see the product costs flow quicker in the Jeanswear business as you did in this quarter and lag a little bit in the Imagewear business simply because of the model differentiation. And then, we'll be back to, I think, by the fourth quarter, for both of the businesses, historical levels and plan and what we have talked about in the past.","Eric C. Wiseman","And Kate, maybe just a little follow-up on that. In the Jeanswear piece, as we've said in the past, we -- we're really locked in, in terms of our denim costs. So the improvement, a little sooner than expected, was more due to manufacturing efficiencies. Our folks there are just doing a great job in terms of running the plants very, very efficiently, also keeping inventories under great control. So that improvement, that faster-than-anticipated improvement, came from a couple of factors like that.","Operator","We'll go next to Omar Saad with ISI Group.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to talk about Vans. The brand has been so strong. Obviously, it's really catching quite a bit at the consumer level globally, especially in Europe. I wondered if I could talk to you about how you think about kind of the canvass shoe, that classic canvass shoe look that Vans is so well known for. And how do you think about that -- is that really driven by kind of the life -- adoption of the brand as a lifestyle brand by consumers? Is it a fashion trend that's really hot right now? Is it sustainable? Or how do you turn it from a fashion trend at the consumer level and to a sustainable kind of brand adoption? Just any thoughts around that, I know, would be really helpful.","Steven E. Rendle","Sure, Omar. Omar, this is Steve, and perhaps Karl Heinz can fill in from a European standpoint. I mean, clearly, the classics portion of the Vans business is what ties it to its historical, cultural element of that skate consumer. As we talked about in New York, that really is the nucleus of how we take our brand to market. And then, we move away from that center really to that youth culture connectivity using the classics as the anchor, but also moving into a number of the other product categories, including the new LXVI launch, to continue to expand ourselves from that core consumer into the youth lifestyle component driven from music and that street culture component.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Yes, Omar, this is Karl Heinz. I can add, Vans is doing particularly well in Europe, as you've seen also. And good news is, we're clearly seeing a lot of goods sales on the classics family, but in addition, also, we monitor and we see great results on the other families as well, including the LXVI. That's the first point. The second one, we have strong sales in the U.K. At the same time, we see also very good performance across Europe. And all our marketing initiatives, we are making sure that we established this as a brand and not just a fashion pick.","Eric C. Wiseman","Omar, if I could pile on -- it's Eric -- on the Vans subject, at our event in New York City last month, as Steve mentioned in the call, we think we can add $1 billion to this brand over the next 5 years. And when we think we can do that -- and we don't come out and talk about those things until we have some proven concepts and some demonstrated performance internally. And Steve talked about 4 things: product innovation, things like the LXVI line; direct-to-consumer growth, so look at the number of stores that we're opening around the world; geographic expansion. You mentioned the strength of the business in Europe is also growing in Asia; and consumer connectivity. Those were our 4 points. Consumer connectivity comes to life online when you go see that brand in particular. So we're confident we have traction against that $1 billion and thrilled that we're having the kind of year we have. It's a great way to start against an ambitious goal like $1 billion to be up 29% in the quarter.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then Eric, while I have you, as we think about maybe some your more cyclical businesses slowing a little bit, still maintaining very healthy margins, and I'm talking about the business maybe with -- those with less global opportunities. Is it a good time to start thinking about portfolio management and take advantage of how strong those businesses have been and maybe consider a divestiture or 2?","Eric C. Wiseman","Well, as you know, we consistently say that we're active portfolio managers. And it's tough to time acquisitions and divestitures, that's for sure. But we are always looking across our portfolio at what do we want to look like 3 or 4 years from now and how do we get there. That includes building in brands and markets to invest and to grow, and it includes buying and selling. Within the last 12 months, we've acquired Timberland. And we have acquired Smartwool, and we've divested John Varvatos. And we continue to try to reshape our portfolio, but I can't comment specifically about what our next step might be.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Mitch Kummetz of Robert Baird.","Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Bob, I just want to drill down on the gross margin a little bit. Now let me start -- I think your comment on the Jeanswear business for the second quarter is that gross margin was up 100 basis points. Did I hear that right?","Robert K. Shearer","Yes, that's right.","Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So how are you thinking -- and I think you said that, that gross margin improves over the balance of the year and it kind of, for this year, at least, it peaks in Q4. So how shall we be thinking about Jeanswear gross margin over Qs 3 and 4?","Robert K. Shearer","Yes. It continues to improve substantially over that period of time. So again, 100 basis points in the second quarter, and that grows to -- I think the best way to maybe put perspective around that is that by the end of the year, we expect our gross margins to be back to more historical levels, the levels that we saw in years prior to 2011. So the expansion just continues to accelerate throughout the year, and a lot of it is based on as costs continue to come down.","Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Can you get even better than historical levels in Jeanswear going into next year based on cotton prices?","Robert K. Shearer","We don't see that right now, okay, based on what we've acquired. And we'll have more to say about next year and -- as we lock in the costs for next year. But for 2012, we're not seeing that. But we are seeing a return, which is a big statement, right? We're seeing that return to those more normalized levels that we enjoyed historically.","Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then, your gross margin guidance on the year is now slightly better than the 70 basis points of improvement that you highlighted, I think, on the last call. Is there any way you can -- when you think about the year on a gross margin, can you kind of break out or quantify the puts and takes on your expectations for gross margin? Can you kind of give us a sense as to where do you think mix comes in for the year, where do you think actual input prices, that impact is for the year?","Robert K. Shearer","Yes. So a little perspective around that. Initially, we indicated that we expected 70 basis points of gross margin improvement, and we said that most of that was mix. And now said it should be a little bit better. And what we're talking about there is maybe 10 basis points of additional improvement, which isn't a huge number, but it's clearly moving in the right direction. So just a couple of factors on a full year basis. As we look at that now implied 80 basis points, we still expect about 70 basis points coming from mix, and that's really been pretty consistent. So we've been running right around 70 basis points over the past several years. And that's been pretty consistent and will be a key driver going forward as well. On top of that, we have, in terms of price and costs, it looks like we'll improve by an additional 30 basis points. We're -- we expect to see gross margin expansion, actually, across nearly every single one of our businesses for the year 2012. So we're really, obviously, pleased with that. So that nets to about 30 basis points on a full year basis. And then, keep in mind that in the last year, we had a few credits. We had a couple of credits. One was from us from the facility exit and also, from a LIFO change. And that helped last year by about 20 basis points. We don't have that this year. So the 80 points is essentially 100 basis points of improvement from mix and our pricing costs ratio, and then net of that 20 basis points that helped last year, not in this year.","Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Thanks for walking me through that. Last question, just on Timberland in the back half. I know your comments, in general, Bob, were that you expect stronger revenue growth in Q4 than Q3. How should we be thinking about the Timberland business on an organic basis? I recognize that Q3 is a little screwed because of the timing of the acquisition. But from an organic standpoint, how should we be thinking about Timberland's growth in the back half, Q3, Q4? Higher growth in Q4, I would assume, organically?","Steven E. Rendle","Yes, I'll go ahead and take that question for you. We're looking at the Timberland growth, as we've said, as to just a gradual improvement year-over-year. In the U.S., we've got a very difficult winter to comp off of. We're planning growth because of that -- what we saw in 2011. But on a year-over-year basis, we're planning the business really, really slight growth overall.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Joseph Parkhill with Morgan Stanley.","Joseph Parkhill - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","My first question is about Jeanswear. While you explained some of the weakness in the quarter due to mid-tier and demand pull-forward to 1Q, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit what you're expecting from a revenue growth perspective in the second half. Would you expect it to normalize a little bit? And then also, your expectations around the European Jeanswear business.","Scott H. Baxter","Joseph, this is Scott. I'll take the first part of the question. I think the key component of your question is, if you think back to February, the last 2 weeks of February and all of March, the really unseasonably warm weather, we pulled a lot of our seasonals forward in the first quarter. And that helped us to have low double-digit increases in the first quarter. And so we're a little less, from a revenue standpoint, in the second quarter. But if you take a look at the first half, we're really comfortable with where we landed relative to that. And then if you look forward and take a look at the full year, stand by our guidance that we've talked about as far as mid-single digit growth for the Jeanswear business for the full year combined. As far as the turbulence or whatever you commented on the mid-tier, no comments on any of our individual customers, and we'll just continue to work our way through it and do the best we can.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Joseph, this is Karl Heinz for the international side. In Europe, you probably know that in addition to the challenging economic situation, the jeans market is not in the best health. And we act in this market like many of our peers do. So we expect our revenues to be down in the high-single digit for the year. What we are doing, we are improving our gross margin and working on the SG&A side so that profitability continues to improve. On Asia, on the other side, you have heard we have strong performance on Lee, and we expect Asia to be as strong as it has been last year.","Joseph Parkhill - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just on Timberland, I mean, I think that was maybe the area where inventories were a little bit higher than sales growth. How comfortable are you with the current inventory levels, and when would you expect that growth would start to match your sales growth for the brand?","Robert K. Shearer","Joseph, I'll start on that one. Our inventories, by the end of the second quarter, were in much better condition. So as you know, and what you're referring to is that we've been aggressively moving some excess inventory through -- we've been moving it over the first half of the year. So a lot better -- a little bit -- still a little bit to move in the third quarter, but not like we've seen in the first half. So at this point in time, we're getting to a position where we're in a lot better shape than we were early in the year.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I was hoping, Eric -- and actually any of you who want to chime in, can you walk us through what you're doing different in China? And sort of break out for us, \"This is what we're doing in Jeanswear and Lee to keep that momentum going, even though others around us are seeing a slowdown\"? And then, similarly, if you could tell us on Vans and North Face how much of the growth that you're continuing to see in China is new door and whether you've seen any slowdown in same-store sales over there? Just maybe help us understand, in general, what's going on in that market broadly.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Robbie, this is Karl Heinz, here. I will try to give you the answers. We operate in China in a different model than many of our competitors. We don't have just a single brand. We act with a portfolio of brands. So we have our 5 large brands: Timberland, The North Face, Vans, Kipling, which are -- which we distribute directly. And all these 4 brands, large brands, would have about 2,000, 2,200 doors, which is significantly lower than many competitors. So I guess, the first answer is, we still have way to go. China is working with tier cities, so we are covering the top tiers. We have -- I guess the message is, we have way to go in the future. We also have, in addition to the brands which we run directly, the smaller brands are -- we have distributors, so we have an opportunity, longer term, once that business gets to a sizable size, to bring that in-house. As we mentioned before, Lee is our largest brand in China. We had a great quarter. We also did say in Q1, we had some shipments. We shipped a little bit more in Q2. So while the growth is strong, at the same time, we are not immune to what is going on in China. But we are confident due to our brand portfolio and our strategy that we have still a good way ahead of us.","Eric C. Wiseman","Robbie, we still have comp store growth happening in all of our brands right now in China. And Karl Heinz said, we've got -- we're only in 2,200 points of distribution across those brands. That's not in each brand, that's across all of them. So if you look at what some other brands' businesses have in China on doors per brand, we have a long way to go. We're thrilled by that because we have a team in place so they can get that done.","Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just a quick follow-up on the U.S. mass channel business for Jeanswear. Is it a unit volume problem? Is it programs being canceled? Or is it average selling prices coming down? Can you just give us more flavor what all the pressure is you guys are working through there?","Scott H. Baxter","Robbie, this is Scott. We feel pretty good about our mass channel business and still stand by the fact that we're going to have a good year and had a good first half. And we pulled some seasonals, significant seasonals, into the first quarter and as you remember in the first quarter release, when I talked about the low-single digit -- excuse me, double-digit increases for the first quarter. So again, I go back to the fact that it's the picture of the first half versus just looking at it at 1 quarter. But I think we feel good about...","Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Sorry, Scott, maybe -- Scott, I maybe meant the moderate channel.","Scott H. Baxter","Okay, then...","Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Sorry, sorry. I meant the moderate channel.","Eric C. Wiseman","You got the answer on the mass channel, all about mass.","Scott H. Baxter","As far as the moderate channel, we don't comment on specific customers, and we're hopeful that-- and feel optimistic that the future is a little bit better than the second quarter. But again, we had a very strong first quarter. Second quarter, as we commented in the Lee business specifically, was a little bit slower. But again, we did pull some seasonals forward in the first quarter. But I think the key for us is new product. We have -- in the moderate channel, we have all kinds of new products, both in our male and our female business, that are really resonating with the consumer. And that's going to help us win in the long term in the moderate channel.","Eric C. Wiseman","It's an interesting time in that mid-tier channel, Robbie. There's a lot of change going on. And so we always look at our businesses 2 ways: and one is absolute performance; and the other is relative performance. And we're real confidence in the jeans category that we're taking share in the mid-tier channel, have for the first 6 months. We've got great new products in there under the Lee brand that consumers are resonating with. We just need more consumers in that channel right now. But that'll happen eventually. That will get sorted out.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Christian Buss with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Christian Buss - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I was wondering if you could let me know what's embedded in your guidance when it comes to the competitive pricing environment as commodity costs are coming down.","Robert K. Shearer","Yes, basically, the answer to that, Christian, is that our pricing remains relatively stable. So a couple of pieces. Relative to Jeanswear, where the bigger pricing increases occurred in 2011, generally, we anticipate -- with some -- a few exceptions, generally, we anticipate that pricing there will hold throughout the year. And you mentioned costs coming down, that's true from a cotton standpoint. But other costs in other of our businesses, for example synthetics, are up to some extent. Nothing at all like what we saw in cotton last year, but there have been some increases in other parts of the business. And what we've done, of course, is we've had some pricing increases to match that. So actually, across the board overall for VF, there are a few percentage points worth of pricing included in our numbers, in our revenue numbers, again, offset by some cost increases as well, coming down to that gross margin expansion on a net basis.","Operator","We'll take our next question from David Glick with Buckingham Research Group.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Eric, I was wondering if you could give us some early thoughts on how you're thinking about the Timberland apparel opportunity, how you're strategizing that rollout -- the pace of the rollout, the distribution strategy and maybe men's versus women's.","Eric C. Wiseman","Not quite ready, David, to disclose that, because we're still developing those plans. What we know is we intend to launch apparel -- we're really talking about the U.S. market here, right, because we have a very successful Timberland apparel business in Europe and Asia. In Asia, in fact, about half our revenue -- the revenue's split about 50-50 between revenue -- I'm sorry, between apparel and footwear. So it's a U.S. question. That line is -- the products are taking shape, but it's too early to comment on that. We have not sorted out the channels, the pricing. All that is in process. And we're going to launch -- when I say launch, I'll temper that with the size of the launch. We're going to kind of ease into that program, walk a bit before we run and get moving, but start moving in the fall of next year.","David J. Glick - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Is it fair to say...","Eric C. Wiseman","We'll give you more details as we have them.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Kernan with Cowen and Company.","John D. Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Eric, you talked about being slightly ahead of your synergies plan for Timberland. And then, you talked about potentially more synergies going into next year. Where are those synergies coming from? And can you quantify any of that?","Eric C. Wiseman","Sure. As you know, John, we've -- last year, in 2011, we exceeded our initial expectation for synergies. We're running slightly ahead again this year. What's changed the most is the leverage in our supply chain to help Timberland execute their apparel sourcing that's largely current, as I just said, in Europe and Asia. And also, we're taking our significant manufacturing expertise and bringing some of those skills to bear in the factory that Timberland and we now own in the Dominican Republic. And then we have terrific manufacturing engineering expertise, and that's helping us reduce the cost in that factory. So the short answer to your question is supply chain synergies in kind of every way. We've touched on it every way.","Steven E. Rendle","And in addition to that, I guess, I'd also just say just managing inventories as well. So when you look at the risk created by having higher inventories versus lower, we think there's an opportunity there as well that we've seen once we've owned the business. And behind some of the practices, we've seen a little bigger opportunity there.","John D. Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Great. And then one longer-term question. The world is a lot different than it was when you held your analyst day last year. And you talked about a 10% organic growth rate going forward. Are you any less confident in that long-term growth profile of your portfolio?","Eric C. Wiseman","No.","Operator","We'll take our last question from Jim Duffy with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Most of my questions have been asked and answered. A question on the e-commerce, however. Seemingly, a driver across multiple brands, particularly international, launching a lot of sites in new geographies. What type of growth are you seeing in the e-commerce business at the corporate level? And where do you see yourselves sitting relative to the global e-commerce opportunity?","Steven E. Rendle","Jim, this is Steve, I'll take that because, I think that the bulk of the e-commerce sales sits in the Americas Outdoor & Action Sports space. We've seen really good historical performance there. Based really on the platform that we've been able to establish both from the commerce, but more importantly, the content. And it's how we marry content to commerce and drive really strong conversion. But we have been seeing high 20%, low 30% growth rates, and we continue to see that into this year.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","And Jim, on the international side -- you asked international, Karl Heinz here. We are behind you, as you heard me saying. We're just launching our e-comm initiatives in Europe. We started with The North Face last year. We are adding countries this year, and Vans literally went live, as I said, on July 16 in 7 countries. So we're at a very, very early stage. And clearly, the growth numbers at this moment are extremely high, but we're starting from a low number.","Operator","And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Eric C. Wiseman","Sure. This is Eric. We're thrilled with where we are halfway through this year. We're right exactly where we thought we would be on the revenue front. The economy is playing out as we thought. We're a little bit ahead from where we thought we would be in earnings for the year, and we're looking forward to the next 6 months and keeping you guys posted. Thanks a lot for being with us this morning.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation, and you may now disconnect."],"21606":["VF Corp.

Unless otherwise noted, results presented on today's call are based on continuing operations.","Joining me on today's call will be VF's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Rendle, and Chief Financial Officer, Scott Roe. Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call for questions. Steve?","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Thanks, Joe, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our fourth quarter 2017 earnings call. Before we get started, I'd like to address the announcement this morning that we've reached the decision to sell the Nautica brand. While we do not yet have a definitive agreement, we are actively engaged with several parties and will update you as conditions warrant. I'd like to thank the Nautica employees for their hard work and dedication as we proceed through this process, and I'm eager for the Nautica organization to move into its next phase of growth and success.","2017 was a transformational year for VF, highlighted by both moves, top quartile value creation, and meaningful progress towards becoming a purpose-led, agile, and consumer and retail-centric organization. In 2017, revenue increased to 7% to $11.8 billion, or 4% on an organic basis. Our big three brands grew at a combined rate of 8%. And on an organic basis, international increased 9%, led by strength in Europe and China, direct-to-consumer increased 15%, with 30% growth in digital, and our Workwear business increased 7%.","Our fundamentals remain strong, as gross margin, a key driver of our value creation model, improved 160 basis points to 50.5%, a record for VF. Adjusted EPS increased 7% to $2.98, including about $100 million of incremental investment to drive our strategy and accelerate growth. And finally, VF delivered a 43% total return to shareholders, including cash returns of $1.9 billion through dividends and share repurchases.","As I reflect back on my first year as CEO, I'm reminded of the commitments we made one year ago. We committed to investing in digital and as a result, we delivered owned and wholesale digital growth of more than 25%, which accounted for 55% of our total growth. We committed to distort investments toward our international platform and as a result, we delivered 9% growth, with international now representing more than 40% of total revenue.","We committed to focus on Workwear and as a result, we consolidated our work brands into a single global platform and acquired Williamson-Dickie. We committed to being active brand portfolio managers and as a result, we sold LSG and are in the process of selling Nautica, and we've acquired Williamson-Dickie and reached an agreement to buy Icebreaker.","And finally, we committed to being a more consumer and retail-centric organization and as a result, we grew D2C 15%, including 12% comp growth, and now D2C represents more than 30% of total revenue. And we directed a majority of the $100 million incremental investment at capabilities that enable our consumer-centric strategy.","As we enter 2018, we will build on our early momentum and deliver on our commitment as value creators, responsible corporate citizens, and good stewards of our planet. Our top priorities for the coming year include protecting and enabling the explosive growth in Vans, while reenergizing growth in our Timberland and North Face brands specifically here in North America; successfully integrating Williamson-Dickie and Icebreaker into VF; accelerate our consumer-centric transformation work, with a particular focus on increasing speed-to-market; and we'll drive operational efficiency and create capacity for growth to fund our strategic growth initiatives.","To support the execution of our strategy and better enable the growth of our large global brands, we have realigned the roles of our Group Presidents and redirected our leadership talents at our most important objectives. Going forward, each Group President will be responsible for a single geographic region and have one global brand reporting to them.","Reshaping the portfolio is the number one choice in our strategy and we were very active in 2017. Our commitment to active portfolio management is how we position ourselves to deliver top quartile returns, with an evolving portfolio of powerful brands that are strategically advantaged to win. The decisions we are making cement VF's position as a value creation company. Reshaping the portfolio will remain a top priority in 2018.","I'd like to take a moment and recognize VF's associates around the globe. The pace of change in our industry is happening at an accelerated rate. To compete and win, our vision is to increase the metabolic rate of the entire organization and become more agile, nimble, and effective in the way we work. Our transformation agenda is in its early phases, but our associates have responded in typical VF fashion. Our success is not possible without the commitment and determination of our talented leadership teams globally. I offer a sincere thank you and I know we're all excited to build on our momentum and drive even stronger results. So with that, let's take a look at the fourth quarter performance.","Beginning with The North Face brand, global revenue increased 6%, including a 3 percentage point benefit from the order book timing shift discussed during our prior calls. Wholesale revenue increased 4% and our direct-to-consumer business increased 8%, including 14% growth in digital. While the growth in The North Face was below our outlook, we accelerated the timing of several initiatives to improve the quality of sales and reposition the brand back to its rightful place as the premium global outdoor lifestyle brand.","During the quarter, less promotional activity, foundational investments in China to improve the marketplace and position ourselves for accelerated growth, as well as aggressive efforts to clear Amazon of unauthorized dealers, impacted results. These actions continued to improve the positioning of the brand in the marketplace and are showing up in stronger margins for both us and our partners.","In 2017, The North Face team made significant progress against our strategic growth plan, and reported numbers clearly don't tell the whole story. To put context around the underlying performance of the brand and the progress being made, excluding lower off-price sales, the impact of cleaning up the Amazon environment, and the investments made in China, fourth quarter revenue growth was 8% when normalized for the order book timing shift.","By region, revenue in the Americas declined 1%, as growth in direct-to-consumer, and particularly digital, was offset by a decline in wholesale due to the factors just mentioned. The fall 2017 release of the new Summit Series reflects The North Face brand's commitment to building the very best technical product in the world. The new range is specifically designed for athletes through a design theory of fast, light, essential, and was so impactful, it inspired the world's leading alpinist, David Lama, to join our brand. The L5 Proprius Jacket and the L2 Proprius Fleece Hoodie are prime examples of this theory and became the core athlete choices of the latest TNF expedition to Antarctica.","The attention to this category will create a positive halo for the brand and influence design for the broader North Face assortment. The brand also saw Urban Exploration business expand nicely, with collaborations with Pendleton, Timberland, Vans, and Supreme, coupled with strong sell-through from its new Cryos Collection and the addition of the Asia designed Black Series Collection, which helped advance this important strategic brand extension.","In Europe, the brand's strong momentum continued with revenue growth of 32%, marking the eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in the region. Wholesale revenue increased over 40%, led by deepening strategic partnerships in the region. Direct-to-consumer increased a mid-teen rate, including almost 30% growth in digital.","The iconic Nuptse Jacket celebrated its 25th anniversary, supported by a Nuptse Forever campaign, which drove excitement in the Urban Exploration territory and buzz across Europe with 75% growth. Asia increased 8% in the quarter, including the negative impact of the foundational investments in China discussed previously. Direct-to-consumer revenue increased 30%, driven by digital, which offset a decline in wholesale, as we aggressively managed inventory in the marketplace.","2018 is off to a strong start for The North Face and we're pleased with the progress being made to elevate the brand. It is early, but we are executing our strategy and even more confident in our 2021 growth targets. As we look to fiscal 2019, we expect growth for The North Face to be in line with the 6% to 8% range we laid out at our Investor Day.","Now to Vans, 2017 was remarkable year for our largest and fastest growing brand, highlighted by broad-based global momentum. Congratulations to the Vans team around the world for delivering record results. The brand has become the global icon of creative expression for youth culture.","Revenue for the fourth quarter increased 35%, with strength across all regions, channels, and product franchises. Revenue in the Americas increased 38%, Europe increased 31%, and Asia Pacific grew 21%. Our wholesale and direct-to-consumer businesses, both increased more than 30%, including more than 50% growth in digital. A special call-out to the Vans North America direct-to-consumer team, which became VF's first $1 billion regional D2C platform. The Vans North America D2C performance was incredible, with nearly 30% growth and a total comp above 20%, a job well done.","Looking at product, the diversity of Vans' growth and the teams' Not Just One Thing mentality will sustain our strong momentum as we move into fiscal 2019. For the quarter, Classic footwear increased more than 25%, with continued strength in Old Skool and Slip-On styles. Progression footwear increased more than 20%, as the new UltraRange, All Weather MTE, and Pro franchises continued to perform well. The brand also delivered double-digit growth across apparel, and accessories. And our customs platform, a great example of creative expression, increased almost 200% in the quarter.","The Vans brand is stronger than it has ever been. Retail inventory levels are in great shape and we remain disciplined with respect to inventory management, merchandising, and assortment planning. We're investing heavily to continue to fuel Vans' explosive growth. While the comps next year will be difficult, disciplined execution and a long track record of consistent performance give us confidence the Vans brand will deliver double-digit growth in fiscal 2019.","Switching to Timberland, as expected, global revenue increased 8%, including a 5 percentage point benefit from the same order book timing shift that impacted The North Face brand. Wholesale increased 6% and direct-to-consumer increased 10%, including more than 30% growth in digital.","In line with expectations, Timberland brand revenue in the Americas increased 5%. However, revenue declined 1% when normalized for the order book timing shift. Our diversification strategy continues to evolve, as strength from non-classic footwear and apparel, both of which increased at a mid-single-digit rate, offset by softness in our core Classic business.","The performance of our SensorFlex and Aerocore platforms was particularly strong, increasing almost 50% in the quarter, and our Timberland PRO business continued to generate double-digit growth, with strength from our Powertrain Sport franchise.","In Europe, Timberland brand revenue increased 14%, including a 2 percentage point benefit from the order book timing shift. Our wholesale and direct-to-consumer businesses both increased at double-digit rate, including more than 30% growth in digital. Our locally designed product continues to drive demand, highlighted by our new women's collection, Courmayeur Valley, and Venice Park, which increased at double-digit rates. In men's, we had strong success with our Radford campaign and our Goose Eye Waterproof Parka collection.","Timberland's Asia business increased 3%, with more than 50% growth in China, which was partially offset by softness in Japan. High-teen growth in our direct-to-consumer business, driven by almost 80% growth in digital, was offset by a decline in wholesale. The Ultimate Winter Boot with a SensorFlex outsole performed well in the region.","Timberland's performance in 2017, while not at the level we've come to expect from this powerful lifestyle brand, was in line with our expectations. We are thoughtfully executing against the strategy we laid out at our Investor Day. And as we move into fiscal 2019, we will begin to step our way into more sustainable and diversified growth. Over the past year, we've made significant investments and announced several organizational changes within the global Timberland brand, designed to foster more global connectivity and speed to market, drafting off the strong momentum we have in Europe and China.","Moving to the Wrangler brand, as expected, global revenue increased 2%, with balanced growth across wholesale and direct-to-consumer. Revenue in the Americas increased 2% and our business in Europe grew 4%. Asia declined 7% due to ongoing weakness in India. While the destocking by our key customer is largely behind us and the initiatives put in place are showing early signs of success, visibility in the U.S. Jeanswear business remains low, and we continue to expect quarter-to-quarter variability.","That said, we were pleased with the improvement in performance during the holiday period. And as we look to fiscal 2019, growth in profitability for the Wrangler brand in the U.S. should continue to improve. Our strategy to elevate the brand and extend more deeply into new channels, such as department stores and specialty retail, continues to gain traction with core and new consumers. From a digital perspective, we're seeing strength across our digital wholesale partners as well as our own wrangler.com business, which increased double digits.","Looking at product, collaborations with designers such as Peter Max are creating upper tier distribution opportunities, and consumers have responded well to new innovations, such as Wrangler Performance Series and Wrangler Outdoor, and our Wrangler Retro line continues to drive meaningful growth in these strategic brand extensions.","Now to the Lee brand, global revenue declined 1%, as 11% growth in direct-to-consumer was offset by a low single-digit decline in wholesale. The Lee Americas business was about flat, with high single-digit growth in men's driven by continued success of our Extreme Comfort Khakis and Extreme Motion denim products was offset by softness in women's. We are encouraged by the improvement we're beginning to see in our women's business. As we enter 2018, continued momentum in men's as well as product innovation and expanded distribution in women's should drive improved results for the Lee Americas business this year.","Lee Europe was up 4%, with balanced growth across wholesale and direct-to-consumer. The Sherpa Rider Jacket performed particularly well in the quarter. In Asia, revenue declined 5%, as mid-teen growth in direct-to-consumer was offset by a mid-teen decline in wholesale, due in part to ongoing challenges in India. In China, the new Magma Fusion and Black Label collections delivered strong results.","Now turning to Workwear, revenue increased 9% on an organic basis, marking the third consecutive quarter of at least high single-digit growth. Timberland PRO, Bulwark, and Wrangler RIGGS achieved double-digit growth, and Red Kap continued to accelerate as sector fundamentals improved.","On a pro forma basis, Williamson-Dickie also had a strong quarter with 13% growth, driven by strength in lifestyle, international, and direct-to-consumer. It's been nearly five months since we acquired Williamson-Dickie, and the integration process has gone exceptionally well. Our integration and leadership teams have worked tirelessly over the past few months, and I couldn't be more pleased with our progress. I am confident that the creation of our Workwear platform and the acquisition of Williamson-Dickie will drive significant value for VF shareholders in the years to come.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Thanks, Steve.","First of all, for those of you on the phone updating your models, our sincere apology for what we've done to you, acquisitions, dispositions, year-end change. We talked about increasing our metabolic rate, and nowhere do you see that more than in the results that we see right now.","It's been almost one year since we laid out a strategic plan at our Investor Day. As we reflect on the 2017 results, one year into our five-year plan, we know a few things to be true. First, 2017 has been a transformational year for VF, highlighted by top quartile value creation for our shareholders. Second, we've seen notable acceleration in Vans Europe and D2C, which allowed us to accelerate investments while delivering our commitments to shareholders. Lastly, while not all businesses are as far along in the journey as others, we're encouraged by our overall progress. In fact, we're slightly ahead of where we expected to be at this point in time, and that gives us confidence we're on the right path.","Before diving into the numbers, let's review a few items that influenced our reported fourth quarter and full-year results. First, during the fourth quarter we reached the decision to sell the Nautica brand and determined it met the held-for-sale and discontinued operations accounting criteria. Accordingly, the results of this business have been classified as discontinued operations and prior periods have been adjusted. We provided an income statement in the press release issued this morning excluding Nautica, so you can see the full impact on our results and on the outlook we provided last October. As a result of this decision, global Kipling results will now be reported within Outdoor & Action Sports coalition.","Second, as a result of recent U.S. tax legislation, we recorded a $466 million provisional net charge in the fourth quarter, which negatively impacted our fourth quarter EPS results by $1.16. The provisional charge comprises an approximate $500 million transition tax payable over the next eight years for historical earnings generated offshore, partially offset by other items, including a favorable revaluation of net deferred assets as a result of the lower U.S. federal tax rate.","Third, we incurred approximately $16 million of pre-tax acquisition-related expenses associated with the Williamson-Dickie and Icebreaker transactions. These expenses negatively impacted fourth quarter EPS by about $0.03. So, with that out of the way, let's review our fourth quarter and full-year performance. My comments going forward will focus on adjusted results excluding the items just mentioned.","Our fourth quarter results were strong, as momentum continues to build across our core growth engines. Revenue increased 18% to $3.6 billion, well ahead of the outlook we provided last October. Excluding the impact of the Williamson-Dickie acquisition, organic revenue increased 10%, including an approximate 2 percentage point benefit from the order book timing shift we discussed during prior calls.","Revenue for our big three brands increased 15% on a combined basis, led by 35% growth in Vans. The performance of Vans globally has been incredible, and we're investing heavily behind our explosive growth to fuel continued momentum. And just to address a question likely on your mind regarding the sustainability of Vans growth, based on our current visibility, we expect high-teen growth from Vans through the first half of this year.","Our Workwear business increased 9% on an organic basis, as sector fundamentals improve and we further establish our work platform capabilities and connectivity. On a pro forma basis, Williamson-Dickie had a strong quarter, with 13% growth compared to the prior year, driven by particular strength in international and direct-to-consumer.","Total international growth accelerated 15% on an organic basis, led by 20% growth in Europe. And to once again highlight the broad-based strength we're seeing across our Europe business, our big three brands increased more than 20% on a combined basis. Wholesale increased more than 20%. Direct-to-consumer increased more than 14%, including more than 25% growth in digital. And, we again achieved double-digit growth across every major market in Europe.","China remained strong, as revenue increased 10% on an organic basis, driven by continued strength in Vans, direct-to-consumer, and digital. Our direct-to-consumer business increased 16% on an organic basis, led by 25% growth in digital. Our Outdoor & Action Sports and international businesses increased at a high-teen rate. With a mid-teen total comp and a low double-digit comp in our brick-and-mortar stores, our focus and investment on elevating our direct-to-consumer platform and connecting more deeply with consumers continues to generate high returns.","Wholesale revenue increased 6% on an organic basis, including a 3 percentage point benefit from the order book timing shift. International wholesale remained strong, increasing at a low double-digit rate, and our digital wholesale accounts increased more than 20%.","Now, as a reminder, our direct-to-consumer and digital wholesale businesses account for about 85% of our 2021 growth plan. So it's very encouraging to see the strong performance and momentum across key pillars of our strategy.","We remain intensely focused on fundamentals and quality growth, as evidenced by continued strength in our gross margin. Gross margin was 51.6% in the fourth quarter, up 70 basis points from the prior year. Excluding the Williamson-Dickie acquisition, gross margin increased 140 basis points to 52.4%. Gross margin was stronger than we expected as a result of more favorable mix and better full price sell-through, a direct result of our heightened focus on quality growth and inventory management. Gross margin expansion continues to be a significant value driver for us, providing the flexibility and opportunity to invest in our strategic growth initiatives.","SG&A as a percentage of revenue was up 250 basis points to 38%, which is above the outlook we provided last October. However, in light of our stronger-than-expected revenue and gross margin performance, we reinvested an additional $35 million back into the business to drive growth into 2018 and beyond.","And just to breakdown our SG&A a bit further, the majority of our increase was driven by investments in direct-to-consumer, demand and product creation, and innovation. In fact, on an organic basis, our demand creation investment increased more than 20% during the fourth quarter, and you're beginning to see the return on that investment. When coupled with higher incentive compensation compared to a weaker performance a year ago, we've accounted for the majority of the change in SG&A.","Relative to the initial outlook we provided last February, we invested about $100 million in 2017. These investments are focused on the core tenets of our strategy, direct-to-consumer, demand and product creation, design and innovation, insights and analytics, supply chain agility, talent and technology. We are transforming VF into a more digitally-enabled consumer and retail-centric organization. While this clearly comes at a cost in the short term, we are confident in our ability to accelerate growth and meet or exceed our long-term financial commitments laid out at our Investor Day.","Fourth quarter adjusted operating margin declined 180 basis points to 13.6%, including a 30 basis point negative impact from changes in FX. Excluding the Williamson-Dickie acquisition, adjusted operating margin was 14.1%.","So to wrap up the P&L, adjusted EPS increased 13% to $1.01, $0.06 above the outlook we provided last October, including $0.06 of additional investment.","Turning to our balance sheet, inventory increased 20%, including the impact of Williamson-Dickie. On an organic basis, inventory increased 3%. Our strong cash generation allowed us to quickly reduce leverage at the end of 2017, and our leverage ratio should decline further through the first half of 2018. Our balance sheet has capacity for additional M&A and it remains a top priority.","So to briefly highlight the full year, revenue increased 7% to $11.8 billion, or 4% on an organic basis. Our growth engines continued to accelerate throughout 2017 and finished the year with strong momentum. The big three brands increased at a combined rate of 8%. On an organic basis, international increased 9%, direct-to-consumer increased 15%, with 30% growth in digital, and Workwear increased 7%.","Our intense focus on fundamentals and quality growth led to 180 basis point improvement in gross margin on an organic basis to 50.7%. Adjusted EPS increased 7% to $2.98, or 6% on an organic basis, in line with the high-end of the initial range we provided last February, despite an incremental $0.19 of investment. We made meaningful progress reshaping the portfolio, returned almost $1.9 billion of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, and generated a 43% total shareholder return. That's top quartile in the S&P 500.","So due to a change in our fiscal year-end, our approach to forward-outlook is a little different this year. Our outlook for the three-month transition quarter ending March 2018 is as follows. Revenue is expected to approximate $2.9 billion, up 16%, including about a $200 million contribution from Williamson-Dickie. On an organic basis, revenue is expected to increase at a high single-digit rate, due in part to changes in FX. Adjusted EPS is expected to approximate $0.65, up 27%, including about $0.02 contribution from Williamson-Dickie. On an organic basis, we expect adjusted earnings per share to increase more than 20%, due in part to changes in FX.","Now, while we will not provide a detailed outlook for fiscal 2019 until our April call, let me provide a few preliminary comments relative to how we see the year shaping up. Revenue is expected to be up more than $13.2 billion, representing high-single-digit growth. This includes the expected contributions from Icebreaker and Williamson-Dickie. Adjusted EPS is expected to be approximately $3.45, representing low double-digit growth. This also includes the expected contributions from Icebreaker and Williamson-Dickie.","So in closing, we have strong momentum and our confidence is high. Our growth is accelerating and our core growth engines are delivering double-digit growth. Our fundamentals are strong, and we are aggressively investing in our largest and most profitable growth opportunities. We will use our early success to build on our momentum and continue to transform VF. We will continue to reshape and evolve our portfolio to deliver top quartile returns to shareholders. We look forward to updating you on our progress and on the next chapter of VF's value-creation journey.","And with that, I'll turn it back to the operator and we'll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. In the interest of time, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question, one follow-up, and re-queue for any additional. Our first question comes from the line of Chethan Mallela with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Chethan Bhaskaran Mallela - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. So I wanted to ask about the Jeanswear business. I think you've cited margin pressure as relating, at least in part, to launching more innovation at a time when pricing in the channel is more difficult. So can you maybe provide a sense of how you're thinking about the timeframe for margins to start to stabilize and maybe rebuild, and if that's contingent on future pricing? Thank you.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Yeah, sure. This is Scott. I'll take that. Let me just set some context that \u2013 of what we said coming into the year. You know that our largest customer was going through a strategic repositioning of their floor and we did talk about putting some innovation \u2013 putting some make into the product without taking price, and that was a decision we made to try to defend our very large position in that retailer, and indications from NPD reports and others who are in that key male business that that has indeed been the case.","But that, frankly, is not the largest contributor to our operating margin decline this year. It's really more from a deleveraging standpoint. As you think about gross margins going forward, there is always pricing pressures in that channel, but as the low-cost producer, we feel confident in our ability to maintain our gross margins.","And from a cost rationalization standpoint, as we deleveraged a little bit, the team at Jeanswear is on it. They have plans in place, and I think you can appreciate we're not going to go into much detail on that, but we do see a path forward to restore profitability to Jeanswear over the long run. And as we look into next year, we expect to see improvements in operating margin.","Chethan Bhaskaran Mallela - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. And then just a quick follow-up on Nautica and the announcement this morning. I know you have a relatively new management team in place there and the performance in recent quarters had appeared to be starting to turn a little more positively. So can you maybe elaborate on the thought process behind the decision to sell and why this business might be a better strategic fit for someone else? And then also, your priorities for the proceeds from the sale.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Great. So this is Steve. I'll start, and Scott can finish. I would first start by saying, we could not be more proud of the management team that's in place at Nautica. Yes, we put some people in place early last year, but there was a good core team there as well. But we focused intensely on improving productivity, specifically in our retail outlet channel, and the team did just fantastic work building that foundation and shoring up profitability. They continue to look at driving product and go-to-market strategies to reignite growth.","What brought us to this point of divesting of Nautica, we've talked a lot about the three lenses that we look at for our M&A activity. There's a strategic lens, there's a financial lens, and are we the right owner lens. And as we've looked continuously, this is not a one-and-done type action. This is something we're doing on a very proactive, very regular basis, evaluating all brands within our portfolio.","But specific to Nautica, we came to a point where it didn't necessarily hit all of our strategic touch points financially. It was not in line with driving our financial aspirations, and we came to a point where we thought perhaps it would be a better owner that could unlock the value that this brand holds. So really hats off to our team putting us in a position where we can enter into the sale process and feel confident in driving a good result.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","I'll follow up. I think there was a question on the use of proceeds and how we were thinking about that. So coming off the acquisition of WD and the upcoming Icebreaker, our first priority has been to deleverage the balance sheet and get our credit metrics back in line, and that will be our priority in the short term. I think it's worth noting, though, as I said in my prepared remarks, we have seen a significant improvement around those metrics already, and we have a lot of capacity and we expect to be back in line as we get through 2018.","Chethan Bhaskaran Mallela - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Perfect, thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Duffy with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","James Vincent Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you, good morning.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Good morning, Jim.","James Vincent Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I have a high-level question and then a question on the preliminary fiscal 2019 outlook. So now that you're into the five-year plan, results from your direct-to-consumer and international have been particularly strong, and in aggregate, maybe the U.S. wholesale a little bit lighter than you had expected. Add in some acquisitions, subtract some divestures, and the mix shift is really evolving more quickly than you had foreshadowed. Scott, can you maybe help us with an updated picture of the U.S. wholesale as a percent of the global revenue mix as we enter fiscal 2019?","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","So I don't have that at the top of my head, but I guess you're right on your general comments. We are evolving the portfolio quicker, and you're seeing the impact on gross margin and growth rate. I guess I'd say as it relates to our long-range targets, we won't change them until we change them. At some point, we'll come back and give an update. I guess you're starting to see the payoff of what we said we were going to do in terms of where our priorities are, where we're trying to reshape the portfolio, in what direction, away from \u2013 if you think of that bell curve from a distribution standpoint, continuing to minimize some of the more disruptive parts of the market and focus on the top and the bottom, and we're seeing progress there. And also you're seeing it in our gross margins from a mix standpoint. So acknowledging that we're ahead of where we said we would be, at some point we'll come forward, but we're not prepared to clean that up at this point.","And, Jim, we'll follow up offline specifically on your question on wholesale. I just don't have that at the top of my head.","James Vincent Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Fair enough, and then a question on the fiscal 2019 outlook. Recognizing that's a preliminary view, it does seem the underlying assumptions for organic growth are very modest embedded in that. Can you unpack that a little bit please? And I'm thinking about FX and the contribution of the acquisitions.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","So I guess what I would say is the momentum that we see coming out of 2017 through the stub and into 2019 is essentially intact. It's right in line with what we guided for our 2021 plan. Yes, we are going to see some benefit from currency. It looks like at this point there are a couple points maybe of benefit from FX. But from our standpoint, the other thing is, you think about Vans, we talked about where we came out of 2017 with our Vans growth rate. We gave you some shaping. I'd like to say we're going to continue to grow at that rate forever. That's probably unrealistic. But we do see continued momentum in Vans, even if a little \u2013 not quite as strong as what we saw in 2017. So that's part of what you're seeing as you look forward into 2019.","James Vincent Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Thanks, Jim.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great, thanks. Good morning. I guess I had a question, Steve, for you on The North Face business. It came in, obviously, a little bit weaker than we all thought. You outlined three specific impacts to the growth. Can you elaborate a little bit more on the Amazon piece in particular? I'm curious what you're learning about from your 3P test step brand there. And then, also I think you gave a preliminary 6% to 8% North Face growth for fiscal 2019. Just curious what's underpinning the confidence in that estimate. Is it where the order books are trending? Just any help around how you think about the shape of that growth into next year.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Great. So let me first, Erinn, just say,\\ we are very confident about our North Face business. We entered last year \u2013 we were pretty open and honest with you all with where we saw our brand in its journey and in the work that needed to be done. And there has been significant work going on internal in that business, specifically around product creation, demand creation, evolving our D2C and digital platforms. But also a big part is how we've looked at really shoring up and strengthening the brand in the work that we've done on Amazon, the work we pulled back on off-price, and some of the actions we're taking in Asia, are all about rebuilding that strong foundation that this brand has become accustomed to operating on.","Specific to Amazon, great partner, we're about five months into what we kind of titled a test of working with them directly. We have a dedicated key account leader and team now here in the United States, really mirroring what we've done in our European platform. But really investing the time and resources to understand Amazon better, help them understand us as a provider and a brand, and then collaboratively going out to clean up the unauthorized dealers, which a tremendous amount of work went into that this fall. I would like to tell you we're done. I don't think you're ever done, as you're constantly policing that environment, but I would tell you, we have a good partner that's very committed to working with us in a collaborative way to bring our brand to life in this aspect of our distribution.","I'll tell you what's giving us confidence about the 6% to 8% really are some of the product proof points that you see coming through. I mentioned in my prepared remarks around Summit Series. We've seen just a complete re-ignition of energy in the specialty channel, in our own D2C. We've seen it across the globe, and the impact that the focus on Summit Series and very specific ideas around design, innovation specific to performance, but really unlocking design that people are attracted to, color stories, and performance features that we see having a direct impact on the balance of the line as we've really shored up the pinnacle.","The Urban Exploration piece that was so strong in Asia, a big part of our results in Europe are driven around the Urban Exploration, particularly the Black Series. Our early reads here in the United States are equally strong. The interest in collaborations with the brand is another proof point. But just as we go out and launch marketing campaigns, the online digital piece and the connections that we're getting with consumers, all of that kind of adds up to us confidently stating 6% to 8% growth rate for next year.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. And if I can just ask a clarification for Scott, just on the $3.45 EPS guide for fiscal 2019, is that constant currency, or does that \u2013 or are you including currency in there? Thank you.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","That's all in, Erinn.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Okay.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","And just as a reminder, too, Nautica is treated as discontinued operations, so Nautica is not included in that number as well. And from an FX standpoint, just to clarify a comment I made a little earlier, so we do see some FX benefit on the top line in the transition period, in the stub. As you look at fiscal 2019, it really is not much of a factor from a revenue standpoint. So my comments were related to the stub period on the earlier question.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. Thank you, guys.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Erinn.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Thanks, Erinn.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie Group. Please proceed with your question.","Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Pretty impressive growth in EMEA. Can you parse out what's driving the growth in EMEA? Are there any design and marketing takeaways that can translate to driving growth in the Americas? And then specifically for 2019, any high-level thoughts on how we should think of the U.S. versus abroad results for 2017?","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Yeah, Laurent, I'll take the EMEA, kind of what's driving that. Scott can unpack the second part of your question. The growth in EMEA is really, it's broad-based. Every one of our businesses is doing extremely well. We have exceptional growth coming from North Face and Vans, but I also would call out the efforts that are going on with our Napapijri business, and really the incubator concept that we've given to that brand to try out new ideas that we are able to then scale across our larger businesses. Some of those are around the creative brand vision work that we're doing and how that's impacting the clarity of design, not just a product, but demand creation.","Our Napapijri business has been growing double digits here for a few quarters and continues to show great strength. But more importantly, it's where we are testing new ideas that are having positive impact as we scale them to the larger brands. So Europe is really broad-based. All of our brands do extremely well. They're focused on key account management, D2C productivity, and really the growth now on the digital area, not only our own platform, but with some of our partners like Zalando, really it's a balanced approach to driving the European growth model.","Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay, and any high-level thoughts for 2019, fiscal 2019, versus U.S. and international?","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","We'll see the U.S. accelerate versus the 2017 rate, as we see some of the recovery and progress being made, that Steve mentioned earlier. But we do see continued strength in Europe. They're really not missing a beat. I always have to point out too, the profitability and efficient tax platform we have in Europe makes, the fact that this business is growing, has momentum, an even bigger weapon for us going forward.","Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay, great. And then a follow-up question is, in terms of the stub quarter's guidance, I just want to be sure this is excluding Nautica. And should we assume the $427 million in revenues were evenly split by quarter, and then the same thing for the EPS? And then the last question is, how much are you expecting to spend on Icebreaker?","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Boy, that was a lot of questions, Laurent.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Wow, okay.","Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Sorry, guys.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","So again, I think the first part of that was related to Nautica. So Nautica is excluded from all of our guidance and our actuals, and I think you'll find in the materials that were provided, we restated historical numbers so you can see that. Remind me that you had a weighting question.","Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Is it evenly split by quarter, the revenues and the EPS contribution from Nautica?","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","More second half weighted due to their D2C business. So again, I think you'll find that offline we could clean that up, but because D2C is a big part of their business, that tends to be a drag to the first part and they see relative better performance in the second half.","Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","And then a question \u2013 yeah, sorry, you asked a question \u2013 were you asking around accretion or what was the question relative to?","Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Yeah. How much do you expect to spend on Icebreaker? Any high-level thoughts on EPS contribution for the year?","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Yeah. So we haven't disclosed the amount on Icebreaker at this point. As you think about the contribution, it's about $150 million business, which means our total Merino business is in that $300 million range when you include Smartwool. As you can imagine, in the first year of acquisition from an accretion standpoint, it's going to be minimal, but it will be accretive in year one.","Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you very much, and best of luck.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Sam Poser with Susquehanna International Group. Please proceed with your question.","Sam Poser - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Good morning. I just have a couple of things. One, just to clarify on The North Face and the U.S. wholesale business, this is a matter of cleaning up distribution and I think, Steve, when I saw you in Denver, you mentioned like some of the better guys are starting to come back to you. Is that sort of what it is, that some of your better accounts may have backed off because of the distribution, and now that you're cleaning it up, you expect it to come back the other way?","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","It's a couple of those. I might characterize it slightly differently. Yes, we put a tremendous amount of effort in pulling down the promotional part of the brand that we've seen the last two to three years. That's not only in the wholesale channel through tighter inventory, but also within our own D2C environments, all to really put the brand back onto a much higher quality and we're seeing the results in not only our profitability, but in our partners' profitability.","I think it's fair to say that we did have some dealers kind of moderate their assortments with our brand, but I would tell you it was as much what was going on in the broader marketplace, which we were part of, we weren't the only issue within the promotional environment that hit the outdoor industry.","But I would also tell you, and we've been pretty honest about this, is our product offer wasn't necessarily giving those better specialty dealers all of the reasons to invest their open buy with us. We're seeing that turn. I think you saw that energy in Denver, and it takes time to kind of refill that pipeline. But I think that is exactly why we remain confident and are putting that 6 to 8 percentage growth for 2019 out in front of you all today.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","So, Sam, if you just put some numbers around that, it would be 1 to 2 points higher base if you normalized for reductions in off-price, lower promotional activity, the cleanup of Amazon that Steve mentioned in his prepared remarks. So the underlying trend is a bit better. But we're really seeing that payoff in our margins. You see that in our results, and also really focusing on our dealer and customer profitability as well, because that's really the key to the long-term growth for our business.","Sam Poser - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","I've got two-and-a-half things more. One, the Urban Exploration, part of that business is coming to the States. What's the timing there? Two, how do you foresee the tax rate going forward? And three, in your preliminary guidance for fiscal 2019, is that a situation where the investments remain strong and you expect ongoing gross margin improvement?","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","So, Sam, I'd love to answer that tax question, but I'll let Scott go with that one. I'll take your Urban Exploration. Some of the exciting parts of that line that are coming out of Asia, China, and in Japan are here today. The Black Series is in market and you'll see it continue to grow. And there'll be some really exciting aspects of some of the GOLDWIN line, really leveraging that partnership that you'll see coming into not only in this market, but also the European market, as we really spend time understanding the importance of the Urban Exploration assortment, what are the right offers across the different points, the distribution that that consumer shops in, and leveraging the global product offer, not just Asia, but there are some exciting things are coming out of Europe that we see driving that growth. And there's things coming out of our U.S. team, the Cryos Collection is here, so it's really unlocking that global design talent and tapping into what that consumer is looking for and placing the right product in the right points of distribution.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","All right. I'll take the other parts of your question. So tax rate, maybe I would just make a broader question, because I know it's on a lot of people's mind, tax reform, what does that mean for us? I guess, the first answer is really complicated and a lot of moving parts. But we're comfortable enough to make the provisional \u2013 record the provisional amounts that we talked about in the prepared remarks. As it relates to the ongoing rate, one thing to keep in mind is, we already had a pretty attractive rate. Our rate was in the high-teens and really very much benefited from our foreign rate.","So if you look at what tax reform did to us, our domestic earnings are getting a tax benefit from the lower \u2013 the 21% rate. Offshore, with the GILTI and BEAT provisions, it actually is a bit of an increase for us. Even though that's recorded on the U.S. side, it's related to foreign earnings. And when you net it all together, it's a very modest benefit. It's almost back to the starting point from our overall business. So it is modestly beneficial, but doesn't move the needle much and really doesn't change anything as it relates to our long-term assumptions.","On the other hand, the access to cash is a big deal. So, because now that 40% of our business is offshore, it's a very profitable business for us, the ability to repatriate that cash just got a lot easier. And for us, going forward, that's going to be a good thing.","As it relates to fiscal 2019 guidance, I think there's a question about how do you think about margins and investments, right? So, obviously, we're not going to give guidance in detail, but a few shaping comments. There's no reason you shouldn't expect gross margin to continue to expand based on those mix benefits that we talked about, that 40 to 50 basis points of mix. You should be able to assume that that's going to continue.","As it relates to investments, the way we think about investments is from a long-term perspective. We laid out our plan in Boston. We said these are the areas that we think are important, that will create a defendable long-term position of advantage for us in a very disruptive marketplace, and we're serious about investing over the long term.","And the way we're thinking about it is the shareholder gets the first bite of the apple. We're going to meet our commitments and we are meeting our commitments according to our long-range plan. On the other hand, where we see opportunities to advance against our investment roadmaps, we'll also take those opportunities. So there is continued investment that will come, although we said in our long-range plan, the investment will be more front-loaded in that five-year period and will start to be a lesser factor as you go forward. And as the top line increases, you'll start to see more leverage as time goes on.","One other just housekeeping item, don't forget WD. As WD comes in next year, that is dilutive to our gross margin. So my 40 to 50 basis points is really relative to the organic business. There will be some offset due to the mix of WD coming in, as you saw this year. You can assume a similar kind of impact as you annualize the impact for next year.","Sam Poser - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you very much.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Thanks, Sam.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Thanks, Sam.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Camilo Lyon with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.","Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Hey, Camilo.","Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Scott, if you could, just provide a little bit more color on the Nautica impact to the quarter, because by my math, it's about $0.03 to what the fourth quarter would have been. And then how does that contextualize for your fiscal 2019 guidance? I'm just trying to figure out what the apples-to-apples comparison is versus \u2013 the preliminary FY 2019 guidance versus what I think we have all been looking for modeling.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","So your $0.03 is about right in the fourth quarter; about $140 million of revenue. And I've got Joe sitting right next to me here. We're going to clean this up. I think in the restated \u2013 since we're going disc-ops, in the restated numbers you can see where we were and where we are now. So the impact of that should be transparent by quarter. We can take that offline if you want to clean that up a little bit. But I think we provided everything you need in order to get the answer by quarter. Joe, you're welcome to add anything to that if you want.","Joe Alkire - VF Corp.","No, that's right.","Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. And then I guess just thinking about the commentary on North Face, the actions taken to improve the positioning of the brand, I think you said it was 1 to 2 points. That was a global number, right, if we exclude all those numbers? So if we were to back that into what the North America growth rate would have been, would you care to comment on what that could've been?","Joe Alkire - VF Corp.","Camilo, it's Joe. So for The North Face North America business, those impacts primarily reside in North America. So relative to the 1% decline that you see, that number would be up at a mid-single-digit rate.","Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Got it, perfect. And my last question, Steve, really goes back to Vans and the exceptional growth that the brand has enjoyed over the last year or so. You talked about protecting the brand. You talked about not letting it overheat. What does that mean to how you're going to manage the brand into the wholesale channel and your DTC, right? Are you going to constrict some of the deliveries into the wholesale channel? Are you going to limit some of the inventory across the channel? Are you going to segment the styles further? How do you plan to maintain a double-digit growth rate, as you alluded to, so that this doesn't roll over, like we've seen other brands do in the not-too-distant past?","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Good question, Camilo. In my prepared comments, I talked about not one thing as part of the Vans strategic approach to their marketplace. And you can see it in where the growth is coming from, from Classics, but also some of the new collections, the UltraRange, the new Mountain series. We see growth in apparel. We see growth in the accessories, but we're also seeing great expansion into the Customs platform. So it's a broad-based \u2013 not one thing, but an intense focus on the right amount of newness, the frequency of new drops.","But we've said this before, our Vans team is really the benchmark business on how they look at product segmentation across the different consumer touch points that we have to sell into, with our stores being the most premier expression of our brand. They're really evolving how they're looking at using stores and coming up with a mix of formats that play into the specific communities across the globe, but being very thoughtful, and direct partnerships with those wholesale partners, placing the right amount of inventory, being very thoughtful about not having one style over-torque, but really having it be a balanced approach with the right amount of newness to keep the brand moving forward each season. So they are the benchmark business for us. A lot of what our Vans team has learned and does, we move across the entire enterprise.","Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Is it fair to say that you're getting a new consumer into the brand as opposed to your existing consumer that's buying multiple pairs relative to what they had been buying before? And if that is true, you guys do a ton of consumer work in understanding who that consumer is. How do you maintain or how do you dig deeper with that new consumer, if that in fact is what's driving the incremental growth rate?","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","There is for sure a new consumer entering this brand, and our team is focused on that creative expressor and understanding what those touch paints are and the things that are important to that consumer, being able to really bring that to life in all of our digital communications within our platform, and then all the different mediums that we have available. We spend a lot of time understanding our consumer, our investments behind data and analytics specifically in the consumer area, being able to evolve our messaging from broad-based to now very individualized conversations, to really make that consumer feel unique and special and being able to offer up what we believe through our data science what that next appropriate item is for them to add to their collection of Vans product.","Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Got it, guys. Thanks very much and good luck.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Thanks, Camilo.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Jonathan Komp with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Jonathan R. Komp - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah, hi. I wanted to clarify a couple things about the commentary about the fiscal 2019 outlook. The first thing I know, Scott, you said about $3.45. I just wanted to clarify the base for that. I think it's in the range of $3.12, but I wanted to confirm that.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Yes, you're right, $3.12 is \u2013 you're in the zip code.","Jonathan R. Komp - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. My question then is that would be about 11% growth, which I know is in line with your long-term targets, but you will be having the Dickies contribution plus I think maybe some favorable currency margin impacts. So I just wanted to drill down why the underlying growth might be below the long-term target.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","So we'll unpack that, obviously, and give you the details. Currency is actually not a huge impact for the 2019 number. But I would say when you look at the underlying organic growth, you're right. It is right in line with our overall long-term growth plan. And we'll give you more visibility into what exactly the contribution is from Dickies when we come back in April.","I would just point everybody back, remember where we are point in time on this five-year plan, right? We're one year in, and this is a period where we talked about relatively modest growth, which we're tracking a little bit ahead, and that's true both from a top and bottom line. So that really is what's shaping our long-term view. We're taking a long-term view as we think about the evolution of both our earnings profile, as well as the decisions that we're making, and that will give you a pretty good guidepost as you think about what to expect going forward.","Jonathan R. Komp - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And last clarification just if I could on Dickies. On the fourth quarter itself, I think it attributed or added $0.04 in earnings. I think you had said $0.02 coming into the quarter. So was that operating over delivery or was that some sort of tax benefit for the domestic business there? Just trying to clarify what drove that and if it has any implications going forward.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","It's really operating and it says we got it a few things a little quicker than we thought. But from an overall standpoint, gives us a little more confidence in our forward plans, but it's not materially different. They had a good fourth quarter. We said international and their retail actually was very strong in the fourth quarter, and that really drove a lot of it, as well as getting at some costs a little bit earlier.","Jonathan R. Komp - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Steve Rendle for any closing remarks.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Great. Thank you, everybody. Just a quick recap. We're coming off a transformational year for VF, highlighted by our top quartile value creation for our shareholders. We are very encouraged by our progress. I think we've been very open and transparent with where we are and where we intend to drive this enterprise. And today, we're slightly ahead of where we expected to be.","As we move forward, just be reassured that we have an intense focus on our brand portfolio, one, the shape of it, but also helping drive the brands to achieve their maximum potential with our focus around product, demand creation, elevating our D2C and our digital, and leveraging our international platforms to drive growth. We will continue to accelerate our investment around becoming more consumer and retail-centric. We see this as foundational to us evolving as an enterprise specifically for our consumers, where we come to life on our own D2C and digital platforms, but will also enable us to be an even better wholesale partner to our wholesale trade across the globe. We will continue to be intently focused on operational efficiency and creating capacity for growth, while being very, very attentive delivering to our shareholder commitments.","So thank you for being with us today. We're excited to continue our conversations in the quarters to come.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day."],"21563":["VF Corp.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Lance Allega, VP of IR. Please go ahead, sir.","Lance Allega - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to VF's second quarter 2016 results. I'd like to remind everyone that participates on today's call we'll make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to certain uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These uncertainties are detailed in documents filed regularly with the SEC.","Unless otherwise noted, amounts that our participants refer to on today's call will be predominantly in currency-neutral terms which we've defined in the press release that was issued at 6:55 a.m. Eastern Time this morning. We use currency-neutral amounts as lead numbers in our discussion because we feel it more accurately represents the true operational performance and underlying results of our businesses and brands.","You may also hear us refer to reported amounts which are in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These amounts include the impact from foreign currency exchange rates. Reconciliations of GAAP measures to currency-neutral amounts can be found in the supplemental financial information included with the press release which identify and quantify all excluded items.","On June 30, we announced an agreement to sell our Contemporary Brands business which includes the 7 for All Mankind, Splendid and Ella Moss brands. Appropriately, we have classified the assets and liabilities of these businesses as held for sale and therefore have moved their results into discontinued operations.","Therefore, unless otherwise noted, results presented on today's call are based on continuing operations. Removing this business from the mix impacts the P&L for both 2015 and 2016 and we have furnished a full year 2015 P&L which designates the impacts. There is more detail in the press release we issued this morning.","Joining us on today's call will be VF Chairman and CEO, Eric Wiseman; President and COO, Steve Rendle; President of our International Business, Karl Heinz Salzburger; and our CFO, Scott Roe. Following the prepared remarks, we'll open the call for questions and ask that you limit yourself to two questions per caller. Thanks. Eric?","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Lance. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2016 earnings call. All global companies operate in diverse and complicated environments. In over both the short and long-term, VF has been very consistent in our ability to effectively manage our business under a variety of conditions. We are a company with many capabilities, many opportunities and great confidence in our ability to execute. This doesn't happen by luck or accident but comes from experience, judgment and a track record of consistency. Our consistency is built on an unparalleled focus on our consumers, optimizing product in retail innovation and superior financial discipline, which together push our operational capabilities to even greater levels. This complements our obsession with a total performance-based approach to shareholder return.","The second quarter, although our smallest by revenue and profit, is exactly the quarter where consistency plays a critical role in supporting any year at VF, and this year is no exception. I'm pleased to report that our second quarter results were a little better than our expectations and that our first half of 2016 came in as promised. And the fact that this came in as promised gives us great confidence in our ability to deliver on our outlook for the full year.","So let's dig down a little bit. Revenue for the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition was up 2%, driven by a 6% increase in Vans and 2% growth in The North Face. This was tempered by a 7% decline in Timberland, which was softer than we expected, but overall the coalition was in line with where we thought we'd be 90 days ago.","Jeanswear posted its seventh consecutive quarter of mid-single digit growth with revenue up 6% and balanced in both brands and in all regions, a truly impressive performance by our Jeanswear team. Our Imagewear coalition, which grew 3%, featured our fastest growing business and brand of the quarter with a mid-teen increase in our Licensed Sports Group, driven by nearly 30% growth from our Majestic brand. Congratulations to the dedicated team in that business who clearly delivered for us in the quarter.","To round it out, our Sportswear business saw revenue decline 19%, a result driven by a very challenging U.S. department store and outward environment. And though we expect this environment to remain challenging, we expect this business to modestly improve in the balance of the year.","In February, we said that we intended to take a focused and proactive look at the composition of our portfolio to ensure we are well-positioned to maximize growth and return to shareholders. During the quarter, we announced that VF had signed an agreement to sell our Contemporary Brands business, which includes 7 For All Mankind, Splendid and Ella Moss to Delta Galil Industries. This announcement demonstrates that our work as active portfolio managers is progressing, and while it's certainly hard to part with people we've come to know, respect and like, we have every confidence that this talented and passionate group is on the best path for long-term success.","You're also aware that we're exploring strategic alternatives for our LSG business within the Imagewear coalition. This process is ongoing, and we'll update you when we have something more to report.","Now, back to some highlights. Our second quarter direct-to-consumer business was up 7%, including mid-teen international growth and a low single-digit increase in the U.S., and this growth was balanced. In fact, on a global basis 9 of our 10 largest brands saw revenue increases. Our e-commerce business continued strong momentum as well, with revenue up nearly 30%. In line with expectations, our wholesale business was flat globally, as many partners continue working through inventory from last winter and a sluggish first half of 2016, trends we expect to continue into our third quarter. Our international sales were up 7% overall, with Europe up 3%, Asia up 6% and our non-U.S. Americas region growing 20%.","Gross margin on a reported basis improved slightly to 48.1% and reported earnings per share was $0.35, so a penny better than our original outlook, but in line to support our full year EPS expectation of 5% growth.","Looking into the second half of 2016 with 60% of our revenue and 70% of our earnings still ahead of us, we have resolute confidence in our ability to deliver on our full year outlook. And to address head-on, what some have called out as concerns, I'd tell you that, yes, we do in fact have wholesale orders in hand and D2C additions in both brick and click to support this expected growth. Yes, our wholesale order book is more fourth quarter weighted than in 2015. Yes, retailers do have a cautious outlook on winter, and that too is baked in. And finally, yes, our outlook is fourth quarter heavy, yet we are up against what is by far our weakest comparison of the year, which I'll remind you was down 1% in 2015, so math's on our side as well.","That said, you can expect to see VF continue to drive brand energy through product innovation and closer connections with our consumers. We'll continue to leverage the power of our portfolio to deliver long-term improvements in gross margin, drive SG&A productivity and improve overall profitability to maximize shareholder returns. It's what you come to expect from VF and what we expect from ourselves. Over to Steve.","Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Thanks, Eric. Starting with the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition, revenue was up 2% in the second quarter driven by a low-double digit increase in D2C and a low-single digit decrease in wholesale. This result was about what we expected 90 days ago, and keep in mind, the second quarter is Outdoor & Action Sports' smallest quarter of the year both from a revenue and earnings perspective. So in total, we checked the box.","Now, let's take a look at VF largest brands. Globally, second quarter revenue for The North Face was up 2%, driven by more than 20% growth in D2C, which was offset by a high single digit decline in wholesale. In the Americas region, revenue was up at a low single digit rate, with more than 20% growth in D2C, which included strong e-commerce results. On the wholesale side, revenue was down at a high single digit rate due to bankruptcies and an order book that is planned later in the year, which will naturally shift the majority of growth to the fourth quarter.","During the second quarter, warmer weather categories including sportswear product and accessories saw significant momentum and were up 40% and 60% respectively. In men's fleece sales doubled, driven by a strategic shift to broaden our assortment of technical styles. In women's, newer silhouettes like the Tomales Bay jacket are also seeing strong response, and we're very proud that Outside Magazine featured several North Face products in their Summer Buyer's Guide, including our Favero 70 pack, which won Outside Magazine's Gear of the Year award. This demonstrates that our continued focus to broaden our spring\/summer assortment is working.","We're also supporting our spring\/summer relevancy through consumer experiences, like our Endurance Challenge Series of trail races, which drew over 13,000 attendees across events this past spring, and community workouts that we sponsor twice a week in San Francisco, Boston, Chicago, New York and D.C.","In April, The North Face relocated its Palo Alto, California store and significantly elevated the retail experience through highly curated merchandising and digital storytelling. Through innovative interior sky windows, information is displayed about North Face's global athlete team, weather forecasts, topographic maps and community information. During the opening weekend, North Face virtual reality was featured, which is an immersive 360\u00b0, 3D video and audio experience that virtually drops viewers into outdoor landscapes such as Moab, Yosemite and Nepal, an innovative example and a living lab that represents how we're starting to transform consumer experiences in our own retail stores and one of many that we plan to scale in the upcoming months. Now to K.H.","Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President & Group President, International","Good morning, everyone. The North Face European business had another strong quarter with revenues up at the low teen rate, driven by more than 25% growth in DTC and a mid-single digit increase in our wholesale business. And the growth was balanced and broad-based too, with double-digit increases in the U.K., Germany, Benelux, Italy and Spain.","A great product highlight was our footwear business, which grew more than 20%. This was supported by marketing campaigns and product styles to help build on the momentum the team has been working on. Our Mountain Athletics collection across Europe had a successful start to the year with over 60% sell-through in wholesale and a 60% increase in DTC.","In Asia, second quarter revenue was down at the mid-teen rate, which was about in line with our expectations. This result was driven by low double-digit growth in DTC, including more than 35% growth in the e-commerce business, which was offset by weak wholesale results due in part to timing of shipments. We expect the region to continue sequential improvement and return to growth in the fourth quarter.","During the quarter, we launched our Water Adventure Series, which features sustainable products, including waterproof jackets and bags. In April, we launched our outdoor training category, which features durable, breathable materials maximized for running and training outdoors. To drive visibility in China and Hong Kong, we continue to host free outside group workout sessions, led by experienced trainers. Social engagement around this effort has already seen more than 16 million social impressions. Globally, the first half of 2016 finished well for The North Face and we are right on track to reach our full year expectations of mid-single digit growth. Now, on to Vans.","Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Vans global revenue was up 6% in the second quarter with a mid-teen increase in D2C and flat wholesale results. With nice sequential improvement from the first quarter, regional, product and channel performances were in line with our plan.","Looking at regions, in the Americas, revenue was up at a high-single digit rate with a low-double digit increase in D2C, including over 25% growth in e-commerce and a mid-single digit increase in wholesale.","During the quarter, Vans showed the strength of its diverse classics offerings, specifically the Sk8-Hi and Old Skool side stripes styles driving strong momentum with meaningful increases in women's sell-through. This success bodes well as we look at scaling a number of new silhouettes in the upcoming seasons.","During the quarter, Vans launched another exciting collaboration with Nintendo celebrating their iconic video game heritage, including an extensive collection of footwear, apparel and accessories featuring Nintendo's extensive cast of iconic characters. The social media reception to this collaboration has been phenomenal and it's performing well against expectations which is no easy feat given it's up against the massive Disney launch of last year's second quarter. With Vans kicking off its 50th anniversary year on March 16, the spring was packed with events across the country. In May, we continued our programming at the House of Vans in New York, which included music, creative workshops and documentary screenings.","In June, the Vans Warped Tour kicked off its 22nd year, bringing music, Vans culture and fans together for more than 40 stops around the country, and tomorrow the U.S. Open of Surfing kicks off in Huntington Beach where the world's elite in surfing, skateboard and BMX reach for the podium. As a complete immersion into Vans' culture, this festival-wide celebration of action sports, creative expression and youth culture is about as core as it gets.","Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President & Group President, International","Vans revenue in Europe was down at the high-single digit rate, the low-double digit increase in DTC offset by a mid-teen decline in wholesale. These results were on track with what we expected 90 days ago as the business continues to manage through elevated inventory. With a slight decline in Vans Europe expected in Q3, we continue to make progress and expect the business will return to growth in the fourth quarter. In Europe, Old Skool and Sk8-Hi were also very successful, strengthened by high-impact window executions at retail.","Nintendo was also a success in Europe as we integrated the launch with in-store activations, House of Vans launch event and wholesale specific programs. Notably, on the first day of the Nintendo launch, e-commerce had its best sales day ever.","In Asia, Vans revenue was up mid-teens driven by more than 30% DTC growth and a mid-single digit increase in our wholesale business. E-commerce definitely played a significant role in these results by nearly doubling its business. And similar to the Americas and Europe, Nintendo was a hit with more than 50% sell-through in the first four weeks and e-commerce sell-through of more than 70%, driven by impressive brand activations at key stores, including our retail lab in Korea, so very pleased with these results.","With the first half behind us and the momentum building for Vans globally, there are no changes to our full year outlook for high-single digit growth. Now, on to Timberland.","Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Timberland global revenue was down 7%, with a low-single digit increase in D2C offset by a low-double digit decline in wholesale sales. While these results were for the most part in line with our expectations for the brand's smallest quarter, as we enter the second half of the year, we have seen higher than anticipated inventory levels, particularly in our Americas business, and anticipate a more challenging sales environment. Accordingly, we're electing to take a more conservative view for the balance of 2016 as this product works through the channel.","Similar to the context for Vans Europe, we are confident that this is a short-term inventory imbalance versus a brand issue and we're tempering sell-in for a quarter or two to allow inventory to normalize. Timberland continues to outperform its competition, including market share gains and the brand health metrics that we track including awareness, conversion and sell-through remain strong. In fact, sell-through rates are healthy, which gives us great confidence that this will be a short-term, normalizing some times in the fourth quarter.","Taking a look at the Americas, revenue was down at a high-teen rate, with wholesale business down 20% and D2C down at a mid-single digit rate. Keep in mind that three quarters of Timberland's D2C business in the Americas is outlet-based, which as you know is a channel that has seen reduced traffic. Notable in the mix, however, was a 25% increase in e-commerce, so solid online growth. Product wise, men's boots continue to be relevant with strong sell-through in wholesale. Our distinctive Timberland Boot Company collection, driven by a new micro site launch, saw a nice pickup in the quarter, a solid validation of the brand's reach given the collection's premium price points.","On the women's side of the business, we continue to be very encouraged by the progress Timberland is making. Families like the Amherst and Newport Bay drove D2C women's casual comps up nearly 30% in full price and 50% in e-commerce. Contributing to this momentum, we launched our biggest spring effort ever through a partnership with Marie Claire, a program that ran across digital, print and in-store, driving digital engagement up over 80% versus last year.","And finally, with oil rig counts reaching an all-time low in May, the entire Workwear category, including our Industrial Pro business remains under significant pressure.","Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President & Group President, International","Revenue in Europe was up at a high-single digit rate for the quarter, driven by low-teen DTC growth. A huge contributor to this came from our e-commerce channel where the brand transitioned to VF's global digital platform, enabling faster, closer consumer engagement and more effective handling of the site. The wholesale channel increased as well by a mid-single digit rate.","Looking at products, after a very successful SensorFlex campaign, we drove traffic through summer heritage collections in men's and women's boat shoes. With our new advertising campaign in digital and traditional media, we doubled our consumer reach and executed a seamless campaign in more than 600 store windows. In apparel, we continued our improvement of the product in terms of fit, fabric and style, and did see very nice progress with our spring 2016 collections, driving low-double digit growth in the quarter. So strong progress there.","Similarly, Asian revenue was down high-single digits primarily from weakness in traffic and spending in Hong Kong and Japan, its largest market in the region. E-commerce was a large driver for the quarter with more than 50% growth including apparel, which was up more than 60% in China. In June, we opened a new workshop retail store in Shanghai, and we have seen strong early results.","We're taking a prudent approach to the second half, and we now expect low-single digit global revenue growth for Timberland in 2016. Now to Jeanswear.","Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","In the second quarter, our global Jeanswear business was up 6% with strong growth across both Wrangler and Lee. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter of mid-single digit growth for the Jeanswear coalition. So once again, hats off to the global team.","In the Americas region, Jeanswear revenues were up at a mid-single digit rate, driven by a mid-single digit increase for Wrangler and a low-double digit increase for Lee. Wrangler's mass business remains strong with a high-single digit increase that marks the ninth consecutive quarter of growth for that business. The story there remains the same, a strong, collaborative retail partnership with the mutual goal of bringing innovation and value to consumers.","Our innovation story is stronger than ever. Wrangler Advanced Comfort outdoor performance shorts and Riders by Lee denim shorts and capris each saw meaningful increases in the channel. In contrast, and a trend we've spoken about over the past few quarters, our Western Specialty business was down as the oil and gas exploration communities continue to be hard hit.","Lee saw excellent consumer response to the new, innovative X-Treme Comfort men's casual pant that has led to market share expansion and wholesale growth through new shelf space as well as expanded distribution. And in a nod to the ultimate blend of elegance and performance, American ballet star, Misty Copeland, is pictured wearing Lee Dream Jean in the August issue of Cosmopolitan magazine. We saw very strong retail sales of Lee's seasonal products, including shorts and capris, especially once the weather turned warmer in May.","Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President & Group President, International","In Europe, revenue for the Jeanswear coalition was up at a high-single digit rate, driven by a mid-teen increase for Lee and a mid-single digit increase for Wrangler. Lee saw great success in the quarter, driven by positive results across all categories. A couple of highlights include continuing double-digit trends in our top 10 accounts, our at-once business and a strong start for our new Scarlett for women and Rider for men products.","Wrangler saw strength in both the wholesale and e-commerce businesses. During the quarter, we launched an out-of-home marketing campaign across Poland, Germany and Italy that boosted region sell-through for our fall 2016 products.","In Asia, Jeanswear revenue was up at low-single digit rate with a mid-single digit increase in Lee, moderated by a slight decline in the Wrangler business. Lee's online sales more than doubled, helped significantly by the Jade Fusion 2.0 launch. Jade Fusion also led to outstanding digital metrics and achieved a record high social engagement of almost 2 million followers in key Chinese markets. For the full year globally, there is no change to the expectation of mid-single digit revenue growth in Jeanswear. Now, to Imagewear.","Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Second quarter Imagewear revenue was up 3%, with our LSG business up mid-teens, offset by a mid-single digit decline in the Workwear business which, similar to Timberland and Wrangler, continue to be impacted by weakness in the energy-related sector. In LSG, Major League Baseball jersey demand was strong aided by continued success of the Cool Base replica jersey, as well as the addition of three new teams in the Japanese professional league. In the NBA, the Cavaliers' Championship delivered strong results for the license portfolio.","On the Workwear side, while we continue to see consistent strength in Red Kap's automotive shop gear line, it should be no surprise that with oil rig counts at historic lows, both Red Kap and Bulwark sales were down in the quarter. Given that, we'll begin to lap this decline in the second half and we do expect this business to return to modest growth in the fourth quarter. For the full year, globally there is no change to the expectation that Imagewear revenue will be up at a low-single digit rate.","Our Sportswear business was down 19% in the quarter due to traffic declines in both wholesale and D2C. Revenue at Nautica was down 20% due to the same challenges we've seen in the past few quarters, including heavy discounting and promotional environments in the U.S. department store channel, our strategic decision to license the women's sleepwear and men's underwear business and traffic declines at outlet where we've closed seven stores this year.","Kipling's North America business was down 16% also due to challenging category and channel performance. Kipling's global business was up 3% driven by strength in both wholesale and D2C in Europe and Asia Pacific. Accordingly, we're now expecting a low-double digit decline in revenues for the full year for our Sportswear coalition. And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.","Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thanks, Steve. On our last call, I spoke about VF's diverse business model and our consistent operational discipline. This discipline provides us with exceptional flexibility to deliver our financial commitments. As you know, this quarter produced some additional noise into the mix of our year, including the announcement of an agreement to divest our contemporary brands coalition, greater visibility into bankruptcies, short-term challenges for Timberland and ongoing weakness in our Sportswear business. Yet, even amid all this noise, we have multiple levers at our disposal that enable us to deliver another year of earnings growth and shareholder value.","So let's review our results. In the second quarter, currency-neutral revenue increased 1% to $2.4 billion. By coalition, Outdoor & Action Sports was up 2%, which is in line with expectations. Jeanswear continued its run with a 6% increase and Imagewear grew 3%. Partially offsetting this growth was a 19% decline in Sportswear which continues to face very challenging conditions.","By channel, direct-to-consumer revenue was up 7%, with low-double digit growth in our Outdoor & Action Sports business being tempered by a mid-teen decrease in our Sportswear coalition. Currency-neutral wholesale revenue was flat in the quarter.","By region, the Americas was up 1%, Europe up 3%, Asia up 6%. Internationally, that is outside of the U.S., our business was up 7% in the quarter. Gross margin was up slightly versus last year at 48.1% as benefits from pricing, lower product cost and mix were offset by FX and inventory management efforts.","In line with expectations, SG&A as a percentage of revenues increased 50 basis points as we continue to invest in key growth priorities, including D2C and product innovation. Our second quarter operating margin was down 40 basis points to 8.6%, which included 40 basis points of negative impact from currency.","Clicking down into profitability by coalition, on a reported basis, we see that Outdoor & Action Sports operating income was down 9% and operating margin was 8.7%, a decrease of 100 basis points compared to last year's second quarter. Continued investment in D2C, product design, innovation and demand creation pressured first half earnings in light of the tougher first half revenue comparisons, coupled with negative impact from FX in 2016. We expect this to normalize in the second half when profitability returns to historic levels.","Operating income in Jeanswear was up 4% in the quarter, with operating margin up 10 basis points to 17.3%, including the negative impact of FX. The strength in Jeanswear continues globally and we are very pleased with this, our seventh consecutive quarter of mid-single digit revenue growth.","Imagewear profit was up 3% and operating margin up 10 basis points to 14.3% due to strength in LSG offset by weakness on the Workwear side of the business. And finally, in Sportswear, operating income was down significantly and the story there remains the same: challenging department store and D2C conditions with traffic and category weakness.","So carrying all this to the bottom line, our reported earnings per share was $0.35 in the second quarter, slightly ahead of where we thought we'd be 90 days ago and overall where we thought we'd be halfway through this year. And keep in mind, this result includes a $0.06 headwind due to changes in net tax discretes compared to last year.","Regarding our balance sheet, inventories were up 6%, of which half remains that same cold weather carryover product we've spoken about on our last two calls. Our inventory is in line with our second half growth projections. During the quarter, we bought back 1.9 million shares of VF stock for $120 million, bringing our year-to-date total to $834 million, so tracking well against the $1 billion target we set in February.","Turning now to outlook, which like the rest of our results today are based on continuing operations, we now expect full year revenues to increase 3% to 4%, down from the previous mid-single digit expectation. If you take a step back to gain perspective, this change is really about two main factors. First, we now expect the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition to grow at a mid-single digit rate for the full year, down from the previous high-single digit outlook. This is due to bankruptcy in the sporting goods and action sports channel and revised outlook for Timberland based primarily on challenges in the Americas business. However, these elements while short-lived in nature do put enough pressure on the year for us to take Timberland's global outlook to a low-single digit growth versus the previous high-single digit increase.","The second factor is a lower outlook for our Sportswear business. For reasons previously discussed, we have updated our full year expectations to a low-double digit decline versus the previous expectation of slight declines. Gross margin is expected to improve by 50 basis points reaching 48.7%. Now, keep in mind the contemporary business carried a higher-than-VF-average gross margin, so when adjusted for this in continuing operations, 2015's gross margin is 10 basis points lower at 48.2%.","Operating margin is expected to reach 14.5% which includes about 60 basis points of FX, so right around 15% for the full year excluding currency. Note that while the exclusion of contemporary brands hurt gross margin, it helps operating margin.","With respect to tax rate, our outlook for the full year is now about 21% versus the previous about 23%, due to a beneficial shift in mix, new policies related to the treatment of equity comp and longer-term improvements we're making in our global tax structure. At the bottom line, reported earnings per share is expected to increase 5% to $3.20, up 11% currency-neutral compared to EPS from continuing operations of $3.04 in 2015. So even after adjusting for Contemporary, we've maintained the same growth rate we targeted in February.","For the second half of the year, we expect revenue growth to be up about 5% with a low-single digit increase in the third quarter, followed by a high-single digit increase in the fourth quarter. With respect to earnings cadence, we expect second half reported EPS to increase at a low-teen percentage rate with a high-single digit increase in the third quarter and a mid- to high-teen increase in the fourth quarter, our easiest comparison of the year.","So to recap the changes to our 2016 outlook, revenue should grow 3% to 4%, down a bit due to bankruptcies, Timberland and Sportswear impacts. Gross margin expansion remains the same, and we took out $0.03 from the bottom line based on what Contemporary Brands would have directly contributed this year.","Flexibility, operational excellence, strong cash flow and balance sheet and strategic financial management, from any angle, our model allows us to transcend short term challenges and consistently deliver total shareholder return, and more importantly, it enables us to continue investing in our business and aggressively manage inventories for the long-term without sacrificing shareholder returns along the way. We believe this combination uniquely positions us to accelerate growth and profitability when the overall environment returns to greater strength.","And with that, we'll turn it back over to the operator and open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our first question comes from Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for all the detail today. Very helpful. I just want to ask one quick Vans question, then I had a bigger picture question. On Vans, that was better than we thought in the second quarter given some of the trends. You guys had talked about pretty consistently that it was going to be back half story. But the guidance for the year was always partly based on things that were not in your direct control, there's some inventory from competitors out there in the U.S. with some of the data sources we see, we see other brands making big pushes on market share. Can you just talk to us about the second half and how you guys think about the competitive landscape for Vans and how much you bake that into the thinking for the improvement there?","Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, Michael, this is Steve. I'll start with the Americas and K.H. maybe will want to add some things from an Asia standpoint. So we've called the year at high single digits and we're pretty much tracking right on plan, seeing great strength in our D2C, most notably e-commerce and then just good solid performance in wholesale. Second half, really don't see the changing dramatically. The strength of the brand continues. We talked about the power of our Classics collection with side stripes really performing extremely well and we've got new innovations with Classic Lights, our ISO program and then our Pro Classics where we brought some real performance attributes into the skate platform, we think will just continue to drive us towards the guidance that we put forward at the beginning of the year of up high-single digits.","Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President & Group President, International","And, Michael, adding some color on the international side, starting with Asia. Asia is really doing well, as you heard me saying. It's doing well in DTC and wholesale, which gives us great confidence, no really big change. It's doing well in most Asian markets actually. Europe is a different picture. We reported that widely last time, Q1 was our worst quarter. Q2 is negative but better and we gradually plan to improve this going back to positive numbers in Q4. What gives us strong confidence also in Europe is our DTC numbers which are positive. That shows that the brand has resonated as well with consumers.","Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","And, Michael, I'd add real quick. We aren't seeing any changes in our wholesale orders due to competitors. And clearly, there's some competitors out there doing much better than they have historically, but from a Vans standpoint and our connection to our consumer, we stay right on track.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks a lot. You guys, I guess stepping back, you guys have always done a great job summarizing the big corporate goals for us and for the investors and for all the employees at the firm to focus on. It's been a while since we got the big goal of the long-term algorithm of 8% organic revenue growth and 13% EPS growth. But we've seen two headlines from you guys on dispositions this year. The end markets are in a different place than where they were when we first got the algorithm in 2013. So would you mind just helping us comment on how you think about those goals today and whether absent an acquisition how much more aggressive you could be with transforming the portfolio towards the highest performing businesses?","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, Michael. Eric. I'll take that question. Our organic growth rate goals remain intact. Clearly this year, we're off to a slower start given all the implications of last winter and the inventory hangover that we faced in the first half of this year. But when you step back and look at our organic growth rate, internationally we were up 7%. That tells us that against that 8% organic growth rate goal outside of the U.S., we're pretty much on track. The most confidence inspiring part of this for me is that in our direct-to-consumer business globally, we were up 7%. So being up 7% in our stores tells us that consumers are buying from us at the kind of growth rate that we have built into our long-term vision.","Unfortunately, that's only about 27% of our business. Our wholesale business is not experiencing that, but that's not to say that our wholesale business, the consumer take-out from our wholesalers isn't strong. What it says is that they have a lot of inventory and they're buying very cautiously. Our wholesale business is a reflection of what we're shipping to them this quarter for sale next quarter and not a reflection of consumer engagement.","So we still think we have the brand portfolio and we're doing the right things with our brands to engage consumers at a near 8% growth rate, even this year which is clearly a pretty challenging year around the world. Obviously, the shape of VF is going to change. It's much easier and easier to manage the timing of selling something than it is buying the right thing.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Right.","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We're actively managing our portfolio, working equally hard on both divestitures and on acquisitions. The timing of one is more predictable than the other, but we're committed to both.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks a lot, guys.","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Please go ahead, sir.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. So switching gears over to Timberland, by classification, where exactly are you seeing the inventory imbalance, whether it's footwear or apparel? And what gives you the confidence that this is a near-term issue and not something larger?","Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. So this is Steve. I'll start this question. So the inventory imbalance we talked about is primarily Americas issue and we see it primarily in our boots category. It really started to see this at the beginning of early Q2, both in our wholesale and pro business and it's truly a short-term inventory balance because what we see is just a little bit of inventory sitting in our channels coming out of last fourth quarter. And similar to our Vans Europe business, it's not a product or brand issue. We feel really good about our brand metrics, as I mentioned in my comments, and we see just over the next quarter or two getting that inventory to normalize. And why we're so confident about that is we've seen really good rates of sale through the first half that continue into the second half and that e-commerce growth rate of plus 25% continues to give us confidence around our ability to connect with the consumer and represent our brand in a really positive way.","So we see returning to growth in the second half low-single digit, mid-single digit despite we're coming up against a Q3 in 2015 where we grew over 40%. So that's, I would tell you, kind of frame up why we're positive is the brand continues strong. The sell-through rates are good. We just carried a little bit more inventory in the channels out of second half 2015 into first half that is normalizing now and will be clear as we come into Q3\/Q4.","Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President & Group President, International","Yeah, Matthew, I may be giving some international color starting with Europe. You heard me saying Europe is really strong. We're doing well in all channels. In wholesale, in DTC we have a new digital platform. We do well in most European countries, but we also do well in many categories of products. So it's a really good story there. Asia is a little bit different picture. We had planned a softer first semester and planned a stronger second semester. Remember, Q2 is our weakest quarter as well. So numbers are a little bit misleading. But specifically related to Hong Kong and Japan, but we expect Timberland going back to growth in Q3 and Q4.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And then just a follow-up on the larger picture model. As we think about the margin profile on the multi-year basis, has there been any change, it sounds like not through this year, but any change to the 50 basis points a year annual gross margin? It sounds like driven primarily by mix that's unchanged from the past. And then as we think about SG&A as a percentage of sales beyond this year, any reason to not think about that as more flattish going forward?","Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah. So, Matthew, the first question is, really no change at all in our outlook for continued margin expansion. And that's really driven by mix. Even this year 50 basis points is what we've talked about for the full year and that's really driven by that mix. So we see no reason why that won't continue. As it relates to SG&A, we really haven't talked longer-term beyond this year. As you can see, we are investing in SG&A this year and, again, that's really, we think, a strength of our model to be able to deliver EPS growth and, at the same time, invest in D2C, innovation, product, those key strategic drivers that are going to set us up for growth in the future.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Best of luck.","Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie.","Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good morning and thank you very much for taking my questions. I was hoping to follow up on your top line guidance for the year. Does it incorporate expectations for normal winter or colder than normal winter? Also, I think there were some comments in the prepared remarks that retailers are cautious regarding this winter. Is that a function of too much inventory or just weakness in the consumer?","Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah. So I'll start that and maybe the guys will jump in. In general, while we're considering this a normal winter from our standpoint, it's worth noting that our wholesale partners have taken a very conservative view of the year, right? And maybe some of these imbalances that historically would have just been tolerated, we now see much more aggressive action from a retail standpoint. Thus, some of the issues that we've seen from our wholesale shipment side.","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And I think just to follow that, the caution in our wholesale, retail community, we called that at the beginning of the year. We spoke a lot about how that's baked into our guidance. And what gives us real confidence about the power of our brands is the performance of our D2C growing high single digits this quarter and the strength of our e-commerce platform growing significantly. And as we expand our e-commerce platform to all of our largest brands, it's now moving internationally. Just again, it's a continued strength of how our brands are coming to life for our brands.","Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay, great. And then I wanted to follow up on the Outdoor & Action Sports double-digit increase and direct-to-consumer versus Sportswear mid-teen decline. Can you provide a bit \u2013 more color on how store comps performed in these two coalitions for the quarter and your expectations for comps for the balance of the year?","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So our Outdoor & Action Sports D2C performance, I mentioned, is e-commerce. We're seeing just great strength there. And our store comps, which we don't talk directly about our brands specifically. We saw those in the flat to up just slightly, which is pretty consistent with what you hear across the board. Contrast that with Sportswear, over three quarters \u2013 well, the majority of our Sportswear retail footprint is outlet. And the outlet channel, as a broad comment, has seen a pretty significant impact in traffic due to the high promotional activity going on across the majority of retail here in the United States. So our Sportswear team has been specifically impacted just due to the heavy weighting of that outlet mix.","Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Thank you. Best of luck.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the excess inventory \u2013 the inventory growth year-over-year, you've called out about half of that is cold weather carryover product. Is that product that you're going to be redirecting to your outlet stores or your website? Or how are you going to work through that excess that's still on your balance sheet?","Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","No, Lindsay. That is good inventory that'll go \u2013 we have orders against it. That's first-quality good inventory. As we've said, we've been watching this now or talking about this for a couple quarters. We had two options. We could've disposed of it and re-bought it. We saw the demand coming in the back half of the year. We chose to hold that inventory and we see demand against it. So it's good quality inventory.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, great. And maybe you guys could give some perspective on whether you saw any shift in consumer behavior in the UK or Europe post some of the negative events in those markets, whether it's Brexit or some of the attacks.","Karl Heinz Salzburger - Vice President & Group President, International","I guess you heard me saying, Lindsay, we grew Europe 3%. Most of the brands are doing okay. It's not an easy environment, you're right. There's a lot going on. Specifically to Brexit, we have to see what is going to happen. Negotiation have started, so it's a long-term view. But all in all, actually, we are doing pretty well. Our DTC numbers are strong in Europe, so that shows that our brands resonate well with consumers.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. And just last one. Could you talk about how your business to off-price has trended?","Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","From a U.S. standpoint, we're pretty much normal percent to totals as we look at this year, nothing dramatically different whatsoever.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Hi, yes. Thanks. Good morning.","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Omar.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Wanted to see if you guys could maybe dive in a little bit deeper on the e-commerce business digital initiatives. And I know it's been growing nicely and I think you guys are maybe a little bit lower penetration than the broader kind of soft goods marketplace. You know what you're doing there and if you also have any thoughts around working with any new partners on the digital side, perhaps getting access to Amazon and the Prime customer base, if that's something that's \u2013 you're thinking about?","Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Right. So here within the U.S. business, I'll walk you through that. Our e-commerce businesses, obviously, has been and continues to be a big emphasis of ours. We put a lot of energy into building our VF platform that now all of our big brands, as well as additional brands are coming on to and we're expanding that into our European marketplace where our large global brands are able to really maximize the power of that content and then transact regionally in a very specific way. We have a digital lab that sits out in our San Francisco campus that is very connected to a lot of the fast-moving digital trends that we're constantly mining and bringing into that VF platform.","And as we look at wholesale partners that we can work with, there's a whole host of really strong, pure plays in each of our businesses. There's the larger multinational partners that we have great business with, and then clearly Amazon is a good partner for many of our brands and one that we would continue to work with strategically as it fits into each one of our brands' strategies.","Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah, Omar, Scott here. Just cleaning up too maybe at the heart of your question that we're less than 5% our e-comm overall. We see a lot of opportunity there. It's high margin, our most profitable format. We've talked about in our long-range plans kind of mid-20s growth rate which is what we're seeing this year and we see a lot of runway on our e-comm.","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And, Omar, this is Eric. One of the ways we're getting at that is through \u2013 we've been talking about this some over the last 18 months. We've built a new digital and e-commerce technology engine that we're rolling out across the world kind of one brand in one country at a time. I think in the last 14 months we've done 24 installations and we still have room to grow. And every time we put a brand up on this website \u2013 or I'm sorry \u2013 on this technology tool in the market, our e-commerce business gets better.","To give you some context for how far we are, The North Face in Europe went live on Wednesday. So we still have a lot of work to do and a lot of opportunity. You're right, we are underdeveloped and we see that as a huge opportunity for us. And we know we have the right tool now, we're just rolling it out across the world and improving our ability to work with it.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Excellent. That's helpful. And then if I could just ask if there's anything new on the M&A front, Eric, that you want to add?","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you for asking, but no. Sorry. Not trying to be cute, but I \u2013 we would never discuss any processes that we're part of, or not during a call. Thank you.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Camilo Lyon with Canaccord Genuity.","Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question.","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","So I guess the other side of the e-commerce question is the wholesale question. Obviously, there's been some challenges in the department stores and I guess the debate now is are these structural challenges or are they cyclical ones. The traffic trends that we've seen in the channel and the growth in your e-commerce partners in your own businesses, does that \u2013 does it fundamentally alter how you view your growth prospects in the wholesale channel for the longer-term? And how do you think about that?","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, it \u2013 look, we've been around long enough. The world is constantly shifting between different channels and structures. To put some context on it, because that VF has changed now, our composition with the exit from the, I guess, potential exit from the Contemporary Brands business, and department stores now represent about 3% of our revenue. Mid-tier represents about 4% of our revenue. We're much more weighted towards specialty and sporting goods and \u2013 but having said that, in all channels in our department \u2013 with our department store partners, we're working very hard to make sure we get more than our fair share of their big revenue numbers. There's still a lot of apparel and footwear sold and we're trying to be a great partner and get more than our fair share, and we do that across \u2013 with of course with all of our customers and it does go from year-to-year. There's different centers of concentration, but I know there's concern about our exposure and that's why I tried to get some context to the size of the business.","Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","That's great. Can you \u2013 Eric, would you care to share a little bit more detail on the coalitions in those exposures?","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I can't do that. Even if I wanted to off the top of my head, I just don't have that information. I'm sorry. They're all \u2013 each has a different model and we're a global company with lots of brands. Scott wants to weigh-in.","Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","I'm just going to say we really haven't disclosed that level of detail. We just \u2013 we give you the overall percentages.","Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. And then just another question is on The North Face. Of late during the past year or so, you were to \u2013 there have been some other entrants into the category at some higher price points. I'm curious to get your take on where do you see the opportunities to grow The North Face brand whether it's on the price point perspective if you have an ability to raise part of your premium offering within The North Face or if you see other opportunities to expand where you're currently \u2013 the base of consumers that you're currently speaking to.","Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Sure. The North Face continues to be the number one outdoor brand on a global basis by a long shot. You heard us talk at the beginning of the year that the team has recently gone through resetting the business around four specific consumer usage occasions or four new business units. Mountain sports which is that most technical expression of the brand, the mountain culture which is more the lifestyle aspect that would come out of that core mountain and into the city, we've got our Mountain Athletics or training category which is a fast-growing, very significant opportunity for both apparel and footwear. And then we have a new category that's coming out of our Asia business called Urban Exploration, marrying up with what's already a good city expression of the brand here and in Europe but bringing a really interesting Asian flair coming out of Japan and China.","There, our team in Asia has been leading that will allow the brand to come at that city market in a slightly different perspective. We have the ability to sell higher price points and you absolutely will see us do that through these four new business units, but what you'll also see is real thoughtful line segmentation covering those key price points in those key categories for those channel partners that we do business with across the globe.","Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. Is that something that we can expect to see this season or is that more of a fall 2017 expression?","Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","You'll start to see it come to life in fall 2016 but it will really come to life in 2017. If you happen to be in San Francisco anytime soon, our Palo Alto store which I mentioned in my comments as well as our Post Street store has just been re-merchandised around these four brand territories, and really it's a beautiful experiential expression of the brand.","Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. Good luck, guys. All the best in the back half.","Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kate McShane with Citi.","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Kate.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I had a question about cotton. This we've noticed over the last week or so that cotton costs have gone up and I know it's only a week move or a couple of week move, but can you just remind us the timing of when you lock in your commodity costs? Is this something that you're watching and do you think it's sustainable and how we should think about it on gross margins going forward?","Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah, Kate, Scott here. So well first of all, as it relates to 2016, at this point we're committed, right? So any movements that you see now are going to be in the future. We're generally two to three quarters out by the time it rolls into our results. What you see now would be a 2017 impact.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Right. Okay. Okay. Do you have any view on cotton for the next six months? Is this something that is potentially sustainable, this increased cost? Or is it, are you watching it?","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well of course, we're watching it all the time but we're not in the prognostication business as it relates to cotton. What we do is we lock in within the time of our lead times, and that allows us then to price and react accordingly. But in terms of trying to predict which way it's going, we haven't been very good at that. I don't know anybody that is.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then my second question was just about the reallocation of resources now that the Contemporary business has been sold and is going to close. Just how should we think about any kind of acceleration of potential investments or reallocation of resources as we get maybe into Q4 from this asset disposal?","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Are you talking about capital or expense was your question?","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Both, if possible.","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'm glad I opened it up to both. Thank you. That's probably a good question to ask, a better question to ask after we have gotten closure on the strategic review we're doing at LSG because that's a big business and they affect our economic model. Scott mentioned that Contemporary has a little bit. Our gross margin will be a little bit weaker without it, but our operating margin will be a little bit higher. LSG would have another effect on it. We are obviously looking at the shape of the P&L, what it might be after this review is complete, and we might be able to answer that better later.","Having said that, the economic, the P&L model will look different and we're trying to put ourselves in a position to accelerate the organic growth rate in our core brands and the two businesses that we're talking about selling will do that by math because they have not grown at the kind of rate that the rest of the business grows at consistently.","From a capital standpoint, we're going to keep that powder dry until we see how much capital we have, but our priorities remain the same. First is acquisitions, and down the road, we'll be looking at dividends and share buyback. But our priority is acquisitions.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Kate.","Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","See you, Kate.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.","Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Good morning, everyone. As you think about pricing in back half of the year with the new product categories and given the fact that it is more fourth quarter heavy, what should we be looking to for each of the brands? Is there some new product, is there some new marketing initiative that we should be looking to for fourth quarter and potentially into next year as top-line drivers? Thank you.","Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Yeah, Dana, as it relates to price, we do have price. It will be a little back-half loaded. And we've talked about the FX impacts over the last couple years. We do have price, which more than offsets that FX in the back half.","Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Got it. And then anything new on the product offering, whether it's in Timberland or Vans or North Face that we should be watching for with marketing to drive that business?","Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Well, our Vans business, as it celebrates its 50th anniversary, has been doing some really creative things certainly with the Nintendo collaboration. You will see some new ideas coming into the marketplace end of this month and early next month that I will leave for you to discover. It's not something we really want to talk about here on the call. But in the case of The North Face, we'll be really anchoring ourselves in these new brand territories that I've talked about, driving our Summit Series Collection which continues to evolve after its relaunch last year on a global basis and also driving Mountain Athletics and footwear.","And in the case of Timberland, we will continue to drive our boots. The boot trend is still alive and well, and we've got some just great offerings along with our SensorFlex platform and, you know, that has been in place now for three years and continues to gain momentum and grab share not only here, but mostly we see it in our international markets.","Dana L. Telsey - Telsey Advisory Group LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Duffy with Stifel.","Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Hi, Jim","Scott A. Roe - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President","Good morning.","Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I'm particularly interested in commentary around channel inventories. You mentioned imbalances with Timberland and Vans Europe. Are there other notable pockets of imbalance? And then in contrast, what are the categories where you have healthier channel inventory positions and the stage seems better set to perform in the second half?","Steven E. Rendle - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, Jim, this is Steve. The imbalance that \u2013 from a Timberland standpoint is, as I mentioned, boots, and it's across the dealer distribution that the brands work with. And it really is inventory that's been carried out of fourth quarter last year, and as they work through it with the strong sell-throughs we see in the first half, we'll return to growth in the second half. Otherwise, we don't see inventory issues other than what we've called out at the beginning of the year. Caution in especially outdoor, reflecting The North Face order book, but the rest of our business is sitting at a really strong place. Our new innovative products will have great opportunities to be placed in and be put in front of consumers.","Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Very good. And then, Eric, I'm sorry to do this, but with respect to acquisitions, I recognize it's a situation of preparedness meaning opportunity. We know you're prepared. So has it been just a matter of pricing that's holding things back? Or are you not seeing properties available that fit the strategy?","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I would say that there's two \u2013 it's a complicated answer because we're very, very active.","Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","I'm sure. Yeah.","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","But the two biggest categories would be some of the properties that we're most interested in aren't available now, and some that we're interested in are not available at a price that we think is prudent to pay.","Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Fair enough and that does seem prudent. Thank you.","Operator","And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Eric Wiseman for any additional or closing remarks.","Eric C. Wiseman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Thank you all for your interest in our company. It's been an interesting year for us. In the first half, as I said earlier, consumer engagement and purchasing of our brands in our stores and online is right in line with our long-term organic growth goals, and that gives us great confidence that our brands are strong and our teams are executing well. Unfortunately, our wholesale business growth is off, and that's following a very weak winter last year and all the implications of that on inventory in the channel. But that will get solved with time.","With that, I'll just say that we're very confident about our outlook for the second half. We have good visibility and strong execution skills, and we look forward to giving you guys another update in 90 days. Thanks so much.","Operator","And that concludes today's presentation.

Thank you. You may begin.","Joe Alkire","Good morning, and welcome to VF Corporation\u2019s second quarter fiscal 2019 earnings call. Participants on today\u2019s call will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These uncertainties are detailed in documents filed regularly with the SEC.","Unless otherwise noted, amounts referred to on today\u2019s call will be on an adjusted basis, which we define in the press release that we issued this morning. We use adjusted amounts as lead numbers in our discussion because we believe they more accurately represent the true operational performance and underlying results of our business. You may also hear us refer to reported amounts, which are in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Reconciliations of GAAP measures to adjusted amounts can be found in the supplemental financial tables included in the press release, which identify and quantify all excluded items and provide management\u2019s view of why this information is useful to investors.","During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the company completed the sale of its Nautica brand business. During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the company completed the sale of its Licensed Sports Group or LSG business. And in conjunction with the LSG divestiture, VF executed its plan to exit the licensing business and completed the sale of the assets of the JanSport brand collegiate business in the fourth quarter of 2017. Accordingly, the company has included the operating results of these businesses in discontinued operations through their respective dates of sale.","Unless otherwise noted, results presented on today\u2019s call are based on continuing operations. Joining me on today\u2019s call will be VF\u2019s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Rendle; and Chief Financial Officer, Scott Roe. Following our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll open the call for questions. Steve?","Steve Rendle","Thank you, Joe. Good morning everyone. VF second quarter results were strong, fueled by the continued acceleration in our core brands and platforms. Our focus in investment in support of 2021 strategy is driving accelerated growth and value creation across key pillars of our portfolio. Over the past few months, geopolitical and macroeconomic events have caused increased volatility in the marketplace. I\u2019d like to take a moment and address how a few of these events are shaping how we think about our business and our consumers.","First, as it relates to the current trade climate between the U.S. and China. We are closely monitoring the situation and are actively involved in scenario planning. For context, about 11% of VF\u2019s total cost of goods sold come directly to the U.S. from China. By leveraging our global supply chain, we have positioned ourselves to address any additional changes in the overall trade environment with China. And we have the ability to reposition our global sourcing footprint in the near to midterm to mitigate the potential negative impact of additional tariffs should they materialize.","Second, with regards to the recent trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada, we are pleased with the outcome. For VF, we\u2019ve retained the most significant benefits we\u2019ve enjoyed through NAFTA, and the impact to our business is expected to be minimal. And finally, this week, one of our U.S. customers filed for bankruptcy. As a reminder, the 2021 financial targets we laid out at our Investor Day in Boston contemplated ongoing industry consolidation and customer bankruptcies in the U.S. market.","So while the customer bankruptcies pressure our results in the short term, there is no impact to the long-term growth outlook for any of our brands. Regarding the consumer, above-average GDP growth, low unemployment and multiyear highs in consumer sentiment are driving strong results in the U.S. market. In China, consumer spending in footwear and apparel remains solid, thus far unfazed by geopolitical rhetoric. And while the performance of our European business has been slightly more volatile the past few months due in part to unusual weather patterns across the continent, we have not seen a meaningful change in the trajectory of our business.","Let\u2019s review a few highlights from our second quarter. Revenue increased 6% on an organic basis or 7% excluding the impact of FX as our growth engines continue to fuel our results. Our big three brands grew to combined rate of 11%, with our Vans brand delivering another exceptional quarter, up 26%. Vans revenue growth was strong across all regions, channels and product categories. And importantly, growth also remains well diversified. Last month, Vans hosted an Investor Day at the brand\u2019s headquarters in Southern California where brand leaders outlined the path to $5 billion of revenue by 2023, representing a five-year CAGR between 10% and 12%.","Van\u2019s performance will continue to be a key driver of our commitment to deliver top-quartile TSR. Momentum in The North Face brand continues to accelerate with 5% growth or 7%, excluding the impact of FX. DTC was strong across all regions, and our digital business delivered over 35% growth. Strong performance in accessories, seasonal and lifestyle products drove the brand\u2019s results. This fall, The North Face unveiled the Retro Nuptse Jacket in vest collection, a water resistant, 700 fill down enhanced replica of the original 1996 version.","The launch was supported as a key pillar of our New Explorers campaign and was highlighted in our first ever Urban brand experience. It was sold out in minutes. The North Face is reenergized. Product engine is beginning to drive consumer demand as the brand consumer demand as the brand explores innovative ways to connect and engage with consumers. Based on our increased confidence and visibility into the second half, we now expect revenue growth in The North Face to be between 7% and 8%.","As a reminder, our updated outlook for The North Face includes a one-point headwind from FX versus our initial outlook of 6% to 8% growth for the brand in April. Now looking at total VF on an organic basis. International increased 4% or 7% excluding the impact of FX. China increased 12% or 15% constant currency, direct to consumer increased 13% with more than 30% growth in digital. And our Work segment increased 5%, driven by balanced growth across nearly all brands. And now halfway through the year, we are executing well on our plan in making a significant progress against our 2021 strategy.","As a result of our strong performance in the quarter and our increased confidence in the full year, we are raising our revenue and earnings growth outlook for fiscal 2019. And Scott will cover the details later in the call. I\u2019d like to take a moment and update you on our recent portfolio actions. In August, we announced a significant milestone in VF\u2019s storied history, our intention to separate VF into two companies via a spinoff of our Jeans business. Since the announcement almost two months ago, our management team, Board of Directors and external advisers have been working diligently toward a target separation date at the end of April 2019.","We are pleased with our progress and remain on track with our time line. We\u2019ll have more specific details to share with you over the coming months. In September, we announced the new location for VF\u2019s global headquarters in Denver\u2019s lower downtown district. We\u2019re excited to co-locate select VF corporate leaders with our outdoor brands in the Rocky Mountains. We look forward to moving into our new building in fall of 2019. Earlier this month, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Reef brand to The Rockport Group. The transaction is expected to close at the end of October. I\u2019d like to personally thank the Reef employees for their hard work and dedication to VF throughout the years.","The Rockport Group is the appropriate partner to shepherd the Reef brand to its next phase of growth and success. And finally, the integration processes for Icebreaker, Altra and Williamson-Dickie remain on track. While still early, we are even more optimistic about the long-term growth opportunity for these high-quality assets. This is an extraordinarily exciting time at VF. The actions we are taking continue to advance our journey toward becoming a purpose-led, performance-driven organization, focused on and committed to delivering superior returns to shareholders. We are delivering on our commitments and remain sharply focused on the foundation we\u2019re setting to position VF for sustainable long-term growth and value creation.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Scott.","Scott Roe","Thanks, Steve, and good morning everyone. Our results for the second quarter were strong and our confidence is high as we enter the fall holiday season. We are executing well against our strategic growth plan. Momentum continues to build across our core growth engines and platforms, and our portfolio is well positioned to deliver sustainable long-term growth and top-quartile value creation. Now let\u2019s review our second quarter performance in more detail.","Total revenue increased 15% or 6% organically, with balanced growth across our core brands and platforms. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, DTC increased 13%, led by more than 30% growth in digital and double-digit brick-and-mortar growth, and that\u2019s despite fewer stores compared to a year ago. Wholesale increased 3% organically, led by a continued strength in international and our digital wholesale partners.","On a regional basis, excluding the impact of acquisitions, growth was balanced with both U.S. and international, up 7% constant currency. Europe remains solid, delivering mid-single-digit growth, while Asia Pacific increased 7%, including 15% growth in China, excluding the impact of FX. Our non-U.S. Americas business also performed well in the quarter, with 12% growth organically on a constant currency basis.","Our big three brands collectively increased 11%, led by 26% growth in Vans and 7% growth at The North Face, excluding the impact of FX. Revenue growth in our big three brands was balanced globally, with 20% growth in DTC and high single-digit growth in wholesale. Results for Timberland were muted for the quarter. However, we have visibility to improve performance in the second half of this year, and we remain confident in our long-term aspirations for the brand.","Our Work portfolio delivered another strong quarter, with revenue up 5%, excluding the impact of a customer bankruptcy, Bulwark and Wrangler RIGGS each grew double digits, and our Timberland PRO and Red Kap businesses increased at a high single-digit rate. And on a pro forma basis, Dickie's had another strong quarter, with revenue growth of 11%. As expected, our Jeans business had a difficult quarter, compounded by the impact of a customer bankruptcy contributing to a decline of 7%.","It's important to note, this quarter's results have no impact on our long-term growth and TSR algorithm for this business. As Steve mentioned, the 2021 financial targets we laid out at our Investor Day in Boston contemplated ongoing industry consolidation and customer bankruptcies in the U.S. market. While we anticipated these events in our 2021 plan, it was hard to predict when they would occur. Thus, while we reduced our current year outlook, there is nothing that we see today that fundamentally changes our review of Wrangler or Lee over the long term.","Moving down the P&L. Gross margin was 50.2%, in line with last year despite a 70 basis point negative impact from acquisitions. On an organic basis, gross margin increased 70 basis points, driven primarily by mix as our largest and most profitable brands and platforms continue to be our fastest growing.","SG&A as a percentage of revenue declined 50 basis points to 32.6%, including continued investments on our strategic priorities. The acceleration of revenue growth, coupled with our ongoing discipline and focus on cost management, is beginning to drive meaningful leverage and will be a catalyst for earnings growth over the next several years. EPS increased 19% or 13% organically to $0.43 per share.","Given our strong results for the second quarter and our increased confidence and visibility into the second half we are raising our full year fiscal 2019 outlook as follows: Revenue is now expected to be at least $13.7 billion, reflecting growth of at least 11%. Our updated outlook includes a more than $100 million impact from expected divestitures of the Reef, Van Moer businesses and \u2013 as well as the impact of customer bankruptcy.","Our updated outlook now includes 7% to 8% growth at The North Face and 18% to 19% growth at Vans. Following this through by segment and channel, Outdoor is now anticipated to increase 7% to 8%, and Active is now expected to increase 14% to 15%. ","From a channel perspective, we now expect DTC to increase 12% to 14% for the full year, with more than 30% growth in digital. We now expect Lee to decrease between 3% and 4%, and our Jeans segment to decline approximately 1% to 2% in light of the previously mentioned bankruptcy. There is no change to our Wrangler outlook of a 1% increase this year.","And finally, we are confirming our mid-single-digit organic growth outlook for Work and our international outlook of 12% to 13% growth. We still expect gross margin to be 51%. And now we expect operating margin to increase 80 basis points to about 13.5% due to slightly stronger SG&A leverage. Our outlook for adjusted earnings per share has increased to $3.65, reflecting 16% growth, and this includes the impact of selling Reef, Van Moer and bankruptcies.","Cash flow from operations is now expected to approximate $1.8 billion with our CapEx forecast unchanged at about $275 million. We remain committed to returning cash to shareholders, and our dividend and share repurchase program are key and our dividend and share repurchase program are key components of our diversified value creation model. Based on our performance and the confidence we have in the cash generation of both RemainCo and NewCo, our Board of Directors approved an 11% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.51 per share. This marks the 46th consecutive year that we've increased our annual dividend.","So to wrap it up, we are pleased with the performance through the first half of this year. We have again raised our full year outlook, and we look forward to building on our momentum in the second half. We are sharply focused on executing against our strategic growth plan and positioning our portfolio for a sustainable long-term growth and top-quartile value creation.","Now with that I will turn the call back to the operator and open the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alexandra Walvis with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.","Alexandra Walvis","Good morning guys. And thanks for the question. I had a question on the Work business, specifically Williamson-Dickie. You've now had that asset for a year, and you've posted solid growth and some improvements in profitability there. I was wondering how the strategy there had progressed versus the original plan and how we should expect that to change as we go into year two and beyond.","Steve Rendle","Yes this is Steve Al. I\u2019ll start answering your question. So yes, we are a year into our Williamson-Dickie acquisition and integration. We are on track with the integration objectives and the synergies that we saw as part of our diligence. There's a lot that we've learned about this great brand. We knew that it was a strong consumer-focused brand as we went through our diligence process. But what we're finding is that it's anchored so well in the Work category, specifically here in the U.S., but as we've worked with management and begun to understand the consumer response to this brand, we're seeing a much stronger work lifestyle component anchored in Asia and Europe that we see being able to bring back across the globe.","So we're very much on track. We remain extremely confident about the impact that this brand can have within our integrated market approach for workwear. But even further, elevating itself as a strong consumer lifestyle brand anchored in the Work category. ","Scott Roe","Let me just add on. Just to put \u2013 make a broader acquisition comment, but I think it's in the prepared remarks. We said we expect $0.14 contribution from acquisitions, about $0.10 of which will be from the Williamson-Dickie acquisition. And so that's a little bit better than what we had originally said. We're seeing that the synergies, now that we've gotten in, are indeed playing out and maybe a little quicker than we originally anticipated. So all good on the financial side as well.","Alexandra Walvis","Great that\u2019s very clear. Thank you. And then second question was on the Jeans business. You explained that much of the weakness in the business this quarter was driven by a bankruptcy. I was wondering if there was anything that you can share with us on perhaps point-of-sale trends at your retail partners. How would the brand have been or the brands have been performing ex the impact of the bankruptcies? Is there anything that you can share with us, for example, on how those brands are resonating with consumers? ","Scott Roe","Yes. Let me start just with the numbers side of your question. This is Scott. So a little bit of perspective. First of all, our Jeans business grew 2% in the first quarter. And when you consider the RIGGS, Wrangler RIGGS business, which we report in the Work segment, it really grew 3% if you think about what will be NewCo going forward. If you exclude the impact of the bankruptcy, which you mentioned in your question that means through the first half, we're down a little more than 1%, maybe 1.5%. We expect in the second half, again, ex the impact of bankruptcy, to be up by about the same amount. So you\u2019re talking flat for the year. And really, bridging back to Steve\u2019s opening comments, as we thought forward in our Boston plan and as we\u2019ve thought through the NewCo and the spin and the modeling that we\u2019ve done, we\u2019ve expected some bad things to happen in this market in terms of bankruptcies, consolidations.","So what you should take away is while you had this quarter, there is noise in this quarter, but when you zoom out and click and look at the big picture, we\u2019re in fundamentally the same place that we thought we were. And we really \u2013 this has no impact on how we view these businesses going forward.","Steve Rendle","And I would just add to that. If you kind of dial back to our time in Boston together and our leader, Tom, walked everybody through the work that we are currently underway on, to really bring these brands together from a global perspective, to move them beyond being incredibly strong channel players in the particular segments, but elevating them to be true lifestyle brands. And the work that\u2019s being done is probably most further down the path is at Wrangler. And that\u2019s where the underlying business continues to be strong.","We see strength in our Western business, in the new modern component, the outdoor segment that\u2019s new and growing very nicely, the Wrangler RIGGS section that\u2019s committed to the outdoor or the work consumer extremely well. But some really good validation points for us is the double-digit growth that we see in our own .com and then in the North America digital wholesale, up over 30% for the quarter. So these brands are resonating very well with the consumer. We\u2019re navigating a changing market dynamic. And I think what I\u2019d ask is just the confidence that doing the \u2013 we\u2019re doing the work to position these brands for very good long-term success.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Duffy with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Jim Duffy","Thank you. Good morning, guys. The prepared remarks did well to address all the common questions, thanks for that. Big picture question on The North Face and then a question on the numbers. For The North Face, the European revenues have been very strong even against double-digit constant-currency growth a year ago, presumably a reflection of some of Arne\u2019s groundwork. Can you talk about positioning of the brand in Europe, some of the factors contributing to that break-out growth and how that can translate to other markets?","Steve Rendle","Sure, Jim. I think the brand is absolutely anchored in that core Mountain Sports category and very committed to making sure that, that foundation is strong and that we\u2019re bringing the right level of new product innovation and marketing to pull through. I mean those key wholesale partners as well as our own store. Where we\u2019ve seen really nice growth, and we\u2019ve talked about this previously, is more of that Mountain Lifestyle component, the more contemporary logo-ed sportswear pieces that are taking their influence from the Mountain Sports category, the influence that, that\u2019s having on Urban Exploration component of the line.","And what we\u2019ve seen in Europe is a brand that\u2019s moved beyond just an outerwear and equipment resource, but truly a brand that can deliver lifestyle apparel while being very anchored in that outdoor Mountain Sports category. And that\u2019s exactly what you see taking place in Asia. More importantly, what we just saw this quarter here in the United States marketplace, where we saw a strong sell-through of daypacks, really good lifestyle sportswear logo. We\u2019re trending extremely well, strong retail sell-throughs, setting the brand up for a really strong fall season, where now you come into the wheelhouse of outerwear.","Jim Duffy","Great. Thanks for that. And then Scott, a lot of moving parts in the business that\u2019s likely to continue. With that, some extraordinary items. Can you just give us a perspective on the criteria you use for defining something as extraordinary, just so we can have that in our mind on a go-forward basis?","Scott Roe","Sure, Jim. I think pretty straightforward really, right? Nonrecurring isolated things related to either a specific initiative like the relocation of our offices to Denver or sale of assets, transactions that we\u2019re going through and the separation then of Jeans. So as you can imagine, there is a lot of fees, costs, et cetera, that are incremental to the business that come in when you have this type of activities that are nonrecurring in nature. So our goal, I think fairly straightforward, is to try to give a picture of what is the ongoing underlying profitability of the business excluding these nonrecurring items.","So I think in the prepared materials, you had a pretty good, both in the press release\u2019s table and also in \u2013 we\u2019ve given you some more detail around that. I think it\u2019s pretty straightforward, and you\u2019ll see in the SEC filings that will give you a little bit more on that. I think it\u2019ll be pretty straightforward.","Jim Duffy","Very good, thank you.","Steve Rendle","Thanks, Jim.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Bob Drbul","Hi, guys good morning.","Steve Rendle","Hey, Bob.","Bob Drbul","I was wondering if you could spend a little time on Timberland, just in terms of the second half visibility that you spoke to, what you\u2019re seeing in the business and, I guess, just what gives you the confidence in terms of the turn of the business in the second half of the year for you.","Steve Rendle","Bob, this is Steve. We remain very confident in our Timberland brand. And I think what\u2019s giving us that confidence is the work that we\u2019re doing to diversify the offer beyond just the Classics collection of the core boots. We\u2019re seeing momentum in our women\u2019s business, continued success in apparel and most importantly, success \u2013 I mean, our non-Classics footwear, both men\u2019s and women\u2019s. The PRO category continues to do extremely well, and that sets a really strong technical halo for that boots business.","So really confident as we look across the product categories. The work we\u2019ve done in Asia over the last 12 months, the marketing that we\u2019re doing with our TeeBooLang marketing campaign has shown really strong results and great \u2013 really good selling in our China marketplace. And I guess the last point would be the work that we\u2019re doing to build a strong product foundation, the integrated marketplace, merchandising strategy that will allow us to have that diversified approach here in the U.S. market where we\u2019ve got the most work to do, a lot of confidence about as we look at that mid-single-digit growth profile on a long-term basis.","Bob Drbul","Great. And I guess just a second question follow-up would be on European business, when you look at \u2013 there\u2019s definitely some disparity between The North Face, Vans and Timberland, I guess. And just on the Vans piece of it, can you just talk to what you\u2019re seeing in the European market there? Is there a weather impact on Vans? I\u2019m just trying to understand that 8% number a little bit better.","Scott Roe","Just \u2013 is your question really why it\u2019s lower than it was in the previous quarter?","Bob Drbul","Yes, I mean \u2013 I guess generally, just when you look at Europe across the multiple brands, that one is a little bit lower than the other two big ones.","Scott Roe","Yes. So I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll \u2013 I\u2019ll try to address your question. So the thing to remember about Vans in Europe is, first of all, 9% is in line with the long-term growth rate of that brand and a great result. Remember what\u2019s going on there. The group \u2013 and we talked a lot about this in the Investor Day. It\u2019s really about making sure that we don\u2019t get overtorqued in any one particular part of our business. And what we\u2019re seeing there is some rationing, frankly, of some of the product as we ensure that not one style or one category gets too much out of balance.","But remember, we\u2019re still growing double digits in this brand, right in line with the long-range growth plan. And I think the takeaway you should have is this is solid sustainable growth that we can build on over the long term. As you think about Europe generally, Steve said it in the prepared remarks. There were some noise. There was \u2013 the weather has been a bit strange there. There were some timing of shipments. But if you look through all that, our Europe business has remained consistent and strong. We don\u2019t really see any change in condition. It\u2019s not exactly been easy over the last couple years. And we read the same things you do, but we haven\u2019t seen a material change in the condition of our business in Europe so far.","Steve Rendle","Bob, I would just reinforce. What you see is just a really strong disciplined approach to how the brand is coming to life across its wholesale partners in support of our DTC. And it\u2019s an important part of that 18% to 19% growth that we\u2019ve given outlook for the balance \u2013 or for this full year.","Bob Drbul","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Erinn Murphy","Great. Thanks. Good morning. Steve, I guess, a question for you on tariffs. You hit a lot of helpful context upfront, but when you think about the scenario planning, I think it's probably fair to assume the entire industry is doing the same just in case there are another batch of tariffs. Are you seeing any price increases in some of China's neighboring countries thus far as people are moving out of China? And then how are factories in China treating their vendors? Are they trying to make any concessions to keep business on the ground there?","Steven Rendle","Sure, great question. To date, Erinn, we have not seen any price increases as our supply chain team looks to manage our global sourcing footprint. It doesn't mean to say that there couldn't be. I think as we work so well with our group of vendors across each of our businesses, we're able to really level set production by country based on where the most favorable tariff situation is for each of those inbound sets of goods. We have not seen anything have not seen anything per se going on in China that would give us any concern that we're not going to be treated well or we're going to be treated better. Again, I just think this just comes through the strength of our relationships. And we've been working to reduce our exposure to China for many, many years. And where you see us now at 11% for our U.S. imports, we can lever that down if need be or we can maintain it. It's really paying very close attention to everything that each one of us reads in the news every day and the work that we're doing in Washington with our partners there.","Erinn Murphy","Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the demand side of China. You talked about the market still being relatively strong. It did decelerate though, just from the first quarter. I think it was \u2013 organic growth was 31%, moved down to 15%. I recognize Jeans was a lot softer there. But just curious if you're seeing any other kind of brand callouts in terms of the deceleration, Q1 to Q2. And then any thoughts on how you're approaching Singles' Day in that market?","Scott Roe","So I\u2019ll take the first part. Really, Erinn, no change. There are some timing quarter-to-quarter, but we don't see any change in trajectory in the China business overall.","Steven Rendle","Right. And then Singles' Day, obviously a very important day of selling there. Our teams are very attentive. I think we've learned a lot over the last few years to be very thoughtful about what products are sort of there, making sure that we're supporting it with the proper marketing, but not getting \u2013 letting that get too far ahead of us and recognizing that we have a full year of opportunity to speak to our consumers and not just one single day.","Erinn Murphy","Okay. And then so, Scott, just to clarify though on the decel and you said there was some timing, is the way to think about the kind of underlying run rate of China as we get into the back half is just kind of the average of the first half? Is that how we should think about it?","Scott Roe","Yes. That's exactly right.","Erinn Murphy","Thank you,. guys.","Scott Roe","Thanks, Erinn.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Binetti","Hey guys, thanks for taking my question here. Scott, let me ask you on the gross margin for a minute. I think there is more noise here than meets the eye, and I just wanted to ask how much do the softer international revenue growth rate on a reported basis and then plus the bankruptcies and Dickies, how much of those hurt the gross margin in this quarter? And then you look out to 3Q, how those changed? I guess, said differently, the core algorithm I think you gave for the five years was 40 to 50 basis points. First half in total was up 35, got in some plus, about 30 for the back half. That's below the algorithm. But on an organic basis, you're up 70 this quarter so above the algorithm, and you have the Dickies impact rolling off next quarter. I'm just trying to think why that wouldn't accelerate more.","Scott Roe","Wow, okay. So let me try, Michael. So let me attack it a little bit differently and see if I answer your question. So if you look at Q2, the mix is about 60 basis points, a little better than what we've said over time. And rate has been a bit favorable, and that's true to the first half, right? But remember what we've said there, cost is a little favorable in the first half, turns a little unfavorable in the second half, and for the year, it's not a material impact. So you'll see a little of that first half, second half dynamic on the cost side. Mix moderates a bit in the second half as well, and some of the reasons for that we've talked about. You think about the Vans, we are full year 18-ish. 18% to 19% growth implies that in the second half, the growth moderates. Again, that we know that both from a DTC standpoint and just the absolute margins of Vans, that has an impact on the mix.","So \u2013 and then lastly, acquisitions in the first half, we start lapping WD. So for example, in the second quarter, acquisitions was negative 70 bps. As you know get into the second half, acquisitions are essentially a push, actually modestly accretive as you start getting into that lap as Altra and Icebreaker have margins that are at\/ or above VF average. So again, big picture, you have your mix moderating a bit in the second half for the reasons that we talked about. That's implied in the guidance. You have you're rate, going from a little bit of a tailwind to a little bit of a headwind in the second half. But remember, the big picture there, pricing overall is moderating that. You have a little bit of timing quarter-to-quarter. And then acquisitions, for the full year, about 20 bps. Essentially, all in the first half of the year because as we start lapping in the second half, you don't see that impact. I don't know if I got you there, Michael, but hopefully\u2026","Michael Binetti","Yes. You almost sound like you're \u2013 it sounded like you were ready for me there.","Scott Roe","Yes. It's almost like we've practiced this stuff, right?","Michael Binetti","Well done. Can I just ask one other? I don't know if Mr. Baxter is hanging around, but I just can't think that jeans demand in Europe really dropped 18% in the quarter out of nowhere. Is there \u2013 I mean, I don't know if there's anything strategic going on now that you're looking ahead to that being a separate company or \u2013 maybe you can help us put some context around what went on with jeans in Europe in the quarter.","Steven Rendle","Right. So Scott's not here, though I know he would love to be, for sure. So what's going on in Europe and certainly, Scott mentioned a little bit of the weather impact, and it's not like we've ever talked about warm weather, but our denim business in Europe is primarily or predominantly long bottoms. And as we've come through this warm cycle, though we come in with good seasonal assortments this year, it was probably even stronger need to be well set up with those stronger spring summer assortments than where we've historically seen a lot of strength. But I would tell you, there is no change to our long-term fundamental view for this business. And I think it's important to remember that Europe is less than 15% of our total Jeanswear business. We do see a consolidation of some key accounts. We closed some doors as we focus on quality within our retail environments. But really, no change to our long-term fundamental view for Jeanswear or for our ability to compete well in Europe.","Michael Binetti","Okay. Thanks a lot guys.","Steven Rendle","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew Boss","Great and congrats on the nice quarter. If we drill down on the expense front, I guess, what's driven the earlier-than-expected inflection to SG&A leverage in the front half? Any change to your back-half leverage outlook and just multiyear plan?","Scott Roe","Yes. I mean, the honest or the quickest answer to that is revenue has been a little better in the first half, right? And that, coupled with discipline on the expense side, has driven a little more leverage. And that leverage you see is falling through to the full year and one of the reasons why we have taken our guidance up for the full year over the last two quarters. But it's also important to remember that we have said that while we're committed to delivering our earnings, we're also looking opportunistically at where we can invest to further our strategic priorities and also set ourselves up for consistent growth in the future. So we have continued to invest. You shouldn't take from this that we're getting leverage because we're walking away from investment on our strategic priorities.","That's not true. But as we see acceleration in the top line and that drives leverage, sure, some of that's going to come through from a profitability standpoint. I mean, we're looking at the mid-teens profit based on this implied guidance, and that's right in line with what we said in Boston. And we're committed to that, and we will continue to deliver it, right? What you have seen though, Matt, is an inflection point, right? Remember, I'm going to take you back to Boston. We talked about as the top line was accelerating through the first part of our plan, we said we're going to start investing in those key growth drivers. We\u2019re now hitting that point where we\u2019re seeing both the virtuous cycle of our revenue increasing. And while we\u2019re not reducing our expenses, they are not growing at the pace of the revenue increase, and that means leverage. And that leverage is driving the kind of margin expansion \u2013 operating margin expansion that we expected in our long-range plan.","Matthew Boss","Great. And then just a follow-up on Vans. So I guess, with the exception of tougher compares in the back-half guide, I guess are you seeing any organic signs of slowing at all in your wholesale order books? Or should we think of this more as still embedded moderation in your DTC business in the back half that potentially could prove conservative if things ended up a little bit better?","Steven Rendle","So as expected, I think we talked about that we would start to see some moderation in the growth rates. So I\u2019m not sure that you could really refer that the plus 26 is a moderate growth rate. The brand continues to move along the same path that we talked about in the offices recently. The retail trends remain really strong. I think we\u2019ve been pretty consistent that we\u2019re in unchartered territory here, and it\u2019s really hard to call. Common sense would tell you that it might moderate. But I\u2019d tell you, at this point, we just haven\u2019t seen evidence of that. And that\u2019s what\u2019s giving us confidence to raise our outlook to plus 18%, 19% for the year.","Matthew Boss","Great. That\u2019s helpful.","Steven Rendle","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie Group. Please proceed with your question.","Laurent Vasilescu","Good morning and thanks for taking my question. It looks like you raised annual revenue guidance by about $100 million. With that, it incorporates a number of factors. Can we assume Reef is a $150 million business? How big is Van Moer? And then what\u2019s the incremental FX headwinds since 90 days ago? And then lastly, sorry, what\u2019s the actual dollar impact from the recent customer bankruptcy?","Scott Roe","All right. So let\u2019s see, where do I start? So we talked about 70 to 80 basis points of FX in the last call. We said that\u2019s about 100 basis points. You can do the math and figure that, I don\u2019t know, another $30 million or so of currency headwind that is, I guess, overcome with this raise in guidance. We said about a point collectively for the dispositions and the bankruptcy. I\u2019m not going to get into real granular on the bankruptcy, but we shaped this a year ago. We said it was less than $100 million. You can assume it\u2019s continued to decline. So it\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019ll just leave it at that as, well, less than $100 million. And then the other side of that, you said what\u2019s Reef? It\u2019s about $150 million annually.","But of course, we have roughly half of that or so, a little more, I guess, in our year \u2013 this year so far. So hopefully, that gets you kind of there \u2013 close to there. But I guess maybe what\u2019s underneath that question, just to reiterate the point, is we raised our guidance, top and bottom line, and absorbed a lot of impacts, right, with the disposition of Reef and Moer, the currency headwinds. And despite all that, we still raised significantly top and bottom line. So hopefully, that was evident.","Laurent Vasilescu","Very helpful. Thank you, Scott. And then inventories, they were up 22% or 17% on an organic basis. What\u2019s the inventory growth coming from by brand or by region? And how should we think about that number relative to the third quarter\u2019s top line growth?","Scott Roe","Yes. Just to clarify though, you\u2019re still lapping acquisitions. So the organic is 5%, which is pretty much in line with what we see. That\u2019s according to the forward guidance that we see, so. Or stated differently, there is nothing in our inventory that gives us any pause. It\u2019s really now that we\u2019re lapping WD, you\u2019ll start to see those. Even the absolute nominal inventory growth will be much smaller because, frankly, Altra and Icebreaker just aren\u2019t that large in the scheme of total VF.","Laurent Vasilescu","Very helpful. Thank you very much.","Steven Rendle","Thanks, Laurent.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Camilo Lyon with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.","Camilo Lyon","Thanks. Good morning guys. How are you?","Steven Rendle","Good.","Camilo Lyon","I wanted to stick in little deeper on North Face. I think in the slides, it talks about a shift in timing of some of the deliveries, both in the Americas and the APAC region. Could you just talk about how you\u2019re seeing the health of the channel unfold? And how they \u2013 you already talked about the increased product innovation, how that\u2019s being received well in different parts of the world. Could you just drill down and articulate how that\u2019s unfolding here in the U.S. market and how you expect that to play out for the season? And then I\u2019ve got follow-ups.","Scott Roe","Yes. Camilo, I\u2019ll start just to clarify that timing. So retail calendars of some of our biggest customers have shifted. That, coupled with the general trend of demand and shipments generally moving to the right, we have seen some shift from \u2013 between two quarters maybe in a little bit later. So we\u2019ll see a relatively higher growth next quarter in The North Face as that shift impacted the current quarter. So all we\u2019re saying is when you normalize for that, we see even greater strength looking forward. And as you know, this is a pre-book business largely on the wholesale side. We have really, at this point, really good visibility to the order book. And that, coupled with the actions over the last couple of years that we\u2019ve been talking about around cleaning the inventory, marketplace, et cetera. So we\u2019re coming into this season in a historically relatively clean environment. That, coupled with our visibility to the early performance and the order book that we see, gives us the confidence to raise for the year.","Steven Rendle","Right. Then Camilo, things going on in Asia, I would probably pull you up a click and just look holistically across the globe for The North Face. I mean, that\u2019s been a very methodical process to reposition this brand to its rightful place, anchoring first to Mountain Sports, which gives the brand permission to come to life in Urban Exploration. The things that you see in the marketplace right now, the campaign around the icons, starting with the Mountain jacket last month, the Nuptse jacket this month and really celebrating the story, history of this powerful brand, taking a very kind of new, fresh approach in its demand creation, starting first with the Walls Are Meant for Climbing, very inclusive, and really celebrating the diversity of the outdoor marketplace and anchoring that invitation to explore through the lens of The North Face point of view.","So really strong focus on product. As we\u2019ve talked about, the demand creation now coming in line to support this season\u2019s initiatives. And what\u2019s really positive is the marketplace across here in the U.S., Europe and Asia, it\u2019s clean, allowing us the opportunity to get these new assortments, these new seasonally relevant assortments into retail and using that new energy of the product to elevate the brand and really return this brand to its rightful leadership position.","Camilo Lyon","Got it. Thanks for that. Then my follow-up had to do with the 50 basis points of incremental strategic investments in the quarter. You\u2019ve done this in the past. It\u2019s worked out well. I was hoping to get some color on where does this incremental $27 million go into? What brands did it go to? What form? Was it digital? Was it innovation? And maybe if you could go back to the last time you did, I think it was last year, where \u2013 when did you see the effect of that, the benefit of that materialize? And I would assume that this is an investment that will lead to the continued growth in over the next 12 to 18 months. Is that the right way to think about these investments and how they play out?","Scott Roe","Yes. I would think of it more as a flywheel. We laid out the \u2013 and declared, I think pretty specifically, what those areas we were going to invest in and we\u2019re continuing to invest in. And when I say opportunistically, things like demand creation. If we have \u2013 there are times when we want to lean in a little heavier based on what we see as an opportunity, but those areas of investment really aren\u2019t changed. Digital, holistically, analytics, insights, our DTC broadly in terms of capabilities and brick-and-mortar as well as in the digital and how those work together. I mean, these are the areas where we\u2019re focusing our investment. So I wouldn\u2019t say what we\u2019re doing now is just a specific finite amount of time for the payback. We're looking at this as developing, consistent, defendable points of difference over a period of time. And we will sustain that investment at a certain level. With my comments again on opportunistic typically are more around specific initiatives where we see an opportunity to really lean in and accelerate.","Camilo Lyon","Was that specific to one or a small handful of brands?","Scott Roe","I didn't make that distinction. But I think it's consistently with the way that we've talked. I mean typically, you're going to see a disproportionate amount of investment in our largest franchises as well as China, which we've declared as one of our strategic priorities.","Steve Rendle","But Camilo, I'd add, the platform investments, the true enablers that sit in the backbone of our model are there for all of our brands to be able to leverage. You might see us initiate some of the work. For example, our loyalty program, the work that Vans and North Face are doing. Certainly, they're the tip of the spear. But this work is done from a broader base of foundation for the entire portfolio to benefit from.","Scott Roe","And just tying that back, it's a great point that Steve makes. And that's one of the reasons we see leverage, right? So as we can invest, it would be harder for any one of these brands individually to be able to afford these kinds of investments. But by doing it on a VF level as a platform, then we can get leverage to those investments across the broader portfolio.","Camilo Lyon","Got it. It sounds great. Good luck guys.","Scott Roe","Thanks, Camilo.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Komp with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Jonathan Komp","Yes. Hi, thank you. Scott, I wanted to first just clarify if I could. On the acquisition benefit this year, I think you said $0.14 to earnings, if I could clarify that and maybe just ask what's behind that thinking in the second half? I think you already delivered $0.12 in the first two quarters. So, any additional perspective there?","Scott Roe","Now, remember we\u2019re not \u2013 the first half is non-comp. So of course, you're going to have the majority of that incremental benefit in the first half. So yes, you're right, it says a couple pennies for the balance of the year is our expectation. But that is largely \u2013 well, it's all Altra and Icebreaker, which are less profitable relative to total VF, right?","Jonathan Komp","And since we don\u2019t fully know the seasonality of this business \u2013 of these businesses all that well, the $0.08 in Q2, is there anything unique in that figure?","Scott Roe","No.","Jonathan Komp","Okay.","Scott Roe","But remember, there\u2019s two things going on, right. You\u2019re delivering just the non-comp earnings, and then underneath that, you've got the synergies that are being delivered over the next predominantly over the next couple of years. So there's really two things going on, which are driving those earnings. So another way of saying why did we take up our acquisition contribution from one quarter ago, we're seeing some of those synergies a little earlier than we anticipated.","Jonathan Komp","Yes. That\u2019s helpful. I wanted to ask a broader question then on \u2013 going back to North Face and really stemming from the newer disclosures around the outdoor versus active segments. And if I look more on a trailing 12-month basis, the outdoor segment margin is quite a bit below active, and I think in the low teens in terms of the margin rate for the outdoor. I just wanted to ask, I assume North Face and Timberland have contributed to kind of a lower margin than we may have expected previously. And I wanted to get some thoughts on the outlook there and your ability to become more profitable, especially at The North Face, going forward.","Scott Roe","Yes. So, there is no doubt. We can and will be more profitable in this segment, first of all. I'll just put a little historical context here. If you go back a couple years, as we've really focused on, quality of sales, cleaning up the marketplace and reducing the discounting on off-price, we've walked some volume. We have not seen the kind of leverage we've typically seen, and we've also been investing in the future of these businesses. So if you think about where they are now compared to historic capability and what we see as the future capability, we see a lot of room to run here over time. The other thing I would say is The North Face, within that, it's relatively more advanced, right? And it is more profitable and more \u2013 and contributing more. Think about Timberland, as we've said consistently, a couple of years behind in terms of its evolution. So if you \u2013 as you look forward, I would think of this category continuing to grow, both from top line and leverage as well as margin expansion. And you should think about The North Face being slightly ahead of Timberland in terms of its profitability evolution.","Jonathan Komp","Understood. It\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Kernan with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.","John Kernan","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. My other questions are already answered. I just wanted to go back to Vans and what your outlook is for just specific franchises within Vans as we kind of go through the back half of the year. Old Skool has obviously had a fairly incredible growth. I know it's only 25% of sales. But when you look at the franchises within Vans, where do you expect the most growth to come from that's embedded in the outlook for the back half? Thank you.","Scott Roe","Yes. So, maybe, I\u2019ll start with that. You\u2019re right. Old Skool is about actually less than 25% of the total franchise. If you go back to the \u2013 probably the best way to answer that would be to refer you back to the Investor Day materials, where I think we unpacked that reasonably well, talking about the different franchises. But I'll give you \u2013 the short answer to that is we see broad-based growth. And we always, within this brand, see certain franchises that are trending a little higher than others. But over time, that's kind of the point, right? It's not just one thing. There's a product life cycle management, which shows as one is relatively stronger within where you're moderating in other areas. And over time, we've seen this engine continue to consistently deliver. For example, apparel, which is only about 20% of the entire Vans, is growing at a rate faster than the total brand growth, right? So you should think of this as being very broad-based and not really driven by just one franchise.","Steve Rendle","And I know specifically, in the footwear area, as you come into this time of year, this is where you'll see that MTE collection that we spoke about, more of the water resistant, more winterized versions of not just Classics, but you also see the Altra series continue to grow and its importance and scale. And the brand did a really good job talking about their whole focus on newness and being able to cycle new ideas through their DTC platform to find those next big levers of growth. Everything that they laid out really is just they'll be very methodical and maintain the rigor to keep that discipline in place.","John Kernan","That\u2019s excellent. Thanks. And then my final question just to keep it within the active segment, just on the outlook for operating margin within that segment as we go through the back half of the year. It's obviously up very significantly in the first half of this year on the top line growth. How should we think about that profitability in that segment as we head into the back half of the year?","Steve Rendle","Yes. Really, the impact there is mostly Vans, which is the largest property within that. And as we said, our guidance implies moderation in the second half. So you should assume that profit will moderate in the second half in that category as well. It's still growing but not quite as fast as the first half.","John Kernan","That\u2019s great. Thanks guys. Best of luck.","Steve Rendle","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. We have come to the end of our time allotted for questions. I'd like to turn the floor back to Mr. Rendle for any further comments.","Steve Rendle","Great. Thank you. I hope you can take away from the call here, we're really pleased with our performance through the first half of this fiscal year. The continued strength of our active businesses and the building momentum across Outdoor and Work segment is giving us confidence that we will deliver on our improved outlook for the balance of this year. I'd leave you with, we are sharply focused on executing against our strategic growth plan and positioning our portfolio for a sustainable long-term growth and value creation. So thank you for giving us time today. We look forward to talking to you in a couple of months.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference.

We are steadfast in our commitment to continue to evolve and transform V.F. into a more consumer-minded and retail-centric enterprise, and our results demonstrate the power, consistency, resiliency of our diversified value creation model.","Looking at our second quarter in more detail. Revenue increased 7% or 8% on an organic basis. Growth was driven by our two largest brands, Vans and The North Face, which grew 16% and 10%, respectively as the strong momentum for both brands continued. The strength of our Vans brand was fueled by a strong back-to-school season. The brand\u2019s growth and our business overall remains well balanced and diversified across geographies, channels and product categories.","While the core heritage business continues to generate strong double-digit growth, we are particularly encouraged by almost 30% growth in progression footwear, driven in part by the new ComfyCush franchise and continued momentum in apparel and accessories, which grew almost 20%. Based on our second quarter performance and our increased visibility to the full year, we are again increasing our growth outlook for the Vans brand. We now expect 13% to 14% growth for the full year, slightly ahead of the brand\u2019s long-term growth target.","Similarly momentum in The North Face continued in the second quarter as the brand achieved double-digit growth, driven by strong back-to-school results and strength across all regions. The brand\u2019s Mountain Lifestyle and Urban Exploration product territories are performing well as the brand executes against its strategy to attract new consumers and capitalize on growth opportunities beyond core Mountain Sports.","On October 1, The North Face launched FutureLight and nearly four weeks in, demand and sell-through have been stronger than expected. While the financial impact of FutureLight is \u2013 in fiscal 2020 will be somewhat limited, the disruptive innovation is casting a strong halo for the brand. We\u2019re looking forward to the second half of the year when the investments in FutureLight, specifically demand creation come to life and consumers have the opportunity to experience a broader product assortment across the portfolio.","Based on our second quarter performance, and our increased visibility to the full year, we are again increasing our growth outlook for The North Face brand. We now expect 9% to 10% growth for the full year, slightly ahead of the brand\u2019s long-term growth target. In line with expectations, Timberland and Dickies were up 1% and down 3%, respectively.","Similar to last quarter, Timberland\u2019s results across the globe were mixed as solid revenue growth in U.S. and APAC were offset by softness in EMEA. Notably, the planned business model changes in South America negatively impacted global revenue growth by 1%. For the full year, we continue to expect low-single-digit growth for the global Timberland brand, including sequential improvement in Europe.","The performance of the Dickies brand in the second quarter was impacted by the timing of its shipments in the U.S. mass channel compared to a year ago. Excluding the timing issue, revenue increased 6% globally, driven by solid growth in lifestyle, China, D2C and digital wholesale, all key growth drivers for the brand over the next five years. For the full year, we continue to expect mid-single-digit growth for the Dickies brand globally.","Looking at our growth platforms. International increased 8%, including nearly 25% growth in China, 9% growth in non-U.S. Americas and 5% growth in Europe, with strengths from the GAS region, Italy and France. Direct-to-consumer increased 12%, including a 9% total comp and nearly 20% growth in digital. Our fundamentals remained strong as gross margin, a key driver of our value creation model, reached 53.1%, providing us the fuel to continue to drive investment and the capabilities required to sustain our growth momentum. And lastly, adjusted EPS increased 8% in the second quarter to $1.26.","To briefly recap our first half results, revenue increased 9%, gross margin expanded by 100 basis points to 53.6% and EPS increased 18% versus the prior year. The quality and fundamentals of our business are sound. We are executing well and our transformation is fueling broad-based growth across the portfolio as we head into the second half of the year. We are confident in the trajectory of our business and in the updated outlook provided today.","However, the environment has become more uncertain over the past several months. Scott will cover the details in a moment, but several factors mainly FX, tariffs and the ongoing disruption in Hong Kong have largely offset the underlying operational strength of our business since we provided our last outlook in July. While all of the items just mentioned are small individually, collectively, they are weighing on our opportunities for upside performance for the remainder of fiscal 2020.","Regarding business conditions across the globe, U.S. consumer and retail environment remains relatively strong. Unemployment is low and we expect a healthy fall holiday season. In contrast, the industrial and manufacturing sectors have weakened somewhat over the past few months, resulting in more tempered growth expectations across the more cyclical parts of our work portfolio.","In EMEA, uncertainty related to Brexit continues to impact consumer confidence, resulting in a slight deceleration in our UK market. Across the rest of Europe, performance has been generally solid as we head into fall holiday. In APAC, despite the rhetoric, our brands continued to perform very well in China. To date, we have not experienced a meaningful change in consumer behavior as a result of trade tension. Further, the situation in Hong Kong has modestly impacted our regional performance. We will continue to evaluate all aspects of our business as events continue to unfold.","Turning to our Denver relocation. I\u2019m pleased to report that our move is at this point, essentially complete. Collectively, we now have approximately 800 associates, who are living and working in the Denver metro area. And in summer 2020, we\u2019re excited to have our Icebreaker North American business and our Smartwool business from Steamboat Springs join the rest of us here in Denver. The nearly five months since the move began and the progress and collaboration I\u2019ve seen to date across our brands and corporate leadership team has been amazing.","Finally, as many of you are aware, we have hosted an Investor Day in Beaver Creek, Colorado in late September. We shared information about our evolved integrated business strategy, individual brand strategies, regional overviews and our global supply chain and digital technology organizations. The theme of our Investor Day was The Power of And, which emphasizes the opportunities we see ahead when we strike the balance between working with a deep sense of purpose, while also remaining sharply focused on delivering strong business results and top quartile returns to our shareholders. We also reinforced our continued focus on transforming to a more consumer-minded, retail-centric and hyper-digital enterprise. If you\u2019re not able to attend, I encourage you to listen to the webcast.","To capture the spirit of our evolution and our focus on always becoming a better version of ourselves, at the Investor Day event, we also introduced a redesigned logo and branding that honors our 120-year history, while also conveying the energy, confidence and optimism we have for our future. Our evolved logo features a new tag line that clearly communicates the type of company we are and will continue to be, purpose-led, performance-driven.","This marks our first logo update in 21 years, but it\u2019s important to note that our new corporate brand is about much more than just an updated design, it\u2019s about elevating how we position our company and engage with our associates and outside stakeholders. As we move forward, our communication will become sharper, more purposeful and more consistent around the world. We believe the new logo and branding sets a powerful tone for enhanced communication and positioning.","So in summary, halfway through the year, our business is performing right in line with our expectations. We remain committed to investing in our brands for the long term, and we remain confident in our ability to deliver our outlook and another year of top-quartile returns for our shareholders.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Scott.","Scott Roe","Thanks, Steve. Our second quarter and first half results were strong and right in line with our expectations. The fundamentals of our business are solid, highlighted by year-to-date revenue growth of 9%, 100 basis points of gross margin expansion and 18% EPS growth. We are intensely focused on executing against our strategic objectives and driving our key growth engines and platforms as we head into the second half of the year.","As Steve mentioned in his opening remarks, the environment has become more uncertain over the past 90 days. While it\u2019s impossible to predict changes in consumer or business conditions, we believe our diversified portfolio and TSR algorithm give us the capacity to consistently deliver top-quartile returns. For those of you that joined us at the Investor Day last month, optionality and portfolio resiliency were key themes throughout our presentation and further support our ability to deliver against our long-term commitments.","Before getting into our second quarter results, I should point out that our reported GAAP figures include the impact of recent Swiss tax legislation, which positively impacted our second quarter EPS by $0.41. Certain provisions of the recently approved Swiss tax reform were enacted during the most recent quarter, resulting in adjustments to deferred tax positions of approximately $164 million for the quarter and the first half of fiscal 2020. My comments going forward will focus on adjusted results, excluding this one-time benefit.","So now let\u2019s recap our second quarter results. Revenue increased 8% organically led by our largest brands across our strategic growth platforms. Our Big 4 brands grew 9% collectively, driven by mid-teen D2C growth, including 20% growth in digital and double-digit comp growth. Wholesale increased at a high single-digit rate, and our Big 4 brands generated balanced growth across all geographic regions.","Vans delivered another strong quarter with 16% growth, driven by a strong back-to-school season. Growth remains well balanced across channels, geographic regions and product categories. Based on Vans\u2019 19% growth in the first half as well as our increased visibility into the full year, we are again increasing our outlook to a range of 13% to 14%, slightly above the brand\u2019s long-term commitment.","The North Face delivered another quarter of double-digit growth with balanced strength across regions and channels. And as Steve covered earlier, the successful FutureLight launch at the beginning of this month has generated strong brand heat globally, which further supports our bullish outlook for the brand, heading back into the back half of the year and into fiscal 2021. Based on TNF\u2019s 10% growth in the first half and our increased visibility into the full year, we are again increasing our outlook to a range of 9% to 10%, slightly above the brand\u2019s long-term commitment. The momentum we have in our two largest brands is strong. And as a reminder, 80% of our growth over the next five years is expected to come from Vans and The North Face, giving us high confidence in our ability to meet or exceed our commitments.","Timberland performed in line with expectations with low single-digit growth in the quarter. Strength in North America and Asia was partially offset by softness in Europe. We continue to expect low-single-digit growth for Timberland this year, including slightly stronger growth in the second half as the brand\u2019s European business begins to improve.","Dickies revenue was impacted this quarter by the timing of shipments in North America. Excluding this timing, global brand revenue increased 6%, led by 22% growth in Asia and 13% global D2C growth. The brand\u2019s key growth drivers outlined last month at the Investor Day work lifestyle apparel, D2C, China and digital are all performing well, and we have full confidence in our 5% to 6% target for fiscal 2020.","Our D2C business grew 12%, driven by 18% growth in digital and a 9% total comp. Wholesale also performed well with 6% growth, led by double digital growth in The North Face and Vans and 21% growth with our digital wholesale partners around the globe. Our ongoing transformation and hyper-digital strategic focus continues to fuel broad-based growth across the portfolio in both the D2C and the wholesale channels.","Moving on to our performance by geographic region. Revenue increased 8% both in the U.S. and internationally. Outside of the U.S., performance was balanced with 16% growth in Asia, 9% growth in non-U.S. Americas and 5% growth in Europe. China remained particularly strong with 24% growth, including balanced double-digit growth across channels and at each of our Big 4 brands.","Turning now to profitability. Gross margin expanded by 90 basis points this quarter to 53.1%, driven primarily by continued favorable mix shift toward higher-margin businesses and the timing of foreign currency transaction gains. Our gross margin for the first half was up by 100 basis points.","Operating margin expanded by 40 basis points to 17.9%, including 10% investment dollar growth in our strategic priorities, including demand and product creation, D2C, technology and supply chain. Consistent with the earnings algorithm we laid out at our Investor Day, for both the second quarter and the first half, we were able to use our structural gross margin expansion to accelerate investment, while at the same time delivering double-digit operating earnings growth. And that\u2019s our model.","EPS increased 8% compared to the prior year as 10% operating earnings growth and lower interest expense were slightly offset by a higher tax rate in the quarter. For the first half, EPS increased 18%, including low-teen operating earnings growth, in line with our internal plans and ahead of our long-range target of 10% to 12%.","Turning to the balance sheet. Inventories were up 10% this quarter, slightly ahead of our forward revenue outlook as we enter the key holiday season. Our owned inventory as well as inventory levels at our retail partners remain in good shape. We expect inventory growth to be more in line with our forward revenue growth expectations as we exit fall holiday season and enter fiscal 2021.","Adjusted leverage remains below targeted levels at just under 2 times, so we have significant capacity and are maintaining dry powder to pursue our M&A agenda. As you likely saw in our release, we\u2019ve raised our quarterly dividend by $0.05 to $0.48 per share, representing 12% growth. And as we covered with you in Beaver Creek, we\u2019re committed to double-digit dividend growth as a key component of our balanced, diversified TSR model.","So moving now to our updated fiscal 2020 outlook. Based on our second quarter and first half performance and our increased visibility into the full year, our fiscal 2020 outlook now includes the following. We continue to expect revenue to approximate $11.8 billion, representing reported growth of approximately 6%. On an organic constant dollar basis, this now represents more than 8% growth as unfavorable foreign currency rates have negatively impacted our revenue outlook by approximately $60 million relative to the outlook we provided in July. Excluding the impact of FX, the increase in our underlying operational outlook is largely driven by continued strength at Vans and The North Face.","On a constant dollar basis, we are raising our outlook for Vans to 13% to 14%, slightly ahead of the long-range growth target for the brand as broad-based momentum continues. We\u2019re also raising our outlook for The North Face to 9% to 10%, again slightly ahead of the long-range growth target for the brand. We now expect 1% to 2% growth in Timberland versus our prior expectation of 1% to 3%. And our outlook for the Dickies brand remains solid at 5% to 6% growth, which compares to our prior expectation of 5% to 7% growth.","We now expect the growth of our strategic platforms, international and D2C to be at the high end of our previously communicated ranges. International is expected to increase between 8% and 9%. And D2C is expected to increase between 12% and 13%, including about 25% growth in digital.","Moving down the P&L. We are maintaining our gross margin target of 54.1%, which implies about 80 basis points of expansion for the full year, including about 50 basis points of expansion in the back half of the year, driven primarily by mix. Relative to the first half, we expect a smaller benefit from FX transaction in the second half compared to the prior year. We continue to expect operating margin for the year to be 13.8%, which implies 90 basis points of expansion for the full year, including SG&A leverage for the second half of fiscal 2020, which we anticipate will be most pronounced in the fourth quarter.","EPS is still expected to be in the range of $3.32 to $3.37, representing 16% to 18% reported growth. On an organic constant dollar basis, EPS growth is now expected to exceed 20% as unfavorable FX rates have negatively impacted our EPS outlook by about $0.03 relative to the outlook we provided in July.","I\u2019d like to take a moment and address a few other items impacting our full year 2020 outlook and particularly our second half. We talked earlier about an increasingly uncertain environment versus 90 days ago. More specifically, FX, the ongoing disruption in Hong Kong and incremental tariffs have negatively impacted our fiscal 2020 outlook by about $0.07 relative to the outlook we provided in July. While none of these items just mentioned are material in isolation, collectively, they are impacting our fiscal 2020 EPS growth by about 2 percentage points relative to the prior outlook.","As further testament to the themes of optionality and portfolio resiliency, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2020 EPS guidance of $3.32 to $3.37, despite these incremental headwinds. While we\u2019re not immune to geopolitical and macro factors, we remain confident in the underlying strength and quality of our business and in our ability to deliver on our growth and TSR commitments.","So in summary, at the midpoint of fiscal 2020, we\u2019re pleased with the performance of our portfolio. Our fundamentals are strong. And our core growth engines and platforms are well positioned as we head into the fall holiday season. We are purposefully investing to sustain and accelerate our growth momentum and our balance sheet is well positioned to continue reinvesting in our business, capitalizing on M&A opportunities and pursuing other capital allocation priorities to further enhance the strength of V.F.\u2019s organic plan.","And now I\u2019d like to turn the call back to the operator and open up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Binetti","Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking our questions here. A couple for you on the brands. On Vans, obviously that\u2019s sort of a big driver given how much of the growth it\u2019s driven. Obviously, we\u2019ve all been watching the deceleration. You guys have spoken to it and the glide path down there relative to how you guys are thinking about it. And I know you said 2Q was right in line with your internal plan. You get that slowdown in the U.S. and EU obviously the compares are probably the reason why. But anything here unusual to call out that gives you confidence that we don\u2019t continue to decelerate further or break away from the plan in any way in 2H, I mean into 2020 for Vans?","And then on North Face, you noted that you\u2019re forecasting revenue growth now above the long-term targets slightly this year. So I guess it begs the question, why does North Face slow from here, given the work you\u2019ve done to rebase that brand, the consumer study, and then FutureLight being the first big innovation platform you guys have had in several years? Maybe you could talk to us about the implied slowdown there for the second half. Thanks.","Scott Roe","Yes, Michael, it\u2019s Scott here. First of all, on the Vans question, we\u2019re \u2013 yes, we\u2019re in line, actually we\u2019re tracking modestly better. And I\u2019ll remind you that both for Vans and The North Face, we\u2019ve increased our annual guidance based on the strength today than what we can see on a go-forward basis. So I\u2019d say in line and slightly even better on both of those brands from an expectation standpoint.","Also, one thing just to remember, as it relates to both Timberland and Vans in the second half, we did some structural changes in our cost of business, exiting some unprofitable markets and now have a modest drag in the second half. I think something like a half, somewhere between a half to 4 point growth impact in the second half on both of those brands.","Steve Rendle","Yes. Michael, on your question on North Face, we reconfirmed or actually increased our guidance to 9% to 10%. And yes, we\u2019ve been tracking a couple of digits. We remain extremely confident in the strategy that Arne laid out in our Investor Day, the launch of FutureLight and the halo that that\u2019s casting over the brand as an innovation platform. But more importantly just bringing the brand in front of more consumers through the increased marketing.","We continue to be very, very confident in the long-term growth prospects of North Face. I wouldn\u2019t \u2013 I guess, I wouldn\u2019t characterize that we\u2019re seeing a slowdown. We\u2019re seeing a continued improvement. We\u2019ve talked about we\u2019re early in our journey. A lot of work has been done and there\u2019s a lot more work to be done to put this brand in a really solid position, but we couldn\u2019t be more confident to where we are today with the results we\u2019ve seen today.","Michael Binetti","Okay. Seem like \u2013 if I could follow up one, Scott. Any help you could help us think about 3Q versus 4Q as far as where you\u2019ve left the embedded guidance for the second half of the year? Any help on cadence would be helpful. Thanks, guys.","Scott Roe","Yes. I guess two things, Michael, I\u2019d point out. So we talked about the gross margin about 50 bps expansion in the second half, and that is more structural. It\u2019s from mix. So you can expect that on a fairly linear basis. And we also talked about some SG&A leverage in the second half, I know near and dear to your heart, particularly in the fourth quarter. I do listen to you, Michael. Particularly in the fourth quarter because remember, we\u2019re up against some pretty big investments that we did last year in terms of incremental investments in Q4 last year. This year, those are more evenly spread throughout the year. So on a quarter-by-quarter basis, you\u2019ll see a relatively larger profit increase in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter.","Michael Binetti","Thanks a lot for all the help, guys. Have a good one.","Scott Roe","Yes, Michael.","Steve Rendle","See you, Michael.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jay Sole with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Jay, your line is live. You may proceed with your questions.","Jay Sole","Hi. Sorry about that. Scott, I just wanted to ask you about the strategic investments that you made in fiscal 2020 that impacted the operating margin that you showed in the operating margin bridge in the slide deck. What impact did that have in terms of basis points? Was it the entire 70 basis point impact on margins that it shows in the slide? Or is it only a piece of that? And then maybe can you help us a little bit more what those investments were?","Scott Roe","Yes. First of all, you\u2019re accurate in the way you characterize that, that is the entire amount. So it\u2019s the same things that we\u2019ve been talking about, Jay. It\u2019s D2C and digital. It\u2019s demand creation. It\u2019s our innovation agenda. It\u2019s the same things that we just highlighted in Beaver Creek that we believe are creating a meaningful point of difference for our brands. And these platforms are powerful and we intend to continue to invest in those things.","Jay Sole","Got it. And maybe when you talk about tariffs, it sounds like it\u2019s a $0.02, $0.03 impact. Is that sort of pre-mitigation? Do you expect to be able to work that number lower as we go through the year as you work on ways to sort of offset the tariffs or that sort of post everything that you plan on doing?","Scott Roe","No, I mean, that\u2019s the gross amount. But remember as we look forward, we talked about, for example, some of the mitigating actions. We\u2019ve said about 7% of our U.S. sourcing came from China this year. We expect that to be more like 4% next year. So the tariffs came mid-year, so there\u2019s a knock-on effect. On the other hand, we\u2019re mitigating the impact as you look going forward. So that\u2019s a long way of saying. As we look forward, unless there\u2019s another tweet or another series of tariffs that come in, you shouldn\u2019t expect much from an ongoing basis relative to tariffs.","Jay Sole","Okay. And then maybe last one for me, the 30 basis points of leverage in the quarter within gross margin is a nice number. And at the Investor Day last month, you talked about maybe 3% to 4% of that total shareholder return coming from margin expansion, but that was mostly sounded like mix. So what sort of the level of sales growth, obviously you had 9% comp in the quarter. What\u2019s the level of sales growth you need to continue to deliver to leverage on fixed costs to continue to drive gross margin on top of what you\u2019ll get from mix?","Scott Roe","Yes. Well, we just laid out a long-term algorithm, right? So it\u2019s 7% to 8% and so that\u2019s our expectation, first of all. And we also said, implied in that is some maybe modest leverage, but essentially, our operating margin expansion comes from that structural gross margin advantage that we have. And that\u2019s really the engine that allows us to reinvest. So again, no change in the way we look at it. I would say this though, there is optionality in the model. I spoke a lot about that in our Investor Day. So should we see a fundamentally different environment, which we don\u2019t today, by the way, but should we see a fundamentally different environment, there are levers we can pull to modulate expenses and meet the commitments that we\u2019ve made from an earnings standpoint.","Jay Sole","Got it. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Sam Poser with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.","Sam Poser","Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I\u2019m really wanted to get some more color on the Dickies brand, the work category and then smaller brands that you spoke of, in some detail at the Investor Day. If you could give us some color on sort of momentum on those smaller brands and then a little more color on this timing issue of the Work business?","Scott Roe","Yes. Maybe I\u2019ll start, Sam, just on the numbers side of this. So first of all, I\u2019m going to talk about Dickies, which is the largest portion of Work. I guess about 40% or so. And remember last quarter, we\u2019ve talked about the first half would be impacted by a couple of factors, one of which we talked about last quarter, which was the reset in Japan. And then the other is timing of particular large North American customer of ours. But what we mean by that is a year ago, we had a very large floor set to obviously get the pipe fill. That makes the comp in this particular quarter pretty tough. Interestingly, if you exclude that customer, the Dickies brand grew about 6% in the quarter.","But more importantly, as we look at the four \u2013 at the full year, we just talked about an outlook of 5% to 6%, which is in line with our long term expectations. And that\u2019s even despite some modest pressures on the more cyclical part of the Work business. So remember, Dickies has a unique aspect to it too with that Work lifestyle. And as we look at the second half of the year, the international business, you don\u2019t have the impact or the mitigation of the Japan reset. That\u2019s behind us in the second half. And we see significant growth in \u2013 particularly in China and also in Europe in the lifestyle business. And that was over 20% in Q2, and we expect that to continue to accelerate throughout the balance of the year.","A little shape on the rest of the Work portfolio, which again if we say overall we\u2019ve got about 40% exposure to the more cyclical part of the business, relatively more of that sits in those more traditional Work businesses. And we have seen some modest slowdown, but even with that, we grew about 3% in the first half. And we expect similar or actually slightly better in the second half primarily due to the acceleration of the Timberland PRO business in the second half. So hopefully, that gives you a little insight into what\u2019s going on, on the numbers side of it, Sam.","Steve Rendle","Yes. Sam, let me just add really quickly on Dickies, and I\u2019ll answer your question on the emerging brands. We are really confident in the Dickies brand. You will \u2013 what we see is greater mixing towards the \u2013 that Work Lifestyle piece that Denny spoke a lot about in our Investor Day. And that will really come to life first and foremost in China. And we\u2019ve seen that have a really strong impact on our growth there. And we\u2019ll be able to represent that very well through our own digital platforms, our D2C platforms and we\u2019ll watch that really expand across the globe and have a long term impact on how this brand evolves beyond that traditional work environment.","On the emerging brands, we\u2019re excited to share those brands with everybody at our Investor Day. We committed to those brands growing low double digits in performance that we\u2019ve seen to date is in line with those commitments. Our plan is not to share those brands on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but periodically give you an update and insight into how we\u2019re doing. But I tell you, we remain very confident and we believe that sitting inside those emerging brands is a breakout opportunity, and hence, our excitement to share those with you when we were together at Beaver Creek.","Scott Roe","And just add on to that from a numbers standpoint as we said in Beaver Creek, those brands don\u2019t make a big impact in the short term, but they have a strategic relevance that Steve and the team unpacked. And there, we believe, it can be The North Face and Vans of tomorrow. That really as we think about managing both the longer term and the shorter term, that\u2019s where these become relatively more impactful.","Sam Poser","Thank you guys very much. Continue the success.","Scott Roe","Thanks, Sam.","Steve Rendle","Thanks, Sam.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Erinn Murphy with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Erinn Murphy","Great, thanks. Good morning. I guess I want to start the conversation just a little higher level, Steve, with what you were referencing on the global consumer. It sounded like you said the U.S. consumer, you still feel relatively okay, about the consumer going into holiday. Can just expound upon that? What are you seeing currently with how retailers are interacting with vendors, anything from the promotional landscape? And then really stepping across the pond, how do you feel about the European consumer into holiday? That would be helpful. Thank you.","Steve Rendle","Sure. Yes, in my remarks, Erinn, I definitely did say that we don\u2019t see any significant changes in consumer behavior with our brands. And our D2C results, from a traffic conversion both in-store and online continue to support that. That said, we\u2019re paying attention. There\u2019s a lot of rhetoric in the marketplace that could change how consumers are thinking, but I think that\u2019s why we are spending the time really putting our brands in a positive light in front of our consumers and really inviting them to be part of our purpose-led journey. So really no change there, and as we look at our wholesale partners, no change in behavior there. Our retailers are well set for this fall holiday season. And as we head now into the cold part of the season, we are confident in our ability to deliver with our partners.","As we jump across the pond, as you would say, we see strength in our German, Austria, Swiss, French, Italian marketplaces. There is a little bit of softness in our UK business. We have seen a slight reduction in traffic. We think this is kind of a point in time and as the rhetoric there starts to settle and there truly is a path forward, we are very well positioned. London is a very critical market for where our brands come to life with flagship store environments. And we think as we mentioned in Beaver Creek, we\u2019ll be opening a new Timberland flagship there, along with the Vans flagship. So long term, we feel good about our opportunities in Europe. We just need to navigate some of these interesting times in the UK.","Scott Roe","Yes, Erinn, just to put on numbers on it, too. Just a reminder, you may have seen it, but we did take up our Europe or EMEA guidance even despite what Steve mentioned relative to Brexit and while we are on the international train, we also took up Asia, despite what\u2019s going on in Hong Kong and China. So we do see strength in the international markets.","Erinn Murphy","So maybe, Scott, just to that end, can you just share a little bit more about what you\u2019re specifically seeing in Hong Kong? I mean, there\u2019s obviously been even with relation to some of your brands, I think Vans in particular a little bit of negative press there. Can you just share kind of what you saw during the quarter? And to your point, China overall was still relatively resilient. So any help on kind of flow between the two? Thank you.","Scott Roe","Yes, maybe Steve and I both talk a little bit about this. But relative to the impact, there has been an impact as we pointed out, but keep in mind the Hong Kong market, specifically the city of Hong Kong is relatively small as a part of our total China business and we see really strong elements elsewhere in China, but Hong Kong specifically is definitely impacted. It\u2019s just not large enough to have a huge impact on overall VF.","Steve Rendle","And I think the results that we see in China are largely offsetting what we see going on in Hong Kong today. And you bring up Vans and what we\u2019ve seen going on there. I think just important to note that our Vans brand remains very committed around their purpose of really enabling creative self-expression. And the Custom Culture competition is really about supporting individual artists and really operating in a very apolitical way. And we remain \u2013 and our Vans brand remains very committed to driving that purpose forward and doing it in a way that really doesn\u2019t bring politics in, but really focuses on the individual artist in that sense of creative self-expression. And we\u2019re navigating that very well and if anything, just an even stronger commitment coming across all of the regions.","Erinn Murphy","And then just one more for me just on Vans. Can you talk about how you see the potential incremental opportunity given that skateboarding is now an Olympic sport? Is that something you guys are going to be kind of playing into, as we go into the Japan 2020?","Steve Rendle","For sure. Yes, I think that\u2019s why you hear Doug speak so confidently about why skateboarding is that true authentic expression of brand\u2019s creative self-expression. And how they will activate around the Olympic Games, it will be a very, very important part of that time \u2013 point in time. I would also tell you Erinn, climbing is part of the Japan Olympics. And our North Face brand is a key sponsor of a number of different countries around the globe\u2019s climbing team. And you\u2019ll see us very well represented there as well.","Erinn Murphy","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew Boss","Great, thanks. So maybe at The North Face brand on FutureLight, how best to think about the phasing of shipments that we\u2019ll see from here? And on profitability of the brand, any structural impediment to returning to the prior peak operating margins at The North Face, which I think would equate to close to 500 basis points of opportunity?","Steve Rendle","So Matt, I will take the FutureLight, then I\u2019ll happily let Scott handle that second part of your question. So FutureLight phasing, we are about four weeks into the launch. And to date, sell-through is strong and actually ahead of expectations. And I mentioned earlier, the FutureLight advertising is casting a really strong halo over the brand. And we\u2019re seeing strong response, especially in these core markets of North America and Europe where these more premium mountaineering ski silhouettes come to life.","Phasing, as we \u2013 we\u2019re really now into that point in time. Third quarter and how it carries into fourth quarter is where the phasing of those deliveries are at their strongest. And you see us very well assorted in our own stores and very well assorted across the globe in those key specialty retailers. So we\u2019re right now in the heat of this launch. And what you see at retail and online is the full representation.","But I think it\u2019s really important to remind everybody that this is a very limited launch in our Summit Series, Steep Series and Flight Series. So that\u2019s not a very large number of styles. You\u2019ll see that grow as we move into the spring 2020 and another leap forward as we move into fall 2020 as the brand begins to replace current waterproof, breathable technologies with the FutureLight platform.","Scott Roe","And Matt, relative to the operating margin, just like we reminded you from the top line standpoint, remember that Vans and The North Face are really outsized drivers from both the top and bottom line standpoint. That\u2019s driven outdoor as well. There is no structural reason why we can\u2019t continue to see operating margin expand. We\u2019re going to approach the mid-teens earnings growth in the outdoor sector this year, and that\u2019s continued progress along a path that we see. We don\u2019t see any reason why we can\u2019t return to, I\u2019ll call it more historical-type operating margins in the outdoor sector.","You\u2019re probably looking at the quarter and where the growth is not quite as strong as what we expect for the full year. A couple of things to remember. Number one, we already had a big marketing campaign embedded relative to FutureLight because this is a really big idea and an opportunity for the brand, and creates a halo. And then we talked a quarter ago about putting even more money to work. And so that is spread through the balance of the year, but certainly is impacting profitability, profitability in the current quarter.","Matthew Boss","Great. And then maybe on Vans, any shifts in demand with later back-to-school timing this year? We\u2019ve heard that from some others out there. How would you rank opportunities to further broaden the reach of the brand from here? And maybe as a microcosm, just any learnings from the recent success of the ACE pro launch, which I know is at $100 price point, a little bit higher than some of your other launches.","Steve Rendle","So that\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything from a phasing standpoint that we would call out specifically. I\u2019ll take the last part of your question, and remind me of the middle. But on the ACE launch, I think key learnings there, that \u2013 at that AUR that\u2019s a higher-than-normal price point. And I think as you know personally, that product in a couple colorways sold out almost immediately. So we know that there\u2019s a significant demand for innovative product beyond those core heritage styles. And that\u2019s why the progression part of the Vans go forward strategy is so important, is being able to push new ideas, new price points, higher AURs as a way of driving this brand long term. So really, really important and very strong validation based on that particular platform. And I\u2019m sorry, the middle part of the question?","Matthew Boss","You kind of just answered it. It was opportunities to further broaden the reach of the brand.","Steve Rendle","Okay. No, it really is around the progression, footwear, it\u2019s about apparel and accessories. They continue to drive very, very strong growth and are important parts of just expanding the wearing occasions and the opportunities for consumers to participate in the brand.","Matthew Boss","Great color. Best of luck.","Steve Rendle","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Laurent Vasilescu with Macquarie Group. Please proceed with your question.","Laurent Vasilescu","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Scott, I wanted to follow up on the timing shifts between quarters. Dickies was down 4%, but excluding the timing, it was up 6%. Is $25 million the right number to think about for the timing shift? And were there any other timing shifts for the other big brands that we should consider?","Scott Roe","Yes. So I\u2019ll have to go back and think about your math. You\u2019re \u2013 knowing you, you\u2019re probably in the ballpark, but let\u2019s confirm that number offline. I guess the bigger \u2013 let me answer the second part. No other big timing shifts really. Although if you look \u2013 listen, our first quarter, we had 86% EPS growth, right? And so for the first half, 18%. So of course there\u2019s some timing shift that we saw between Q1 and Q2. I think the bigger picture here is, don\u2019t get too isolated on any particular quarter, right?","Our first half, we grew 9% on the top line, 18% on the bottom line. We\u2019ve got a similar top line implied in our guidance for the second half and actually accelerating from an earnings standpoint. So as we look at it, yes, a little bit of quarter-to-quarter noise. But if you zoom out and look at the big picture, this is a very solid year and actually ahead of the guidance that we just laid out in Beaver Creek.","Laurent Vasilescu","Okay. Very helpful. Thank you. And then I wanted to follow up on M&A. I think in the prepared remarks, you talked about dry powder to pursue your M&A agenda. Can you remind us how much leverage you\u2019re willing to take on to maintain your credit rating? How much time it would \u2013 you would want to give back to just under two times, if that\u2019s the target longer term? And would you be willing to issue equity for the right sized deal?","Scott Roe","Okay. So first of all, at our current rating, it\u2019s \u2013 debt to EBITDA is two times is what our target is. We\u2019re a little south of that right now. So obviously even at that, there\u2019s capacity. We showed our willingness to lever up as long as there\u2019s a glide path. There\u2019s no absolute number, it depends on the asset, it depends on the circumstances. But I think it\u2019s fair to say within a couple year period, more or less, as long as we could get back to a reasonable leverage rate in general, other rating agencies have gone with us on that and we\u2019ve got history that shows that.","I think we have a lot of credibility that they would stay with us. We\u2019ve also said we\u2019re willing to take a one-step downgrade. At BBB plus, still investment grade, still access to CP, but obviously more capacity. That takes you about 0.5 turns up in terms of debt capacity. And then finally, the last element is, yes, we\u2019re willing to issue equity for the right deal. So put that all together and it says we could do a really big deal.","Laurent Vasilescu","Very helpful. Thank you very much, guys. And best of luck.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Bob Drbul","Hey, guys. Good morning. Just wondering if I could ask a couple of questions on Timberland. When you look at like the regional performances and the differences, especially Americas versus Europe, can you just help us understand that a little bit better, especially the wholesale piece? And is the European weakness all UK in Timberland?","Steve Rendle","Sure. So Timberland North America, the performance we see there is our classic business stabilized a number of quarters ago. And we\u2019ve seen a good performance with that being at baseline foundation. But where we\u2019re seeing improvement is on a number of those diversification vectors, specifically some of the new \u2013 the newer footwear where we\u2019re bringing a little bit more of a contemporary styling. But we\u2019re also seeing really good sell-through on \u2013 in our apparel category both here in North America, but also in Europe.","So the focus there, Bob, just continues to put the proper diversification tools in place for this brand to move beyond the heritage footwear, to move beyond the brown shoe classification and really start to unlock some of these more lifestyle elements. Starting within footwear, getting to that younger consumer with more than just boots, but starting to elevate our presence with apparel and we\u2019re really pleased with what we see going on in apparel category.","In Europe, yes, the UK is part of our issue, but it\u2019s really the \u2013 the men\u2019s footwear business last year, with some of the weather conditions that we endured, slowed down. And it\u2019s a significant part of the business. And that\u2019s what you see impacting our results. But there as well, women\u2019s footwear, apparel are doing well. And the product enhancements that Martino represented in Beaver Creek, as those start to come online, we see line of sight through our order book for spring 2020.","We\u2019re confident we\u2019re working on the right things. It will just take us time to get these products to the marketplace to get that consumer response. And as we start to see that sell-through come across the men\u2019s footwear, we\u2019re confident that the plan we have in place will drive our long term growth projections.","Bob Drbul","Got it. And if I could just ask on the inventory, took inventory up 10%. And I think you said your owned inventory and partners are in good shape. But in terms of as you look forward, was there \u2013 is there a big front-load on the inventory side? Are there any pockets within your inventory that you are concerned about? Or just trying to understand that number a little bit better. Thanks.","Scott Roe","Yes, Bob. The short answer is, we\u2019re not concerned about inventory. We did build up a little bit coming into our largest season from a service standpoint. That\u2019s been a priority. As you think about in particular our largest brand, Vans, we have been chasing this for a long time. And frankly, our service hasn\u2019t been at the level that our partners or we expect. So bringing that back to normal puts a little bit of pressure as well as being ready for what we think is going to be a good fall\/winter season, right? This is when we make hay from a North Face in particular standpoint.","So yes, it\u2019s a little bit up relative to the growth rate going forward. But importantly, when we look at the quality of the inventory and we look at where we expect to end this year, we don\u2019t see any issues from an inventory standpoint. As it relates to inventories at retail, we told you coming into the season, everybody was in pretty good shape. We read the same things you do. I know there are pockets of issues out there. All I can say is as it relates to our brands and our partners, we don\u2019t see particular issues. Now it is worth noting as we think about fall, did get off to a bit of a slow start in the U.S. Importantly though, we\u2019ve seen that starting to reverse. And we\u2019ve seen that in the most recent month, we\u2019ve seen improvement from a retail activity and from a sell-through standpoint.","Bob Drbul","Great. Thanks, Scott.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Komp with Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Jonathan Komp","Yes, hi. Thank you. Maybe just a bigger picture question related to some of the incremental pressures that you called out relative to 90 days ago, the $0.07 of tariffs in Hong Kong and some of the other uncertainties. Just curious maybe how you\u2019ve embedded those assumptions going forward. Like have you made assumptions that those factors continue? And barring any changes in the environment, would you still be set up to pretty healthily deliver on what you\u2019ve laid out going forward?","Scott Roe","Yes. We don\u2019t try to get in the prediction business, Jonathan. I mean we look at the most recent trends, what we know and we try to factor in what\u2019s in front of us. I think I mentioned earlier in the call, for example, we\u2019re not expecting more tariffs. But with the tariffs that we know about, we\u2019ve factored those in, as well as on a go-forward basis, mitigating actions.","I think the important thing to remember on that $0.07 and with the point we were making is not that we\u2019re in a different place. We actually don\u2019t believe we\u2019re in a fundamentally different place. You heard Steve mention how we see the consumer, the overall environment. The point there was by reiterating our guidance and absorbing that $0.07. We\u2019ve really operationally absorbed that and strengthened our operational guide by holding our reported guide at from $3.32 to $3.37. That was the point that we were trying to make, not that we\u2019re in a fundamentally different place because we\u2019re not.","Jonathan Komp","Okay. Great. And maybe just one more kind of near term follow-up, when you think about the next couple of quarters, certainly looks like there\u2019s diverging trends maybe across categories. Some may be heavier on inventory, some of your categories, not so much. And then even just varying impacts from tariffs and the other pieces, how do you think about some of the divergences between kind of the winners and losers as you look forward to the holiday? And any thoughts there would be appreciated.","Steve Rendle","Maybe just some clarity on the winners and losers. Is that a brand question or is that retailer question? Just some context.","Jonathan Komp","Yes. It could be both, frankly. But certainly, there are some pockets where inventory seems heavier. And certain brands and retailers seem lesser positioned than maybe your portfolio. So I\u2019m just curious how you\u2019re viewing that within the context of your brands, and if there\u2019s any, I mean, spillover impact potentially if there\u2019s other pockets of weaknesses.","Steve Rendle","Sure. I think what we see are the strong brands continue to get stronger. Those brands are bringing innovative products, driving really powerful brand experiences. They\u2019re inviting consumers to be part of those moments. Those are the winners. And our portfolio we feel is very well positioned. The work we\u2019ve been doing over the last 2.5 years to put ourselves in this place, very well positioned to compete with that kind of consumer behavior.","From a retailer standpoint, again, the work that we\u2019ve been doing over the last 2.5 years has really positioned us away from those parts of the market, what we call the kind of the middle of that hourglass where there is quite a bit of tension in the system and some lack of differentiation. We\u2019re positioned through our own stores, our own digital platforms, our key accounts across the globe, really, in those pockets of the market where retail is succeeding. And our focus on becoming a more consumer-minded, retail-centric provider of products and experiences, not just for ourselves but for our wholesale partners as well, is to be that better partner that\u2019s able to deliver the proper amount of product at the right time for that particular moment in the year, and in a way that helps drive positive margins for both ourselves and our key accounts is a big part of our go-forward strategy. And you see that working today in this shift in our portfolio.","Jonathan Komp","Okay, great. That\u2019s very helpful to hear. Thank you.","Scott Roe","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group. Please proceed with your question.","Dana Telsey","Good morning, everyone. As you think about the wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels, how do you think about them by brand and what you\u2019re seeing for the back half of the year? And on direct-to-consumer, with the 9% comp you had, what are you seeing from full line and factory stores? And where you see the base of factory stores today and where it\u2019s going? Thank you.","Steve Rendle","Okay. So wholesale D2C by brand, I think a big part of our go-forward strategy and the work we\u2019ve been doing is really to increase the level of our direct-to-consumer presence as we move towards \u2013 from a low 30% as we trend now toward a 40% of our revenue coming from our own stores, these are really important shifts. This is a place where we\u2019re able to have that strong representation of our brand in very authentic environments.","And across our portfolio, the \u2013 as we evolve our portfolio, it really is with brands that have the ability and the permission to operate in a direct manner. But we take those learnings into our wholesale partners as well. And we talk a lot about key accounts and where we\u2019re able to collaboratively represent our brands within their environments consistent with what we\u2019re doing in our own stores. So that mix and focus on D2C helps us be a better wholesale partner as well.","Scott Roe","Yes, just a reminder, Dana. Also, outlets for us is not a growth strategy. It\u2019s about one-third of our owned fleet. But when you consider partner doors and actual consumer-facing mono-branded stores, it falls to more like 20%. So only about one-fifth of our consumer-facing retail points of sale are outlet. And we\u2019re going to continue to think of it from that standpoint. So we\u2019re probably not the best to answer the overall outlet environment because we don\u2019t play in it in a meaningful way.","Dana Telsey","Thank you.","Steve Rendle","Thank you, Dana.","Scott Roe","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session, so I\u2019d like to pass the floor back over to Mr. Rendle for any additional concluding comments.","Steve Rendle","Great. Thank you. Hey everybody, thank you for joining us this morning. We\u2019re pleased with the strength and quality of our second quarter results. The \u2013 our underlying business is strong. And our first half was right in line with our plan, up 9% and 18% in earnings. And our reaffirmation of our full year, I think, is just another data point of our commitment and our \u2013 really our confidence in our ability to just deliver against our long-range plan.","We are very committed to continue to evolve not only our portfolio, but how we operate as a more consumer-minded, retail-centric, hyper-digital enterprise, putting ourselves, our brands in a much more powerful position to connect with our consumers and drive really how businesses like ours operate forward into the coming years.","So look forward to talking to with you all in the coming quarters and thank you for joining us.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. Again, we thank you for your participation and you may disconnect your lines at this time."],"21564":["VF Corp.

Good day, and welcome to the VF Corporation Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would now like to turn the conference over to Lance Allega, VP of IR and Strategic Accounts. Please go ahead sir.","Lance Allega - VF Corp.","Thank you, good morning and welcome to VF Third Quarter 2016 Results. I'd like to remind everyone that participants on the call will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to certain uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These uncertainties are detailed in documents filed regularly with the SEC. Unless otherwise noted, amounts that our participants refer to on today's call will be predominantly in currency-neutral terms which we define in the press release that was issued at 6:55 A.M. Eastern this morning. We use currency-neutral amounts as lead numbers in our discussion because we feel it more accurately represents the true operational performance and underlying results of our businesses and brands.","You may also hear us refer to reported amounts which are in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These amounts include the impact from foreign currency exchange rates. Reconciliations of GAAP measures to currency-neutral amounts can be found in the supplemental financial tables included in the press release which identify and quantify all excluded items. On August 26, we announced that we had completed the sale of the Contemporary Brands Coalition to Delta Galil Industries. Accordingly, those assets and liabilities were moved into discontinued operations and results present on today's call are based on continuing operations.","Joining us on today's call will be VF's Chairman and CFO, Eric Wiseman; President and COO, Steve Rendle; President of our International business, Karl Heinz Salzburger; and our CFO, Scott Roe. Following our prepared remarks, we'll open the call for questions and ask that you limit yourselves to two per caller. Thanks. Eric?","Eric C. Wiseman - VF Corp.","Thanks, Lance, and good morning, everyone. We have a lot to share on today's call; so I'll get right to it. You'll hear that our third quarter results confirm our ability to deliver value in an uneven global economy. You'll hear caution around the external environment and confidence that our operational discipline can safeguard profitability in the near term and long term. But what you won't hear is that it's business as usual for VF. Let's start with the environment.","Last October, our year-to-date revenue on a comp basis was up 9% and EPS was up 17% including broad based strength across our brands and regions around the world. However, during the past four quarters, weak consumer spending, the warmest winter on record, retail bankruptcies and excess inventory in the off-price channel have had an outsized impact, particularly on our U.S. business. Consistently positive results from our International business, which is about 40% of our revenues, have been somewhat offset by a slight decline in our U.S. business. Simply put, we've seen mixed results. By channel, our D2C business has seen steady growth, up 7% year-to-date and we've made significant progress towards amplifying our connection with consumers in the space where we directly control our brands.","In harnessing this powerful growth driver, we're keeping a sharpened eye towards brick-and-click channel shifts while staying laser-focused on productivity and ensuring our growth-oriented investments are balanced accordingly. In wholesale, conservative retailer open-to-buys, buy-now, wear-now calendar shifts and leaner inventory positions remain among the top priorities for many retailers. As you'd imagine, this conservatism has put even greater pressure on vendors who are being asked to take on larger inventory risk to meet demand closer to consumer need. And while we don't like it, rather than speculatively building inventory, we've reduced our inventory buys to protect our brands and ensure channel health. And we're pulling various levers to preserve gross margin expansion and ensure profitability. With inventory up only 1%, we're confidently managing the business to be in line with the environment. That said, let's take a look at how this environment impacted our third quarter top-line results.","Revenue was down 1%. And while we were down in the U.S., VF's International business was up 6% with a 6% increase in Europe, a 9% increase in the non-U.S. Americas region and 4% growth in Asia-Pacific. Our direct-to-consumer business was also up 6% with strength in the Outdoor & Action Sports and Jeanswear coalitions being tempered by ongoing weakness in Sportswear. Our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition was up 2%, driven by an 8% increase in Vans and essentially flat results for both The North Face and Timberland. Keep in mind, these three brands faced tough comps against last year's third quarter when Timberland was up 21%, The North Face up 11% and Vans up 10% in a very different environment.","Let's take a moment on Vans and paraphrasing Mark Twain, the reports of Vans' decline have been greatly exaggerated. So let's take a closer look. Unless you've been following along all year, Vans' 8% growth on top of last year's 10% growth doesn't tell the whole story. As we've detailed on previous calls, Vans' EMEA business, which is about 25% of global revenue, has been working through an inventory imbalance in 2016. This work-through saw Vans' EMEA revenue down slightly this quarter, which is exactly what we expected. And we still expect the brand to return to growth in the last quarter of this year. In Asia, the Vans momentum continued with revenue up more than 20%. Now, in the Americas, despite reports from channel checks and even partner commentary that was mistakenly interpreted to our brand, the Vans business was up 10%, which is an acceleration of 9% in the second quarter and 8% in the first quarter. That makes 10% growth on top of 10% growth for the Vans America business. So by quarter, 8%, 9% and 10%. And we're expecting the fourth quarter to be in line with the third quarter. And yes, that's more detail than we normally give, but it just seemed necessary this time around.","Next up and returning to the mixed and uneven environment theme, Jeanswear revenue was down 4% following seven consecutive quarters of mid-single-digit growth. Steve will go into greater detail about the particulars in the quarter. But on balance for the year, Q3 should prove to be an anomaly and we expect Jeanswear to return to mid-single-digit growth in the fourth quarter. Our Imagewear coalition declined 4% as growth in our Licensed Sports Group was offset by ongoing sector challenges in the workwear business. And despite the revenue decline, profit remained strong, up more than two points. Our Sportswear business saw revenue decline 13% and the story there remains the same, troubling U.S. department store and outlet conditions along with general category weakness and finally, in August, we completed the sale of the Contemporary Brands business to Delta Galil Industries.","Now rounding out the P&L, on a currency-neutral basis, our gross margin was up 130 basis points to 49% and our operating margin was up 50 basis points to 18.6%. Take that through to the bottom line, and currency-neutral EPS was up 16%.","While we're certainly not satisfied with this quarter's top-line performance, we clearly demonstrated some of the many levers we have at our disposal to ultimately get the EPS job done and we did just that.","So what's not business as usual? The current environment has led us to employ even greater analysis with respect to the areas of the business where we can become stronger, more efficient and more effective, from processes and operations to product creation, category expansion and distribution opportunities, to the shape of our brand portfolio and where we ultimately plan to take it in our next chapter.","All of this requires an aggressive, yet measured and holistic approach to marketplace management, to bring the industry's most compelling and innovative products to consumers more quickly, delivering premium experiences whenever, wherever and however they connect with our brands.","Our approach is centered on the development of business scenarios assessing the risks and opportunities by brand and platforms and the playbook necessary to address them and then leveraging the full power of VF's operational and financial disciplines. If this sounds like just the type of content that would fill an Investor Day, then you would be correct. It's an event we're targeting for sometime late in the first quarter of 2017, with more details to follow.","And speaking of next chapters, we announced earlier this month that I'm retiring from the CEO position and will remain Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors. The board named Steve Rendle CEO effective January 1.","I give VF's board a lot of credit for its longstanding rigorous approach to succession planning and Steve's selection is the direct result of this process. When I became CEO nine years ago, within the first few months, the board began work to identify and prepare the right person to succeed me. Steve is the right person. I know most of you have had the pleasure of meeting Steve and I can assure you, VF will be in very capable hands.","Steve?","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Thanks, Eric. Appreciate the kind words and the trust that VF's Board of Directors has placed in me. I look forward to January 1 and the incredible opportunities that lie ahead for VF in its next chapter.","For now, let's take a look at Q3. Starting with the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition, revenue was up 2%. As described earlier, where we control our brands directly, we continue to see consistent growth. In the quarter, Outdoor & Action Sports D2C was up low-double digits with positive results in 9 of our 11 brands. This was offset by a low-single-digit decline in wholesale, where a tough comp against last year's low-teen increase, buy-now, wear-now calendar shifts and bankruptcies tempered results.","Turning to our three largest brands, revenue for The North Face was flat with a mid-teen increase in D2C offset by a mid-single-digit decline in wholesale. Keep in mind that last year, The North Face grew 11% in the third quarter. So even though the results were flat, we performed relatively well given the changes in the environment and retailer caution around orders headed into this winter season. On a comp basis, if you exclude impacts from bankruptcies, global revenues for The North Face would have been up at a mid-single-digit rate.","In the Americas, revenue was down mid-single-digits with healthy mid-teen D2C growth offset by a low-double-digit decline in wholesale. Bankruptcies had a big impact on our wholesale business. Without them, total revenue for The North Face Americas would have been flat in the quarter versus a mid-single-digit decline.","Versus last year, we did see a meaningful shift of retailers wanting deliveries later in the calendar, particularly a third quarter to fourth quarter shift. This reflects the desire to have leaner inventory positions and match consumers' buy-now, wear-now behavior. Setting floors with seasonal products when it's actually the season is a shift we believe is appropriate and one that should eventually help mitigate what's been a volatile markdown environment.","Taking a look at some of the product highlights during the quarter, as we continue to evolve our Four Seasons strategy, warm weather categories like training apparel, lightweight outerwear and sportswear continue to resonate. Our Mountain Athletics collection, along with products like DRYZZLE, VENTURE and MILLERTON have seen some early season momentum. Additionally, Thermal 3D, our new smooth-faced fleece, is already a top five selling sportswear style in our direct-to-consumer business. We also saw strong results in backpacks and logo wear which combined were up at a mid-teen rate.","On the branding side, less than two weeks ago, in honor of its 50th anniversary, The North Face unveiled its new global brand campaign Question Madness. The campaign's digital content series showcases athletes from throughout the brand's history examining individual motives for exploration and the gratification that comes from pushing norms and boundaries. And finally, on Wednesday this week, The North Face officially opens its Fifth Avenue store in New York City, an immersive brand experience that includes an interactive climbing wall, our unique consumer segmentation strategy and custom product that will only be available at that location.","Clearly a lot of momentum, innovation and experience is at play, yet we're electing to take a cautious approach to the balance of the year to more closely mirror market conditions. Despite the fact that we feel well positioned with our inventory in the channel, it's readily apparent that there is a lot of competitive product in the marketplace, particularly in the off-price channel that's stunting early autumn momentum. This, along with bankruptcies and warmer September and October conditions, have caused us to take a more prudent position with inventory to try to mitigate markdown risk and protect the long-term integrity of the brand.","Given this conservatism in the Americas business, we're taking our full-year global expectations down to low-single-digit growth compared to the previous mid-single-digit. This move is also mirrored in our full-year Outdoor & Action Sports coalition outlook. Certainly not what we'd like to do at this point, but on balance, the right thing to do for the brand and overall channel health.","Now to K.H.","Karl Heinz Salzburger - VF Corp.","Good morning, everyone. The North Face European business had another strong quarter with revenue up over 20%, driven by high-teen increase in D2C and more than 20% growth in our wholesale business. Demand remained strong across most geographies and product categories. Warm weather products performed well in the quarter with our Mountain Athletics collection up over 70%, driven by our expanded men's collection. Sportswear also performed strongly with revenue up over 20%. In September, our new Thermoball campaign went live across e-Commerce, retail and wholesale, good timing before cooler weather has started to set in.","During the quarter, we opened our first Urban Exploration store in London, an active lifestyle-focused location geared at the city adventurer. We also opened our first branch stores based on a (14:16) new concept with a higher focus on the consumer experience and our distinct consumer segmentation strategies. Early results have been very promising. We're really pleased with the enhanced European business. The work we started a few years ago with respect to local-for-local product design, our targeted distribution strategy and changes in the way we reach consumers has put the business solidly on track for a very strong year.","In Asia, third quarter revenue was down slightly. Our Retail business saw mid-teen growth, driven by strength in Hong Kong and strong e-Commerce sales, which more than doubled as we revamped our website. This was offset by mid-single-digit decline in wholesale due to heavy promotions across the Outdoor category in China. Overall, we expect Asia to return to growth in the fourth quarter.","Now on to Vans.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","I think Eric's opening run on Vans was pretty straightforward about the confidence we have in VF's second largest brand, the strong momentum that continues and its ability to perform consistently well against expectations. In the third quarter, Vans global revenue was up 8% driven by a mid-teen increase in D2C and a slight bump in wholesale driven by strong results in the Americas and Asia-Pacific businesses. In the Americas, revenue was up 10%. D2C, which is more than 50% of this region's revenue, and there is your cautionary tale about market share data, was up at a low-teen rate with 15% e-Commerce growth.","Wholesale revenue was up mid-single-digits with fairly even strength across concepts. And to point out once again, this 10% increase follows 9% growth in Q2, which was up from 8% growth in Q1. During the quarter, our new LIGHTs and ISO models met the demands of the athletic lifestyle-inspired consumer with lightweight construction, new colors and materials. Our classic styles, specifically the Sk8-Hi and Old Skool, continued to perform really well and have been recently called out by quite a few magazines and blogs as the \"it\" shoe being frequently seen on the feet of celebrities, athletes and tastemakers worldwide. And of course, in its 50th year of business, Vans' heritage remains front of mind. As the original and still number one skate shoe in core board shops, we continue to support skateboarders worldwide.","During the quarter, Vans held its first Pro Skate Park Series competition in four countries to create the platform for skateboarding's inaugural participation in the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics. Earlier this month, Vans launched a collection celebrating the original characters from Disney's Toy Story movie, which showcases Andy's favorite toys across an extensive assortment of adult and kids footwear as well as apparel and accessories. Following Star Wars and Nintendo, the bar is set pretty high, but early momentum on this one is very encouraging.","To close out, Vans remains obsessively focused on their consumer and is becoming even better and more capable of delivering the right product across multiple channels. With momentum and the ever-present \"it\" factor on our side, we're looking forward to finishing yet another strong year for the brand in the Americas.","Karl Heinz Salzburger - VF Corp.","Vans' European business continued its sequential improvement, with revenue down at the low-single-digit rate. This result is right where we said we would be on our last call, so tracking along as planned. Independent of wholesale, which is where inventory actions have taken place all year, our DTC business has performed well with revenue up 20%. This was driven by mid-teen comps and e-Commerce, which was up more than 40% on the back of a new platform launch.","Our iconic Old Skool and Sk8-Hi Classic delivered solid advance sales. Our Pro Skate performance was also strong with sales up more than 30%, supported by the finance of the Pro Skate Park Series, which were held in Malm\u00f6, Sweden.","Our Panel business also continues to show really strong results. Overall, for Vans Europe, we expect this business to return to growth in the fourth quarter.","In Asia, Vans revenue continues to impress with more than 20% growth driven by almost 40% growth in DTC and a mid-teen increase in our wholesale business. Similar to last quarter, e-Commerce had a significant role in these results by doubling its business.","Looking at products, Old Skool continues to perform well and was up over 70% compared to last year, while the Nintendo Collection continues to be a hit and had over 80% sell-through. We also completed a series of House of Vans pop-up events across Asia, which continues to be a key brand activation platform centered around creative self-expression. With more than 45,000 attendees and over 2.5 million live video views in China, we are constantly driving momentum through visibility and consumer touch points. And finally, China continues to maintain strong momentum, posting over 30% growth on the back of an aggressively growing e-Commerce business.","Globally, Vans remains on track to deliver high-single-digit growth for the year. Now on to Timberland.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Timberland global revenue was down slightly compared to last year with a mid-single-digit decline in D2C and flat wholesale results. Timberland had the toughest comparison at VF in the third quarter as it was up against a 21% growth last year, which was driven by a 40% increase in the Americas business. Excluding impacts from bankruptcies, global revenues for Timberland would have been up at a low-single-digit rate.","The Americas had a mid-single-digit decline with flat D2C results, offset by a mid-single-digit decline in wholesale. The dip in wholesale reflects the impacts of the proactive reduction in sell-in that we spoke about on our last call and a buy-now, wear-now calendar shift very similar to The North Face with retailers trying to set floors later in the year for cold weather product. D2C was flat including gains in full-price stores and nearly a 30% increase in e-Commerce being offset by outlet locations, which saw a reduction in traffic. And similar to last quarter, the PRO business is still under pressure from subdued oil and gas exploration and industrial manufacturing.","Product-wise, we've continued to see momentum in the men's casual footwear across both wholesale and D2C, which is positive validation that our diversification strategy is working. We're particularly excited about the success of our SensorFlex platform, with collections like Britton Hill and Amherst seeing excellent sell-through.","Another bright spot is The Timberland Boot Company, which was our top family in D2C and saw strong results with our exclusive department store partner. At more than $300 a pair, this reinforces we have permission to play in the premium footwear market.","In women's, we see a similar story with our casual footwear collections. Revenues for our heeled Glancy six-inch boot were up five times in D2C and the Kenniston, again a SensorFlex style, saw strong sell-through as well, more proof points that Timberland's focus on women is paying off.","Helping to drive this success, we launched a new marketing campaign touting the Flex Appeal of SensorFlex being on both style and performance. The brand also launched a 360-degree marketing campaign centered on our Yellow Boot, driving extensive awareness, PR buzz and social engagement. In fact, the Yellow Boot video garnered over 3.5 million views in six weeks and was reported as best-in-class by YouTube.","Karl Heinz Salzburger - VF Corp.","Revenue in Europe was up at low-single digit rate with low-single-digit DTC and wholesale growth which was consistent with expectations. Men's Footwear was up nicely, supported by a SensorFlex campaign. The new footwear technology combines the SensorFlex out-sole with a cup-sole look and is selling well.","Casual category also performed and drove the Footwear business to positive growth in the quarter despite the warm weather in Q3. In Women's, we continued to innovate and bring new products to market with the Kenniston being our number two seller after the Yellow Boot. In Apparel, new product introductions with updated fits, fabric and style contributed to a 30% increase in that business. Especially the Outerwear category, they performed very well, gaining market share against competition in new silhouettes.","Revenue in Timberland's Asian business was down slightly with low-double-digit wholesale growth offset by mid-teen decrease in DTC due to traffic declines in Singapore and Japan. This was partially offset by e-Commerce which was up more than 50% in the region.","Kenniston (23:11) sold too very well in the quarter, supported by impactful in-store marketing. In September, consumers in Japan camped out overnight to purchase items from the limited Timberland monkey time Apparel collection, a collaboration between the two brands that sold out in hours.","Also just last week, Timberland launched its first direct e-Commerce platform in Southeast Asia by opening a site in Singapore, so an excellent way to connect further with consumers in this important market.","For the full year globally, there are no changes to the expectation that Timberland will see low-single-digit revenue growth.","Now to Jeanswear.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Our global Jeanswear business declined 4% with similar declines at both Wrangler and Lee. While we did plan for the business to be down slightly based on changes in the timing of shipments, the decline was a little more than we originally anticipated, but as Eric indicated, should still prove to be an anomaly for the full year.","Our Americas business saw the majority of the decline which was partially offset by strength in Europe. Results in the Asia Pacific region were in line with last year. In the Americas, Jeanswear revenue was down at a high-single-digit rate with a mid-single-digit decline in Wrangler and a high-single-digit decline in Lee.","In addition to timing of shipments, we're off to a slower start to our second half. And similar to The North Face and Timberland, when cold weather materializes, we've seen immediate pickup in our Denim and Long Bottoms business. We expect to return to mid-single-digit growth in the fourth quarter.","In Wrangler, on the marketing front, the brand launched a new fall creative campaign in conjunction with the start of the American football season that has received strong consumer response in brand awareness and recall. The brand also sponsored weekly programs including ESPN College Football Live and the NFL's GameDay Morning, contributing to more than 2.3 billion national media impressions in the quarter. Wrangler's Western Specialty business continues to be challenged. In addition, subdued energy and industrial manufacturing conditions are impacting community spending levels and retailers are aggressively managing inventory.","Lee's high-single-digit decline in the third quarter doesn't necessarily tell the whole story. With a low-double-digit increase in the second quarter due to accelerated timing of shipments, the third quarter was penalized accordingly. When averaged across both quarters which are pretty similar in size, revenue was essentially flat year over year for the comparable period. That said, we expect to deliver low-single-digit growth in the fourth quarter.","A few product highlights in the quarter that received positive response included the new Extreme Comfort Men's casual pant that has led to market share expansion and wholesale growth. In late September, Lee's Dream Jean was featured on Good Morning America's Best Denim segment which has driven a very nice pickup in sales and on the marketing front, we launched the Move Your Lee campaign in September to rave reviews, an event that spiked e-Commerce sales significantly.","Karl Heinz Salzburger - VF Corp.","In Europe, consistent growth continued for the Jeanswear coalition with revenue up at the mid-single-digit rate balanced between Wrangler and Lee. Marking more than three years of consecutive quarterly growth, these results were driven by solid fall-winter bookings and strong replenishment. The Scarlet for women and Ryder for men continue to be strong drivers for the brand. Also in Europe, the Move Your Lee brand campaign launched across Scandinavia, Germany, France and the UK to a very positive reception. Wrangler saw strength as the brand transitioned to more modern assortments with success in tops and bottoms as well as an increase in third quarter reorders. Our Body Bespoke PR and social campaign reached more than 5 million views.","In Asia, Jeanswear revenue was in line with last year, driven by a low-double-digit increase in Wrangler, offset by a slight decline in Lee due to a timing of shipments from Q3 to Q4. Lee's e-Commerce business was up over 20%. During the quarter, BODY OPTIX launched in 400 stores in China, Hong Kong and e-Commerce with particularly strong sell-through. The media efforts behind BODY OPTIX kicked off in August and was the first ever to be streamed live on Tmall. For the full year, globally, Jeanswear revenue is now expected to see low-single-digit growth.","Now to Imagewear.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Imagewear revenue was down 4% with a slight LSG increase, offset by a high-single-digit decline in the workwear business. This business, similar to Timberland and Wrangler, continued to be impacted by weakness in the energy and industrial manufacturing sectors. In LSG, MLB saw double-digit growth with strong jersey demand aided by continued success of the Cool Base replica jersey.","On the workwear side, while we continue to see consistent strength in Red Kap's automotive shop gear line, it should be no surprise that with oil rig counts hovering at historic lows, both Red Kap and Bulwark sales were down in the quarter. Considering we will soon begin to lap this decline, we expect the workwear business to return to growth in the fourth quarter.","Our Sportswear business was down 13% in the quarter due to weakness in both wholesale and D2C. Revenue at Nautica was down 15%. However, adjusting for strategic decision to license the women's sleepwear and men's underwear business, the brand was down 7%. Nautica continues to face the same challenges including heavy discounting in promotional environments in the U.S. department store channel and traffic declines at outlet where we've closed 11 stores in the past year. Kipling's North America business was down 6% and the International business was down 2% and we expect both businesses to return to growth in the fourth quarter.","And last but not least, congratulations to the Napapijri team for being VF's fastest growing brand in the quarter.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Thanks, Steve. In the third quarter, revenue was down 1% to $3.5 billion. We've already reviewed the individual coalition results, so let's look at the global business by channel. Direct-to-consumer revenue was up 6% including a low-double-digit increase in Outdoor & Action Sports and mid-single-digit growth in Jeanswear, moderated by a low teen decline in Sportswear. Wholesale was down at a low single-digit rate in the quarter, with a mid-single-digit increase in our International business being offset by high-single-digit decline in the U.S. By region, the Americas was down 4%, EMEA up 6% and APAC was up 4%.","Gross margin was 48.4%, up 70 basis points versus last year as benefits from pricing, mix and lower product costs were held back a bit by inventory management efforts and a 60 basis point headwind from FX. In fact, currency-neutral gross margin expanded by 130 basis points in the quarter. SG&A as a percentage of revenues was up 60 basis points to 30.2% as we balanced appropriate cost controls with continued strategic investments in direct-to-consumer, product innovation and connecting our brands with consumers whenever, wherever and however they shop.","Third quarter operating margin was up 10 basis points to 18.2%, which included 40 basis points of negative impact from currency. By coalition, operating income in the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition was up 1% and operating margin was 21%. That's 20 basis points less than last year as strong gross margin expansion was tempered by FX and continued investment in strategic priorities including D2C and innovation.","Jeanswear operating income was down 10% with operating margin down 90 basis points to 20.3% due to top-line volume and the quarter-specific impacts discussed earlier. Profit for Imagewear was up 11% and operating margin was up 230 basis points to 16.6% as widespread gross margin improvement with particular strength in LSG drove the results. And in Sportswear, operating income was down 35% for the reasons already detailed.","So carrying all of this to the bottom line, our reported EPS grew 13% to $1.20 in the third quarter. Currency-neutral earnings were up 16%. This increase was primarily due to gross margin expansion and a lower tax rate due to regional mix and discrete items.","Now to our balance sheet. If we turn back the clock to February 19, which was in the midst of the winter that never showed up, we told you we intended to carry forward about $60 million of cold weather core product to fulfill orders for the 2016 fall\/winter season. We said it again on April 29, and again on July 22. With today's report that our inventory position is nearly flat, we've now delivered on our commitment to solid inventory management. We have great confidence that our marketplace discipline, that is, our ability to quickly adapt to supply\/demand changes, will continue to play an essential role in our future performance.","During the quarter, we bought back 2.7 million shares of VF stock for $166 million, bringing our year-to-date total to $1 billion, meeting the target we set in February. As you know, our commitment and track record of returning cash to shareholders is essential to our approach to delivering total shareholder return. In fact, at the end of 2016, we will have returned more than $5.5 billion of cash via share buybacks and dividends over the past five years.","This year, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.42 per share, which is $0.05 or 14% over the prior quarterly amount. This marks the 44th consecutive year we've increased our annual dividend payout. With this increase, our calendar 2016 dividend will reach $1.53, a 15% increase over the prior year.","Turning to outlook, we expect full-year currency-neutral revenue to be up 2% to about $12.2 billion. This revision is primarily due to lower-than-expected third quarter results which flow through to the balance of the year and specific inventory actions we're taking at The North Face and Timberland to improve brand and channel health.","Gross margin should improve 40 basis points to 48.6% or 49.3% currency-neutral. Operating margin should reach 14.3%, or 14.8% currency-neutral. Our tax rate should be about 20% and our reported EPS is expected to increase 3% to $3.13 or up 7% on a currency-neutral basis.","As we assess our performance during the past year, pressures in the global economic environment and related shopping patterns combined to create what has now been a four-quarter long uneven environment with mixed performance across our portfolio. Throughout this period, we've continued to speak to delivering sustainable profitable growth by investing in the future and delivering value for our shareholders. And while many things in this environment have changed and shifted since last October, our financial philosophy has not. Maintaining profitability, preserving and returning capital to shareholders and strengthening our brands to ensure long-term sustainable growth remain our top priorities.","For VF, the current environment is characterized by both challenges and opportunities. To meet the challenges, we're using multiple P&L and balance sheet levers to counterbalance top-line weakness. From supply chain initiatives and inventory management to expense discipline around overhead, demand creation and investments, the evolution of our tax platform to powerful free cash flow, historically high return on capital and dividend yields, we remain able to mitigate risk and safeguard consistency even in the face of uneven conditions.","We've begun to work to strategically assess and actively explore how best to optimize and leverage our strengths to create an even better, more responsive organization to accelerate growth. As Eric mentioned, we do have line of sight to an Investor Day where we will share these strategies in the context of our next long-range plan. Currently, we're looking sometime late in the first quarter of next year, so stay tuned and we'll be in touch by the holidays, if not sooner, for a save the date and more details.","To close out today's call, amid persistently tough conditions in some geographies and categories, we believe passionately in our brands, our business and our ability to deliver the results you've come to expect from us, even when our top line is challenged in an uneven environment.","With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator and we'll take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we will take our first question from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim Securities.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Steve, congratulations. Eric, best of luck.","Eric C. Wiseman - VF Corp.","Thanks, Bob.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Thanks, Bob.","Eric C. Wiseman - VF Corp.","Was that your question, Bob?","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","No. I guess on Vans, could we start on Vans a little bit? Seems to be a lot of discussion around the Vans brand. Can you guys update us on where you see the channel inventories both in the U.S., with Vans and the category, but also importantly Europe and the category?","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Bob, I'll start and talk to you in general about Vans. And I'll let K.H. close with specific comments around Europe. I would tell you first and foremost, our Vans brand, the strong momentum continues. And I feel compelled to reiterate, we were up 10% for this quarter following a 9% in Q2 and an 8% in Q1. This brand's ability to have consistent flow of relevant new products for each of the channels that they do business in is really I think one of the main points that continues to drive their significant and sustainable growth.","They're intently focused on their consumer. And as they think about the different channels, they're being very thoughtful around the collections and the different collabs that they're bringing to bear in each of these seasons. The channel inventory that we see here in the U.S. is \u2013 nothing is alarming to us. They're right where we expected them to be. But I think the most remarkable thing, Bob, is the results that we're seeing in our own direct-to-consumer channel, where we control that complete brand experience, continuing to drive significant growth this last quarter, up low teens.","I'll pass it to K.H. and he can talk about Europe where we have had some inventory build that we've been systematically working through.","Karl Heinz Salzburger - VF Corp.","Yeah, Bob. Europe is playing out exactly how we had anticipated it at the beginning of the year. Every quarter, we saw sequential improvement. And as I mentioned, we expect Q4 to return into positive territory. I would say the inventory situation which we faced is normalizing month by month. And the fact that our DTC numbers in Q3 were so strong, up mid-teens, show that the brand resonates well with our consumers. We have a lot of good stuff in the pipeline, good product stories which are resonating well. So all in all we're pretty confident.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Great. And I guess the second question that I have is in the Outdoor area, when you look at the inventories that are in off-price, can you just talk about how that may impact the Q4 on some of your inline product and how you're forecasting to manage through that and your confidence level in both Timberland in the fourth quarter and The North Face?","Eric C. Wiseman - VF Corp.","Yeah. So I think an important fact here, Bob, is we have seen demand in the wholesale channel shift from Q3 to Q4, or as we said, in the commentary to the right. And we've seen this beginning, but coming out of last winter, the dealer caution is at a significant level and we took actions at that point to really mitigate the amount of inventory that we brought in to cover our orders. We kind of had a good sense of what was going to go on in the off-price channel. We participated in moving goods there last fall.","But I'll tell you, as we came into September, we were a bit surprised by the sheer amount of just not outerwear from the outdoor industry, but all categories from across Apparel. And it's what's caused \u2013 it's really brought us to make this decision to really be thoughtful around our go-forward actions and to mitigate the impact that participation in this channel can have on the long-term health of a brand. I think if we had to do it over again, we may have taken a little bit less of a position as we went in to \u2013 out of last fall. And I think what we saw that maybe compounded things that we didn't see last fall was the bankruptcies that took place early in the year that had an additional amount of inventory move into the off-price channel as well as online that's causing some pressure in the outdoor industry.","Robert Drbul - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you very much. Good luck.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. Congrats, Eric, on your next move. If I could just ask a...","Eric C. Wiseman - VF Corp.","Thanks, Michael.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Sure. If I could just ask a quick question on the model, could you help us quantify how much the shift was in Jeanswear? You've kind of commented on an overarching theme here that the retailers are looking to take delivery later on. Maybe you can help us contextualize how much that impacted Jeanswear in the quarter?","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","I don't know if I can put an exact number on it. We did expect the Q3 number to be down slightly when we considered the movement of our Lee business from Q3 into Q2 as well as what we saw in our Asia Lee business going from Q3 to Q4, but it was a slightly slower start to the second half. And we were \u2013 as we saw the softer consumer spending in the U.S. and specifically in that energy and industrial community, but also mid and mass \u2013 with the warm weather, we saw that slight downturn in our Denim and Long Bottoms business, but Lee was up low double digits in Q2. And as we've come into Q3, we saw that moderate. But we see it coming back to growth in Q4. So kind of on the level, we are right-sizing our expectations for the Jeans business for the year, taking it to a low-single-digit growth year-over-year.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And congrats, Steve, if I didn't mention that upfront.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Yes.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Just a \u2013 you mentioned \u2013 looking at the Analyst Day for 1Q, obviously we've all been looking very forward to having an update from you guys. You mentioned looking at the optimum portfolio longer term and obviously timing of things like brand acquisitions is something that's less controllable. Maybe you can give us some thoughts on what you guys are evaluating or maybe some of your early goals you guys are trying to look at as far as what are you trying to deliver for the Analyst Day in 1Q?","Eric C. Wiseman - VF Corp.","Yeah, Michael, we're not going to give a lot of details at this point. But obviously \u2013 we've used the words historically that we're active portfolio managers and that includes what we move away from our portfolio and what we hope to bring in. And we've been clear this year about a couple of moves that I don't need to repeat. And our intent at the Analyst Day will be to lay that out and hopefully have more updates between now and then. So I just can't be specific right now. That would be inappropriate, but we will be more clear I hope when we get to that time in the first quarter.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Maybe as far as connecting the algorithm that you guys gave us in 2013 to how you guys are thinking about the targeting that you guys want to look at? I know you gave us M&A within the context of the last algorithm. Is that something that \u2013 with several years gone by since Timberland, and obviously you guys have said you're actively looking at things \u2013 but is that something you want to continue to put yourself \u2013 put a timeframe on? Or is it something that you guys think will come when it comes we just (44:47) take the focus off that for now?","Eric C. Wiseman - VF Corp.","One of the things that we're really proud of is that we haven't made an acquisition in the last five years because we've had opportunities that we've walked away from based on price where we couldn't deliver shareholder value and we got inactive when the market was frothy. And we would have had to really overpay just in general. So our discipline around that is strong. Our efforts around M&A are non-stop. There has not been a week that's gone by in the last 12 weeks that we haven't had at least one M&A-related meeting and discussion. So we're as active as we could possibly be and that's really all I can say.","Michael Binetti - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks again, guys.","Eric C. Wiseman - VF Corp.","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks. Can you guys speak to pricing and product costs? So on pricing, any brands where you might consider driving market share at the expense of historical margins? And then on product costs, what you're seeing in terms of your outlook?","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Yeah, this is Scott. I'll take that. So we've talked all year about how we expected pricing to offset the FX impact and we said that would be mostly second half-weighted. And indeed that is what we're seeing as you can see from our gross margin expansion this quarter and what we expect next quarter. Same with product costs. While it's not huge for the year, we said it was a little against us early on and it flips to positive. Again, we are seeing that and we said particularly in the leather area is where the biggest benefit is coming in.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. And then as we think about the multi-year gross margin profile, what's the confidence on 50 basis points annually? Can you just walk through some of the moving parts? And more so just offsets to potentially more moderate Outdoor coalition growth.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Yeah, so as you would probably anticipate, we can't speak to the future. But our model really has been, and we've said consistently, we see no reason for this to change in the future, that our fastest growing businesses are our highest margin businesses, and that being Outdoor\/Action Sports, our D2C and our International and there's no reason that wouldn't continue to be the same in the future.","Matthew Robert Boss - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Best of luck.","Eric C. Wiseman - VF Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","We will take our next question from Lindsay Drucker Mann with Goldman Sachs.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And I'll offer my congratulations as well to Eric and Steve.","Eric C. Wiseman - VF Corp.","Thanks, Lindsay.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I wanted to ask a question, Eric, on a remark you made earlier in the conference call about it's not business as usual at VF. And I was hoping maybe you could expand a little bit on some of the areas and initiatives that you're doing differently with the \u2013 in the context of as an organization that you guys are always evolving and striving to perform better. So maybe just some more specifics on what's changing.","Eric C. Wiseman - VF Corp.","Yeah, Lindsay, we will cover a lot of this at our Investor Day later in the first quarter, but I'll give you a couple real-time examples. As we saw a slowdown in the performance of our North Face stores in North America earlier this year, we rapidly worked to implement some in-store model changes that made our stores look different and were more engaging for consumers. We've been rolling that out and we're seeing immediate impact from it. So they're pretty significant changes. And if you were to go into the Michigan Avenue store or the new store in New York City, you're going to see what we think the future of that looks like. It was a sense of urgency around making some of those tactical things and we're doing that around the world.","You heard that our D2C business is up 7% year-to-date in total and that to us is very encouraging because when we record revenue in our D2C business, it's because a consumer came into a store and bought something they wanted. When we report revenue in our wholesale model, it's a shipment to another retailer for a future sale to consumer. One is a true impact of how effectively our products and stories communicate. The other has a long delay on it and is impacted by things we don't control like wholesale \u2013 I'm sorry, like inventory in wholesale. So we've been working on the shorter-term things and we'll be giving a lot more detail around the shape of the portfolio, the regions and how we're going to distort effort in some of those and more later in the first quarter.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Great.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Lindsay, if I were to add just a real quick point to build on Eric, I think one of the other areas that we're really doubling down on is in the area of product design and innovation. And to Eric's point on what we've done in-store is it's really clear in this changing consumer environment that for brands to succeed and with the powerful brand portfolio that we have, we know that when we elevate the quality of the design of our products and marry that with really powerful experiences, be it in-store, at events or through our demand creation, we have an outsized opportunity to succeed. And I think that would be the other area really married with what Eric talked about in The North Face store that we think will continue to propel our brands forward. And you really see that going on in our Vans business and it's no accident that we congratulated our Napapijri business for being the fastest-growing business. They began a lot of work last year and were able to rapidly really shift their go-to-market strategy with product and marketing and they're having a really, really good fall season.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. And on the point about wholesale, is it possible for you to comment on the difference between sell-in versus sell-through to the degree that you're seeing retailers order inventory more cautiously? And how long until this sort of destocking effort from retailers is through to the degree that it escalated, it sounds like, in the back half of the year? Is this a drag do you think potentially in the first half of next year?","Eric C. Wiseman - VF Corp.","Yeah, it really is an exaggerated thing this year and Steve touched on it earlier about the inventory that didn't sell last winter when winter didn't happen. A lot of that inventory is still out there and it's affected our wholesale bookings because people \u2013 if last year, they sold 100 jackets and this year they plan to sell 100, but they started with 10, they're going to buy 10 less this year and that's just a reality. But it's really distorted in North America this year and you're seeing it sit at The North Face and Timberland.","It's our colder weather brands that are \u2013 have the least momentum in their wholesale business in North America and that's really where our biggest challenge is. You saw our International results have been strong. They were up 6% in total and they were up in every region other than in the U.S. And a lot of that is because of the wholesale business being down because of inventory that already exists from last year.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks, guys.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","And if I could be consistent in tag teaming with Eric here, our inventories at key retailers are balanced and that's something that we are controlling. But I think the lesson here, Lindsay, is that it's no longer going to be the norm where you set a floor early fall and expect to take reorders through the season and come out the other side in a successful place. I mean, the demand that consumers are now putting on businesses to bring more frequency of new ideas and elevating that brand experience is something that we're pivoting to be very, very responsive to. And our supply chain really puts us in an advantaged position to be able to look at the number of drops per season for each of our brands and being able to dial that into our model, both how we create the product, but also how we build that product and deliver to our wholesale and our own stores.","Lindsay Drucker Mann - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks very much.","Eric C. Wiseman - VF Corp.","Thanks, Lindsay.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Kate McShane from Citi Research.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations, Steve and Eric. My question was \u2013 wanted to build on the last question actually with regard to how the business is changing and some of your commentary around direct-to-consumer. We've heard from you in the past that you have these innovation centers and have a lot of flexibility by having partially owned your supply chain. I just wondered if you could update us on how you're leveraging these two competitive advantages to, again, focus on some of the changes that you're seeing in the industry?","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Well, Kate, this is Steve. I mean, really I just build on my reply to Lindsay is, I think the consumer today is able to access pretty much any time what they want, where they want. And for powerful brands to compete in this environment, we need to be ever-present with innovative product and really powerful experiential demand creation, as I said, either in our stores, at events, like our Vans business does with House of Vans, or through the demand creation that we deliver across the different mediums available to us.","So our D2C platform \u2013 and it's, again, I don't think it's any surprise that that's where we're seeing the greatest success. That is where we're able to have ultimate control of our brands' assortments and in-store experience that leads to that brand experience and that's where we're able to really bring to bear our new tools. And we take those to our wholesale partners and use those to build the same kind of strengths in there.","I mean, the innovation platform, just to finish, that's really that upstream capability that we've added over the last two or three years that as they marry more closely with our in-line product teams, we have new ideas that will create new platforms, new franchises, just really building into a frequency and flow of new ideas back to that point of bringing new ideas consistently to the consumer.","Eric C. Wiseman - VF Corp.","Kate, this time I get to pile on Steve's answer; just the way it works. One of the things that we have that is a unique competitive advantage is just under a third of the products that we sell in the United States we make in this hemisphere in factories that we own and operate. And in a time when retailers are carrying less inventory and consumers are going through this buy-now, wear-now, everything is happening later closer to the moment of purchase.","And by far, our shortest lead time is when we make it in factories that we own and operate in this hemisphere and we're uniquely positioned to do that in our space. Just not very many people own and operate factories like we do and our lead time there is a fraction of what it is from other regions of the world. And it gives us an advantage, whether that's making Timberland Boots in the Dominican Republic or making Jeanswear or some North Face products in Mexico and Central America. It really is an asset that we're relying on more and will become more and more part of our strategy.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Eric C. Wiseman - VF Corp.","Thanks, Kate.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Erinn Murphy from Piper Jaffray.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. Thanks. Good morning. Just as I take a step back and listen to the commentary, you are highlighting a number of your brands that are returning to growth in Q4, particularly those that have significant exposure in North America and in the wholesale channel. So could you maybe just express kind of what's changing in the environment or in your visibility that really gives you the confidence in the pickup in the fourth quarter?","Eric C. Wiseman - VF Corp.","Yeah, I really do wish that I had a crystal ball that could give me clear context around the fourth quarter. Let me just shape up how we look at it. The fourth quarter, Erinn, in terms of total revenue is about the same size as the third quarter. So we're looking at about a $3.5 billion quarter in each.","One of the differences is that the third quarter is more about wholesale shipments to retailers for eventual sale and we've already documented that we struggled with that in the third quarter. And the fourth quarter for us is much more about our D2C business. It is when that business peaks as a percentage of our revenue and it's a business that is up 7% year-to-date. So it has been working for us all year around the globe and that's one thing that gives us confidence.","We've also assumed a normal winter. And by a normal winter, we don't mean a 1980s normal winter. We mean an average of the last three years to five years normal winter which includes some good ones and some bad ones. And if it sets up like that, which is our assumption \u2013 and that is a big assumption, we're going to be just fine because we know our stores are working and we know we have the right products in them. As we said, we're up 7% year-to-date, we were up 6% in the third quarter and our effort on communicating to consumers is a lot around driving them to retail, ours or our customer's.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Yeah, I'd just add one thing from a context standpoint. Remember, our third quarter is off of a plus 9% in the previous year, and our fourth quarter is against a minus 1%. So from a comp standpoint, fourth quarter is much easier.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. And then historically, you guys have done a significant portion of your order book on pre-book, particularly for the seasonal businesses. So for your major brands today, how much are on pre-book going forward? And then where would that have been about a year ago?","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Yeah, I'd say the pre-book percentage pretty much holds true. It's not a dramatic shift. It's in the high 90%. We've always gone out and presold and had a very limited amount of reorder inventory on those key seasonal initiatives and I don't really see that changing dramatically today or in the future.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.","I may have missed this, but just the direct-to-consumer comp in Q3? And then what is assumed in Q4? That would be helpful. Thank you.","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Yeah, Erinn. We don't give the comp specifically. We just talked about from a shave standpoint low-single-digit.","Erinn E. Murphy - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you, guys, and best of luck.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Omar Saad with Evercore ISI.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good morning. Eric and Steve, best wishes to you both.","Eric C. Wiseman - VF Corp.","Thanks, Omar.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Thank you.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Wanted to ask \u2013 it's pretty interesting. The U.S. market performance seems to be so different than the rest of the world the last few quarters and especially this quarter. Maybe talk about what some of the differences are in the markets. Is it a macro level issue? Is it a competitive landscape? Or is it \u2013 the business is already quite big in the U.S. and maybe a little bit closer to maturity? Maybe help us think about your key brands in the U.S. versus the other markets? And why there's such a disparity in performance?","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Yeah, Omar. I guess I'd go first. We all get to watch the TV these last few weeks and I think there's an overarching theme going on in our political atmosphere that's giving consumers a little bit of pause and potentially making them a bit conservative as we're all uneasy about where we're ultimately going here.","I think last year's fall season has had a compounding effect not just on the winter goods, but in Apparel and Footwear in general and we've seen bankruptcies come into view, having an impact on certainly where businesses like ours have the opportunity to sell, but also where consumers are looking to engage. So I think the U.S. market just finds itself in maybe a similar situation of where our European business was two years or three years ago. And as we've got a lot of lessons learned and are employing a lot of really great solutions, I think you saw the growth that we delivered here for Q3, I think we have a really strong playbook of how to navigate this.","Because I think at the center here is powerful brands, consumers absolutely want to connect with them, engage with them and purchase from them. And it's really in our court to create the compelling products and the demand creation that draws them to us and really create that loyal relationship that we can build on year-over-year.","Eric C. Wiseman - VF Corp.","I'll add just a little bit of context for you, Omar, because there's this consumer thing and then there's the thing that Steve talked about, the bankruptcies and the inventory hangover from last winter. So peeling it back for The North Face because it's such an important part of our story. In the quarter, in the Americas, our direct-to-consumer business was up mid-teens. And in Europe, it was up high-teens. And in Asia, it was up mid-teens. So there's \u2013 we're all kind of right in the same pocket where we're selling products to consumers through our stores. It's in the wholesale side that there's a different story in outside the U.S. and inside the U.S. And a big part of that is the bankruptcies and the inventory hangover from last year. And as I've stacked them up geographically and by the way, you see about the same thing in Vans where in Americas, it was up low teens and in EMEA, it was up over 20%. It was still strong growth in our own stores and differences in the wholesale piece of the business.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","That's actually really helpful, Eric, to put some context around it. Maybe along the same lines then, do you think differently long-term about the growth rates DTC, e-Commerce, owned stores versus the wholesale channel? Is this kind of ratcheting down to inventory levels, is this a temporary thing \u2013 really just a temporary thing, the hangover from last year and retailers ordering more cautiously or do you think there's more of a structural trend here where you're going to really try to shift the consumer maybe a little bit away from the traditional wholesale channels and more towards the overall DTC complex?","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Great question. I really wish I knew the answer to it. I will tell you that for sure, if you had to make a choice right now, you'd be doing so in a cloudy environment because we don't know exactly how much inventory is out there from us and from all the competitors between our core channel to distribution and the off-price. And that's going to have to flush through, I think, until we get a better read on that. And it will be different when that flushes through. So if we have a nice solid winter this year and that flushes out, I think that's when you want to make any choices about changes in your model.","Eric C. Wiseman - VF Corp.","Real quick, I mean, our model is very intact. Our wholesale partner relationships are very important. It's over 70% of our total revenue today. And I think our best wholesale partners are looking to and actively evolving their model that marries with our model and we use our stores to really position our brands in the most complete way and that learning flows into our best wholesale partners. And as we evolve our model and really move to more frequency of deliveries across the seasons, this idea of pre-book and wait for reorders starts to give way to more monthly or every six weeks to eight weeks drops of meaningful collections across the different channel partners that our brands have to work with and putting the right product for that consumer in front of them and using the powerful demand creation to draw them in to transact with us directly or through our powerful wholesale partners.","Omar Saad - Evercore ISI","Appreciate the thoughts, guys. Thank you.","Eric C. Wiseman - VF Corp.","Thanks, Omar.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Sam Poser with SIG.","Samuel Marc Poser - Susquehanna International Group, LLP","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. And congratulations to both of you as well. I just want to talk about the inventory first of all. I mean, if we look back on the inventory levels over the last few years, it looks like even though your inventory is basically in line with last year, it looks like your inventory is still significantly higher than it was two years or three years ago \u2013 at the end of Q3 and you're really driving in the same range of cost of goods sold. So I understand it's in line with last year, but was last year too high? And what is the correct amount of inventory? What kind of turn do you want to get to and questions of that nature?","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Yeah, Sam, this is Scott. So, I mean, obviously I think if VF is known for anything, we're known for the way we manage our inventory and we look at this very carefully every month really, not even every quarter. And we set targets based on the balance between trying to manage the balance sheet and the cash flow versus making sure we're matching with demand. And you look at our days, they're right in line with what we've historically run from our standpoint. Our business mix has changed a bit. Our model has evolved a bit as we go to a little more D2C. That has impacts if you look over a long period of history. But I guess the short answer is we're right about where we want to be from an inventory standpoint and it's back in line from the hangover that we had a year ago.","Samuel Marc Poser - Susquehanna International Group, LLP","Thank you. And then secondly, can you give us \u2013 in the press release, you give us a breakdown of the EBIT by coalition, but can you dig into the EBIT maybe by brand within the Outdoor & Action Sports coalition to give us some color within the brands there?","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Yeah, Sam, we don't get into profitability by brand. I mean I think you can logically say that our largest brands are our also our largest contributors to both gross margin and operating margin expansion. That's just the law of big numbers. But in terms of actually quoting the profitability, we don't do that by brand.","Samuel Marc Poser - Susquehanna International Group, LLP","How about on a growth perspective, both in the quarter?","Scott A. Roe - VF Corp.","Yeah, we've given you the growth on the top five brands, and beyond that we really don't give more detail.","Samuel Marc Poser - Susquehanna International Group, LLP","All right. Well, thank you very much, and best of luck.","Eric C. Wiseman - VF Corp.","Thanks, Sam.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Thanks, Sam.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Laurent Vasilescu from Macquarie.","Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Good morning and I'll add my congratulations. I wanted to follow up on the Jeanswear coalition. Can you provide some color on how inventories stand within the Jeanswear channels? The last time there was too much Jeanswear inventory in the channel, I think you wound down some internal production. Could we see that happening over the next few quarters? And if so, what are the P&L implications?","Eric C. Wiseman - VF Corp.","Laurent, the inventory levels across our channel partners in Jeanswear is fine. It's in line with expectation. Ours is really looking at coming off a strong Q2 and that shift in our Asia business from Q3 to Q4. And just really moderating shipments based on consumer demand. With our channel partners, which our Jeanswear team does extremely well, if anything they're the benchmark that all of our other businesses have learned from.","Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Congrats. And congrats on today's overall inventory number. A few weeks ago, a very large athletic brand out of the West Coast reported significant buildup in the Western European inventories. And I was curious to know how your Western European inventories are versus the company-wide reported percentage of up 1%. And then more specifically, how are inventories at your key European retail partners?","Karl Heinz Salzburger - VF Corp.","I'll try to answer this question. I mentioned before in my script, we had an issue during the year on Vans, which is normalizing as you saw in our results. As far as we know, there's no real issue in the market in other brands or in other channels.","Laurent Vasilescu - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much and best of luck.","Eric C. Wiseman - VF Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Camilo Lyon with Canaccord Genuity.","Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thanks. And all the best to Eric and Steve. I just wanted a little clarification on the commentary around the proactive inventory pullback for North Face and for Timberland in the fourth quarter. Were there any order cancellations that materialized? Or really what was the impetus for this? It sounds like this was a stark change from how you had anticipated the season unfolding. And given that we're at the outset of this, beginning of this season, and I appreciate the awareness of the channel inventory, was there something that \u2013 was there something that drove this initial sort of decision to pull back on inventory that you saw from your wholesale partners?","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Sure. There have not been any cancellations to our order books. If anything, it's been that shift to the right of demand from what historically was Q3 into Q4. What really caused us to talk about mitigating our inventory positions in the marketplace really has to do with what we see in the off-price channel, really driven from the record warm winter of last year, but also the bankruptcies that compounded. And as we rolled into September and just were able to see the amount of inventory out there, not just ours, but of all brands, we've taken the position to be very proactive and thoughtful about managing long-term integrity of our brands. And these are great channel partners, but there's a finite amount of capacity out there and we want to be really thoughtful about how we're utilizing it.","Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Great. And then just to follow up on that, should there be incremental demand as the fourth quarter progresses and hopefully as winter really materializes, could that serve as a lever to \u2013 could inventory serve as a lever to meet or satisfy reorders if and when wholesale partners of yours realize that they under-ordered and under-stored their \u2013 or under-inventoried their stores or was that inventory that you pulled back on, was that curtailed farther back in the supply chain?","Eric C. Wiseman - VF Corp.","Well, I think a high-level answer to that is we run our business \u2013 on average, we have about a hundred days of inventory. So right now, our plans are kind of in that ZIP code. I hope we end the year with 90 days of inventory because that would mean that we had the \u2013 that we had a good winter and we were able to sell some more through. But it's not like we're standing here with no product to sell. The question is, does it match up with what demand is? And that's never going to be perfect, but I don't want people to think we don't have the ability to chase some things. We just can't chase everything.","Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Okay. Last question too, you speak about the strength of DTC and how there is a divergent path of how your brands are performing. Sticking to those growth numbers, could you just dig into the unit comparisons on what you're seeing on a unit basis of sell-through in your D2C versus your wholesale?","Eric C. Wiseman - VF Corp.","I don't think we're capable of that.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","If we have that level of detail...","Eric C. Wiseman - VF Corp.","We're all sitting here looking at dollar reports...","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Great question.","Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Well, you see what I'm trying to get at, right? I'm trying to understand \u2013 you obviously get the pricing benefit of your DTC, but we're just really trying to dig into what is the underlying unit demand because there's obviously that...","Eric C. Wiseman - VF Corp.","Sure. Well, the numbers I gave in an earlier comment of \u2013 and I was focused on The North Face where our direct-to-consumer business was up mid-teens both in the Americas and Asia and high-teens in EMEA, guaranteed that there's unit sales increase in that because we certainly don't have mid-teens to high-teens price increases in our products, particularly in the third quarter when we're not selling our most expensive outerwear products, we're selling other kinds of products in those stores. So it implies \u2013 it actually tells you that there's a unit price increase that \u2013 what might be slightly below those because we haven't taken big retail price increases.","Camilo Lyon - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Perfect. Thanks, guys. Good luck in the fourth quarter.","Eric C. Wiseman - VF Corp.","Thanks.","Steven E. Rendle - VF Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","This does conclude today's Q&A session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Eric Wiseman for any additional or closing remarks.","Eric C. Wiseman - VF Corp.","Thank you, and thank you all for being with us on this call. I said at the opening that we had a lot to cover and that's why we went a little long on the Q&A. We wanted to give you a chance to ask your questions. I hope you heard from us a lot of confidence about the upcoming quarter. As I said earlier, the fourth quarter is where our business model shifts and our direct-to-consumer business peaks both in dollars and as a percent of our revenues. And that's our best indicator, and that's where we've been performing strongly. We're up 7% year-to-date.","We also have confidence in our wholesale business because by this stage in the game, we obviously are \u2013 in the quarter, we have the most visibility of any quarter in terms of what's going to happen from a wholesale business. And we sit here confident that we can deliver the year as promised, even though we have \u2013 it is not what we promised at the beginning of the year for lots of reasons that we've discussed.

In fact our performance in the first quarter of 2015 clearly demonstrates how we're expanding on that momentum. Currency neutral revenue, gross margin and earnings showed strong gains during the quarter making it a terrific start to the year. Taking a look at our operational highlights which are currency neutral, revenue was up 8% with growth in nine of our 10 largest brands, four of our five coalitions direct-to-consumer and wholesale and in every region around the world. Our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition was up 10%, we also saw solid growth from our Jeanswear coalition with a 6% increase and our Imagewear coalition which grew by 8%.","And congratulations to the [Eastpac] team, which was VF's fastest growing brand in the quarter. Our direct-to-consumer business grew 11% and included mid-single-digit comps. Our international business grew 9%, with Europe up 4%, Asia up 17% and a 16% increase from our Americas non-U.S. region. Gross margin which I'll discuss on a reported basis was 49% in line with our expectations and not surprisingly held back by the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar actually by about 50 basis points in the quarter. All of which led to 13% earnings per share growth for the first quarter, indeed a very strong start to our year.","Since the last time we spoke, the U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen against global currencies, in fact the euro to dollar relationship which is VF's most significant foreign currency exposure was as high as [121] and as low [105] that volatility along with all new assumptions has produced a negative $0.06 impact to our earnings for the full year. Yet even with these additional headwinds I am proud to report that on a GAAP basis there is no change to our expectations for 3% revenue growth or 49.2% gross margin rate and 4% EPS growth to $3.20 per share in 2015. ","Now take out the impact of currency and our expectations for 8% revenue growth and a 49.5% gross margin rate also remained unchanged. However due to underlying brand and operational strength and greater visibility to how the full year should play out we're now raising our full year currency neutral earnings growth expectation to 14% up from the 12% outlook we gave in February. This growth rate would of course be ahead of our 2017 plan for the second year in a row and clearly a bullish statement about our outlook for VF. ","In summary while macro-economic, geopolitical and currency challenges continues to make headlines the things we can't control we had great confidence that we are in command of the things we can control our brands, our platforms and our operational disciplines all of which empower us to deliver consistent sustainable and profitable growth to our shareholders. 2015 is off to a great start. We've got our heads down and are executing well against our plans. We are confident. ","So with that I'll turn the call over to Steve, Karl Heinz and Scott take us through our five largest brands and then Scott Roe certainly not new to VF but new to this world will go to our financial results. So Steve it's over to you.","Steve Rendle ","Thanks Eric. Revenues for the North Face in the first quarter were up 7% which was in line with our expectations and included growth in all regions and channels. Globally we saw particular strength in our D2C business with revenues up 20%. Exiting the fall winter season inventories in our stores as well as our whole sale partners are very clean with excellent sell through as the colder weather wrapped around the world. ","Looking towards the coming fall winter season the brand's order book is in line with expectations and we feel very confident in our ability to deliver low double digit global growth for the full year. ","Now back to the quarter in the America's revenues were up at mid-single digit rate with D2C up more than 10% including strong growth in our e-commerce business driven by solid increases in both traffic and conversion. And speaking of e-com we're getting ready to re-launch new websites for both the North Face and JanSport this month bringing them on to same newly upgraded platform as Vans and Timberland a great example of our one VF approach as we leverage core competencies within centers of excellence across our portfolio.","During the quarter, ThermoBall continued to build even greater momentum with triple digit growth at both wholesale and D2C. We also launched the North Faces FuseForm technology a bit more broadly with the Dot Matrix jacket and Ultra-Light Rain Shell that utilizes our revolutionary reading process to form multiple fiber types into a single fabrication to maximize functionality and performance. The launch was supported by a meaningful increase in demand creation to inform and amplify connections with consumers. ","And the performance of the product and feedback from consumers thus far has been solid. We are encouraged as we look to continue to build momentum this fall with an even broader exposure in the re-launch of our summer series collection. We're also increasing demand creation investments for the North Faces Mountain Athletic training collection including our first ever spring TV commercial. Launched only a year ago the line continues to gain momentum and is helping further shift the consideration set of existing in new consumers towards the North Face as four season brand. This year's collection also includes women's products for the first time. ","Now to Karl Heinz.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Thanks Steve, and good morning. The North Face international business was up at a low double digit rate driven by more than 30% growth in D2C revenues. In Europe revenues were up at high single digit rate driven by significant strength in our D2C business and comps greater than 25%. During the quarter we celebrated 30 years with our anniversary Mountain Jacket to great success and so continued momentum from our ThermoBall, FuseForm and running footwear products. ","In Asia revenues were up at low double digit rate with both wholesale and D2C showing solid growth. A few highlights included launching our first ever Chinese New Year collection and collaboration with Tmall to promote our TNF 100 event on ultra-marathon trade running race. Based on feedback from both of these efforts we have great confidence about how we are positioning the brand and it is very important goal for market. ","Overall we continue to feel really good about the North Face international business and our global outlook for the full year. Now let's turn to Vans.","Unidentified Company Representative","The Vans strong momentum continued with global revenues up 16% and bounced strength in both D2C and wholesale. This marks the brand 22nd consecutive quarter of double digit growth that's five and half years another amazing result in this team. ","In the Americas revenues were up at a high teen rate with mid teen growth in D2C and more than 20% growth in our wholesale business. We saw very strong growth in both footwear and apparel and are very excited to see significant momentum in one of our newest categories and lines the mountain addition collection. Designed for the elements mountain addition products still look just like iconic Vans product but feature weather proofing heat retention and traction technology as well. This is a critical growth strategy for Vans as we seek to become more meaningful in all four seasons especially when cold and wet weather sets in and people tend to think less about canvas. And after selling out of the entire line in its first season, demand for this coming fall winter is very strong. ","We also continue to find interactive innovative ways to bring the Vans brand to life, are seeing the creative expressions on an art, music, action sports and street culture a great example of this is the continued expansion of our House of Vans concept using prop ups at exciting events like the South by South West Music Festival in Austin and the SIA Tradeshow in Denver. ","And finally to sneak this in a bit of ahead of time, next year is a big year for the Vans brand given their 50th anniversary so we're already gearing up to celebrate in a way that only Vans can do, definitely stay tuned for this one.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Vans international business was up at mid-teen rate, driven by balanced wholesale and DTC results. In Europe revenue grew at the mid-single digit rate, driven by more than 20% growth in DTC and solid results in our wholesale business.","Key footwear product highlights included a great performance from our enhanced comfort ISO collection as well as strong response to our printed styles. We also have strong growth in our apparel and accessory lines driven by DTC and wholesale. Both men and women's products are showing strong momentum with double digit pace. We also continue to engage consumers through unique events such as Vans Snow Day, [indiscernible] and High Standard all fantastic ways we're bringing the Vans to even more European consumers.","In Asia, Vans continue to outperform with revenue increasing more than 45% and equally strong DTC and wholesale growth. Momentum continues in this region due to smart localized products especially in apparel, relevant brand right demand creation investments, events that speaks to the authenticity of our brand and a really sharp presentation at retail. The business is firing on all cylinders, in an ecosystem that has the consumer at the centre of everything it does. So overall really great momentum at Vans and globally we've continued to see a mid-teen increase in revenues for the full year and now on to Timberland.","Unidentified Company Representative","Timberland revenues were up 10% driven by a mid-teen increase in global wholesale sales. The Americas recorded its sixth consecutive quarter of double digit growth with revenues up at a high teen rate driven by nearly 30% wholesale growth and this resulted balanced with gains across the portfolio including both men's and women's and footwear and apparel. ","In footwear it's been particularly exciting to see continued momentum in our women's collection as new products hit the mark in terms of style, relevance and trend. In our industrial Pro line the Pro Boondock and Powertrain collections had especially strong results as work consumers continue to respond favourably to these new innovative platforms.","On the demands creation side, Timberland continues to drive brand heat and relevance through its Mark Makers program, for seasons now the brand has been outfitting influential trend setters from head to toe and creating compelling content to engage consumers across multiple media platforms. ","And finally as I mentioned earlier we just launched Timberland's new website on April 14, marrying great content with new functionality to create a holistic brand and product experience for Timberland outdoor lifestyle consumer. And so far we're very encouraged by the early results, especially related to traffic and conversion. So, continued success, balanced growth and amazing product, all reasons we continue to be very bullish on Timberland.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Timberland's international revenues were up at the low single digit rate. In Europe revenues were also up at low single digit rate. The men's business since reflects an Sensorflex and Cupsole product continue to build on the strong momentum from last year and casuals began to gain traction on the women's side. And our new website has seen very positive early results, a great indicator that our one VF approach has meaningful global benefit.","Turning to Asia. Revenues increased at high single digit rate with strong wholesale growth. A couple of highlights included our new catalogue out sole boots and the [indiscernible] boots in particular that had great marketing support. Additionally apparel had a strong quarter driven by outerwear and tops. For the full year global Timberland is right on track to grow revenues at the low teen percentage rate.","Now let's turn to Scott and Jeanswear.","Scott Baxter","Thanks K.H. Our global Jeanswear business was up 6% with positive results in all three regions wholesale and D2C in both the Wrangler and Lee brands. In the Americas region Jeanswear revenues were up at a middle single digit rate despite ongoing challenges and softness in the overall denim market. Revenues for Wrangler in the Americas were up at a low double digit rate. In the mass channel we saw continued momentum driven by new products, improved brand presentation and category expansion which created higher demand and conversion in our core pants business. Additionally, the expansion of our lifestyle products including broader offerings in both men's and women's tops gives us confidence that we're on track for meaningful growth in this important channel in 2015.","In our Western business customers are responding well to our new product introductions including the advanced comfort line which will see greater mid-tier expansion in the second quarter. We've also seen positive reaction to our expanded Western performance platform with the launch of our Cool Vantage line a jeans for hot weather that maximizes breathability for work or play. And on the workwear side our new Wrangler Riggs campaign that features [indiscernible] has been a big win with both retailers and in consumer tests, giving us confidence as we roll this out nationally.","Turning to Lee. The Americas business was down slightly yet we are encouraged by strong seasonal sales and continued momentum of our modern series products for both male and female consumers with continued traction in our department store business and enhanced demand creation support especially for the crucial fall season. We expect this brand to show slight growth over last year. KH?","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Our international gents wear business was up at the mid-single digit rate driven by a mid-single digit increase in Europe and a high single-digit increase in Asia. In Europe the Keeps You Cool product continues to drive outstanding performance for the Wrangler business and we've also seen initial strong response to [born and ready] platform. In Lee we saw brand momentum continue which led to our eighth consecutive quarter of revenue increases in the region. We are also excited to report that our women's business has returned to double-digit growth driven by a number of new product initiatives. ","In Asia our Wrangler business continued to focus on the denim performance range launching new finishers including water repellent and dust [indiscernible]. At Lee we continue to see strong reception for our key product collection stores and introduced new assortments in a number of lines during the quarter. ","In summary, we're off to a great start to 2015 in our global Jeanswear business and expect momentum to continue throughout the year to reach our target of low single-digit revenue growth. And now back to Scott on Imagewear. ","Scott Baxter","Thanks KH. Our Imagewear coalition posted strong revenue growth of 8% in the first quarter driven by mid-teen growth in our workwear business particularly the Red Kap brand with a very strong start to the year we're on track for mid-single-digit revenue growth in 2015. ","And now over to Scott Roe for our financials. ","Scott Roe","Thanks Scott. Well that sure is a lot for a CFO to like in this quarter. Our diverse portfolio of brands continues to thrive based on innovative products, connecting with consumers where, when and how they shop and the amazing opportunity that we have to expand our business around the world its look more robust. In our first quarter revenues on a currency neutral basis were up 8% and as Eric mentioned we saw growth in nine of our 10 largest brands four of our five coalitions and in every region around the world. By channel our direct-to-consumer business grew by 11% and we saw a high single-digit increase in sales to our wholesale customers. ","The Outdoor and Action Sports coalition continue to lead the way and the Jeanswear and Imagewear businesses maintained the momentum we saw at the end of 2014. Growth in all regions, all channels and across multiple coalitions underscores the power of VF's portfolio. ","As expected our gross margin rate was down 40 basis points to 49% in the quarter due to the negative impact of foreign currency however to give a bit more context around this on the plus side and in line with our expectations our typical mix benefit of about 60 basis points from our highest margin businesses was closer to 40 basis points as strong growth in Jeanswear and Imagewear which carry relatively lower margins tampered our normal mix benefit, more than offsetting this mix benefit was about 30 basis points of higher cost due in part to timing factors we discussed during our last call and about 50 basis points of foreign currency headwinds driven by the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. In fact with an average euro rate of 112 versus 137 in the first quarter of 2015 and 2014 respectively it was one of the largest movements we've seen since the financial crisis of 2008. ","Despite the strengthening of the Swiss franc which added nearly 20 basis points of expense in the quarter our SG&A as a percentage of revenues was about flat. This demonstrates the power of our business model as we continue to invest in D2C and demand creation while leveraging other expenses. First quarter operating margin was 14% which includes a negative 70 basis points impact from currency headwind. Carrying that down currency neutral earnings per share increased 13% on a reported basis EPS was in line with last year's first quarter. ","Now taking the look at our performance by coalition revenues for Outdoor and Action Sports were up 10% on a currency neutral basis and even stronger result when you consider this quarter was negatively impacted by the 53rd week which traded a very strong retail week in early January for a relatively weaker week in early April, yet was solid growth in both our wholesale and D2C businesses including positive results from nearly every brand and double-digit growth in Vans in Timberland and a high single-digit increased for the North Face 2015 is right on track. ","Reported operating income for the coalition declined 5% and operating margin came in 120 basis points lower than last year at 16.2% predominantly due to changes in foreign currency rates as nearly half of the Outdoor Action Sports business in the quarter was outside of the U.S. The decline was also related to the impact from the 53rd week and our increased D2C investments including a 116 additional retail stores compared with the same period last year. ","As we've seen during the past few years the addition of stores earlier in the year pressures earnings in the first half while paying off in the second half as we entered the peak retail season. For the full year there is no change to our expectation that currency neutral revenues for the Outdoor and Action Sports coalition will grow at a low double-digit rate. ","Turning to Jeanswear, revenues were up 6% currency neutral and included positive global results for both Wrangler and Lee. Reported operating income grew 2% and operating margin increased 20 basis points to 18.9%. We are really pleased with Jeanswear's performance and remain confident in our ability to achieve low-single-digit growth for the full year. ","Results in our Imagewear business were strong with 8% currency neutral revenue growth driven in part by our Red Kap business. Reported operating income for the coalition was up 9%, which resulted in a 30 basis point expansion in operating margin. ","As the year plays out, we expect revenue growth rates for Imagewear to be more consistent with our full year expectation of mid-single-digit growth. Our Sportswear business grew 3% reflecting similar increases in both wholesale and D2C channels and a high single-digit increase in revenues from Kipling. Operating income was up slightly and operating margin was in line with last year's results. For the balance of the year, we expect a similar growth rate to close out the first-half and the full year to remain on track with our expectation for a mid-single-digit increase in revenue. ","Our Contemporary Brands business continue to experience challenging consumer demand for premium denim and women's contemporary apparel which resulted in a 7% currency neutral decline in revenues and a decline in profitability. We continue to expect about flat results on a year-over-year basis for this coalition. ","Turning now to our balance sheet, our inventories were up 7%, right in line with expectations. During the first quarter, we bought back 10 million shares for a total of approximately $730 million. There are currently no plans to purchase additional shares in 2015. We also made a discretionary contribution of $250 million to our U.S. pension plan which is now fully funded, something we are proud to report. So let's turn our full year outlook, let's turn to our full year outlook now and we'll start with currency, since it play such a central role to this year's story. In February we laid out our assumption of a [\u20ac130] to U.S. dollar relationship with the direction that $0.05 move in the euro on a full year basis would need an impact on revenues of about $125 million and $0.05 per share on our EPS.","Now with one quarter behind us and a revised euro to U.S. dollar assumption of [1.10] for the balance of the year, our $0.05 move in the euro would mean an impact on revenues of about $80 million or $0.04 per share in EPS. Keep in mind that other currencies have also continued to devalue against the U.S. dollar. However, the euro remains our most significant exposure and as a reminder, our first and third quarters are the largest for our international businesses and therefore a stronger dollar would have the most significant impact on our results during those periods. Using the [\u20ac1.10] to dollar assumption there is obviously some impact on our expected full year reported results. ","So let's take a look now how that flows through the P&L. At the top-line there is no change to the outlook we gave in February. We continue to expect currency neutral revenues to be up 8% in 2015, which is in line with the growth rate we laid out in our 2017 plan.","And we expect reported revenues to be up 3%, putting us at about $12.7 billion for the year. On our full year currency neutral gross margin assumption remains about unchanged at 49.5%, which would be equal to our 2017 target two years ahead of plan. Independent of foreign currency, the annual expansion in gross margin of about 60 basis points, primarily from the favorable mix shifts that we've seen for so many years remains intact and despite even greater strengthening into the U.S. dollar, we continue to expect that same 49.2% gross margin rate for the full year on a reported basis, all of which takes us to the bottom-line. ","On a reported basis, despite an additional $0.06 negative impact from changes in foreign currency about half of which relate to the euro and the balance relates to other currencies, we expect 4% EPS growth to $3.20 compared with last year's adjusted EPS of $3.08. This means we are taking up our full year currency neutral EPS outlook to 14%, that's two more points of growth than our previous outlook, once again putting us ahead of our 2017 pace.","So what gives us confidence in our ability to absorb $0.06 of currency impact, first the continued momentum that our brands are realizing around the world and the underlying strength that these brands provide sound footing for the year? Second, with four months behind us, fall order books in hand and more visibility into our second half, we are even more confident and how our story should play out over the year. Greater visibility, coupled with a solid first quarter has built confidence. Confidence in our business model that continues to deliver consistent results even in dynamic environment.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to the operator for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first quarter from Bob Drbul from Nomura.","Bob Drbul ","I guess I had two questions, the first one is on the inventories, when you look at sort of the revenue base in real dollars and then the inventory levels, can you just talk us through how you're balancing those numbers and like with inventories up seven and the revenues up two just sort of reconcile that for us a little bit?","Scott Roe","This is Scott, I'll take that. It's matching supply and demand in any case difficult and it was particularly difficult in the first quarter give the disruptions relative to the port strike. We in general manage through that very well we saw that coming, we did things like extend lead times in some cases broaden inventory early. And you really didn't hear us talk about the impact to our quarter for the port strike, that's because it was relatively significant. Sure we have some disruption but it was minimal and not big enough to talk about. So as it relates to the inventory we see we are very confident and the quality of the inventory it's matched with future orders and as a matter of fact our days are down slightly compare to a year ago. ","Unidentified Analyst","And I just have a question on the jeans wear business. Scott can you elaborate a little bit on the Americas business I guess specifically the Wrangler and the mass business. What's going on there and those numbers are quite impressive. So if you could elaborate little bit that would be helpful for us.","Scott Roe","Over the last couple of years you've heard me talk a lot about our product and our product engine, our innovations our demand creation. And what you're seeing as a combination of a lot of hard work from the Wrangler team on new product innovations that have come to like. So you've got advance comfort, heavily touch, couple of just examples that have now gained broad distribution within the mass channel. And then with our demand creation platform the consumer has really taken those products both male and female. And then in addition to that if we're speaking just specifically in that channel in the mass channel, we've got a really strong selection this year from the seasonal standpoint. So our consumer has loved our assortment and the takeout has been fantastic, so more to come in the future. We feel really good about where the business is, feel really good about our innovation pipeline and the products that are in that and we'll continue with a more assortment, more product innovations and better distribution within the products that I just spoke of.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti ","Scott just a little bit more color on direct-to-consumer perhaps. You guys plan that business to grow I think double digits this year versus only five in the quarter 5% in the quarter. You mentioned that store growth rate would accelerate a little bit. But there are some pretty big comparisons coming in the back half. Can you walk us through some of the big line items like footage cadence and comp sales to get back to the run rate that you pointed for the year. ","Scott Roe","Yes I guess first just in terms of some stats we're going open about a 125 stores this year on an annual basis. And from a comp standpoint we're more or less the same as we saw last year, a little better than acceleration and obviously that's in the back half of the year during the peak season.","Scott Baxter","And Michael one way you can think about that is we're going have a 125 net new stores open this year so that will help us. We also have a lot of top most stores going into the first half of this year. The way we've talked about comps is overall comps are in the mid to single, so low to bit single digits. But it varies by geography, obviously much stronger in the Asia Pacific region then in the United States and all that's really about our brick and motor stores. You have to remember that our e-com business is going to grow by over 30% has the last few years and we expect it to happen this year too. So that's a really strong horse pulling that wagon for us.","Michael Binetti ","And then just one quick follow up Scott hate to do this to you, but I'm going to ask you to ask you to one of Bob's comment some last quarter -- last quarter, Bob mentioned it, you guys have mentioned him a few times that you'll be at your 2017 guidance for the gross margin by the end of this year and made a lot of progress on that early. So as we look into next year Bob mentioned that obviously he doesn't want us flat lining on our longer term model starting in 2016 just flat lining the gross margin, so he said to us I believe to still expect the 50 to 70 basis points of gross margin expansion per year that you guys guided to in your Analyst Day. ","We are all staring at the gross margin pressure and we've heard from other companies that the transactional pressure will have an impact in the first half of 2016. So are you guys are going to see the same dynamics on gross margin from FX as your hedges roll off into the first half of '16 and then how do we get to the expanded gross margin reported rate next year if that is the case. Thanks. ","Scott Baxter","You partially answered the question in the way you asked it, because we will see that 60 basis points plus or minus mix benefit going forward. We've seen that for the last several years, there is no reason we wouldn't expect that going forward now. We're not going to give guidance on 2016 it's not time for that. But in general of course if the euro were to stay where it is today and few can predict that you are better than anybody else. Sure that would have some pressure, on the other hand we've talked about input cost generally are lessening and of course we always have pricing levers that we can pull which we have in the past. So again I can't give you exact guidance on '16 but we would say the mix there is no reason that mix benefit won't continue to be there and there are many other levers besides currency which will be impact in our 2016 guidance.","Operator","And we'll go now to Kate McShane with Citi.","Kate McShane","I appreciate the commentary on the outlook for 2015 and the raising of guidance on the bottom line. But I think one of the reasons why you are raising it because you have more confidence in what you're seeing for the later part of the year. But I don't think revenue guidance is going up. So can you reconcile that for us?","Scott Baxter","Yes, so you're right Kate we have maintained the 8% currency neutral and 3% as reported. But that confidence within that obviously we're feeling better about the year and that means that we see some slight improvement on the top line if you are trying to model that out. It's not enough to change the overall guidance but yes we're feeling more bullish and that really should translate into a little bit better top line.","Kate McShane","And then my second question is on contemporary, down quarter but guiding flat for the year. Could you walk us through the cadence of growth for the rest of the year and what's giving you confidence of accomplishing that in the contemporary category?","Steve Rendle","Kate this is Steve. So, contemporary as we mentioned continues to see pressure in the sectors that they do business in specifically women's premium -- men's and women's premium denim and women's contemporary. As last year we saw our D2C as a bright spot in our go to market in our ability to tell our stories to our consumers in a really clear and productive way. We're seeing strength in some of our wholesale partners, it's giving us confidence this year to couple with our D2C carrying forward into the balance of the year. And really good balanced growth between both 7 For All Mankind and Splendid Ella Moss is giving us confidence that we'll be in that flat range from a full year standpoint.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan.","Matthew Boss","So you have three brands that are all more or less around the $2 billion level today. Can you guys talk about market share penetration today and broader growth in each category as we think about the longer term complexion of your portfolio?","Steve Rendle","I will take this one. I am going to try to pull some things out of my memory bank. North Face at about 2.3 billion and we've come out and stated really operates in a market that's about 26 billion in total in that outdoor performance category, that will put them in an 8% share. Vans is just over 2 billion pressing that mark last year action sports at 29 billion market has been then around that 7% range and Timberland approaching 2 billion at 1.8 in that outdoor lifestyle category we have somewhere around 36 billion so quick math would say that's mid-single digit market share.","What we don't capture in that is the athletic, training, lifestyle and some of the youth culture numbers. And we were to layer that in against each one of those three segments each one of them would be about 70 billion in total which really translates into a lot of headroom for each one of these brands in their respective sectors.","Matthew Boss","So as you think over the next couple of years -- over the long term I mean is it -- seems like there is the ability that every single one of these brands could potentially double. Is that out of the realm a possibility?","Steve Rendle","It's absolutely not out of the realm of possibility. I think as we speak to you at our Investors Day, we really lay out those strategies that are deeply embedded in our knowledge of our consumer and how that informs product and demand creation in our go to market with our D2C. We are extremely confident in these three brands continuing to grow but also taking that knowledge that we've developed with these three brands and applying it to other brands within our portfolio and I think you see some of that going on right now with our Wrangler brand and you will see that really coming to life in other brands like Kipling and such.","Matthew Boss","And then quick follow up on the balance sheet, so $1 billion increase in short term borrowings. Is that more seasonality related? And then if you just kind of think forward, any line that you've drawn in the sand to think about potentially increasing the capital allocation just given the building cash balance if you were to remain patient on the acquisition front?","Scott Baxter","Matthew, this is Scott I'll take that one. First, you are correct. The CP balances are seasonal, that's really what that is. It's a seasonal timing issue. We will be out of CP by the end of the year and that's just the way that the ups and flows come through the year. And as it would be typical we're a little ahead of where we were last year but we'll be out of that by the end of the year. As it relates to capital allocation really no change in the way we've talked about that, acquisitions remain our first priority, followed by dividends and we said consistently and we demonstrated we won't accumulate cash. So in the event that one of the first two leverage are not available, then we would look at returning that to shareholders through repos which we have done over the last two years.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Laurent Vasilescu from Macquarie. ","Laurent Vasilescu ","I have two sourcing related questions. First is on input cost. I think Scott mentioned that input costs were up a bit during the quarter. What are you seeing in terms of input costs going forward? Do you anticipate a benefit in 2H 2015 regarding cotton, and oil-based synthetics and if that's the case could you potentially quantify it?","Scott Baxter","Scott here and I will take that Laurent. What we're seeing is that we did indeed see a higher input cost in the first quarter and we see that through the first half, that's starts to mitigate in the second half slightly particularly more in leather than cotton although there is a little benefit there. On the other hand we did see that labor in overhead is an increasing cost. So really not significant in the second half. ","Going into next year we should see some tempering petrochemicals, leather again which we've seen high cost come down. But again we're not -- that's directional and these things change along with currency. So right now I can't quantify that nor would we give any kind of guidance into 2016 at this point. ","Laurent Vasilescu ","And then my second question on the Trans-Pacific Partnership. U.S. is at the cusp of a free freight agreement with much of Asia which could potentially eliminate footwear and apparel tariffs. Curious if you are factoring in the TPP in terms of your long-term view on sourcing across geographies and if you could see any potential savings on tariffs what would you do with the savings? Would you reinvest it in marketing, R&D, reduced prices or flow it to the bottom-line?","Scott Baxter","I guess I will take that one. We have been watching this for a number of months even years this has been going on, and it does appear that maybe making some progress. It will have some benefit to us, we're still evaluating that. I mean the details aren't fully worked out, and we would have to look at it. Our priorities in terms of should there be some opportunities our priorities remain the same. We would be investing in those growth drivers which have been successful for us so far. Our lifestyle brand international and D2C would be our priorities from an investment standpoint. ","Steve Rendle","And we do that because that's in the best interest of our shareholder contract.","Operator","And we will take our next question from Omar Saad from Evercore ISI. ","Omar Saad ","Outdoor Action Sports it's been such a big segment of the business for so long, it seems like it slowed this quarter even I know the reported numbers non-indicative of the underlying growth, but still seem to decelerate a little bit price lower than it's been in a while. Are there timing issues going on there and you also sound really confident about the outlook for that business for the rest of the year in North Face for example the retail reported numbers look really good in the quarter. Help me understand some of the dynamics going on in this quarter if there is anything to call out. ","Steve Rendle","Omar this Steve, I will take that [indiscernible] might want to fill in from international standpoint. So we absolutely remain very confident in our Outdoor and Action Sports businesses. I think the effect that you see in Q1 that we didn't detail necessarily in our remarks was that impacted the 53rd week to specifically the North Face and Timberland two big drivers was equal to 3 percentage points of growth. So if we were to put that each one of those brands North Face would have been at 10 and Timberland would have moved in to the low-teens. ","Kind of factoring that and understanding that we had that in our plans, we saw that coming, continues to give us confidence in the guidance that we gave last quarter. ","Unidentified Company Representative","Omar there is not too much to add on the international side, it's a similar picture. Starting with Asia you heard us we're doing really well in Asia, we expect nice growth in most of the Asian markets on the large brands. And similar picture in Europe, the guidance we gave for Europe is to grow high single-digits. So there were some issues by quarter but the full year outlook is really good. ","Eric Wiseman","And Omar its Eric I will finish that comment, Steve mentioned that the 53rd week switch that we had cost Timberland and the North Face 3 percentage points of growth which is true. For the global Outdoor and Action Sports coalition it cost us 2%. So what we reported -- what we talked about is 10 is our constant currency number would have been a 12. ","Omar Saad ","I think you called out Kipling and Napapijri a quarter or two ago as the potential next billion dollar brands. Any updates there?","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Starting with Kipling, you heard us saying Kipling was the fastest growing brand in last year and two years ago, and based on the outlook we have this year it would be the fastest brand again for the third year in a row, so it's good. We had a good quarter we don't release that numbers but we had a good quarter in all three areas, I guess that's the good news in the U.S. in Europe, and in Asia and in several channels in wholesale and D2C. Napa is a similar picture, Napa is predominantly Europe we see a good year for Napa and up high single-digit. So the smaller brands are growing, especially Kipling is becoming a meaningful business for us. ","Omar Saad ","And maybe one last quick question for Eric and Scott. The acquisition environment kind of remains a little bit stuck and the willingness is [indiscernible] there. Can you talk about your willingness to pursue other strategies in terms of maybe not just capital and using debt and cash but is there potential to use issue equity to make a bigger acquisition, maybe help loosen the wheels a little bit?","Scott Baxter","We get that kind of discussion from last week when we talk with them, we're very, we continue to remain very disciplined about exploring our acquisition opportunities and creative about how we might bring one in. Of course the good news as a shareholder is we're real disciplined about what we'll pay to, it's not part of how you pay for and what you pay and we just haven't found the right combinations to unlock that opportunity and just know that we are diligent and something that we work on every single week and eventually, we will bring something in, but nothing to report today.","Unidentified Analyst","Creativity is on the table.","Unidentified Company Representative","Yes it is.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Robby Ohmes from Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Unidentified Analyst","This is actually [indiscernible] for Robby. Thanks for taking our questions. Scott can you give you an update on the trends in the mid-tier channel for Jeanswear in the U.S.? And then have you seen any change or improvement in the -- kind of low to middle income consumer in the Jeanswear business?","Scott Roe","We've seen very positive trends in the mid-tier channel, so we've seen enough fix in our business; we're really pleased with it. The consumer is coming back to that channel for sure, I think the consumer is really dialed into innovation in that channel. So we spend a lot of time on some innovative products, our Easy Fit, our Comfort Fit, our Modern Series. Those products are really taking with the consumer very well. So really feeling bullish about that and I think the single most important thing for us right now in the mid-tier channel is that we've introduced Wrangler to mid-tier channel very successfully. So we're rolling Wrangler out, still has a lot of opportunity, a lot more distribution in the mid-tier channel. And so we've got a really powerful two brands that we're bringing to the mid-tier channel in that bottoms category right now, that's pretty important for us. That answers your question?","Unidentified Analyst","Yes. And then just in terms of the really strong growth Vans in Asia, how should we think about that growth longer-term? And then can you maybe talk about how many doors you have in China now and where that could go overtime?","Karl Heinz Salzburger","You heard us saying Vans had an amazing run in the last quarters in Asia and it has been a meaningful brand for us. Now we have declared that growth which was in the [aisles] of 50%, will that stay, probably hard going forward. But we are very, very confident on our long-term goals. The good news is the brand is doing well by geography, not only in China but in Asia, allover in Asia and the more developed countries Korea, Japan but also in developing markets like Malaysia or Indonesia. It's doing well by channel; we see good comps on who it's doing well and who sell. And it's doing well by category and Footwear and Apparel. So yes, we are very positive for the long-term outlook for Vans in Asia.","Now the question on the doors, was that related to China?","Unidentified Analyst","Yes.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Yes, I always say, we have now, I think we have around 2,500 doors altogether on primarily five brands, which if you benchmark that with the big, big brands which are playing in Asia they are all working around 5,000. So, I think the answer is implied we still have room to grow by adding doors overtime.","Steve Rendle","The new markets we started, we want our VF subsidiary in Korea two years ago and we built -- we want the Vans brand there with our starting point and Karl Heinz and I were actually there last month celebrating the success of that team it is off to a fantastic start and we think the brand has a lot of legs particularly in the Asia Pacific region.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Barbara Wyckoff from CLSA.","Barbara Wyckoff","What percentage of Vans sales came from footwear versus apparel? And can you talk about the penetration of men's versus women's in Vans and the opportunities there, where is the growth is going to come from besides just more doors?","Steve Rendle","This is Steve, from an America standpoint the predominant percent of our growth with Q1 was footwear. So we are continuing to see expanded growth in our apparel, high-teen growth this last quarter. Right in line with what we see going on with our footwear. Men's and women's in footwear, it's kind of hard to tell because many of our styles are unisex, but we were to try to overlay, we're probably about 60:40 men's to women's if we were to try to capture the meaning of that unisex sizing. And where will the growth come in the future? We have a tremendous amount of opportunity here in the North America market. You've heard us talk about our expansion strategies we move geographically with our stores that help supercharge our wholesale distribution, the brand is moving into athletic. We opened up with sporting goods this quarter in a significant number of doors and new initiative that they have and we're continuing to work with our partners at foot locker to expand the growth there.","So a lot of opportunity here in United States, Canada, our Mexico business is extremely strong and at the front end of its growth and we're just beginning to convert distributors in South America. It will give us a tremendous amount of upside in those developed markets there as well.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","And seeing that picture for us on the international side you hear that I've saying before we have it by geography we just opened a subsidy in Korea where Vans is doing extremely well. It just started two years ago long, long way to go we still have the South Asian market which we just started. We also have distributors there which one they would probably can convert. So geography for sure the other one is category similar picture for us apparel is small but it is growing faster than footwear. So that's a big expansion and then the other one is our DTC like e-commerce doing well and stores. So very, very articulate rate going forward.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Lindsay Drucker Mann from Goldman Sachs. ","Lindsay Drucker Mann ","I wanted to ask about Outdoor and Action margins in the quarter it wouldn't make sense -- margins came under pressure would make sense as you had if you re-trading 53rd week and you had less productive week. So maybe you would have delivered on some of the fixed cost. But you guys also mentioned some demand creation expense in the quarter. So I just wanted to get your view on how we should think about Outdoor and Action margins across the full year and maybe some perspective on what drove the compression in 1Q.","Steve Rendle","So as I mentioned in my comments Lindsay this was a particular big international quarter and also the delta on currency we had a 137 average year ago versus 112 in the first quarter. Combination of those two things put a lot of currency pressure on outdoor as margins in the first quarter it was 80 basis points and again you said it in your question also those sales that Steve mentioned under 53 week those are profitable sales. So really those are the two largest factor that impacted the quarter but now when we zoom out and look at the full year we see kind of the normalizing of the margins and we see expansion outdoor action sports margins will grow faster than revenue for the full year.","Lindsay Drucker Mann ","The demand creation expense is that sort -- was the call of because it was timing that was particularly one queue weighted or is there an incremental step up versus what you were expecting?","Steve Rendle","We continue to invest in demand creation it's roughly growing with sales. So wasn't a big factor in the quarter.","Unidentified Company Representative","Just real quick Lindsay where we put those dollars here in the Amercias was first in Q1 around the FuseForm launch in really driving that story to support the placement and as well as I mentioned in my remarks we're putting significant effort behind mountain athletics as we look to expand the North Face into more of a 12 month out of the year brand and really help drive that shift in outdoor towards via outdoor athletics space that we've been talking about over the last couple of years.","Lindsay Drucker Mann ","And then Karl Heinz I wanted to ask about Europe on an organic basis we were a little surprised to see the sequential deceleration in the first quarter versus the run rate you had the last few quarter especially because it feels like the economy is getting better there. I was just -- if you could shed some light on if there was anything particular to happen in the quarter if you are looking for reacceleration across the back half of the year. Thanks.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","I guess you heard those saying we are full year outlook is intact. So the good news we have seen no changes in our potential for the full year. We have some issues sometimes in the quarter but no the answers were pretty confident we have seen no signals which would change our mind for the full year goals which we have given. And this is true for the large brand but also for the smaller brands which I commented before.","Steve Rendle","And just to add to that Steve mentioned the 53rd week impact could also be a factor in Europe as well which will hold down your growth rate little bit in the first quarter. We still high single digits for the year and there is no change in the overall.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","First quarter came in as we expected.","Operator","And we'll go now to Chris Svezia with Susquehanna Group.","Chris Svezia ","I guess Steve for you just on Timberland for a sec. The growth in Americas is 30% whole sale growth. I was just wondering may be you can talk about you mentioned women's, you mentioned the pro-line. But a little color maybe on anything on distribution or pricing may be how we think about that momentum for the balance of the year. Just a little more color about that business please.","Steve Rendle","We've been very bullish for the last umpteen quarters about the growth of Timberland. And I think you can probably hear that in our comments today its broad based, we are seeing success across all of our collections certainly driven from the heritage of the boot but absolutely moving into casual silhouettes both spring and fall. We're seeing it across all channels our own B2C as well as wholesale and the across wholesale the various points that we come to sell in and we're seeing it in men's and women's as well as youth. ","I think it's really safe to say that these brand are our leaders there have really embraced the information that they've taken out of our consumer research applied it to their product strategy, that's a global comment and we really have understood how to bring our brand to life to our consumer, delivering content to where they are. We see this continued growth, we're very bullish and we see great upside not just in our footwear but also in our Pro Workwear business and as well as apparel.","Unidentified Analyst","Any color Steve at all on how apparel's been doing for you, what some of the [learnings] just some of the data points [indiscernible]?","Steve Rendle","We are learning it's a really good word to use and I think we've been clear, we started slow and we are incrementally increasing doors with the partners that we've launched with. And each year or each season we continue to see good growth. We're seeing Riggs -- we sell through Riggs here in the U.S. market in the high single digit rate, that's good from a retail sale point and that's helping us gain confidence to expand our collection, expand our doors and really move towards that long term projection. Apparel is much larger on an international standpoint with our largest penetration in Europe but also significant growth and opportunity in Asia.","Unidentified Analyst","And then Scott real quick to you just on the inventory growth, just maybe how we think about that throughout the balance of the year, is that's such a trend more in line with sales or reported sales in back half of the year just a little color there please.","Scott Roe","Sure. I mean we don't give quarterly outlooks but I would say for the year when you look at our cash flow and our balance sheet projections we see no issue with inventory, we're really confident that the quality is there, and we're not concerned about the inventory.","Operator","And we'll take a question now from Matt McClintock from Barclays.","Matt McClintock","Good morning everybody. I just wanted to ask a question on e-commerce. Could you just give us some color on how e-commerce businesses for your various brands are performing? I know you have a bunch of digital platform launches and re-launches over the last few years. So, how has that impacted those businesses and how should we think about the performance, the ecommerce performance of those businesses as you start to compare against those platform re-launches? Thank you.","Eric Wiseman","Let me make an opening comment on that and I'll hand it over to Steve and Karl Heinz. Some context Matt in 2007 now I know I just went way back in history but I have to know the numbers so I'll do that. Our global ecommerce business across all brands was $7 million. So we have been working hard since that time to try to put in place e-com platforms around the world that make sense. And we are -- when I look at that as part of our future growth I look at it as being one of the largest sources of our future growth because of how underdeveloped we are versus all the other levers we have to pull.","And as you would expect while we're building these sites brand by brand and country by country, we're focused most on our biggest brands and we have a lot of brands to add and a lot of countries to add and a lot more to deal. And with that I'll turn it over to Steve and let you [wane] on this.","Steve Rendle","I mean ecommerce, to Eric's point, is really new. I mean it's one of the tools and it was North Face that has led the [indiscernible] to really understanding how to really bring to our brand to life digitally. Year-to-date our ecommerce business is about 18% of our D2C we talked a lot about our new platforms, Vans came live on last year and we saw a great acceleration to the second half of the year and that absolutely continues to be the case here this year. Timberland has just launched in April. North Face and JanSport are going live today. And following them will be our Wrangler and Lee businesses, our Lucy, Reef and SmartWool towards the back half of the year.","So, we are really happy with our website it's an adaptive responsive Web site and I don't want to get too geeky here, but our brands have rich-rich content. And we've developed a content a platform that marries content with product, helps us tell very-very strong stories connected with our products with drive conversion and ultimately help drive sales. It's also a site that's very easy to adapt content mobile as we see our consumers shift to accessing our sites from their mobile devices.","Lance Allega ","Thank you. And operator that will conclude our remarks today I think Eric might have a couple words and we'll close the call.","Operator","Yes sir.","Eric Wiseman","I'll just thank all of you for spending your morning with us, talking about the current status and future of our company. As I said in my comments, we are confident about where we are this year. And I think I also mentioned that we are heads down ensuring that we deliver the results that we've promised for this year. And the last comment I'll make is a special shot after Bob [indiscernible] we know you're listening.","Steve Rendle","Bob give me a call let me know what's like on the other side of this line. Thanks everybody. See you in 90 days. Bye-bye.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. And we do thank you for your participation."],"21501":["V.F.

Please be aware that today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Jean Fontana of ICR. Please go ahead.","Jean Fontana","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for VF Corporation's First Quarter 2012 Conference Call. By now, you should have received today's earnings press release. If not, please call (203) 682-8200, and we'll send you a copy immediately following the call. Hosting the call today is Eric Wiseman, Chairman and CEO of VF Corp.","Before we begin, I would like to remind participants that certain statements included in today's remarks and the Q&A session may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws. Forward-looking statements include management's current expectations, estimates and projections about business and results of operations and the industries in which VF operates. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements are discussed in the documents filed with the company and the SEC. I would now like to turn the call over to Eric Wiseman.","Eric C. Wiseman","Thanks, Jean. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. With me today are Bob Shearer, our Chief Financial Officer; and our 3 Group Presidents, Scott Baxter, Steve Rendle and Karl Heinz Salzburger. In the midst of continued economic challenges and uncertainty both here and abroad, VF's record revenues and earnings demonstrate the strength of our highly diversified business model, the power of our brand portfolio and the ability of our people to succeed in any environment.","Total revenue growth of 31% in the quarter with organic growth of 12% continues to outpace our long-term annual revenue growth target of 10% and gives us complete confidence in our ability to achieve our goal of 15% growth in total revenues for the full year. During the quarter, each VF coalition achieved strong revenue gains with double-digit growth on a constant currency basis in every coalition. And with the exception of Jeanswear, where we expect to continue facing higher product costs in the first half of 2012, our coalitions posted double-digit gains in operating income and solid operating margin expansion.","So with 1 quarter behind us and 3 to go, thought I'd take a minute to recap our key strategic priorities for 2012, which are obviously aligned to VF's fixed growth drivers. First and foremost, building lifestyle brands. In 2012, this means maintaining the momentum in our fastest-growing business, Outdoor & Action Sports and continuing to empower our other brands to grow and reach their full potential globally. We'll leverage our consumer insight, marketing and product development capabilities to strengthen consumer loyalty for all our brands. And this year, making Timberland work for our shareholders by growing revenues and improving profitability is a particularly important focus. We're really excited about the progress we're making there, which you'll hear more about from Steve and Karl Heinz.","Second, growing internationally. Here, the focus is investing behind our strong momentum in Asia and navigating through increasingly difficult conditions in Europe. Our business in Europe grew strongly in the first quarter as our marketing investments continue to fuel growth in our biggest and most profitable brands. We do expect double-digit revenue growth in Europe, although slightly below last year's 16% constant currency rate, given conditions there. But the power and authenticity of our brands, combined with generally low market penetration in many European markets, gives us great confidence in our ability to continue to grow both near and longer term. In fact, this year, VF should see 37% of revenues coming from international markets.","With respect to Asia, we recognize there are concerns around slowing growth, particularly in China. But for VF, the story is really just beginning there as we've only invested in a small slice of VF's brand portfolio in China and in the region. To date, we've built just 4 platforms for growth there: Jeanswear, primarily with Lee; Outdoor with The North Face; Action Sports with Vans; and handbags and accessories with Kipling. We have many more opportunities in the region, and capturing these opportunities will be a significant factor in achieving our goal of 40% of revenues from international by 2015.","Third, serving consumers directly through our growing base of retail and online stores. This year, we will open more than 110 stores across our brands, with the largest number planned for Vans, Timberland and The North Face. 15% growth in our direct-to-consumer revenues this year should help drive those revenues to greater than 20% of our total revenues in 2012, marking another year of progress towards our goal of 22%.","Our fourth growth driver is to win with winning retailers. 80% of our business comes from our wholesale partners. So at the center of this strategy is aligning our brand, product and marketing strategies with those partners who can drive mutually beneficial and profitable growth.","Fifth is to enable VF's future. We've nearly doubled in size over the past 5 years. To continue our momentum, we recognize the importance of consistent investments behind a best-in-class infrastructure, including talent development, supply chain capabilities and technology. In 2012, our capital expenditures will reach a record $375 million as we invest in such growth-supporting projects as new distribution centers, new coalition headquarters, technology and retail stores.","Our sixth and newest growth driver announced in March 2011 is to lead in innovation. At VF, we have a simple definition of innovation. It's something new that creates value. Products, of course, are at the heart of our innovation agenda, from The North Face's Flash Dry fabric that provides unmatched moisture wicking to Timberland's anti-fatigue technology that gives all-day comfort, to patent-pending technology in Jeanswear that provides a superior fit for women, all of our brands are actively pursuing breakthroughs in product and process innovation. We obviously have a lot to get done this year. I am confident that we have the right strategies; the right focus; and most importantly, the right team to deliver another outstanding year to our shareholders.","Now I'd like to turn the call over to our 3 Group Presidents. We're taking a slightly different tack this year in terms of their commentary, one that we hope will be more informative and efficient for you. Their content will focus solely on our 5 largest brands: The North Face, Timberland, Vans, Wrangler and Lee, which together comprise nearly 70% of VF's total revenues, providing a strategic overview of the domestic and international growth opportunities for each. Let's start with Steve Rendle and Karl Heinz Salzburger, who will discuss our top Outdoor & Action Sports brands. Steve?","Steven E. Rendle","Thank you, Eric. Starting with VF's largest brand, The North Face. Global revenues were up 14% or 15% if you exclude the impact of foreign currency, including a 20% plus increase in the brand's DtoC business. In our Americas geography, The North Face brand's revenues were up mid-teens, which along with solid international growth, puts us on track to meet our full-year goal of mid-teens revenue growth. So a great start to the year.","To proactively address a couple of anticipated questions, I'd like to take a moment and comment on The North Face's inventory and backlog. On inventory, even though the balance of the winter selling season remained challenging and spring arrived earlier with warmer and drier conditions than normal, we have seen solid sell-through of seasonal products across the majority of our regions and channels. Looking out towards the fall, we are encouraged by our current global fall order book, which is up low double-digits to last year. And while we're certainly not immune to overall market dynamics, we are confident that The North Face is the best-positioned brand in the outdoor industry to manage through any environment.","Okay. Now back to strategy. 2012 will be an exciting year for The North Face. With sales approaching $2 billion, we're hard at work executing a number of strategies designed not only to realize short-term growth, but also strengthen the brand's foundation and empower it to generate consistent growth for years to come. Taking a cue from Eric's list, The North Face key strategy in 2012 include delivering the most important, innovative outdoor products in the industry, leveraging our brand authenticity to connect more deeply with active consumers, providing a premium retail experience both in our owned stores and wholesale partners' locations and growing our international business.","Let's start with product. Innovative product is critical for The North Face consumer, a consumer that is very knowledgeable and passionate about their sport and the products they require to perform at the highest level. They demand the world's best gear, so it's our job to continually push the boundaries of performance and deliver solutions for real-world challenges. Eric mentioned The North Face's Flash Dry technology. This is an excellent example of how our collaborative efforts with our world-class athletes yield product innovations that help redefine what is possible in fabric performance. As new technologies emerge, we continually assess our entire product line for opportunities to leverage more focused offerings.","And in addition, in an effort to meet our consumer demand and better focus our presentation at retail, we're implementing a global product line rationalization program with the goal of reducing SKUs by 15% by fall 2013. This means industry-leading product for the consumer, a more succinct set of merchandise product collections at retail and enhanced margins.","Next up is work to elevate The North Face brand's connection with consumers. Centered on bold, athlete-tested, expedition-proven storytelling campaigns, we continue to invest in expeditions and events that define our brand through the eyes of the hard core user. This year's story from the successful first ascent of Mount Meru's Shark's Fin, located in India's Himalayan region, will be the cornerstone of the brand's seasonal storytelling platform. The essence of the story lies in the Meru Kit, a collection of products built specifically for high-altitude, cold environments that was inspired and created by our amazing athletes and the Summit Series product team. And telling the story well is, of course, only a part of the equation.","Our third strategy focuses on providing consumers the best possible retail experience wherever they shop, in our owned stores or with our wholesale partners. Retail is where we tell our athlete-generated stories and present our product in an environment that emotionally engages consumers. We continue to invest in our digital capabilities so that we can deliver and receive unique product, brand and consumer-generated content across a broad spectrum of innovative tools. In a few weeks, we'll be launching a new iPhone and Android-enabled app specifically geared at supporting our omni-channel efforts. The app will provide our consumers the capability to view system-wide inventory, upload and review product details through 2D and 3D scanning, as well as initiate a purchase transaction.","The fourth strategy for The North Face brand in 2012 is growing our international business. So with that, I'll hand it over to Karl Heinz, who will take you through some highlights there.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Thank you, Steve. Following a very strong performance in 2011, The North Face international business, which represents about 1\/3 of global revenues, has continued its momentum in the quarter with high single-digit constant dollar growth in Europe and tremendous growth continuing in Asia.","On the DtoC side, we launched The North Face websites in Italy and Spain, which now, along with the U.K., Sweden and France, brings our European e-commerce presence to 5 countries. We expect to launch a site for Ireland during the second quarter and Germany, Austria and the Netherlands in the second half of 2012. The North Face European e-commerce sites continue to outperform our expectations on all key performance indicators. We're truly excited to watch this business grow and to have country-specific vehicles to better connect and communicate with our consumers.","On the wholesale side, we are pleased with our growth amidst an increasingly difficult environment. In Europe, winter arrived later than expected, and we saw concentrated sales in a short period of time in the first quarter. Looking at fall, as we anticipated, retailers are being cautious and are committing later to fall orders. That being said, we continue to gain market share and we keep a keen eye on market dynamics so that we can react as needed to future changes.","For The North Face in Asia, our momentum is strong with a double-digit increase in the quarter. We have had very positive results from a new advertising campaign that launched there a few months ago. We're also testing a new retail concept that has great promise, have begun implementing an integrated digital communication plan. All of this continues to build the foundation for tremendous future growth.","Now we move on to Vans. Steve?","Steven E. Rendle","Thank you, Karl Heinz. Coming off a terrific year in 2011, where we passed $1 billion in sales, Vans had yet another strong quarter with global revenues up 25% or 27% excluding the impact of foreign currency. In the Americas, revenues increased at a low double-digit rate in constant dollars. We are in very good shape to reach our full year goal of mid-teens growth.","Our 4 main strategies for Vans in 2012 are similar to those at The North Face. Starting with innovation, our Vans product team, working with 4 of their top skate athletes, took 2 existing outsole technologies and combined them into a single patented WAFFLECUP outsole technology platform. Our new Stage 4 skate shoe is being debuted in stores and online this spring. This new innovation has reinforced that our Vans organization continues to be the leader in breakthrough technologies that exceed the expectations of their core skate consumer across the globe.","In 2012, we will continue to elevate our connection with consumers by investing heavily in grassroots events like South by Southwest, numerous skate events and this summer's iconic Warped Tour. For all of these events, we're using social media in new and creative ways to link consumers back to the brand and interactively telling our story. In fact, our efforts have yielded a nearly 60% increase in Facebook fans and Twitter subscribers since the beginning of the year.","Our Americas DtoC business continues to perform solidly. In the first quarter, Vans DtoC was up 13% including a nearly 40% increase in our e-commerce business. In both our wholesale and DtoC businesses, we continue to aggressively build the brand outside of the Western U.S., in Canada, Mexico and up and down the East Coast of the United States. To this end, we have opened 7 new stores since the beginning of the year, all primarily on the East Coast of the United States.","We've scheduled an investor meeting in New York on June 14, where we'll go into much greater detail about Vans' overall business and long-term growth strategy. So now I'll pass it over to Karl Heinz, who will take us through some brief international highlights before we move onto Timberland.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","In the first quarter, Vans saw tremendous growth of greater than 50% in Europe and high-teen revenue growth in Asia. We are clearly benefiting from higher brand investments, focusing on new products, strong emotional storytelling and focused skate culture events to connect deeply with our consumers. During the quarter, we opened 3 new owned retail locations, including a store on Camden Street in London, which showcases Vans' new retail concept, in 3 short weeks, become our second-best performing store in Europe.","We're also excited about the simultaneous launch next month of 7 new e-commerce sites in the U.K., Germany, Netherlands, France, Ireland, Austria and Sweden. We're clearly at the beginning stages with e-commerce in Europe, so you can understand why we are very bullish on our long-term growth opportunities in Europe with the Vans brand.","And now let's take a look at Timberland. Steve?","Steven E. Rendle","On a constant dollar basis, global revenues for Timberland were up modestly in the first quarter. In North America, revenues declined slightly due to unusually warm weather that dampened demand for Timberland's core winter boot business, as well as lower royalty income from the brand's former apparel licensee. The license was terminated last year.","As Eric indicated, we are intensely focused this year on realizing the tremendous opportunities presented by the Timberland brand, growing revenues and improving profitability. Building on the strategies we laid out on our last call, we're focused on accelerating Timberland's product engine for maximum innovation, activating the brand to create a deeper consumer connection, assessing Timberland's wholesale distribution and DtoC and growing the business internationally. Timberland has a long-standing history of building quality footwear and we're looking to leverage this competency to develop a corporate innovation center that will serve both the Timberland and other footwear brands in the VF portfolio.","Simultaneously, we're putting in place the team and infrastructure to support next year's apparel launch. We recently placed a leader from our North Face apparel business in Europe at Timberland to head up this important effort. We're fast developing a very clear vision of how to translate Timberland's unique heritage into apparel with special fabrics and features, which we look forward to sharing with you.","We're also in the process of evaluating Timberland's DtoC strategy and operating model. We're making good progress in terms of rightsizing the cost structure and as well as in specific initiatives designed to drive traffic, improve conversion and improve margins. These efforts will better align Timberland's DtoC model with that of our Outdoor & Action Sports coalition.","Now I'll turn it over to Karl Heinz to take you through what's going on internationally with Timberland.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Timberland's international business, which makes up more than 50% of total sales, saw low single-digit growth in Europe and strong double-digit growth in Asia on a constant dollar basis. Italy is Timberland's largest European market, and the challenging market conditions there are weighting on our overall results in Europe. But the overall strength of the Timberland brand makes us confident that we will weather these conditions and continue to grow and gain share in this important geography.","To highlight a few strategic initiatives, on the product side, we are seeing excellent growth with our Earthkeepers and women's footwear. Both categories are starting to hit their stride, and we are confident that with continued marketing investments, they will establish themselves as even greater contributors to our overall performance this fall. In Asia, our strategic initiatives for Timberland are similar. Within this geography, we see opportunity for Timberland in multiple markets and are particularly excited about the upside in China, where we can leverage VF's existing infrastructure.","Keeping our focus on our international business for the moment, let's now switch gears to Wrangler. On a global basis, first quarter revenues for the Wrangler brand were up 8% or 10% if you exclude the impact of foreign currency. International highlights for the quarter was continued very strong growth in Asia, where revenues grew at a mid-teen rate in constant dollars. Perhaps not surprisingly, our business in Europe softened in the first quarter, leading to lower revenues there. Positive performance in Northern and Eastern Europe were not enough to offset challenging conditions in Southern Europe, especially in Spain, Greece and Italy. We were pleased, however, to achieve a nice improvement in gross margin and operating income.","So in summary, a slightly lower top line for Wrangler in Europe with improved profitability. Strategically, we have a number of initiatives underway to position the Wrangler brand for long-term growth. This includes accelerating our efforts around product innovation, more powerful storytelling and new tools to help our wholesale partners communicate the brand's authenticity and heritage.","With that, Scott will take you through Wrangler's performance in the Americas.","Scott H. Baxter","Thanks, Karl Heinz. In our Americas geography, Wrangler grew at a low double-digit rate in constant dollars, driven by strong performance in our Mass Market and Western businesses, pointing again to the success of new products and helped by the healthy sales of spring seasonal products. Product innovation tops the list of key strategic initiatives this year for Wrangler.","On the mass side, we're seeing great results in our performance polo shirt and are looking forward to new fleece and easy-care shirt launches later this year. We're also very excited about the expansion of our Wrangler Five Star Premium line, and although early on, the Wrangler brand's extension into footwear.","In our Western business, our product innovation efforts are targeted squarely at Western lifestyle consumers in both men's and women's. Examples include expanding our Premium Performance Cowboy Cut platform with shirts and a new Retro jean that will retail between $40 and $50 a pair in Western Specialty stores. DtoC is also an important growth engine for this business. In fact, our e-commerce business grew by 50% plus in the first quarter, and we're looking to develop a Wrangler Western partner store model. With 2 locations already opened, early reads are quite positive.","And finally, let's take a look at the Lee brand. On a global basis, first quarter revenues were up 6% or 7% on a constant dollar basis. In the Americas, the Lee brand achieved low-teen revenue growth helped by strong seasonal sales. This performance contributed to market share gains in both jeans and total bottoms in the mid-tier department stores. Our ability to keep our products new and relevant, keeping the consumer at the center of everything we do by combining their feedback with our design expertise, is clearly working.","On the men's side of the Lee business, new fit innovations like modern straight fit and motion comfort khaki are selling through strongly, and we're excited about the potential of our worry-free casual pants. Like Wrangler, we're also looking into opportunities to increase Lee's Premium offering to expand our brand's reach. On the women's side, we are seeing great momentum for our Shapetastic Perfect Fit [ph], an amazing slimming technology, and are very excited about the new product launches from Riders by Lee in mass stores later this year.","All in all, a great start to the year with a tremendous amount of excitement and energy around the momentum we've built, the innovation that's coming and the opportunity to continue to grow this business. Karl Heinz?","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Similar to Wrangler, Lee saw lower revenue in the first quarter in Europe while also improving profitability. In Asia, growth was at the high single-digit rate, which is lower than we have recently, due to entirely to the timing of shipments. We're looking forward to strong Q2 performance.","On the product innovation front, Lee's women's stretch deluxe initiative continues to show promising results with high sell-through. We look forward to building on this initial success with a strengthening pipeline of innovative products to drive future growth. In the near term, we are very focused on execution of a variety of action plans to stimulate sell-through by managing inventories and expenses tightly to ensure we are in the best position possible relevant to the environment.","Now I'll turn it over to Bob, who will take you through our financial highlights.","Robert K. Shearer","All right. Well, thanks, all, for the terrific overview. Now I'd like to wrap up today's call with some commentary around our first quarter financial performance and our strengthened full year guidance.","Revenues were up a strong 31% or 32% in constant dollars. Similarly, our healthy organic revenue growth momentum continued in the quarter at 12% reported and 14% in constant dollars. In 2 of our very important growth drivers, international and direct-to-consumer, organic revenues grew by 15% and 16%, respectively, so we're tracking really well against the 2012 targets set in February for these businesses. Our revenue growth in the quarter was somewhat stronger than anticipated due in part to the unusually warm weather, which drove earlier shipments and stronger sales of seasonal products.","Now a quick comment on 3 businesses that we haven't touched on: Imagewear, Sportswear and Contemporary Brands. All had very good quarters, with each double-digit top line growth and a healthy expansion in operating margins. A couple of details. Imagewear posted yet another quarter of double-digit revenue and operating income growth. And as we've seen in past quarters, the momentum continues in the Image or the uniform side of the business, driven by 20% plus growth in both our Bulwark Protective Apparel and Red Kap uniform brands. And we also achieved another quarter of growth in the Licensed Sports Apparel business with particular strength in our Major League Baseball and NFL businesses.","Regarding Sportswear, we really feel good about the strength we're seeing in both the Nautica and Kipling brands. Nautica's focus on differentiated products, supported by a powerful brand message, is clearly resonating with consumers with healthy increases in both its wholesale and retail businesses. Kipling in the U.S. also delivered exceptional retail growth in the quarter, over 50% in fact, with very strong comps. Wholesale revenues increased by over 25%, resulting in the 44% increase in total reported revenues.","And in terms of our Contemporary Brands business, we really feel we're turning the corner here. We saw a big improvement in operating margin, which increased 300 basis points in the quarter. We're experiencing a nice pickup in our U.S. 7 For All Mankind business with 18% revenue growth. And we're continuing to open new stores for 7 For All Mankind, Splendid and Ella Moss. In fact, the Splendid and Ella Moss brands grew by over 20% in the quarter. And while these aren't VF's largest brands, they do present us with a significant opportunity for growth going forward.","Now a few comments on gross margin. On our last call, I noted that gross margin could be down about 100 basis points. The reported gross margin was down 150 points. Let me provide some context. The gross margin for our core businesses, meaning excluding Timberland, was right on plan. And as planned, the decline was due to higher jeans product costs. However, gross margin for Timberland was lower than anticipated. We are taking aggressive actions to move cold-weather Timberland inventories, which given the exceptionally warm weather, is proving more challenging than expected. The good news is that these actions are working, and Timberland's inventories will be in much better shape by mid-year.","As we discussed in February, we continue to anticipate significant gross margin improvement for our jeans businesses in the latter part of the year, and we expect to achieve the planned improvement in Timberland's gross margin in the second half. Finally, I'd also remind you that the overall gross margin comparison was impacted by a change in inventory accounting that took place in last year's first quarter, which benefited the gross margin in that period by 40 basis points.","Our SG&A ratio is trending pretty stable with last year's level, up just 20 basis points. And that's despite the fact that this year's ratio includes, first, the impact of Timberland, where SG&A as a percent of revenues is significantly higher than VF's. In fact, Timberland drove up VF's overall SG&A ratio by about 100 basis points. And second, a 30 basis point negative impact from the higher pension expense. So that points to very disciplined overall expense control during the quarter.","Our operating margin was 12.5% on an adjusted basis, compared with 14% in last year's first quarter. But here again, we have some puts and takes. Timberland negatively impacted the operating margin by 100 basis points. And of course, the current year's quarter includes the 30 basis point negative impact from higher pension expense. And finally, in last year's first quarter, the 40 basis point benefit from the inventory accounting change impacts the comparison. So on an apples-to-apples basis and excluding Timberland, the operating margin was actually pretty comparable to the very strong 14% achieved last year.","Now you'll note the tax rate increased in the quarter to 26.7% from 21.9%, but I'll remind you that last year's low rate reflected a favorable tax settlement that lowered the rate by about 300 basis points.","And that brings us to the bottom line, with adjusted earnings per share rising by 7% to $1.94. Timberland contributed $0.12 to earnings per share, excluding acquisition-related expenses that were $0.03 per share in the quarter. Now it's important to understand the factors behind this quarter's earnings comparison. Included in the $1.94 was the combined negative impact from foreign currency translation and pension expense, which pulled EPS down by $0.09 per share. On the other hand, EPS in last year's quarter benefited by $0.11 in unusual items, which were the LIFO inventory accounting change and the favorable tax settlement. So excluding these unusuals, the year-over-year positive swing in earnings was actually $0.32 per share, underscoring our strong fundamental performance.","Turning now to the balance sheet. Inventories are in really good shape, up only 7% excluding Timberland, with 6 percentage points of the increase coming from higher product costs. We did repurchase 2 million shares during the quarter for $300 million to help offset the dilutive impact of stock option exercises. We continue to anticipate another strong year of cash generation, which we now expect to exceed $1.1 billion for the year.","Now I'd like to close with a recap of our revised earnings guidance, including a few comments on the second quarter. We're really pleased to be raising our guidance for adjusted earnings per share to $9.45, up from the $9.30 we provided back in February. This increase is primarily driven by our great confidence in our brands' continued momentum. The increase also includes the $0.06 improvement from a smaller-than-anticipated negative impact from foreign currency.","We remain comfortable with our assumption for an EPS contribution of $1.10 from Timberland, excluding acquisition expenses. So no change there. No change either in the $0.19 per share impact from higher pension expense. And the full year impact from foreign currency now moves to $0.35 from $0.41 per share. We noted in the release the 1.30 euro conversion rate for the second quarter and the 1.25 rate we're assuming for the second half. So the full year currency impact only changes by $0.06 from our prior guidance, as the change in the assumed rate from 1.25 to 1.30 for the second quarter has only about $0.01 of benefit to that quarter, given that Q2 is a seasonally low quarter of activity for our international businesses. Of course, if the euro remains at its current rate, there is upside to our guidance. To quantify that, in the second half of the year, there's about $0.10 of EPS benefit for every $0.05 movement in the euro-to-dollar relationship.","Now a final comment on adjusted earnings per share. As we indicated in the release, adjusted EPS will now exclude not only the Timberland acquisition-related expenses currently estimated at $0.23 per share. But looking forward, we'll also exclude the gain anticipated from the John Varvatos sale, which is expected to approximate $0.20 per share. Coincidently, these 2 items nearly offset each other, so there will likely not be a significant difference between adjusted and reported EPS on full year reporting.","With respect to gross margin, we remain comfortable with our guidance for a 70 basis point improvement for the full year. Gross margin comparisons will continue to improve in the second quarter and should turn nicely positive in the second half, with by far the strongest comparison in the fourth quarter. In terms of revenues, our guidance remains intact with that provided back in February, which called for a 15% increase in total revenues. And we're holding guidance despite the fact that we're now taking out $70 million in John Varvatos revenues for the balance of the year. We're still cautious about the macro environment both here and abroad, given the mixed economic data that we're seeing, so we think it's prudent to wait and get another quarter or 2 under our belts before we consider taking a stronger stand on revenues.","Now as you know, we don't provide quarterly earnings guidance, but we did think more color was necessary around what we expect for the second quarter, particularly given the impact of Timberland on the numbers. On our February call, I said that the second quarter would be our most challenged earnings comparison. Let's review the reasons why. The first is the impact from Timberland, which historically posts a significant loss in the second quarter. This year will be no expectation, and we expect a loss comparable to what they reported last year of about $30 million on an adjusted basis. Timberland is now clearly our most seasonal business. And with that, VF now has a new earnings cadence. That loss will impact earnings by about $0.20 per share in the second quarter.","And it's important to keep in mind as well the impacts from foreign currency and higher pension expense, which together are expected to be comparable to that in the first quarter or $0.09. So we're looking at a combined impact from Timberland, pension and currency on the second quarter that should approximate $0.29 per share. Comparisons are further challenged by the fact that last year's second quarter included a $0.07 benefit from a European plant closing. In short, despite continued growth in our core business, given these factors, we're looking at a decrease in second quarter earnings per share.","And of course, given our full year earnings guidance, this points to very strong earnings gains in the second half of the year. We expect the fourth quarter to post by far the most positive earnings comparison of the year, given the rebound in our Jeanswear, and therefore total VF margins; strong retail revenue performance, as we continue to add new stores; and the seasonal nature of our biggest and most profitable Outdoor & Action Sports brands.","Well, I hope this helps clarify the cadence of our upcoming earnings. In summary, we're off to a very strong start to 2012. We're seeing strong momentum continue. Our brands are in great shape. And as you've heard, we have a long runway for continued growth globally.","Eric C. Wiseman","Thanks, Bob. Operator, we're now going to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Robert Drbul with Barclays.","Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division","First question that I have is on the outlook for the full year. Can you elaborate a little bit more in terms of the way that you guys are positioned around the orders and open to buy throughout Europe? And just sort of are there any stretches to what you're assuming in that? Or where is there any risk that you see around the plans for the European business, specifically Vans and The North Face?","Eric C. Wiseman","Karl Heinz, do you want to take a shot at that?","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Yes, yes, I do. As we had said in the release before, we had expected a little bit softer bookings, fall bookings, which is what actually happened. Having said still that, we still expect The North Face to grow in the full year. I mean, this is a firm statement. On Vans, Vans operates a little bit on a different business model than The North Face. We have multiple collections, so we had to work on 4, rather than 2. And so we don't have the full visibility yet on the full fall and back-to-school looks. But what we have at the moment, we said, we experienced a 50% growth in the first quarter makes us very confident that we'll have again, after last year, a very strong year on Vans. Did I answer you?","Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, that's helpful, yes. And I think you said The North Face, the global fall bookings were up low double. Is there a big discrepancy? Can you just give us any numbers around the U.S. versus the international order book on that one?","Steven E. Rendle","Karl Heinz, do we want to split this one?","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Yes, yes, I can start maybe with my part, which is Europe and Asia. We saw very strong numbers in Asia, which were -- they mirror historical numbers. So we mentioned double-digit up, very strong numbers. Europe was a little bit softer and we had a few exceptional items, not only the economy, which everybody knows about, and the bad weather, which really didn't help the business. But we also saw, particularly in the U.K., we had some major customers who had some bankruptcies, which affected us. Now this has been resolved. And if you neutralize these extraordinary events, we also pulled out from distribution which we didn't believe was good short-term and long-term for the brand. So if you neutralize these extraordinary factors, we still see a few percent of growth also in Europe.","Steven E. Rendle","And so, Bob, in the Americas, we don't -- we're actually seeing fall bookings comparable to prior seasons. So we're really on a nice trend. And in fact, as you heard, there's no change to our full year expectations of mid-teen growth for the brand on a global basis. I think it really speaks to the brand's diversified strategy, both from a region standpoint as well as the activities-based model that was deployed 3, 3.5 years ago, as well as the different categories of business that we sell into retail.","Eric C. Wiseman","And, Bob, the other piece is Asia, where the brand is really strong in Asia and also very new in Asia. So we've got nothing but opportunity there. And our teams are capitalizing on the opportunity.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So I'm just -- I'm curious about your comments that there was a bit of a gross margin tail -- sorry, headwind due to Timberland inventories being a bit of a challenge. But you didn't see a similar thing materialize for The North Face, yet we have -- yet it sounds like you're planning on doing some clearing of low-productivity SKUs for The North Face at the same time. So I was just hoping you could help us reconcile that as far as how we're thinking about -- it sounds like you have a lot of confidence in the second half earnings. That's usually very closely tied to The North Face. We're trying to think about a little bit -- how much -- how conservative we are or how much risk there is to the back half potentially from inventories for North Face in the channel still that might show up from last year from the warm winter.","Steven E. Rendle","Sure. So this is Steve. So on The North Face, I'll deal with that first. We saw a really strong close to 2011, where we moved through the standard seasonal inventories at that point. And as we came into the first quarter, we saw solid growth of the seasonal categories as well. We -- I think from a brand standpoint, we've seen really good sell-through. Inventories at retail are in good positions. There are some retailers that are sitting on slightly higher but from our standpoint, we've seen such good sell-through here that we feel we're in the best position as we move into the second half. And our fall bookings would give us that confidence. And I think it's important to say that retailers book sales for coming seasons based on prior season sales, not necessarily prior season bookings or receipts, but on what they sold through. And our future bookings in fall really reinforce how well we've done in the first quarter and how we expect to enter into the second half. In the case of Timberland, we are still learning what it means to own a business that's primarily a winter boot brand. The impacts of the warm, dry winter were somewhat greater than we expected. That has left us with a slightly higher inventory position now. But as Bob mentioned, we will work our way through that by the end of the second quarter. But I think it also is important to say that this really reinforces our long-term strategy to accelerate innovation in both footwear and apparel, to build a business that has a more diversified assortment, not only in the fall but year around.","Robert K. Shearer","And Michael, I'd just add to that, that obviously right now we're instilling a lot of discipline, especially in the inventory management area at Timberland, and we're seeing a little bit of short-term impact from that. But we're going to see big benefits going forward as we get the inventory levels down, which are quite high right now, and as we work those down by mid-year and then move forward in the second half of the year.","Eric C. Wiseman","And, Michael, it's Eric. Just to make sure there's clarity about the situation in North America with The North Face, yes, we did have a few retailers that put some inventory back to hold onto it to sell until fall. All of that is reflected in their bookings. They obviously wrote their bookings knowing exactly what they had. And so our outlook for the fall, we have pretty clear visibility to the outlook, and we're really encouraged.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just since we're going to be -- I think the next time we'll chat with you guys will be at a Vans Analyst Day, maybe a Vans question. I think we heard that you guys are -- you have the e-commerce platform set up in Europe now. And I think it becomes quite leveragable that you have the back-of-house supply chain and order fulfillment set up. And I think you're going to be turning on quite a few markets for Vans now that you have North Face on in the near term. Can you tell us a little about the plans for Vans as you roll that out across Europe on e-commerce and perhaps what you're seeing early on with North Face, so we could think about, as you do that for Vans?","Eric C. Wiseman","Go ahead, Karl Heinz.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Yes. Michael, you said it all, right? We do work and we have a leverage on our, what we call the backend on e-comm. We started about 15 months ago with the first trial market on The North Face. And what we do now, we are rolling out other markets and brands. We use the backend, which includes not only the system part but also the order fulfillment and the deliveries, the supply chain. It's all backed and it's leveraged. Well, what we do keep in focus though is the brand part. So every site has its relevant part, so it could speak to their relevant consumers. We don't know yet what is going to happen on Vans because we mentioned we are rolling it out next month. But I did mention that in my script, the experience we had on The North Face. Once we improved the first initial difficulties, it's great. And it's much over what we had planned and what our expectations were. It's a very fast, rapidly growing channel.","Eric C. Wiseman","For us, that's all upside in Europe around the e-commerce thing. This will not come as a surprise to you: we've been pretty conservative in our expectations this year as we start launching the Vans e-commerce sites in Europe. But it's all upside and the right thing for us to be doing.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","All right. And just one last question, and I'll let you guys run. But since we're on the topic of field trips, we're going to China. You guys are taking investors to China in September. Why now? Why is now the right time? You guys have been there for decades. It's a single-digit part of the revenues. But I'm just curious, is there an inflection point ahead? Or why is now the time to showcase what you -- the work you guys have done in China?","Eric C. Wiseman","Well, we've been thinking about when was the right time to go to Asia and talk about our Asian business and our focus on China in particular. And Timberland was actually an inflection point because they're so successful in that region that we thought now was the right time to go over and talk about our Asia-Pacific business and share with you just how much progress we're making. We're getting very close to that $1 billion mark in the region. And we thought that was something to talk about and show you how we're doing that, centered, of course, our biggest market is China, but wanted to share all that with you. So looking forward to that trip in September.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Jim Duffy with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. If you mentioned what you're seeing from Timberland orders for fall, I missed it. Can you share some perspective on this? And is the 10% annual growth objective for Timberland still a reasonable expectation for '12?","Steven E. Rendle","Yes, Jim, this is Steve. Timberland, similar to Vans in Karl Heinz's earlier answer, operates on a different model than The North Face, so we don't currently have a full season visibility into what that fall season looks like. But we are confident that our expectations of Timberland adding $1 billion in revenue to 2012 is well on track to come together.","Eric C. Wiseman","And Jim, Eric. When we talked last quarter about the 2012 outlook for Timberland, we mentioned that it would be low single-digit revenue growth. As we cleaned up some distribution, closed some underproductive owned stores and we exited the apparel business in the United States, we're positioning long term. 10% annual growth is still our target. But our specific reference to this year's Timberland organic revenue growth number was in the low single-digit range.","Robert K. Shearer","And Jim, the other -- yes, the other reconciling item there is currency, right? So from the 10% currency as well as the exiting of some business, that's how we got down to the single digits.","Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Got you. That's helpful clarification. And then a question on the Jeanswear business for Scott. So competitors have made some pricing adjustments recently. Has that had any detectable influence on Lee or Wrangler's sell-through share in recent months?","Scott H. Baxter","No, Jim, it hasn't. And our intention is try to hold pricing and keep it where it's at. Now if you remember, our last couple of calls, Jim, we've talked a lot about the fact that we didn't go up as far as the pricing went up and as far as the cost went up. We stayed fairly neutral, only went up about half. But as we look at the business and we look with our customers to work with them, we'll be fair and we'll work with our customers to make sure we maximize the business going forward. But right now, our intention is to stay pat.","Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Got it. And a quick follow-up to Mike Binetti's question. When you talk about the 15% SKU rationalization, that isn't liquidation but it's assortment planning for future seasons, correct?","Steven E. Rendle","Exactly, Jim. That's all about rightsizing our collections to really maximize our output and our creativity and also improve margins from that exercise.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Kate McShane with Citi.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I just wondered if we could have a little bit more detail around the outlook for the year and where the $0.15 is coming from. Obviously, there was some contribution from better-than-expected currency. But I wondered if you could help us understand the additional $0.10 upside since revenue guidance is staying the same.","Robert K. Shearer","Sure. I'll start on that one. So Kate, it is important to factor in the John Varvatos piece. So what happens is we had John Varvatos business obviously built into our initial projections. We'll lose about $70 million of revenues by the sale, but not a lot profit, right? So there's not a big impact there. So what that means is if we're taking $70 million out of revenues, it means that we're feeling more comfortable with the rest of our businesses, some increase in the rest of our businesses and seeing some pickup there in terms of the additional or the incremental EPS contribution.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, great. And then with regards to margin contribution then for the rest of the year, are there any areas for where there could be more upside with regards to gross margin than maybe -- than you were originally expecting, either on the cost side or on -- from pricing?","Robert K. Shearer","Yes. We're pretty well locked in right now. Based on prior conversations, we're in a very different place today than we've been in the past and particularly on -- or at least last year, and particularly on the denim side, right? So we're pretty well locked in right now on the cost side. And that is true both from a sourced goods standpoint, as well as our denim buys. So we're covering at this point in time at least through the end of the third quarter and about half of the fourth quarter. So we have a very, very good picture in terms of what those costs will be. And on the revenue side, I think you mentioned pricing. I mean, pricing as well, I think the question has been around the Jeanswear side, particularly here in the U.S. And as Scott just said, our intent is to hold our pricing there. But it's really important to keep in mind that our pricing increases only covered half of the cost increases. So once again, we feel very confident about our assumptions there.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Eric Tracy with Janney Capital Markets.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","I guess, if I could follow up on the Jeanswear business. Clearly, the combination of pricing and product costs rolling over are going to help domestically. Maybe, Karl Heinz, a little bit more color on the European business. Remind us what Jeanswear represents for that region and sort of the visibility as you go forward through the balance of the year, what top line trends looks like there.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Sure. Let me just do some math in my head. Jeanswear, our largest business in Europe as well as the Outdoor business. I think Jeanswear represents about 20% of our total business in Europe. And we said it before. We had expected a little bit slower bookings for fall, which actually happened. Where we see some pressure is on the replenishment. Jeanswear operates a little bit different business model than Outdoor, where the replenishment side is higher than in Outdoor. And we basically see the same trend. Our customers, primarily the department stores, are suffering from lower traffic. And we see that reflected in the replenishment then. So the bookings came in as we had expected. They were slightly up in spring, and they were a little bit lower -- I mean, they are a few percent down versus last year in fall. But what we have worked on very highly was the improvement in gross margin and in the profitability of our Jeanswear business. And that's what's happening at the moment.","Eric C. Wiseman","And, Eric, it's the other Eric here. I'll add to Karl Heinz's comment and remind you that when you look at the international business for Jeanswear, you have to look at China and India. Our biggest business in China is our jeans business and our biggest business in India is our jeans business. And our jeans business in China is more profitable than any jeans business we have anywhere in the world. So our Asian growth in Jeanswear is a really important part of our story. And I'm sure we'll be talking about that in September. Hope you can join us.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay, no, that's great. And then really just quick follow-up. I realize it's a smaller piece of the business, but certainly the opportunity for growth, and it sounds like turning contemporary, be it 7 For All Mankind or the Ella and Splendid businesses. Maybe just touch on, what are the kind of key drivers there? Is it wholesale versus direct for 7 For All Mankind? Sort of what's driving that? And where do you see the opportunities over the next 12 months?","Eric C. Wiseman","Sure. I'll start with talking about the Splendid and Ella Moss business, which we don't often talk about. And Bob commented, I think, in his comments, it was up 20% in the quarter. That's not new news for us. Actually, it's been kind of growing that way for the last couple of years. That is a very -- those are very strong brands, very relevant to their consumers, mostly a U.S. business for us now with international opportunity. Mostly U.S. business, and that kind of growth is not new. They've been very disciplined there about delivering strong double-digit growth quarter after quarter after quarter. 7, as you know, was a business where we went backwards during -- particularly during the recession, when the premium business in general slowed down. And that team has been working very hard to make sure they have the right product and the right mix in their wholesale and retail business. And both grew. Both the wholesale and retail business were up. And as Bob said, I think, in his comments, the brand in the U.S. was up 18% in the quarter. And we're thrilled to see that kind of traction. It began in the middle of last year, and it seems to be accelerating.","Eric B. Tracy - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","And is that primarily a wholesale function of picking up share? Or was this kind of greater driving from direct-to-consumer?","Eric C. Wiseman","I can't -- well, it's both. Both were up double digits, right at around the 18% range in both. I can't comment on the share piece at wholesale because that space, the premium denim space, has been a good space for the last 6 or 9 months. But I don't know that we're gaining or losing share there, but we are having that kind of strong double-digit growth. I don't know what the total space is.","Operator","And next, we'll go to John Kernan with Cowen.","John D. Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to go back to Timberland again. You talked a lot about long-term margin recovery in this business. Is there any way to improve the seasonality potentially in Timberland? Maybe looking out into next year, do you see any long-term leverage to kind of improve that seasonality from a profitability standpoint?","Steven E. Rendle","Yes, I think -- John, this is Steve. Our opportunities at Timberland are to certainly strengthen the core footwear collection that Timberland's known for. But it's also to diversify that collection and look at growing the spring assortment, growing the men's and women's assortment. And it really is apparel, which we talked a lot about at the point of acquisition, the $300 million in incremental opportunity we see over the next 5 years. As we bring that online beginning fall 2013, we believe that we'll start to see that seasonality start to diversify similar to what we saw going on with The North Face back when we acquired it in the 2000.","John D. Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then revenue growth in 2013, and kind of an inflection back towards that 10% growth. Aside from apparel, what other drivers do you have to kind of produce that growth? Is there DTC growth? Is there going to be new wholesale partner doors? Or what really gives us and you guys confidence in that 10% growth rate?","Steven E. Rendle","Our confidence on that 10% growth rate over the 5-year period is improving the assortments and the sell-through of the brand in our key wholesale partners. It's also the improvement of DtoC as we look to improve the contribution of our current stores, as we achieve that, adding new stores, and certainly the e-commerce component where we see such great significance in our North Face and Vans businesses, leveraging those learnings in that platform to help Timberland scale in that area as well.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","John, Karl Heinz here. I would add also geography, and I mentioned that in my section. We just started in China with Timberland, and where we can leverage the success story we're having with VF. And also Europe, the penetration in Europe, while it's a big, important market, there are still areas where we believe we can cover.","John D. Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. If you don't mind me asking one more kind of macro-related question, there's been some cautiousness recently out of some other footwear and apparel companies regarding Europe. Have you seen any change in confidence in your consumers and retail partners there since the fourth quarter towards -- to more of a cautious outlook, I guess?","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Well, we read a lot of about Europe. I guess, what we have seen or what we see is more and more a polarization between the southern part of Europe and the central and the northern part, which we all know about and read about the difficulties of the southern part, the 3 big large markets, without even touching Greece, but Spain, Italy. What we have seen though lately is a little bit of stabilization. We haven't seen these trends deteriorating. So I guess that's the good news. We have to see how it will evolve. But so far, the good news, even at the weaker market, we haven't seen a deterioration.","Eric C. Wiseman","And what I find particularly encouraging about our European situation, last year, we grew 16% on a constant currency basis. And there was economic turmoil then. Would we expect to be a little bit below that this year? But part of that is because our brands are -- we have brands that are relatively underpenetrated in a lot of countries. And Karl Heinz and his team have managed to identify a path that will still give us double-digit growth in Western Europe. Despite all the changes and swings and roundabouts across our brand portfolio, the breadth of our portfolio and the differences in how each brand has penetrated in each market is really an advantage for us. It gives us a lot more opportunity.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Taposh Bari with Jefferies.","Taposh Bari - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Wanted to ask you, I guess, Eric, on a follow-up to that last point. So it seems like you're doing a really good job of challenging -- or managing the macro challenges in Europe, and your brands are fairly underpenetrated there. I was hoping -- we got a glimpse of this at The North Face Analyst Day, I guess, last year. But I was hoping to get some more color on where you're seeing growth: if it's distribution, if it's door growth, or if it's just increased relevance amongst your brands.","Eric C. Wiseman","Karl, you want...","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Yes, it's multiple things, and some you touched on. Certainly, I mentioned about the e-comm initiatives, right? We are rolling out, as we speak, a new market. So that's one big initiative. The second one, still falling under direct-to-consumer, we are opening stores in The North Face, as we have mentioned before. And our number of stores today, a grand total of 40 stores, it's still significantly lower than even a sister company like Timberland. So that is an opportunity. If we benchmark the number of stores we have to some local competitors, we have a long way to go. So that's the second. The third one is simply geographies, right? The North Face had always had a pan-European strategy, and we are very rarely the #1 in the market. We have local competitors, but we are growing. So we are going on a pan-European basis, not just primarily in 1 or 2 markets. I guess, these 3 factors are helping us to see this continuous success we're having since many, many quarters.","Taposh Bari - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Great. Can you just -- would you be able to just talk to the -- or the countries specifically? Like which countries do you feel like you're most underpenetrated in, in Europe today?","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Well, we still have, compared to some other competitors, what we call the emerging market, which is that area from Russia, which is a big important market for Outdoor. Russia, going down to Turkey, covering Poland and the Czech Republic. But primarily these 3 big, large -- relatively large and healthy markets, that's important. They are growing. They are doing well. We are going also very nicely, higher than the average in the Scandinavian area, while on the other big markets like Germany, Italy, France, we still have people ahead of us. There's a German player which has nearly 150 doors, and we have probably 10 in Germany. So we still have, even in the big markets, some room to grow.","Taposh Bari - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just a final quick follow-up question for Bob. I don't know if I missed this, but can you tell us what Timberland's gross margins were in the first quarter?","Robert K. Shearer","Yes. We don't provide specific gross margins by brand. But what we can tell you is that for Timberland, the gross margin was right on the average. It was right on overall VF's average. Now again, we did expect it to be a little bit stronger than that, and we talked about why that was the case. But it was right on VF's overall average.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Omar Saad with ISI Group.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Eric, as you think about the portfolio management strategy for VF Corp., obviously with the addition of Timberland, the strong growth in the Outdoor & Action Sports segment, the increasing shift to a little bit more retail mix than wholesale mix, the business has become much -- is becoming much more seasonal, back-half-weighted. Are you comfortable with that? Do you feel like -- especially as you look out in the future and look to manage the portfolio, add brands, do you look to fill in kind of seasonally strong brands that would be -- that would offset kind of some of the way it's weighted now? Or are you comfortable with that, kind of building a really strong Outdoor business? If it's back half-weighted, it's back half-weighted. It's what we're good at. It's what we really know. Just your thoughts on the portfolio management and the seasonality of the business would be great.","Eric C. Wiseman","Yes. Seasonality has not been a primary filter that we use as we look at the portfolio. We obviously are aware of it. And I would say that from an acquisition standpoint, which I think is the point of your question. We do look at, are there seasonal opportunities for us to strengthen businesses as we did with The North Face? And it's interesting to us that 12 years ago, we were talking about really difficult second quarters because The North Face was not a good business to be in, in the second quarter. But we've rounded out the product portfolio. We've rounded out the countries we sell the brand in. We've rounded out -- we have really good spring, summer products in The North Face. And that -- we weren't having that discussion for the last 2 or 3 years. And we have the exact same opportunity with Timberland. And as Steve said in his comments or the answer to one of his questions, apparel is really an important part of that solution for Timberland. And we won't be begin to -- we won't have a spring apparel line until the spring of 2014, so it's in our sights and we will get at it, but it will take us a while. But we haven't said, \"Well, let's go acquire a business that will make us stronger in the second quarter.\" We are very comfortable with -- if we're leading in these cold-weather brands, if we have the strongest cold-weather brands, we will continue to have good third and fourth quarters as we have for the last 5 or 6 years in a row.","Robert K. Shearer","And Omar, just I guess, I'd just add to that, that one of the challenges with businesses that have that highly seasonal nature is from an operational standpoint and managing inventories. And we've demonstrated that we can do that pretty well with brands like The North Face. It's exactly what we're working on right now in Timberland. And again, we'll make a lot of progress there.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great, great. And then one follow-up. On the kind of cost-inflation side, obviously, the cotton bubble seems to be behind us, so to speak. How are you guys thinking about inflation long-term? Yes, the material side may be getting easier, but we kind of all know about the structural wage story in China and emerging markets, where a lot of the manufacturing is done. How do you see VF in maybe a structurally inflationary environment, kind of especially once we get past the back half of this year? And how do you see that impacting the kind of overall marketplace if we really are going from 20 years of deflation to some extended period of inflation?","Robert K. Shearer","Yes. And we, of course, enjoyed that period of time from a cost perspective. But right now, in a more stable environment, I guess, you might say, it feels to us like there's a few percentage points of inflationary cost that will come our way probably over some period of time here. That's what we're seeing this year. And as we look forward, we expect something more like that. And as you pointed out, with the cotton bubble, it appears to be behind us, a lot more stable environment. But a few percentage points of inflation on an annual basis could be expected.","Eric C. Wiseman","And that's one of the reasons, Omar, that we are investing so heavily behind our brands and why we're so focused on our innovation strategy because we believe that if we build these brands to be the leaders in their space and if we have incredibly innovative products, that we can get paid for the products with the leading brands. And seeing this wave of inflation coming at us for years to come, we think that's critical to our solution. Fortunately, we think we're well positioned with both the brand and the product innovation fronts.","Operator","And with that being our last question, I'll turn the call back over to Eric Wiseman for any additional comments or closing remarks.","Eric C. Wiseman","Sure. Thanks for being with us today. As you've heard, the momentum of VF continues despite external economic challenges. We're really confident in our ability to deliver our increased 2012 guidance, and we look forward to giving you another update in July. Thanks so much.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference. And we thank you for participating."],"21500":["V.F.

Good morning, everyone. Thank you for participating in VF Corporation's fourth quarter and full year 2011 conference call. By now, you should have received today's earnings press release. If not, please call (203) 682-8200, and we'll send you a copy immediately following the call. Hosting the call today is Eric Wiseman, Chairman and CEO of VF Corp.","Before we begin, I would like to remind participants that certain statements included in today's remarks and the Q&A session may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements include management's current expectations, estimates and projections about business and results of operations and the industries in which VF operates.

Wiseman","Thanks, Jean. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. With me today are Bob Shearer, our Chief Financial Officer; our 3 group presidents, Steve Rendle, Karl Heinz Salzburger and Scott Baxter; as well as Karen Murray, President of VF Sportswear; and Susan Kellogg, President of VF Contemporary Brands. I'd like to start off today's call by answering a question I know has been on everyone's mind lately. That question relates to the impact of unseasonably warm weather on VF in general and on The North Face, in particular. I'm delighted to report that in the fourth quarter of 2011, The North Face achieved a 22% increase in global revenues, and this was no easy comp. In the fourth quarter of 2010, The North Face achieved global revenue growth of 25% during an exceptionally cold and snowy winter season globally. Here are some additional numbers. The North Face Americas business grew by 24%. European revenues rose 12% in constant dollars, and Asia revenues increased 41% in constant dollars. I hope that this helps put to rest concerns about the ability of this powerful brand to grow, even in less-than-ideal conditions. We are confident that The North Face's momentum will continue in the years to come, and we look forward to achieving our 2015 revenue goal of $3 billion.","Now with that piece of the picture behind us, let's talk some about the year and the quarter just ended.","2011 was a year of records: record revenues, record earnings, record cash flow from operations both  on an organic basis and, of course, including Timberland, which represents another VF record, the largest acquisition in VF's history.","We continue to be thrilled about the opportunities that Timberland and SmartWool offer VF and our shareholders. We delivered revenues and earnings accretion in 2011 above our initial expectation. We have outstanding teams in place at both Timberland and SmartWool, who are working incredibly hard to realize all the synergies and growth we laid out for you at the time of the acquisition, and we're confident that both the Timberland and SmartWool brands will be important drivers of VF's success for years to come.","The VF team delivered an impressive array of accomplishments in 2011. First, solid organic revenue growth in each and every VF coalition and higher operating income in every coalition except Jeanswear, for reasons we have discussed throughout the year, continued momentum at both The North Face and Vans brands, both of which grew over 20%.","Internationally, organic revenue growth was about 20% in constant dollars. Including Timberland, international revenues were 34% of VF's total revenues. And speaking of international growth, despite the well documented financial challenges in Europe, our organic revenue growth in Europe was 16% in constant dollars. In Asia, an area of continued investment for us, organic revenue growth was greater than 30% in constant dollars, and in our direct-to-consumer businesses, we achieved organic revenue growth of 15%.","In terms of the fourth quarter, we're delighted to wrap up the year on such a strong note, with total revenues rising 37%, and organic growth of 11%. I noted earlier the strength of The North Face in the quarter, but that doesn't tell the whole story. All the VF coalitions achieved solid organic revenue growth in the quarter, and both our international and direct-to-consumer businesses posted double-digit organic growth in the period.","Remember a year ago, at this time, we talked at length about the key issue of the day: higher product costs. And we've laid out our assumptions for 2011 and acknowledged that no one knew how those assumptions were going to play out. So how did we do? We indicated then that the impact on gross margins from higher product costs would be just under 100 basis points. The reported gross margin was down 90 basis points. And we guided to an operating margin that was flat with 2010 levels. Our operating margin, excluding Timberland, was up 30 basis points to 13.6%. Including Timberland, our operating margin was about flat.","I think that speaks volumes about VF's ability to execute in the face of highly challenging and volatile conditions. We recognize that this issue continues to be on everyone's radar for 2012, and Bob will have more to say on this in his comments.","I know another big issue out there is the outlook in Europe. As I mentioned, our organic revenues in Europe grew 16% in constant dollars in 2011. We did see some slowdown in the fourth quarter, with European revenues growing by 14% in constant dollars versus the 20% growth achieved in the third quarter. In times like these, it's important to appreciate the benefits of VF's diversified model. Europe represents about 20% of VF's total revenues, but we are highly diversified there, with a presence across European markets that remain relatively healthy, such as Northern and Eastern Europe. Our brands still have low market shares in nearly every major European market.","The substantial marketing investments we've made over the past couple of years and will continue to make in 2012 are paying for themselves in the form of strong, profitable growth, which we'll continue this year. In fact, our Europe -- our revenues in Europe in 2012 are expected to grow more than 10% in constant dollars. Of course, we're constantly monitoring events overseas and are prepared to course-correct as needed should conditions change dramatically.","With 2011 behind us, our focus is now squarely on 2012 and on achieving the results we've laid out in today's release. To quickly summarize, we expect to grow revenues by 15%, or 17% in constant dollars, and that will take us very close to the $11 billion mark.","Organic growth is pegged at 8% in constant dollars, which we think is a prudent assumption given the uncertainties surrounding economic conditions here and abroad.","All VF coalitions are planning to deliver solid organic growth with another outstanding year of double-digit organic growth in Outdoor & Action Sports. Timberland should add $1 billion to revenue growth this year. You'll hear more from Steve and Karl Heinz about our plans for Timberland and the steps we're taking to ensure strong, long-term growth and profitability.","In 2012, our international business should be 37% of total revenues, so we are well on our way towards achieving our goal of 40% of revenues from our highly profitable international markets by 2015.  ","And we're closing in rapidly on our 2015 goal of 22% of revenues coming from our direct-to-consumer business, with direct-to-consumer revenues approaching that level this year.","Finally, in terms of earnings per share, we've acknowledged the twin headwinds of foreign currency translation and higher pension expense. And as mentioned in today's release, we expect these headwinds to impact our earnings per share by $0.60 in 2012. Yet despite these headwinds, we're looking forward to another record year with adjusted earnings per share expected to reach $9.30, up 13% over 2011.","So we enter 2012 with confidence in the power of our brands to continue the momentum, with conviction in our ability to execute against our plans and with a great deal of excitement about the many, many opportunities that still lie ahead.","I'll turn the call over to Bob now to discuss our financial performance in more detail. Bob?","Robert K. Shearer","Thanks, Eric. These are truly exciting times for VF, with strong momentum across our brands globally. I'd also point out another big milestone reached this year. With the Timberland acquisition, VF will have more than half its revenues coming from Outdoor & Action Sports. The portfolio transformation that we envisioned several years ago has become a fast-growing, highly profitable reality.","Quick point before I dive in. The release contains financial data on an adjusted basis. The adjusted data excludes 2 items: expenses related to the Timberland acquisition in 2011 and 2012 and the impairment charges recorded in 2010. We hope that this helps you better interpret our results.","Now let's start at the top with revenues. Revenues in the quarter increased 37%, with 26 percentage points of the growth, more than $0.5 billion, coming from Timberland. So organic revenues grew at a very healthy rate of 11% this quarter, and that is on top of a strong Q4 in 2010. The momentum continues. And for the year, revenues grew 23%, with 9 percentage points of the growth coming from Timberland. We exceeded the $700 million in revenues targeted for Timberland in 2011. Their total contribution was $713 million. Organic revenues grew 14% in 2011, which is substantially above our long-term organic revenue growth target of 10% that we established in early 2011. The power of the VF portfolio, diversified, global and growing, is clearly evident in these results. ","So onto  gross margin. Our original gross margin guidance on a full year basis was a decline of just less than 100 basis points. So we're really pleased that on a full year basis, we navigated our way through the challenges related to higher product costs, with full year gross margin down 90 basis points.","In terms of the fourth quarter, we were a bit behind the gross margin guidance we provided back in October. The reason: We experienced a modest gross margin pressure from onetime expenses in our U.S. Jeanswear business, including a charge related to the bankruptcy of a supplier.","And to anticipate a question that you might have, Timberland did not have a material impact on gross margin in the quarter as their gross margin was comparable to that of VF's core businesses.","Now in terms of SG&A, you'll also recall that our guidance for the ratio of SG&A to revenues in 2011 was a decline of 100 basis points. On a reported basis, SG&A declined 80 basis points, but that reduction was impacted by the inclusion of Timberland.","Timberland's SG&A ratio to revenues is substantially higher than that of other VF businesses and, in 2011, also included onetime acquisition-related expenses.","Excluding Timberland, the SG&A ratio for the full year 2011 declined by 110 basis points, or 10 basis points better than our initial guidance. In the fourth quarter, the negative impact on the SG&A ratio from Timberland was 90 basis points. Excluding Timberland, the SG&A ratio would have declined by nearly 150 basis points.","Obviously, this speaks to the opportunities we see for future improvements in profitability and margins for Timberland and also to the benefit that we've seen from leveraging our strong organic growth.","In addition, you'll recall that the SG&A ratio in the 2010 quarter reflected some heavier investments in marketing spending, which also helped the comparisons.","Let's move on to the operating income line. As you saw in the release, earnings from Timberland contributed $43.3 million to operating income in the quarter, which is net of $6.7 million in onetime acquisition-related expenses.","For the quarter, the operating margin for Timberland, excluding the onetime expenses, was 9%. If you exclude Timberland, our fourth quarter operating margin increased 10 basis points to 13% compared with the 2010 adjusted operating margin of 12.9%, despite the gross margin pressure I noted earlier. On a full year basis, excluding Timberland, our operating margin moved to 13.6% from 13.3% in 2010. With the inclusion of Timberland, our reported operating margin for the year was 13.2% and adjusted to exclude the onetime acquisition-related costs, 13.5%.","Now let's bring it down to the bottom line. For the year, adjusted earnings per share grew 27% to $8.20 from $6.46 in 2010. That's a $0.05 beat to our prior guidance of $8.15 per share from stronger-than-anticipated accretion from Timberland. Timberland contributed $0.60 per share in 2011 on an adjusted basis. That is excluding onetime costs. On a reported basis, Timberland's contribution was $0.38 per share. Organic earnings per share growth in 2011 was 18%. That is $7.60 versus the $6.46 reported in 2010, something we're quite proud of and well ahead of our long-term growth target of 12%.","And for the quarter, adjusted EPS rose by 30%. That's based on $2.32 per share versus $1.78 per share reported in the 2010 quarter. Timberland provided $0.34 accretion in the quarter, excluding $0.04 of acquisition expenses.","And now before moving on to our 2012 guidance, a few points related to our balance sheet and cash flow. Excluding Timberland, inventories were up 12%, with 9 percentage points of the increase due to higher product costs. Our balance sheet continues to be in excellent shape. As expected, we did generate sufficient cash by year end 2011 to pay down the commercial paper borrowings related to the Timberland acquisition. The remaining short-term borrowings on the year-end balance sheet support current working capital needs. And from a cash generation standpoint, 2011 marked another very strong year. In fact, our cash generated at $1,081,000,000 was a new record high. ","Okay. So let's review our guidance for 2012 and our plans to deliver another year of double-digit revenues and earnings growth to our shareholders.  Revenues are expected to increase 15%, or 17% in constant dollars. A note here. We are putting a particular emphasis on constant dollar amounts in our discussions related to 2012 given the headwinds presented by foreign currency translation for the year.","As you know, our biggest exposure is to the euro and for planning purposes, we are using a 1.25 rate for 2012. Given where the euro is today, that would indicate some upside. To answer your question in advance, every 5-point movement in the euro is equivalent to about $100 million in revenue and equal to approximately $0.18 per share.","Timberland should contribute about $1 billion to revenue growth this year. That's on a reported basis, or $1,050,000,000 on a constant dollar basis. You'll hear more about our plans for Timberland from Steve Rendle and Karl Heinz in just a minute. In constant dollars, excluding Timberland in both 2011 and 2012, revenues should rise by 8%, which is pretty close to our target for organic revenue growth of 10%. We realize there's still a lot of uncertainty out there related to economic conditions both here and abroad, so we're taking what we think is an appropriately cautious approach to our guidance this year.","Now following all the concern and discussions around gross margin in 2011, we're looking forward to getting back on track with gross margin expansion in 2012. In fact, we're looking for about 70 basis points of gross margin expansion over the 45.8% reported in 2011.","Now to be clear, as we discussed during our third quarter call, we'll continue to experience higher product costs through the first half of 2012, so that increase will all occur in the second half of the year.","Our operating margin in 2012 is targeted to improve, and that is despite higher pension costs, which will negatively impact our operating margin by 30 basis points. Timberland's operating margin should improve significantly in 2012 and could exceed 11%.","Excluding Timberland in both 2011 and 2012, VF's core operating margin should improve to about 14%, and that includes the 30 basis point negative impact from higher pension expense.","So we are pointing toward, once again, making great progress as we set our sights on achieving our 15% operating margin goal. ","Now wrapping up now with our earnings guidance, our target for adjusted earnings per share for 2012, again, that's excluding Timberland-related expenses, is approximately $9.30. That implies 13% growth over our adjusted EPS of $8.20 in 2011.","Talk about the puts and takes here. First, we expect $1.10 in adjusted earnings from Timberland, which is higher than our original estimate of $0.90 that we committed to when we first announced this great acquisition. Our experience has obviously been quite positive to date, and also, as detailed  in the release, our adjusted EPS guidance of $9.30 is held back by a $0.60 per share negative impact from foreign currency translation and higher pension expense.","In constant dollars and without the pension expense increase, adjusted EPS would be up 21% from the adjusted EPS of $8.20 in 2011. If you go a step further here and strip out Timberland from both 2011 and 2012, the growth in VF's core EPS, once again, excluding foreign currency exchange and pension impacts, would be 16% over VF's core EPS of $7.60 in 2011. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share are expected to increase 14% to approximately $9.10 per share from the $7.98 per share in 2011.","Let's talk for a moment about the cadence of our earnings per share results in 2011. There are a couple of significant factors that will impact our flow of earnings  this year. First, product cost reductions in our Jeanswear business will benefit gross margin starting in the third quarter. Up to that point, higher product costs will continue to pressure gross margin for Jeanswear and for VF in total, especially in Q1.","Next, Timberland is a highly seasonal business, with much stronger second half results than first. Historically, Timberland has recorded losses in their second quarter, and while we see their profitability continuing to improve, we expect the same for 2012 for this business.","Next, the FX impact will be biggest in the first and third quarters, which are the biggest quarters for our international business. And finally, the $0.19 increase in pension expense will be spread evenly across the 4 quarters.","So our earnings gains for 2012 will clearly be back half-loaded, but the second quarter being our most challenged earnings comparison. ","And finally, I should comment on our planned capital expenditures for 2012, which are expected to increase to $375 million. The good news here is that this higher level of spend is directly related to the success and growth that we're experiencing across our businesses. We'll be investing in new headquarter locations for our Outdoor & Action Sports businesses both in the U.S. as well as in Europe, new distribution centers across the globe and continued store growth investments that we're more than happy to fund.","In summary, 2011 has been a year like no other for VF, marked by tremendous momentum across our brands and around the world, capped by the transformational acquisition of Timberland. We look forward to delivering another strong year in 2012 and remain confident in our ability to achieve our long-term revenue and earnings growth objectives.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Steve Rendle.","Steven E. Rendle","Thank you, Bob. On our third quarter call, I emphasized the momentum that our global Outdoor & Action Sports business continues to build, a momentum we're particularly proud of as  we finish out a record year and enter 2012 with our strongest portfolio ever. Our fourth quarter and full year results demonstrates the investments we continue to make in our brands, our infrastructure and our ability to connect with consumers is contributing to a very exciting long-term growth story.","Clearly, our results for both the quarter and year benefited tremendously from the Timberland acquisition, but we're just as excited about the organic growth we achieved during both periods.","Excluding Timberland and SmartWool, our core Outdoor & Action Sports Americas revenues grew near 20% in the fourth quarter, including double-digit revenue increases from The North Face, Vans, lucy and Reef. For the full year, again excluding Timberland and SmartWool, our Outdoor & Action Sports Americas revenues grew nearly 15%, with solid growth achieved at The North Face, Vans, JanSport, lucy and Reef. ","Taking a quick look at some of the brand highlights, it's easy to understand why we believe 2012 will be another great year for us. Starting with The North Face. As Eric mentioned in his opening remarks, the brand showed amazing resilience in the fourth quarter in the face of unusually warm weather, with a 22% increase in global revenues. In fact, The North Face Americas fourth quarter revenue growth was the strongest we've seen all year and included strong double-digit d-to-c growth in both retail and e-commerce channels, as well as mid-teen increases in our wholesale business.","For the year, The North Face Americas revenue growth finished ahead of our global 5-year compounded growth goal of 16%. And as noted on our last call, spring 2012 bookings for The North Face were up 15% globally, and although early, we're encouraged by what we see for fall.","As the #1 outdoor brand both in the U.S. and globally, the success of The North Face is due to our continued sharp focus on executing against our activity-based strategy. This model is driven by industry-leading product innovation that is athlete-tested and expedition-proven. In 2012, product innovation takes a dramatic leap forward with 4 technologies. Two examples include our revolutionary Flash Dry apparel, which works with your body to regulate its temperature by accelerating moisture removal and dramatically improving dry time; and our new Cradle  cushioned footwear, which equips elite athletes with maximum stability and comfort, for any foot, on any terrain.","In summary, The North Face is looking forward to another great year of record revenues. On a worldwide basis, in 2012, we're targeting mid-teen revenue growth and remain on track to achieve our goal of $3 billion in total sales by 2015.","Turning now to Vans. Vans also had a tremendous year with ongoing investments, including further retail expansion, grassroot marketing efforts targeted at influential consumers and athletes and a heightened social media presence. Our efforts are clearly working. Fourth quarter global Vans revenues saw  25% revenue growth, with a double-digit increase in our Americas business, and that growth was well balanced with gains in all channels, including U.S. retail, wholesale and e-commerce.","In fact, vans.com continues to break records with 28 million unique visitors in 2011. Social media is an important marketing tool for Vans, and our marketing work is paying off, with the brand's Facebook fans exceeding 4 million. For the full year, Vans Americas had double-digit growth that, I'm proud to say, helped push global revenues well past the $1 billion mark for the first time in the brand's 46-year history. This is a major achievement that we're all very proud of, so congratulations to Vans and the amazing team around the world, whose ability to stay authentic to the brand's consumers while driving growth continues to inspire generation after off-the-wall generation.","2012 promises to be another very strong year for Vans, with global revenues targeted to grow at a mid-teen rate. Going direct to consumers remains our greatest opportunity to showcase the Vans brand and products. We'll continue to activate the brand outside of its core West Coast market, building on the success of new stores in the Northeast regions added in 2011 and our rapidly growing e-commerce business.","Moving to Timberland and SmartWool, the fourth quarter marks the first full quarter of contribution from these high-potential brands, and we feel very good about their results. Globally, the Timberland brand achieved revenue growth of more than 10% in the fourth quarter, less than the very strong rate we saw in the third quarter, which is not surprising, considering the unfavorable weather conditions. SmartWool revenues grew 20% in the fourth quarter. We entered 2012 highly energized and ready to take full advantage of VF's resources to do what we do best, position both brands for healthy, sustainable and profitable growth. These are still early days for Timberland within VF, and we have much to do to realize the full potential of these great outdoor brands. ","Our 2012 to-do list is extensive. First, we'll be supercharging Timberland's product engine for maximum innovation. Second, we'll continue to align Timberland's financial and planning processes with those of VF to ensure clear visibility into current and future business performance. Third, we're working on a comprehensive global technology integration plan to support growth while minimizing business risk. And last but not least, we'll continue to assess and adjust Timberland's wholesale distribution to build the strongest possible connection between the brand and its outdoor-inspired consumers.","Looking more immediately at 2012, we're targeting low single-digit global revenue growth for the combined Timberland and SmartWool business, but that doesn't tell the whole story. In constant dollars, the growth increases to a mid-single-digit rate, and if you take into account the impact of some highly targeted and strategic business exits to improve Timberland's distribution, we're looking at a high-single-digit growth rate for the year.","We're fully cognizant of the fact this is below our 5-year compounded growth rate of 10%, but it will take time to fully activate all of the growth opportunities and synergies envisioned in our 5-year plan. For example, 1\/3 of the year -- of the 5-year revenue target for Timberland is slated to come from our U.S. apparel launch, which won't take place until fall 2013. ","And to add some additional context, I see many parallels to our early days with The North Face. Purchased in 2000, for the first 2 years, The North Face revenues remained relatively stable as we worked through distribution and operational issues. And as we all know, the rest is history.","Today, we are fortunate to have 2 brands, the North Face and Timberland, with combined revenues of roughly $3.5 billion, who are both passionately committed to embedding sustainability across their products and operations.","As authentic outdoor brands, both The North Face and Timberland understand the importance of getting consumers outside to enjoy and appreciate the environment and to protect and conserve it for future generations.","Before I conclude my comments, I also want to acknowledge great performances from lucy and Reef. On our last call, I noted that we are very well positioned to capitalize on lucy's potential given the success of new product introductions, strengthened  revenue trends and improved store profitability. I'm happy to report that lucy had a record year, with healthy double-digit profitable growth, and we anticipate even stronger results in 2012. In fact, we have amazing new products that are hitting the stores right now, and early indications are very positive. And finally, Reef. Another story of strong double-digit growth, profitable revenue growth, with another great year planned for 2012. ","In summary, a terrific finish to 2011, and as noted in today's release, we're looking forward to delivering another solid year of growth for our Outdoor & Action Sports business.","Now I'll turn the call over to Karl Heinz, who will take you through our international results.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Thank you, Steve. On our last call, I mentioned that VF's 2011 international business was shaping up to be the strongest I had seen in my 12-year career with the company. Today, I'm happy to say that is, in fact, the case. With 20% organic growth in constant currency revenues, including double-digit increases in Europe, Asia and India, growth across nearly every brand in our portfolio and significant gains in our direct-to-consumer business, 2011 was a record year for our international business. ","My review of our businesses today will focus on results in constant dollars. In Europe, each of our 3 businesses, Outdoor & Action Sports, Sportswear and Contemporary and Jeanswear, achieved organic revenue growth in both the fourth quarter and full year. Taking a deeper dive into our European Outdoor & Action Sports business, excluding Timberland and SmartWool, we achieved revenue growth of over 25% in both the fourth quarter and full year, driven by tremendous momentum at Vans, where revenues grew more than 50% in both periods. Spring bookings support another strong year in 2012 as well. The North Face also enjoyed a strong finish to 2011, with a double-digit revenue increase in the fourth quarter and nearly 20% growth for the full year. The momentum continues here as well, with solid spring 2012 bookings pointing to another strong year.","I would also like to congratulate the Vans team in Europe, whose passion for the brand and hard work contributed to growth well above the 24% revenue increase that Steve referenced earlier.","In their first full quarter as part of our portfolio, Timberland and SmartWool Europe enjoyed very healthy growth. For the full fourth quarter period, revenues increased at the mid-teen rate. Timberland is now the largest brand in our European portfolio, and while market conditions are still difficult across Southern Europe, long term, we are bullish on our growth prospects as we continue to expand Earthkeepers in both apparel and footwear and continue to build Timberland's overall apparel business.","Our European Sportswear and Contemporary Brands coalition achieved moderate growth in the fourth quarter with higher revenues in our Eastpak, Kipling and 7 For All Mankind brands. For the full year, European Sportswear and Contemporary Brands revenue rose 10%, and based on healthy booking to date, we believe this business could achieve similar growth in 2012 as well.","Taking a look at Jeanswear in Europe, we are pleased to report that the business grew in both the fourth quarter and full year, driven by the strength of our Lee brand. The best news here is that the work we have done behind the scenes to improve operating efficiencies is yielding significant improvement in our profitability.  Looking ahead to 2012, we expect continued modest Jeanswear growth in Europe as we navigate through today's challenging conditions.","I noted earlier that conditions are weak in southern Europe, particularly Italy. However, we remain cautiously optimistic as retailers continue to place priority and confidence in brands with proven sell-through strength, such as ours.","In summary, for 2012, given our current visibility and market conditions, we are targeting greater than 10% organic revenue growth in constant dollars for our European business. ","Let's now turn to Asia, a pillar of VF's growth story both today and in the future. Organic revenue growth in constant dollars in Asia was about 20% in the fourth quarter and over 30% for the year. For both periods, we achieved strong double-digit organic growth in nearly every brand.","China remains at the center of our long-term growth story. We are continuing to invest in consumer insight work that is enabling our brands to connect more strongly with local tastes and preferences. For The North Face, our work is concentrated around encouraging outdoor participation in a way that's relevant to Chinese consumers.","And with respect to Timberland, which is now our largest single brand in Asia, we are very excited about our long-term growth potential. VF has a strong, well established platform in China, which we are eager to leverage to enable Timberland's future growth. In fact, we expect to grow our Timberland business in Asia by more than 15% in '12.","India is another rapidly growing market for us, and you'll recall that in September, we acquired the minority interest in our joint venture there, with the business now operating as a wholly-owned subsidiary. Our growth in India remains strong, with full year revenue growth over 45% in constant dollars, and we are looking forward to a very strong year in 2012 as well.","We are very well positioned to continue the momentum across our brands in Asia. We have well established platforms in place encompassing 4 key categories: Jeans, Outdoor, Action Sports and Sportswear. 2012 should be another great year for us in Asia, with revenues growing more than 20%.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Scott Baxter,  who will take you through Jeanswear and Imagewear in the Americas.","Scott Baxter","Thank you, Karl Heinz, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with our Jeanswear America business first, which includes our Lee, Western Specialty and Mass businesses, and then discuss our Imagewear results. We entered 2011 with our key Jeanswear brands as strong and well positioned for growth as they have ever been, yet with the sharp rise in product costs you are all familiar with, we knew we faced a tough year and an unprecedented margin pressure. Accordingly, we went heads down and devised a short- and long-term plan to navigate through an environment, the likes of which we have never seen. We implemented strategic pricing actions to help mitigate costs while growing our retail floor space and market share. We elevated our product innovation agenda to ensure industry-leading style, construction and performance, and we supported our brands with strong, targeted demand-creation efforts, investing marketing dollars to forge even stronger connections with our consumers. So how did we do? We did well. The year ended on a strong note, with the fourth consecutive quarter of top line growth and full year revenues up with mid-single digits, with growth from all brands and geographies in our Jeanswear Americas business. As expected, profitability was hindered by exceptionally high raw material costs, and unit volume was impacted by price increases. Despite these challenges, our brands gained market share across all channels, mass, mid-tier and specialty.","Top line growth, profitability in line with our expectations and market share gains in arguably the toughest cost environment we've ever seen. I am very proud of the performance we achieved in 2011 and more importantly, how well positioned we are for continued success in 2012.","Now let's dig a little bit deeper. The Lee brand had a very strong year, with 8% growth in 2011. Our success was driven by new product innovation, such as the Lee Classic Fit and Premium Select lines, that helped drive our market share gains for this year. We have a very full agenda designed to drive solid top line growth, with new fit innovations in both men's and women's jeans and casual pants in mid-tier department stores. And speaking of mid-tier department stores, you'll recall that 2012 marks the launch of a new brand, Rock & Republic, as an exclusive with Kohl's in both men's and women's jeans. The launch takes place this weekend in all Kohl's stores and online. In fact, if you check out Kohl's website, you'll see that the product is already available. This launch will be supported by a major national advertising campaign, including Rock & Republic TV and print ads, plus an online and social media campaign.","We're very excited about the long-term opportunity for this brand and another great example of our ability to identify and add compelling new brands to our portfolio and leverage them for success with our retail partners. Our Western Specialty business delivered 10% growth in 2011, led by continued momentum in our new and innovative Cowboy Cut, Western and women's fashion bottom styles. And in terms of our Mass business, having successfully navigated through pricing actions in the most price-sensitive channel of our Jeanswear business, the Mass Market, a flat revenue and performance in 2011 should be construed as a successful demonstration of our ability to manage our business well regardless of the environment.  Add on to that the fact that we gained market share in both our Wrangler and Riders by Lee brands, and you'll understand why we're proud of our performance this year.","Internationally, we enjoyed another double-digit revenue growth quarter and year in all 3 of our major Americas geographies: Latin America, Mexico and Canada. Looking at 2012, we expect to see a strong year in our Jeanswear Americas business with solid top and bottom line growth and continued market share gains in all 3 of our businesses: Lee, Western Specialty and Mass.","We're looking forward to revenue growth this year. However, 2012 is a tale of 2 halves. While the cost of denim purchases peaked in the second half of 2011, the negative impact will continue to work through our P&L in 2012. Accordingly, the first quarter of 2012 will be characterized by lower gross margins than the exceptionally strong first quarter of 2011, then we expect margins to stabilize in the second quarter and improve in the second half of 2012.","Switching gears, I'll now touch briefly on our Imagewear results. I'm happy to report that with a revenue increase of 10% for the fourth quarter and 13% for the year, our Imagewear coalition passed the $1 billion threshold for the first time.","Our protective apparel business, powered by the Bulwark brand, had an outstanding fourth quarter, which, along with Red Kap, drove our image -- or uniform business up nearly 20% revenues for the full year. In our Licensed Sports Group, we saw great results from our NFL business, which was up nearly 30%, contributing to a 6% increase in the overall Licensed Sports Group revenue for the full year.","In terms of 2012, we are confident that we can maintain positive momentum in both businesses and are targeting a mid-single-digit growth rate for the Imagewear coalition revenues. Next, we have Karen Murray, who will take us through the Sportswear business.","Karen Murray","Thank you, Scott. Our Sportswear coalition, which consists of the Nautica brand and Kipling's U.S. business, performed very well in 2011, growing total revenues by 9%. Here's a quick recap of some highlights for both of these brands in the fourth quarter and full year, starting with Nautica. Nautica ended the year with revenues up 5%, including gains In our Sportswear license and outlet businesses. We've been working hard to evolve our product offering to a more differentiated, performance-based positioning around water, the core of the Nautica brand, and it's working, with our momentum building with our biggest retail partner and consumers. We're also telling our product stories more effectively, particularly online, with a new fully refreshed and integrated website. Our brand connection with consumers is strengthening as well. Our YouTube holiday ad generated over 1 million views. In addition, we saw a significant increase in Facebook fans in 2011, and most importantly, we are engaging with these fans and driving meaningful traffic to nautica.com.","Nautica is truly a global brand, sold in over 75 countries and in 155 freestanding stores. Our international business is licensed, and the strength of the brand is evidenced by the 30% increase in international retail sales in our key markets in 2011 and over 1,200 points of sale. Nautica's outlet business continues its turnaround, ending the year with comps up at a mid-single-digit rate. The growth is due directly to successful test concepts we've executed at our highest volume locations, where we've worked to reset the consumer experience, updated our store navigation and appearance and most importantly, improved the store allocation process. We're looking forward to continuing this momentum in 2012.","Now onto Kipling, a fast-growing and very profitable success story in the United States, particularly since we joined forces with Macy's as our exclusive department store partner for handbags in 2010. Kipling achieved 49% revenue growth in the quarter and 56% growth for the full year. We're currently in 420 Macy's doors. Additional door expansion in 2012 and increased penetration, coupled with a growing direct-to-consumer business, should fuel another year of exceptional growth for Kipling in the U.S."," ","To sum up, the Sportswear coalition is well positioned to grow revenues at a mid-single-digit rate in 2012, with gains in both our Nautica and Kipling brands, and we're planning improved profitability as we, too, begin to benefit from lower product costs.","Now my colleague, Susan Kellogg, will take you through Contemporary Brands.","Susan Kellogg","Thanks, Karen. We're in the homestretch. Our Contemporary Brands coalition, which consists of 7 For All Mankind, Splendid, Ella Moss and John Varvatos, saw growth across all brands in the fourth quarter, with global revenues up 12% and full year revenues up 11%. We continue to improve the profitability of our coalition with positive operating comparisons in both the quarter and for the year.","7 For All Mankind achieved mid-single-digit growth in the fourth quarter, driven by increases in DTC business. In fact, our Americas business saw  mid-single-digit comp growth in our U.S. retail stores and nearly 30% increased  online revenue.  For the year, the brand continues to grow both in the U.S. and in Europe, fueled by DTC revenues that increased almost 40%.","Looking forward to spring, be on the lookout for 7 For All Mankind's new ad campaign shot by Oscar-nominated actor James Franco. The campaign, which features both print and video, rolls out this week and really elevates our brand story to a uniquely fresh, California-inspired style. Together with future innovations in fit, fabric and finish, we're feeling great about 7 For All Mankind's brand outlook for 2012.","Our Splendid and Ella Moss brands continued to experience tremendous growth, with fourth quarter and full year revenues each rising in excess of 20%. In 2011, wholesale revenues grew at a mid-teen rate, and our DTC business nearly doubled with the addition of 6 new stores and rapid growth in our e-com business. We're barely scratching the surface of this potential of these 2 brands, and we're excited about the outlook for 2012 as well.","Innovation is what drives and it takes to win Contemporary, and we're driving more innovation than ever before across all of our brands, particularly with emphasis on color and fabric. Supported by marketing investments and continued DTC expansion in 2012, the global Contemporary Brands coalition is working and looking forward to a year of healthy, mid-single-digit growth combined with our substantial increase in profitability. And with that, we conclude today's comments and turn it back over to the operator to open up for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And for our first question, we go to Michael Binetti with UBS.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So, I might have missed it. Did you guys give  North Face and Vans bookings yet on the call?","Unknown Executive","What's the question?","Eric C. Wiseman","Is that a question about fall 2012 bookings?","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I just wanted to see if we can get an update on what the bookings are for  North Face and Vans right now.","Steven E. Rendle","Yes, well, we spoke about The North Face bookings for spring, which we did mention on our third quarter call, up 15% globally. But in case of fall, it's too early to call. We're very encouraged, but our teams are all actually in the field continuing to sell with our wholesale dealer partners. It's something we'd update you in our Q1 call.","Michael Binetti - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Obviously, that was a volatile winter for those guys. Do you have any better visibility on Vans bookings for the fall yet?","Steven E. Rendle","No, we don't. They actually come in slightly later than our other business.","Operator","And for our next question, we go to Jim Duffy with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions around Timberland. The accretion for '12 is projected ahead of original plans, though the revenue outlook doesn't appear any more aggressive. Where is the incremental margin benefit that you're finding?","Robert K. Shearer","Jim, it's actually in a couple of places. In the gross margin as well as in the expense levels, you might notice that we're going to spend just a little bit more than we previously indicated, and of course, that's giving us nice benefits in terms of the operating margin. So we're seeing some stronger opportunities in the gross margin, and we're realizing those. And also, relative to the expense reduction, meaning SG&A reductions, we've seen a little bit more opportunity there as well. So it's really in both of those areas that's driving the improved profitability over our initial guidance.","Jim Duffy - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And Timberland's clearly tracking quite well. It's a bigger acquisition than you've done in the past. At what point do you see the organization ready to take on another acquisition of any size? Can you guys, at this juncture, be a serious bidder for any properties that might come to market near term?","Eric C. Wiseman","Yes, Jim, it's Eric, obviously, we have the capacity to be engaged right now in additional acquisition activities, both financial capacity and organization resource capacity. Something the size of Timberland, probably unlikely in the next 12 months. There aren't a lot of opportunities that are that big out there, but we remain active as always and continuing  relationships and discussions around future opportunities.","Operator","And we go next to Joseph Parkhill with Morgan Stanley.","Joseph Parkhill - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just also wanted to ask about Timberland. I think there's a lot of opportunity for you to improve retail operating margins there. But I was wondering if that improvement is dependent on improving the apparel offering, so that really won't come until after 2013, or is there something that you can do in the meantime to improve profitability at retail?","Steven E. Rendle","You're absolutely right, Joe, that the serious improvement will come as we start to introduce apparel, but we do see opportunities to improve this year. In fact, we have a very talented team of both Timberland and VF outdoor retail expertise focused on our direct-to-consumer channel operationally, as well as looking to merchandising strategy to bring improvement in this year.","Joseph Parkhill - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And if I could just ask some quick modeling questions, I was wondering if you could quantify the impact of the onetime charge in Jeanswear. Also, give your tax rate that you expect in 2012 and what your plan for marketing is as a percentage of sales.","Robert K. Shearer","Sure, Joe. All in, the impact of that charge was -- really, the Jeanswear was 40 or 50 basis points. So again, it accounted for most of the difference in terms of what we guided toward. And the tax rate for 2012, 25% to 25.5% is what we're planning.","Joseph Parkhill - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Great. And your marketing?","Robert K. Shearer","Marketing spend should -- will stay relatively stable as a percent of overall revenues, which was right at about 5.7% in 2011, 5.7% of revenues.","Operator","For our next question, we go to Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two quick questions. I was hoping Scott could talk about the average -- looking back at 2011, what the average ASP in Jeanswear looked like in both U.S. and Europe and then maybe thoughts on holding that as costs come down in the back half and into 2013. And the second question, I was hoping you guys could give a little more detail on the Vans outlook for 2012. Two things. Can you tell us how many doors you have in China and how many more doors you hope to add in 2012, or remind us that, and then the mix of growth for Vans in 2012, sort of China versus Europe versus U.S. I know there's a lot there, but I appreciate the help.","Scott Baxter","It's Scott. Robby, I'm going to go ahead and answer the first part of the first question, and then I'll have Karl Heinz address the European part of the question. But as expected, Robby, 2011 came in as expected and flow-through as expected. And 2012, we feel real good about our plans, feel real confident we're going to be able to hold our AURs. And we're seeing those trends all the way through January right now, and we feel real good about what's going on for the rest of the year. So as expected in '11 and feel good about '12.","Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And was it some sort of a single-digit or double-digit AUR increase?","Scott Baxter","Double-digit.","Robert K. Shearer","In 2011, you're saying?","Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes.","Robert K. Shearer","Yes, on average, it was. It was right around 10% overall in the U.S. Jeans business, right.","Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then how did Europe look on that?","Eric C. Wiseman","Jeans have price increases in Europe.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Yes. Karl Heinz here, Robby. Jeans, we had some price increases in Europe in the lower, around mid-teens. On the second question, the China doors, we said we have about 1,700 doors, which we ended up in 2011, and we plan to open 500 -- around 550 doors, which would bring us to around 2,250. Now to put this in perspective, this is 2,200 doors with 4 main brands: The North Face, Vans, Kipling and our Jeans business. And if we benchmark that to what -- presence, is a meaningful presence in China, we see some competitors, large companies having around 5,000 to 6,000 doors.","Eric C. Wiseman","Per brand.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Per brand, per single brand.","Robert F. Ohmes - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And can you give me just the Vans breakout on that?","Karl Heinz Salzburger","We did say in our announcement we expect Vans to grow about in the mid-teens for 2012.","Operator","And for our next question, we go to Mitch Kummetz with Robert Baird.","Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Bob, let me start with you. In terms of your gross margin guidance for this year, up 70 basis points, a couple of things. Can you break that down by puts and takes in terms of what do you expect in terms of sort of basis point increases, decreases on costs, pricing, mix and FX? And then you've also said that you expect the improvement to come in the back half. Should I assume that means flat to down in the first half? And then I have a follow-up.","Robert K. Shearer","Okay, relative to the gross margin percentage, in terms of the puts and takes, I think is what you asked. What we're seeing there, Mitch, is just as we've been seeing over the past couple of years. Most of the improvement that we expect to see is from mix, right? So in 2011, we gained about 80 points from mix, and when I talk about mix, it's higher revenues in our Outdoor & Action Sports businesses. In retail, on the international side, becoming a bigger piece of the overall business. And  I referenced that in my comments. So again, most of that improvement comes from the mix side. Relative to cost and pricing, what we're seeing there, it's relatively neutral. It could be a little bit of upside from prices exceeding cost increases. Obviously, we're not looking for the same kind of cost increases that we saw in 2011, substantially less. But overall, relatively a neutral impact from pricing, net of costs. And the other question was?","Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Gross margin first half versus second half.","Robert K. Shearer","Gross margin first half, second half. Clearly, what we'll see is in the first quarter, our gross margins, we expect still to be below the prior year's first quarter. I'd remind you there that in the first quarter of 2011, it was a really good quarter for us, and part of that was that we bought a lot of denim well in advance, right? So we carried low-cost denim into the early part of 2011, really benefited from that. So clearly, the toughest comparison will be in the first quarter of the year, and we do expect our gross margins to be down. It could be about 100 basis points. In the second quarter, we expect the gross margins then to flatten out. That's where we really see the stabilization. Third quarter, improvement, up obviously, and then the fourth quarter, more improvement over the third quarter.","Mitchel J. Kummetz - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then my follow-up, on your sales outlook for the year, 8% constant dollar or 6% reported dollar growth, again, can you talk a little bit how you expect that to play out first half, second half? Should I assume maybe stronger growth on a year-over-year basis, percentage-wise, in the first half or at least better visibility on that first half growth at this point, not knowing how your prebooks are coming in for fall just yet?","Robert K. Shearer","Not really. Actually, first half versus second half, and of course, I'll speak to the core business, right, Timberland is a different story for the subperiod. But speaking to the core business, actually, first half, second half, we expect the top line growth to be relatively even, maybe a little stronger in the second half but not a lot stronger. But the point is what's happening here is that as our business -- especially with Timberland and the growth in Outdoor & Action Sports, the seasonality of our business continues to change. So the first half is becoming a little bit less than it has been in the past, and that's particularly so with Timberland, as you probably know. The second quarter, for example, in Timberland is less than 15% of their total year. So again, all of that impacts the overall seasonality.","Operator","We go next to Kate McShane with Citi Investment Research.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wondered, Steve, if you could walk us through a little bit with what has been done with the Timberland brand so far in the U.S. I wondered if there had been a notable increase in distribution of some of the smaller brands like nonathletic and Earthkeepers so far, or is that still yet to come in 2012?","Steven E. Rendle","Sure, Kate. From a product distribution, the classics part of the Timberland merchandise mix continues to be important, but the major, major emphasis previous and now within VF is the Earthkeepers collection and what that means, not just to the footwear product but to the overall brand and its brand strategy. I will tell you there's a heightened focus on our wholesale\/retail partnerships. The team has been extremely diligent over the last couple of months, meeting with and beginning to update and set strategies in motion to start to drive growth not only this year but to build the base for the years to come.","Kate McShane - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And the operating margin you reported for Timberland of 9%, was this for the year or the quarter? And whatever the case, I'm just wondering if you could, again, highlight what the pressure was on the operating income margin this year versus last year despite some of the synergies.","Robert K. Shearer","Yes, the 9% for Timberland, Kate, was in the fourth quarter. And by the way, that's adjusted for the onetime costs. So it was only the quarter. On a full year, it was stronger than that, including the subperiod or the short period in the month of September. Overall there, on a full year basis, it was more like 12%, again, adjusted. In terms of the pressures on the margin, costs, just as we've been seeing in our businesses, product cost increases created some challenges to the Timberland team in 2011, for sure. So not really so different.","Operator","We go next to John Kernan with Cowen and Company.","John D. Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I'm wondering if you could quantify the net unit growth for Timberland in terms of retail next year. I think in the press release, it said half of the 130 stores would be from Timberland. And then the geographic mix of that square footage growth for Timberland.","Eric C. Wiseman","Actually, John, we don't break out our store growth targets by brand. We did say that of the 130 stores next year, over half of them are coming from our Outdoor & Action Sports brands combined globally, but we haven't in the past and don't give, by brand, store numbers. Sorry.","John D. Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. A little bit more on capital allocation next year. Obviously, the CapEx is coming in a little bit higher than we expected due to some headquarters and DC growth. But can you give us a sense as to what, I guess, the balance sheet's going to look like? You paid off almost $900 million of commercial paper in Q4. How do we look in terms of share repurchases?  It sounds like you're still open to making an acquisition. And then in terms of the -- more in terms of the balance sheet, what is your guidance for interest expense next year, or in 2012, I should say?","Robert K. Shearer","Well, that's a lot. Okay, I hope I hit them all. In terms of the balance sheet, commercial paper, the $280 million or so, at the end of the year, we'd expect to pay that down, obviously. We indicated in the release that we expect another year of very, very strong cash generation. So we'd pay the CP down. That would be our plan. In terms of the buyback that you asked about, we did not buy any shares back in 2011 because of the acquisition, but in 2012, we expect to resume our practice of offsetting the impact of option exercises. That would indicate buying back about 2 million shares. That's what's included in our plan on a full year basis. And the interest guidance for the year is about $90 million.","John D. Kernan - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then one follow-up question. I think I heard Karl Heinz Salzburger say -- guides a 10% organic rev growth in Europe. What does that imply for organic growth in North America for the year, for 2012?","Robert K. Shearer","I mean, there's a lot of different factors there. We have Asia as well, but what we said overall was 8% in Europe. This is about 20% of our total business.","Operator","We go next to Robert Drbul with Barclays Capital.","Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess I want to focus on The North Face a little bit more, just on the outlook for The North Face. So I think you said mid-teens expectation for this year. Can you elaborate a little bit sort of in North America and Europe and the visibility around the expectations? I guess what I'm interested in is given the warm weather and the inventory levels at retail, just sort of what you're seeing on the order book and sort of how we should think about it geographically a little bit.","Steven E. Rendle","Robert, this is Steve Rendle. North Face America, specifically, mentioned that our spring order book globally was up in the mid-teens, and that absolutely holds true for here in the Americas. Our teams are currently in the process of collecting our fall order book. I mentioned that we're extremely encouraged. Yes, our outdoor industry is coming out of a very difficult fourth quarter. Specifically, December was down 2% from an industry sell-through standpoint. I can tell you that our North Face business was positive, and  was one of the leading brands from a sell-through standpoint in the industry. And as we've seen over the last few years, it's further consolidation around those brands that deliver very high product price value, and we're very confident what we will see for the balance of the year.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Yes, this is Karl Heinz. Let me start with Asia first. In Asia, we see The North Face as strong as ever. We're a little bit -- we have visibility on the fall bookings, and we can confirm that they will be as strong as we always had in the past. Europe is a little bit more different. Europe, there's a general trend in the market, as you mentioned before. We had a very late winter coming. We have a lot of snow now, but that caused a delay in the order intake process, not only for us but the entire industry. But we are confident to continue to grow in Europe as well based on strong spring bookings, and it's a little bit too early to say how fall would evolve. But again, the entire industry is a little bit later this year.","Robert S. Drbul - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then my second question is on Timberland. I think, Bob, the original cost synergy number was $35 million, and I think that you originally said maybe $0.90 of accretion for '12, and this year, it's $1.10. Can you just give us an update in terms of the cost synergy side, sort of what's embedded in the accretion numbers that you've provided us today for 2012?","Robert K. Shearer","Yes, sure, Bob. It's obviously more than that, right? So we've identified more opportunities. Remember, those are very early numbers, and you're exactly right. We indicated $35 million, and we're running at a rate that will be above that by $10 million or $15 million. So that is part of the increase in the accretion that you mentioned, the $1.10 versus the $0.90, as I said earlier on the call. Another factor, however, where we are seeing opportunity is in the gross margin area as well. It's a little more than we originally anticipated. Actually, in both areas, we're seeing some positive signs, and both are contributing to the higher accretion.","Operator","We go next to Omar Saad with the ISI Group.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","To follow up on the Timberland discussion, you saw a little bit of the impact in the margin in the outdoor business, I think on the fact that Timberland is a lower-margin business. And I just wanted to kind of get your views. Is it structurally lower-margin business because it's footwear, or do you expect that, over the long-term, you should be able to get that Timberland margin up to more where  your corporate average is, obviously, is one of the best in the industry. And then I have a follow-up, too.","Robert K. Shearer","Omar, we committed to 15% operating margin on Timberland by 2015. What we also indicated, when we issued our initial guidance, we said that there was opportunity beyond that, to the 18% level, pretty specifically, is what we said. Just as we said when we did the acquisition, the point that I always made was we looked at the gross margin. The gross margins are really strong, and as I just said on an earlier response, we continue to see opportunities in those gross margins. And we think that, that really does speak a lot to the strength of the brand. So no, the answer is there are no inherent or fundamental areas of concern or differences that we see relative to the model for Timberland versus the rest of our outdoor businesses. Steve, anything to add there?","Steven E. Rendle","Yes, Omar, we do see opportunity over time, as the apparel launch comes live in fall 2013 and beyond, to see a benefit to getting a higher mix of apparel.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","And Omar, if I may add, Timberland has a very strong retail presence in Europe and Asia, which will further also improve the gross margins.","Omar Saad - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I understand. And then could you also talk about -- I thought I heard a comment in the prepared remarks about changing the outdoor -- new outdoor headquarters in Europe and the U.S. Are you changing the way the business is -- operationally is organized and where the different brands are located?","Eric C. Wiseman","No, we're not changing where anybody is located or how the businesses are configured. As you would imagine, the buildings that we're in, we've been in the one in California for over a decade and the one in Lugano for 6 or 7 years, and we have outgrown that space. So it's simply -- it is a growth-driven need for more space. That's it.","Operator","We go next to Ken Stumphauzer with Sterne Agee.","Kenneth M. Stumphauzer - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","First, Bob, I just wanted to touch on 2Q. Timberland obviously suffers a loss in 2Q, and I'm wondering if you could help us think through the magnitude of what that could mean for VF as a corporation. Would it be safe to assume that kind of the organic or the core EBIT grows 10% and then you layer on the loss you typically see for Timberland, and as such, maybe earnings could be around $1? Or is that too negative of an assumption?","Robert K. Shearer","Yes, I mean, it's just way too early to comment, Ken, on the second quarter. That's why we've kind of talked more about the first half. I can tell you this, though. I mean, you're absolutely on the right track relative to Timberland. You're right. I mean, historically, Timberland has incurred a loss in the second quarter of the year, and I've commented earlier on the seasonality of their business. So that obviously is going to be a hurdle for us. And could we be down quarter-over-quarter because of Timberland? Well, sure. It's a fairly significant amount. In 2011, for example, Timberland lost, I believe, $30 million-plus in the second quarter. So while we're improving the business and may not be quite there, still, that's a fairly significant hurdle for us in the second quarter.","Kenneth M. Stumphauzer - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, Steve, I was just wondering if I could ask you about The North Face and kind of what 4Q could potentially mean for 1Q. It looks like you guys came out of 4Q with actually pretty clean inventories. Do you feel like that's the case at retail given the warm weather? And if that's not the case, is there the potential for sales in 1Q to be a little bit light given the lack of replenishment?","Steven E. Rendle","Yes, Ken, we have follow-up on some of the discussions we had at the outdoor retailer show.","We did come through fourth quarter really well. We talked about the need to see cold weather arrive across the U.S. to start to drive that positive sell-through, and fortunately, it did come. We got cold weather. We didn't necessarily get cold, snowy weather, but with those colder temperatures, we have seen an increase in sell-through, giving us confidence for not only the quarter but for what that means for the full year.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","And Ken, we experienced a similar situation in Europe. Winter came -- it came late, but it helped us tremendously.","Operator","We go next to Michelle Tan with Goldman Sachs.","Michelle Tan - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I was wondering -- it's really helpful to understand how you guys are thinking about the margin opportunity, long term, for Timberland. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the market opportunity from a top line perspective. I think, Steve, you mentioned The North Face experience and the acquisition there, but clearly, Timberland is a much bigger business today than North Face was when you bought it. So I was wondering if you could help us with a little more detail on what kind of big opportunities you see to expand the top line over time. What are the big kind of holes in the business?","Steven E. Rendle","Absolutely. Michelle, from an Americas standpoint, and then Karl Heinz can fill you in on the international piece, the opportunities that we see, and we've been really forthright from the beginning, is to just continue to expand the distribution opportunities for footwear, first and foremost, building behind the Earthkeepers strategy that the brand has in place. We do see great opportunity with apparel. That's one of the synergies that we believe we will bring and be able to really help that team not only vision the apparel assortment but certainly produce it in a way that will be very positive. We see great opportunities with our direct-to-consumer channel, both the in-store experience, which will help us tell that brand story, which will certainly help expand the brand over time, but the digital aspect of the brand driving not only the content but the commerce piece. So I think it's a combination of those elements that we see driving growth over the long term.","Karl Heinz Salzburger","Yes, Michelle, it's very similar for us in Europe and Asia. I guess the only change is, we already have -- Timberland has a very well-developed apparel program, which is doing extremely well, especially in Asia, with a component between -- the ratio between apparel and footwear is nearly 50-50. So Earthkeepers in Europe resonates extremely well with consumers, and we are expanding that into more product categories, into apparel as well.","Michelle Tan - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And is there a benchmark kind of thing you point to, whether it's another brand or another business that says, hey, this is how big we think it can be, or is it just too kind of soon or too early in the strategy rollout to say that?","Steven E. Rendle","No, I think we see, Michelle, some real similarities to our North Face business, which is heavily weighted to the apparel and equipment side and the footwear growing. But we see an opportunity to tell a very clear outdoor message, maybe not to the same technical level of The North Face but absolutely building on that New England outdoor heritage and building both footwear and apparel through wholesale and direct-to-consumer.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to return the conference to Mr. Wiseman for any closing remarks.","Eric C. Wiseman","Just thank all of you for your time and your interest and your questions. 2011 was a record year for VF Corporation in just about every way. And as we approach 2012, we expect to do significantly better despite headwinds from pension and foreign currency translation and uncertain economic environment.

Corporation Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2019 Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now pleasure to introduce your host, Joe Alkire, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Joe Alkire","Good morning, and welcome to V.F. Corporation's fourth quarter fiscal 2019 earnings call. Participants on today's call will make forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These uncertainties are detailed in documents filed regularly with the SEC. Unless otherwise noted, amounts referred to on today's call will be on an adjusted constant dollar basis, excluding Kontoor Brands, which we define in the press release that was issued this morning. In the context of VF's review of its fiscal 2019 results, excluding Kontoor Brands amounts exclude the results of VF\u2019s Jeans reportable segment, Wrangler RIGGS brand and VF Outlet business. The results are not indicative of the results of Kontoor Brands as a standalone entity, and are not representative of VF\u2019s discontinued operations view of consolidated results after the separation of Kontoor Brands is complete.","In addition, the release provides adjusted fiscal 2020 outlook information reflecting management\u2019s best estimates of the impact the separation of Kontoor Brands may have on VF\u2019s fiscal 2019 financial information and fiscal 2020 outlook on a discontinued operations basis, along with other adjustments. VF\u2019s analysis of the separation of Kontoor Brands has not been completed and is subject to change.","We use adjusted constant dollar amounts excluding Kontoor Brands as lead numbers in our discussion because we believe they more accurately represent the true operational performance and underlying results of our business post to separation of Kontoor Brands. You may also hear us refer to reported amounts which are in accordance with US GAAP. Reconciliations of GAAP measures to adjusted amounts can be found in the supplemental financial tables included in the press release, which identify and quantify all excluded items and provide management's view of why this information is useful to investors.","In connection with a distribution date of May 22, 2019, VF will file its current report on Form 8-K, no later than May 29, 2019, which will include supplemental financial information on VF, illustrating Kontoor Brands on a discontinued operations basis under U.S. GAAP for certain historical periods.","During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company completed the sale of its Nautica brand business. During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company completed the sale of its Licensed Sports Group or LSG business. In conjunction with the LSG divestiture, VF executed its plan to exit the licensing business and completed the sale of the assets of the JanSport brand collegiate business in the fourth quarter of 2017. Accordingly, the Company has included the operating results of these businesses in discontinued operations to their respective dates of sale. Unless otherwise noted, results presented on today's call are based on continuing operations.","Joining me on today's call will be VF's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Steve Rendle; and Chief Financial Officer, Scott Roe. Following our prepared remarks, we will open the call for questions. Steve?","Steven Rendle","Thank you, Joe, and good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2019 represented one of the most transformative periods in VF's 120-year history, culminating with the tax-free spin-off of Kontoor Brands. The actions we took last year are just further milestones along the path we laid out in Boston two years ago. Since that time, we broadly reshaped our portfolio, placed significant investments in key capabilities, accelerated growth in our largest brands, delivered sound fundamentals with gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage and returned $3 billion to shareholders and all through a purpose driven lens. It has been a bust two years.","We made significant strides this year and we\u2019re steadfast to deliver on our commitment to be a purpose-led, performance driven and value creating enterprise. And even as our teams have managed an intense work load and a tremendous amount of change, I\u2019m proud to report that we delivered strong financial results in another year of top quartile returns to shareholders.","Excluding Kontoor Brands, highlights from our fiscal 2019 results include revenue growth of 18% or 11% on an organic basis, growth driven by our two largest brands, Vans and The North Face, which grew 26% and 10%, respectively, and on an organic basis international increased 10% led by 25% growth in China and 8% growth in EMEA. Direct-to-consumer increased 13% with 26% growth in digital, and our Work business increased 5% with bounced broad-based growth.","Our fundamentals remain strong. As gross margin, the key driver of our value creation model, expanded 90 basis points organically providing us the fuel to continue to invest in the capabilities required to sustain our growth momentum. Including Kontoor Brands, EPS increased 22% to $3.78, including $65 million of incremental investment to drive our strategy and accelerate growth. And notably, EPS growth excluding Kontoor Brands was even stronger.","And finally VF delivered yet another year of top quartile returns to shareholders with 20% TSR in fiscal 2019. Since launching our 2021 strategy in Boston just over two years ago, VF has delivered an annualized TSR of 29% over this period with a strong balance of both earnings growth and cash returns.","Let me take a moment to address current market conditions as the geopolitical environment has become more uncertain in recent weeks. While current events have the potential to disrupt our business and our consumers around the globe, to date the impact to our business has been minimal. Our most -- more closely monitoring conditions in certain markets such as China and the U.K., where our businesses the overall consumer backdrop remains quite solid. As it relates to trade, the impact of tariffs to date has been de minimis.","We continue to monitor the situation closely and are developing contingency plans for potential outcomes. For context, post our spin-off of Kontoor Brands, our total cost of goods sold sourced directly from China to the U.S is 7% and we will continue to implement mitigating actions to dampen the financial impact of incremental tariffs.","At the beginning of fiscal 2019, I shared three key areas where we would focus our attention and investments throughout the year to enable our strategy and fuel growth. I\u2019m pleased to report that we made substantial progress on each of these areas. First, we committed to reshaping and optimizing our portfolio, while protecting and enabling the explosive growth in Vans, shepherding the positive momentum of The North Face and focusing on reenergizing growth in Timberland, North America.","As a result, in August, we announced the separation of our jeans business, which will become an independent publicly traded company beginning tomorrow morning. In addition to the spin, we took other notable action -- actions to optimize our brand portfolio. We continue to integrating Williamson-Dickie into VF as well as the Icebreaker and Altra brands and we completed the sale of the Nautica, Reef and Van Moer businesses.","We enable the explosive growth at Vans with revenue growth -- with revenue growing 26% for the year on top of 27% in fiscal 2018, adding $1.4 billion of incremental growth over the 2-year period. Vans is tracking well ahead of the $5 billion target we laid out last September. The North Face brand made significant progress in reclaiming its rightful leadership position as one of the world's largest most influential outdoor brands and delivered 10% growth with strength across regions and channels, most importantly, with high single-digit growth in North America. And importantly, the Timberland brand in North America increased 5% driven by double-digit growth from non-classics footwear, mid single-digit growth in apparel and stabilization in our classics footwear business, demonstrating the diversification strategy is working.","Second, we committed to continue our consumer centric transformation work and to distort resources against our D2C platform and our digital transformation. As a result, on an organic basis, D2C grew by 13% including 13% comps. Digital increased 26% with 50% growth from Vans and more than 20% growth from both The North Face and Timberland. And we directed a majority of the $65 million incremental investment at capabilities that enable our consumer centric strategy.","And finally, we committed to increase our metabolic rate with a goal of operating with greater its speed and agility. We continue to drive a culture of lean operational excellence to unlock investment capacity and fund our strategic growth initiatives. Our management team has remained sharply focused on delivering business results, while also leading our company through a purpose led transformation journey. The dedication and perseverance that our associates have brought to that task are in a word remarkable.","Equally important is the business results we achieved is how we did it. VF associates around the world continued to lead by example and demonstrate our relentless focus on operating with the highest ethical standards. During the quarter, we received third-party recognitions including one of the world's most ethical companies recognized by Ethisphere Institute due to our continued commitment to leading the industry to ethical business standards and practices. We were also recognized by Fortune Magazine as one of the world's most admired companies for the 24th consecutive year.","As we enter fiscal 2020, our priorities remain consistent as we continue to advance our most promising areas of opportunity. Our top priorities for the coming year include: maximizing value creation and further optimizing our portfolio, continuing to accelerate our consumer centric transformation and growth work with a particular focus on collaboration between our businesses product merchandising, design and development teams and the supply chain, while increasing speed to market. And finally creating and enabling a purpose led performance culture across VF to the activation of our employee value proposition and by defining clear cultural behaviors that are required to deliver on our purpose and business strategy.","At the end of April, our Board of Directors approved the separation of VF's Jeanswear organization or Kontoor Brands. Tomorrow we expect Kontoor Brands will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol KTB following distribution after the market closes today.","I would like to thank everyone in our Jeans business for their service to VF and wish them well as they embark on their new journey as Kontoor Brands. The histories of VF Corporation and Kontoor Brands are woven together in the rich denim history of North Carolina. We're grateful for our time together and confident that Kontoor has a bright future ahead as an independent company.","Now as we continue our journey as a more agile and focused VF, I could not be more proud of all that we've accomplished over the past year. And I'm very excited about what's to come with our next chapter. Fiscal 2021 will undoubtedly be another solid year for our enterprise and one that sets a strong and positive tone for the years ahead.","And with that, I will turn it over to Scott.","Scott Roe","Thanks, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Before diving into our 2019 financial results and 2020 outlook, I'd like to take a moment and reflect on a few of the major milestones we achieved over the past year.","First, we\u2019ve made significant progress integrating Williamson-Dickie, our largest acquisition since Timberland. We are ahead of our acquisition plan from a gross profit and return on capital perspective and even more excited about the growth opportunities that lie ahead for what is now our fourth largest brand post the Kontoor spin.","Second, we changed our fiscal year-end and realigned our reportable segments to enhance visibility, reduce volatility and provide greater transparency into the growth and profitability drivers of our portfolio.","Third, we redesigned and simplified our organization and the North American footprint with a goal of operating with greater agility and speed, accelerating innovation and unlocking greater collaboration across brands and functions. And finally, we continue to reshape our portfolio. Over the past 18 months, we have acquired Icebreaker and Altra, divested Nautica, Reef and Van Moer and have effectively completed the spin of Kontoor Brands estimated to take place tomorrow.","Fiscal 2019 was indeed one of the most transformational years in VF's history. In fact, since the launch of our 2021 plan two years ago, we bought and sold 10 businesses with combined annual revenue of more than $5 billion. I'm incredibly proud of our team and the progress we've made reshaping our portfolio. And underneath all these exciting changes, our management team remain sharply focused on delivering strong results and value creation through a purpose lens. It's not only about making profits, it's how we make them that matters.","Our growth has accelerated and the fundamentals of our business are strong. I'm very pleased with the quality and diversity of our growth and momentum we carry into fiscal 2020. The investments we continue to make and the capabilities needed to sustain our growth are transitioning into strong tangible results and we're executing exceptionally well and tracking ahead of our 2021 commitments. Altogether, VF post Kontoor is a stronger version of itself, more focused and better positioned to build on our long track record of delivering top quartile returns to our shareholders.","Turning to our fourth quarter and full-year of fiscal 2019 results, remember there are reported numbers for fiscal 2019 including Kontoor Brands. However, I'll focus the majority of my commentary today on the performance of the RemainCo portfolio.","So let's begin with the fourth quarter. Revenue increased 12% on an organic basis as our core growth engines continue to perform well. Our big three brands grew 13% led by 18% growth at Vans and 11% growth at The North Face. Direct-to-consumer increased 10% and digital remained strong with more than 20% growth.","By geography, international increased 12% led by 25% growth in China. Our Europe business increased 10%, despite a somewhat more challenging backdrop across the region. This reflects the diversity of growth by brand, geography and channel. And our Americas non-U.S business also increased more than 20%. Work grew 6% with broad-based growth across the portfolio, including strong performance from our two largest brands Dickies and Timberland PRO.","Total VF gross margin expanded 30 basis points to 51.1%. Mix in the quarter was negative 20 basis points due mainly to the timing of distress sales. However, our mix benefit in the second half of 2019 was in line with our full-year benefit of 60 basis points. Excluding Kontoor Brands, gross margin increased 90 basis points on an organic basis as gross margin expansion continues to be a significant value driver for us, providing the flexibility and opportunity to accelerate investment and the capabilities needed to sustain long-term growth.","Operating profit was about flat, including approximately $65 million of incremental investments. Second half operating profit increased nearly 30% and operating margin increased almost 200 basis points driven by both gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage. And that\u2019s our model, gross margin expansion funding investments and capabilities to drive growth resulting in operating margin expansion.","Moving now to full-year fiscal 2019. Revenue increased 11% on an organic basis with double-digit growth in both the U.S and internationally and across both our D2C and wholesale channels. Our digital wholesale business, a key growth driver and strategic focus for our long-term strategy, increased at a mid teen rate. Our big three brands grew at a combined rate of 14%, led by 26% growth at Vans and 10% growth at The North Face.","D2C increased 13%, including a 13% total comp and a 9% comp in our brick-and-mortar stores. Digital increased 26%, slightly above our long-term target, a reflection of our strategic focus on investment against our vision to become a more digitally enabled enterprise.","By geography, international increased 10%, led by 25% growth in China. Our Europe business increased 8% with broad-based growth across brands, geographies and channels and our Americas non-U.S region increased 16%. The performance of our Work portfolio was solid with 5% growth including diversified growth across all brands in the portfolio as sector fundamentals remain resilient.","Gross margin expanded by 40 bps excluding Kontoor Brands or 90 basis points on an organic basis. Operating margin -- operating profit increased more than 30% and our operating margin expanded by 160 basis points to 13.7%. In addition to our gross margin expansion, strong top line growth drove significant leverage of SG&A despite investments in support of our long-term strategy.","Including Kontoor Brands, EPS for fiscal 2019 was $3.78, reflecting 18% growth on an organic basis and including $65 million of incremental investments or $0.13 per share. EPS for fiscal 2019 also includes a 9% decline and the operating profit of Kontoor Brands.","So turning to the balance sheet, inventory remains tightly controlled, increasing just 4% over the prior year. We generated adjusted cash flow from ops of nearly $1.8 billion in line with expectations and our return on capital was over 22%. We ended fiscal 2019 with a leverage ratio of about 2x. So our balance sheet leverage has essentially returned to pre-acquisition levels.","We also returned approximately $900 million to shareholders through share repos and dividends. Our diversified business model is delivering exceptional results and as we enter 2020 with strong momentum across multiple brands, geographies and channels. And with a more focused portfolio we are confident in our ability to deliver yet another year of top quartile value creation.","Let's now turn to fiscal 2020 outlook. As a reminder, our outlook excludes Kontoor Brands and includes the following. We expect revenue to be in the range of $11.7 billion to $11.8 billion, representing 5% to 6% growth compared to the prior year at approximately 7% to 8% growth on an organic constant dollar basis. From a shaping standpoint, FX and the divestitures of Reef and Van Moer will have a bigger impact on both revenue and earnings growth in our first half.","As previewed on our last call, on a constant dollar basis, we expect Vans to grow at a low double-digit rate surpassing $4 billion in 2020 and tracking well ahead of its plan to reach $5 billion by 2023. Note that our outlook for Vans includes a negative impact from business model changes in South America. We expect momentum in The North Face to continue into 2020 and still anticipate high single-digit growth with balanced growth in both the first and second half.","We expect low single-digit growth from Timberland, including the negative impact from business model changes in South America and mid single-digit growth from Dickies in 2020. We expect high single-digit growth from our international business highlighted by mid teen growth in Asia and 5% to 7% growth in Europe. We anticipate high single-digit growth from our non-U.S Americas business adjusted for the impact of planned business model changes in South America.","As previously announced, we're in the process of converting our direct business in the region to a licensed or distributor model. While these markets continue to represent growth opportunities for our brands over the long-term, we are narrowing the focus of our management teams and given the volatility in the region taking the opportunity to simplify and derisk our operating model in CASA.","Moving on to our channel outlook, we expect low double-digit growth in D2C led by approximately 25% growth in digital and mid single-digit growth in wholesale. Gross margin is expected to reach about 54%, representing 60 basis points of expansion, driven primarily by our ongoing mix shift towards higher-margin businesses. We anticipate operating margin expansion of roughly 60 basis points to 13.7%, despite incremental growth investments as well as dyssynergies from the Kontoor separation.","EPS is expected to be $3.30 to $3.35, representing 15% to 17% growth compared to the prior year or approximately 17% to 19% on an organic constant dollar basis. Our 2020 outlook assumes share repos offset dilution. Now to anticipate a question likely on your mind regarding the $1 billion of cash proceeds from Kontoor Brands, we intend to pay-off our short-term borrowings, which were about $650 million at the end of fiscal 2019. And while we will be opportunistic with respect to repos, M&A remains our top capital allocation priority. With our leverage ratio back at 2x and the cash from Kontoor Brands, we have significant capacity for M&A, which gives us the opportunity to drive incremental value creation in addition to the strength of our organic plan.","Cash flow from operations is expected to be at least $1.3 billion on an adjusted basis. Our cash flow outlook for 2020 excludes Kontoor Brands as well as the impact of timing related items in connection with our fiscal year-end change. On a normalized basis, cash flow from ops is expected to grow roughly in line with earnings. CapEx is expected to be just under $400 million for 2020 driven primarily by infrastructure investments as a result of our growth. We expect our CapEx on a normal run rate basis going forward to be about $250 million.","So, in summary, our business performance is strong and the execution of this world-class management team has been nothing short of amazing. Our portfolio is much better positioned as we head into next year. Our investments are creating strong demand across the globe and while we are pleased with our progress to date, the most exciting part of our story is we are just getting started. With the spin-off of Kontoor, expected to be completed today, we are looking forward to the next chapter of value creation for VF.","I will now turn it back to the operator and we will open the call for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Erinn Murphy from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now live.","Erinn Murphy","Great. Thanks. Good morning. I guess, my first question is on Vans. You guys talked about it tackling nicely ahead of the $5 billion long-term target. If we drill down into the quarter, the dollar growth was lighter than you see in the last six quarters. Can you just speak to what\u2019s some of the drivers [indiscernible] in Asia, it was a little bit slower. And then just thinking ahead to 2020, what are the dollar impact from the South American business model changes to Vans?","Scott Roe","Yes. So, Erinn, good morning. This is Scott. So, first of all, on Vans, I guess the big picture is remember we are talking a soft landing and you're seeing that modest deceleration, that's really the big picture, and we don't see anything fundamentally different in that overall trajectory. So that's number one. And while the business is moderating off those growth rates, we still see a very strong business as we leave Q4 and the signs are positive as it relates to Vans, whether that's channel checks, social media, all those factors remain high. There's some wholesale timing. I think you call that Asia, if you like, you might recall the third quarter was exceptionally strong. You\u2019ve got some noise quarter-to-quarter, but there's nothing fundamentally that we see here that changes anything we feel about the trajectory or timing of the business. Steve, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything from a Vans standpoint.","Steven Rendle","No, no. I think you hit it.","Scott Roe","And then as it relates to CASA, we -- you asked about the impact, it's about a point worth of growth for the Vans business. And just to give some shape on that, the business X Kontoor is less than $150 million in total, but obviously as you change from a direct model in a few of these countries to either a distributor or a licensee, then that has a top line impact. Although from a bottom-line standpoint, we think this will be modestly actually positive over time.","Erinn Murphy","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then, I guess my second question is on the ongoing investment this quarter, I think it was another $20 million of incremental investment. Can you just unpack what some of those biggest buckets have been? And then, Scott as you talked about the shaping for 2020 and kind of the components, the guide you did talk about your planning for ongoing investments, how should we think about 2020 level of investment? Thank you so much.","Scott Roe","Yes, Erinn, so a couple of things that are I think behind your question. So first of all, if you look at our implied guidance it says modest SG&A leverage And so I think that's part of your question. So let me answer that more broadly. As we think about our long-term algorithm it is absolutely still in place. We\u2019ve talked about high single-digit top line growth, gross margin expansion both through mix and also some of the -- frankly some of the moves we've made from a portfolio standpoint, all those thing and innovation and all the other things we talk about pricing, power, all those driving gross margin and operating margin expansion. As it relates to our investments, we\u2019ve said consistently that we are going to continue to opportunistically invest around those key capabilities and strategic priorities that we think are giving us a separation from our competitive set and really driving some of the growth of our brands and I would point backwards and say one of the reasons we think we are ahead of our long range plan is because of some of those capabilities that we've been investing in. Some areas, I mean, we\u2019ve talked about them, D2C, digital, in particular, which by the way drives both gross margin and also as an SG&A component that comes with it, insights analytics, advanced manufacturing, demand creation. It's the same things that we've been talking about, Erinn. Now as -- the other thing I would just point out is, listen, this is the first guidance for the year. As you can imagine, we are giving you guidance that we have strong confidence in. As we see opportunities from margin expansion, we are going to make sure we're delivering our commitments to the street. Don't forget our earnings are up 17% to 19%. I will say that again, 17% to 19% earnings growth. But we believe the investments back into our business are one of the reasons why we\u2019re seeing the success that we are and that is an area once we fulfill our commitment to the street that we\u2019re going to continue to make those investments.","Erinn Murphy","Great. Thank you, guys and all the best.","Scott Roe","Thanks, Erinn.","Steven Rendle","Thanks, Erinn.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Bob Drbul from Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now live.","Robert Drbul","Hi. Good morning, guys. I guess the first question that I have is really: one, are you done with the portfolio or not? Are we going to take a breath from all the model changes and everything? Because it's a little complicated. When you think about where you\u2019re right now, but I\u2019m serious, are you guys going to take a break from the portfolio changes? Do you think you\u2019re where you want to be to try to like go through this next chapter?","Steven Rendle","Yes, Bob. This is Steve. We apologize for the tremendous number of changes you all had to negotiate, but let me leave you with this. We've been very purposeful over the last 24 months to reshape our portfolio to align with our long-term growth aspirations. And I think you -- what you see today is who we intend to be. Now M&A remains the number one capital allocation priority that we have. We have the means to do that. We will be very rigorous, very thoughtful and disciplined. And I would tell you our people would love it as much as you would if we would just let the dust settle, get to our move, execute for a few quarters. But we will be very mindful as we continue to look at the M&A opportunities around us.","Robert Drbul","Got it. Okay. And then, I guess the other question I have is when you take a step back over the last few months just at retail including some of the reports recently from your wholesale customers, the environment is definitely -- gotten a little bit tougher and you guys are outperforming, but can you just talk about how the order books for your businesses have materialized on a wholesale basis? And have they strengthen going into fall or have there been any pullbacks most recently just by what we\u2019ve seen for the spring so far?","Scott Roe","Yes, Bob. Scott here. I guess the big picture is we\u2019ve seen -- we see strong order books and at least in our brands and our key partners the general sentiment has been positive. Now part of that too is inventories at retail are pretty good shape, I mean, not universally, there's always exceptions out there. But as a general rule, it's been a good year. With -- sell-through has been pretty got, at least in where we play and we are in pretty good shape. So we see confidence. I wouldn't say a big change, frankly. Better or worse, we see continuation of the support that we've seen coming out of the second half.","Steven Rendle","And Bob I would add the result of the portfolio moves that we've made over the last 24 months, we have navigated our way away from that middle portion of the marketplace and where we have wholesale penetration is in the better parts of the market. And I would also say that the focused efforts that we have to be more retail minded are putting us in a better position to be a better wholesale provider of quality products supported by really quality stories that we are able to drive collaboratively with our key account partners to get that consumer traffic and strong sell-through.","Robert Drbul","Got it. Great. Thanks very much, guys. Good luck with everything.","Steven Rendle","Thanks, Bob.","Scott Roe","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Binetti from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live.","Michael Binetti","Hey, guys. Thanks for all the help here. Thanks for taking our question. I guess, Scott my first modeling question is -- to get out of the way is when you get back to your desk, could you update that model and reply and sent it back to us? That would help. You\u2019ve added -- I think you added about $75 million of dyssynergies to the base line rate. So -- but I think a lot of that is related to stranded costs you\u2019ve incurred related to some of the myriad brand dispositions that have gone on over 18 months. As you looked around and taking a look at the cost you\u2019re stuck with, with those revenues going away, how did you think about whether you can start to work away with some of that, whether that's in the guidance for the year as you start with $3.30, $3.35 guidance for us this year?","Scott Roe","Sure. Yes, so first of all, I will just give you a kudos for teasing all this out. Joe sent a decoder ring, I don\u2019t know if it's been received yet, but it will help you get through that. So I think what -- just for the benefit of the group, I think it's a good time to reset everybody. So if you take our 2019 results and you look in the prepared materials we sent, there was a bifurcation between RemainCo and Kontoor as we reported it under VF consolidated. But then you take our implied guidance, the $3.30, $3.35, you look at the growth rates work that backwards then the implied base is different, and you're exactly right, Michael, it's that -- depending on some of the assumptions you make, you\u2019re going to be in that $75 million range. And indeed that is the dyssynergy number. So as you can imagine we didn't just wake up one day and Say we've got dyssynergies. We've been talking to you guys about this transaction for I guess a year or so and we\u2019ve been talking internally for going on two years. So we had great line of sight to what was coming. The majority of these relate to technology. And the technology platform which is largely unique to the Kontoor business. So the way this is going to work is the -- for a couple of years as they stand up their own systems and they\u2019ve talked about this publicly, they\u2019re on a TSA with us, Transition Services Agreement, they\u2019re kind of little more than half of that cost is going to be reimbursed by Kontoor to us and that helps mitigate those costs for that 2-year period. At the end of that 2-year period, we are already underway and we've been working on plans to get those costs out of our system. So I've made comments in the past about in response to either dyssynergies, I've always said yes they are, they\u2019re not significant or not material to VF. And as we look at it on a net basis, they're not going to be that significant on a go-forward basis in the scheme of VF. And we have line of sight to get out of those cost from a structural standpoint over the next two years. So hopefully that helps.","Michael Binetti","That does. So the -- I guess the dyssynergy number that we see in the model today, it looks a bit overstated in fiscal '20 and we can work through that going forward.","Scott Roe","Well, I wouldn\u2019t say overstated, it's what it is. And you have a similar number. What I'm saying is against that to mitigate that cost you\u2019re going to have an offset from the TSA's coming from the Kontoor business. That is not just technology, but technology comprises the -- by far the largest piece of that. So what that means is year-on-year you will have a lesser dyssynergy as you look into the 2020 guidance and that's implied in there.","Michael Binetti","If I could just follow-up on the brands then, Timberland has been described for a while as on the same arc of development similar to what we\u2019ve seen from North Face in the past few years, but the 1% to 3% rev growth here you gave this year doesn\u2019t bake in much improvement from recent results. So we\u2019ve seen interesting ideas like the pop up on Fifth Avenue, we saw the Champion tie-in over the holiday, we saw was website redesign. Where do you think the disconnect is between an expectation for that brand to accelerate and the guidance for this year?","Scott Roe","Yes, let me start, Michael. So, first of all that you probably saw the fourth quarter showed some strength, although we would say if you zoom out and click it really -- the business is showing signs of encouragement, but overall the trajectory is essentially where we expected it to be as we entered this year. And we would say, indications of improvement, modest improvement, but fundamentally the businesses is kind of modestly improve next year. Remember, in that 2020 guidance, which appears to be about flat you got the CASA impact, which I mentioned before. Also one of the things going on within Timberland is a focus on improving profitability, you see some of that drag in the outdoor results and you'll see that improve as we go next year. Some of that's at the cost of top line. For example, some underperforming stores which are at the end of their lease are going to be close. So when you put those two factors together, there's about a point of growth that is hidden in the implied guidance. So again, zooming out of click, I think you should say modest improvement as we're focusing on those fundamentals, that game plan is very similar to The North Face plan over the last -- looking back several years.","Steven Rendle","And, Michael, I will try along a just a little bit here. I think we\u2019ve said in last couple of calls, we're in that low single-digit growth place for the Timberland brand. We are a little bit behind where we'd like to be, but the diversification strategy that we've been talking about it's working. We are seeing double-digit growth across all regions with our non-classic styles. And as those continue to grow, we will change the waiting and dependence of the classics business that this brand had for such a long part of its history. We are seeing good growth with our peril. You also mentioned how we\u2019re elevating the brand and the trial that we did on, the pop up on Fifth Avenue has informed a new brand prototype that you'll see us continue to rollout thoughtfully, testing and learning this fall. But the team continues to work on elevating the brand, focusing on taking that that brand focus into the design and merchandising aspects of the business. We\u2019ve talked about the addition of Christopher Raeburn and elevating all elements of design and create -- creativity. We are still a little bit behind where we'd like to be, but we remain very optimistic with where we intend to be at a mid single-digit growth potential in the out years.","Michael Binetti","Okay. Thanks for all the help, guys.","Scott Roe","Okay, Michael.","Operator","Thanks. Your next question is coming from Jonathan Komp from Baird. Your line is now live.","Jonathan Komp","Yes. Hi, thank you. I just wanted to follow-up on the G&A question and just may be to tie in the dyssynergies as well as the investment piece, but I know couple of years ago now and the 21 plan you put out a goal for 35.5% on the G&A ratio. And just given all the business model changes, which obviously changes the cost structure, I\u2019m wondering where that target stands today?","Scott Roe","Yes, Jonathan, so -- obviously, many of those factors are changed because of the -- exactly what you mentioned, the Kontoor spin, the acquisitions and disposition. So, for example, we\u2019re way ahead on gross margin from what we said and we bought some businesses with lower operating margins and all those things. I guess, two things I would point you to. Number one, think of the general algorithm with the gross margin mix driving our ability to invest in the business and we will continue to see leverage in SG&A and operating margin over time. And the other thing I'd say is I\u2019d point you to this fall, we recognize the need to reset our long range plan and we intend to do that at an Investor Day that we will host this fall and given the new shape of the business we will reset all those parameters. But you shouldn't take away from that that's a big change. The basic model is the same that you've been used to in terms of the growth rates in the general way that this is going to function. For example, I don't see any change in our gross margin trajectory. We are going to continue to see operating margins expand over time. We will see gross margin or SG&A leverage. We just need to reshape that in light of the new business model that we have, and that's what this fall will be about.","Jonathan Komp","Okay. Makes sense. And maybe just a follow-up and maybe it's been touched on a little bit already. But if I look at the results for fiscal '19, I know you beat the original earnings target by pretty significant amount, almost close to 10% and that's even with the incremental investments. I\u2019m just wondering kind of the pace of incremental investment to the extent that you will show upside either the sales or the gross margin. Is the rate of strategic reinvestment the same as what it was sitting here a year-ago or how should we think about that?","Scott Roe","Yes, that's a hard question to answer because we don't look at it from a formulaic standpoint. The first thing I want to reiterate, we are going to expand our margins, we are going to deliver our commitment to the shareholders. And where that is a firm commitment, Steve and I are rock solid on that. And as we look at investments, incremental investments, it's really about -- we look at these, we rack and stack them literally, and we look at what are those opportunities, what do we think the payback is going to be, is this going to create a true meaningful impact on the business or create a point of difference. And that's how we make those decisions and I would just say they're not all perfect. We haven't made a 100%, but we've done a pretty good job looking back. Again, I just point to the return on capital of 22% over the last year. That gives us confidence and you look at where we\u2019re at on our overall growth trajectory, that gives us confidence that in general we're making pretty good decisions and we will continue to feed the fires that we think are burning, propelling these brands. I will give you a couple specific examples that's implied in our 2020 guidance around demand creation. For example, we brought $1.4 billion of growth in the Vans business over the last two years, and on top of that we are still grown within our long range growth plans. So consolidating all those new consumers into the franchise around innovation products like ComfyCush, we think that's a really good idea and this is a moment in time where we want to really consolidate that growth. Think about that three years stack just from a minute, I\u2019m just going to back up. Think about the 3-year cumulative growth rate on that business, that's a pretty high bar and on top of that we continue to grow. So where we see opportunities, where we think we have a meaningful point of difference like ComfyCush, which is a brilliant innovation that the Vans team brought, we are going to invest in that. I\u2019d give you another example, FutureLight as in the TNF business. We think this is a moment in time and taking advantage of this moment in time, we are going to invest around that because we think it's a game changer. We think it's disruptive in the industry. So where we see opportunities like that, we're going to take those advantages. Now I don't know if that same thing is going to be if we should do better this year, I don't know if they'll be that type of investment available or not. So I can't say per se what we would -- whether we would invest or not, it depends on the situation.","Jonathan Komp","Okay. Very helpful. And last, if I could, any color in the shaping of margin expansion throughout the year? I know you gave a couple of pieces around currency in top line, but just any color on the margin expansion? Thank you.","Scott Roe","Sure. So we talked about 60 bps next year, largely driven by our mix. And as you think about the other components, currency is a tailwind and you'll see that more in the first half than the second half just as those, frankly, as those favorable hedges roll in. Against that we have some cost pressure -- cotton, synthetics, polymers, petrochemical related and labor and overhead are the area. So if you see those net to a small net positive and then really the primary driver we see is related to the mix. So you will see a little more gross margin in the first part of the year based on what we see today.","Jonathan Komp","Okay. Thank you very much.","Scott Roe","Yes, thank you.","Operator","Thanks. The next question today is coming from Laurent Vasilescu from Macquarie. Your line is now live.","Laurent Vasilescu","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. You\u2019ve seen impressive growth in China last year as that market was called out as a key driver for the 2017 Investor Day. Can you dimensionalize what kind of growth we should expect for this fiscal year and what brand should be driving that growth in that market?","Scott Roe","Yes, I will put a number on it. So, in Asia, in general, we are looking at mid-teens, in China it would be north of 20. So we see continuing strength in the China business that's implied in the guidance. I don\u2019t think we specifically -- we talked about Asia, we didn\u2019t specifically talk about China, but we see that momentum in China which has been in that plus 20 range continuing at a similar pace for 2020.","Steven Rendle","And look, Laurent, the brands the brands that will be driving that are really the brands that we have present in that marketplace, Vans, The North Face, Timberland carrying the majority of that top line growth. But you know Kipling also a good business for us in the Asia market and specifically China.","Laurent Vasilescu","Okay. Very helpful. And then I wanted to follow-up on Erinn's questions on Vans. I think, obviously you gave a lot of detail. I think you guys called out for equal growth at TNF. How should we think about the growth in the first half, second half. And then maybe any dimensionalization on growth in wholesale versus retail for Vans overall?","Scott Roe","Yes, Laurent, I will take that one. So, in general, the first half will be stronger than the second half in our implied guidance. So again, we're thinking about a soft landing and so you'll see that kind of shape estimated to take place over the year. And that moderation occurs in both D2C and wholesale, but relatively larger decline in the wholesale business as a percentage. So we\u2019re thinking about high single-digit from a wholesale standpoint, low teen from a D2C standpoint. And I think that was in the prepared materials as well.","Laurent Vasilescu","Okay. Thank you very much and best of luck.","Scott Roe","Yes, thanks, Laurent.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Alexandra Walvis from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.","Alexandra Walvis","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions here. First question is on the Work business. You\u2019re guiding to 4% to 6% growth in that segment. I just wanted to step back there and ask about the exposure of that segment now to some of the cyclical end markets. I know that was reduced with the Williamson-Dickie acquisition, but I wonder if you could share with us the rough breakdown of that segment to end markets? And then, perhaps help us to kind of pass through the growth rates of different brands that are embedded in that expectation. I know you talked about the 5% -- sorry, mid single-digit growth rate expected for the Dickies brand. I wonder if you could share any color on some of the other big brands, Bulwark, Red Kap and so forth.","Scott Roe","Yes, sure. So I think part of the question was around the exposure to the cyclicality, and so we\u2019ve said about a third of the business roughly 30% to 40% of the businesses is exposed to the what we would call the cyclical parts of the market, like oil and gas, etcetera and we're seeing real resiliency. I think I said in my prepared remarks in that category. Remember, our expectations for the Work segment are mid-single digits and we\u2019ve seen -- we're right in that zone, in fact probably at the upper end of that in Dickies at constant currency, 5% to 7%, really ahead of our acquisition plan and at the high-end of that growth. The interesting thing we believe that the grounding and work is really important for the work inspired, but where we see a larger opportunity frankly is in that maker community work inspired and Dickies in particular is a great example of that, where we're seeing outsized growth in Asia market really in that work inspired side we call it lifestyle whatever term you like and we're going north of 20% over the last year, and we see a similar kind of trajectory as we go forward. That is particularly exciting to us and frankly exceeding our acquisition goals from when we bought the brand.","Steven Rendle","And just real quick, I will pile on. Clearly, Williamson-Dickie -- Dickies brand is really that front and center large consumer property, but Timberland PRO business is growing nicely in that high single-digit rate as well it plays very well into those core work segments, but also has that opportunity to move beyond in more of that work lifestyle piece. And then Red Kap and Bulwark in their respective sectors doing extremely well we see opportunities in being able to take our Red Kap brand beyond as well following some of the same playbook we see with Williamson-Dickie. So we remain very optimistic and proud of the portfolio we've assembled and the team that\u2019s driving that business.","Alexandra Walvis","Thank you.","Scott Roe","Yes and -- sorry, part of your question was around growth rates on specific brands and we haven't said that publicly. I would just say this -- that we see -- I think our comment was pretty widespread growth and you can assume that that if we are saying 5% to 7% overall that the brands that you mentioned would be in that range from a growth standpoint.","Alexandra Walvis","Thank you. My second question was on the active division. So you continue to deliver the very strong growth rates in Vans, but the implied growth rate for some of the other brands in that division has been reasonably weak and I think that\u2019s expected going forward. I wonder if you could spend just a moment on some of those brands and the trends that you\u2019re seeing there, Eastpak, JanSport and I think that Napapijri has been a growth spot there. So what\u2019s really dragging on that division?","Scott Roe","Yes, so one thing that's in the guidance is, remember, we sold Reef and that's not a discontinued operation, it's not material enough. So that really is weighing on the impact of the sector, particularly in the first couple quarters because that business was very spring oriented. So you're comping the majority of their business, but if you look our packs business, it's in the mid to high single-digit. A couple of call outs, our Eastpak and our Napapijri business which have really put several years in a row of high single-digit growth even into the double-digit along with really nice profitability growth. And we don't talk much about these brands, but they are real jewels and they continue to do well. They're not that large in the scheme of VF, but they grow and they\u2019re profitable and we think that these are exciting brands that you\u2019re going to hear more about in the future.","Steven Rendle","And to that point, I mean, these are brands where we're able to really test and learn many of our new brand building ideas and things that we're doing around creative vision work. And that that growth that\u2019s got mentioned for both Napa and Eastpak are really a result of greater clarity of what these brands stand for, a rationalization of the styles and the elevation of big stories and focusing on a few markets and really driving strong outsized growth. So think of these as certainly smaller, but good growth drivers, but they're important parts of our portfolio for our ability to learn, test and scale and they\u2019re certainly receiving the benefit themselves as they do that work.","Alexandra Walvis","Fantastic. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question today is coming from Matthew Boss from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.","Matthew Boss","Thanks and congrats on a nice quarter.","Scott Roe","Thanks, Matt.","Steven Rendle","Thank you.","Matthew Boss","So at The North Face, can you walk through the drivers of the brands accelerated growth profile over the past year and aside from potential conservatism or maybe tougher comparisons? Anything structural behind the moderation to 7% to 9% constant currency growth next year versus double digits this year?","Scott Roe","I will just jump in on the numbers. I don\u2019t think you should look at this as a deceleration of The North Face.","Steven Rendle","You stole my starting point.","Scott Roe","Oh, sorry.","Steven Rendle","No, go ahead.","Scott Roe","Yes, I think is it decelerating, I'm not sure. I think this brand has put a lot of work in over the last couple years, starting first with the management team cleaning up the marketplace and amidst all that you standing up a product creation team that\u2019s innovating some very, very strong products. And the growth that we're seeing is really broad-based across each region. The North America's return to growth and its across each one of their elements of the business from their core Mountain business to the Mountain Lifestyle business and the Urban Exploration. We are really seeing solid growth from each one of those particular consumer expressions of the brand. And as we see this going forward, the innovations that are beginning with FutureLight, really being able to separate this brand from its peer group. And we talk a lot about returning to that rightful leadership position not only from a product standpoint, from the things of this brand is doing from a positioning brand experience and a purpose led aspect, we're really confident and proud of where we stand in high single-digit at this time a year is a strong outlook.","Matthew Boss","Great. And then just a -- maybe just a follow-up to put together some of your comments regarding the 5-year targets outlined at the '17 Investor Day. I guess is it fair to say that there's no major changes to the 16% EBIT margin target, despite maybe some different gross margin and SG&A path to get there given the portfolio reshaping?","Scott Roe","Yes, I mean, I think I would say that our aspiration to 16% is unchanged, but the fact remains when you take pieces out and put other pieces in, you reset the base. So that margin expansion is there. I think we're talking about horizon, right? And that's why this fall Investor Day I think it's really important just to reset all the pieces. For example, the Kontoor business, higher operating margin and you take that out that changes the math and, and, and. So there's many examples like that. The most important point I would bring you back to is that the basic algorithm is the same with that gross margin expansion and operating margin expansion. So we will clean that up for you this fall. In the meantime the takeaway it's not really -- it's not changed.","Matthew Boss","Great. Best of luck.","Scott Roe","Yes, thank you.","Operator","Thanks. Our next question is coming from Jay Sole from UBS. Your line is now live.","Jay Sole","Great. Thanks so much. My first question is some of the other smaller, less talked about brands and portfolio, like Altra and Icebreaker. Maybe, Steve, you could just help us understand like what's been the development of those brands that you\u2019ve acquired?","Steven Rendle","Sure. Great. We don't talk enough about them. Icebreaker being our first purpose led acquisition had a really strong year, amidst being integrated into VF and having to adapt to a lot of our processes and fitting their culture inside ours, delivered a strong low double-digit growth rate last year and continues to innovate with Merino as their core product in that apparel category and we continue to be very bullish. You will see some exciting things coming from the brand this year as we look to continue to evolve their retail representation of this brand as a really strong brand building component. On Altra, we\u2019ve -- they\u2019ve been part of our Denver relocation and we\u2019ve -- they\u2019ve come through that extremely well. They, too, have had to endure integration. As a small brand that\u2019s not always the easiest thing to do and we\u2019ve great admiration for our team and being able to work through that with us, they\u2019re now solidly in Denver. We\u2019ve got a new leader there. And it continues to connect extremely well with that core specialty running, trail running set of retailers and innovating some very interesting new products that will keep them at the forefront of that core running consumer.","Jay Sole","Got it. And then maybe, Scott, if I can ask you about that $75 million dyssynergies as you\u2019ve reabsorbed that overhead from Kontoor. As you talk about finding ways to releverage that over the coming years, and you\u2019ve touched on, can you give us a little bit more detail about how you\u2019re doing -- how much of that $75 million maybe you can eliminate by just becoming more efficient operationally?","Scott Roe","Sure. Well, when we buy something that will take care of it. First of all, that\u2019s my flip answer. But the -- as I mentioned, the largest component of that relates to technology and we are not going too deep into the technology platform that the Kontoor business operates on is fairly unique to the Kontoor business. And so effectively, what will happen at the end of this period is all of that cost and the contracts and the maintenance of that system will come out of the -- come out of our company, right? They will come out of our cost center. So it's really there is line of sight to eliminate that cost. Of course, we have other initiatives going on all the time in terms of looking at being more lean as an organization, but when you look at the net impact of this and all of the -- all of the activities that we have and the growth that we have, we grow into this pretty quickly. It's a relatively small number in the size of overall the VF model, and we will grow into it pretty quickly.","Jay Sole","Got it. Great. Thanks so much.","Scott Roe","You know, I\u2019m just going to add on as I know we\u2019re ending to the -- getting to the end of the call, there's some other modeling questions that didn't come up that I want to just get on the record because I think it will help -- it will Joe in the follow-up, so -- if nothing else. But as our implied guidance, if you go below the operating line and get to the EPS and the other income, you'll see there are benefits and that is really in two areas. There's about $70 plus million, call it $75 million of implied benefit there. The biggest chunk of that is going to be from interest as we get the proceeds from Kontoor we pay down debt. Our average debt load, obviously year-on-year is going to be less and you\u2019re going to see that benefit. The other is don\u2019t forget we froze our pension, so you will see pension benefits also showing up in that line. And that\u2019s a piece that we haven't talked about this morning, but you'll need that as you model the guidance that we have. The other just general comment I would say, remember, we\u2019ve been working on this for a couple of years and a word I would ask you to take away from this call is optionality. We\u2019ve talked a lot about investments, we\u2019ve talked about SG&A, we\u2019ve talked about some of these other initiatives. We obviously saw these coming. We know that we have line of sight to deliver 17% to 19% operating income and have the ability on top of that to invest back in those areas that we think have been paying off. Remember 22% return on capital over the last year. So we could deliver more earnings. That\u2019s absolutely an option from a standpoint -- from an earnings standpoint. But we believe these investments are key to our -- the reason that we're winning and our brands are winning and we are going to continue doing that where it makes sense.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to management at this time.","Steven Rendle","Great. I would just like to thank everybody for joining us on this call. We have just finished an exceptional year, a year of significant transformation where we find ourselves going into fiscal '20 is in a very strong position. We are a leaner, more focused version of ourselves and I think what you will see is just continued strong performance as we focus on our purpose led performance driven value creating operating model. So thank you and we look forward to catching up with you here in a not too many weeks as we finish up our first quarter.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today."]}}
