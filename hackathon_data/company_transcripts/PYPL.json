And welcome to PayPal\u2019s First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]","As a reminder, this conference maybe recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Ms. Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Gabrielle Rabinovitch","Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal Holdings\u2019 earnings conference call for the first quarter 2017. Joining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO; John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer; and Bill Ready, our Chief Operating Officer.","We\u2019re providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentaries. This conference call is also being broadcast on the Internet and both the presentation and call are available through the Investor Relations section of our website.","We will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about our company\u2019s performance. In discussing certain historical year-over-year comparisons, we have chosen to present non-GAAP pro forma measures because we believe that these measures provide investors a consistent basis for reviewing the company\u2019s performance across different periods. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call.","In addition, management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for the second quarter and full year 2017.","Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in this call. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our operating results in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on the Investor Relations section of our website. You should not rely on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today\u2019s date, April 26, 2017. We disclaim any obligation to update the information.","With that, let me turn the call over to Dan.","Dan Schulman","Thank you, Gabrielle. I\u2019m pleased to report that PayPal began 2017 with an exceptional quarter. This continues a string of consistently strong performance since our separation from eBay in July 2015. We delivered solid operating and financial results this quarter. PayPal gained 6 million net new active accounts, a 35% increase from the 4.5 million net adds in Q1 a year ago. This represents largest organic quarterly increase in this important metric over the past three years.","We ended the quarter with 203 million active accounts. We expect that our net adds will increase by more than 20 million in 2017 and once again our transactions per active account increases, growing in Q1 to 32 up from 28 a year ago.","We reported $2.975 billion in revenues, an increase of 19% on an FX neutral basis, above the high end of our guidance, driven predominantly by stronger core PayPal growth. PayPal delivered $.44 of non-GAAP EPS, which is $0.02 above the high end of our guidance as we are beginning to realize the sustainable benefits of our scale and we generated $603 million in free cash flow. This strong customer results clearly demonstrate our progress towards becoming the worlds leading open digital payments platform.","We continue to build on our strategies of reimagining and democratizing the management and movement of money for our consumers. Helping drive the global transition from cash to digital payments and positioning our millions of merchants to benefit from the noble revolution at move to an all-digital cross-context retail environment.","Our powerful two-sided network engages both consumers and merchants and the larger our scale the stronger our network effect becomes. We have made meaningful progress in advancing merchant adoption of PayPal in the quarter. At the end of March the number of active merchant accounts on our platform increased to 16 million. The size of our merchant base is a formidable competitive advantage and is extraordinarily difficult for others to replicate.","We have provided one of the new brands at the PayPal platform including online fashion retailer with Vente-Privee in France, Papa John\u2019s and Groupon in U.S., leading Mexican department store chains, Coppel and Liverpool, and we made meaningful strides in the travel and tourism vertical in India with the addition of access rooms, Vista Rooms and MakeMyTrip.","In addition, over 5 million merchants and 75% of the IRR 100 now offer our industry-leading One Touch checkout solution on their mobile and desktop shopping experiences. We expect the number of merchants accepting One Touch to increase noticeably throughout the year.","We finished the quarter with 53 million consumers opted into One Touch. We couldn\u2019t be more pleased with this transformative product experience and the engagement that\u2019s driving with our customers.","One Touch provides a powerful connection between our merchants and our consumers in a mobile first world. In the quarter, 32% of our payment volume came through mobile device and mobile payment volume increased 51% over the same period last year to approximately $32 billion.","In the quarter, we also continue to innovate and transform how people send money to each other through P2P and remittent services. We continue to expand the functionality of our global remittent service Xoom.","In the quarter we launched the Xoom service within the PayPal mobile app in the U.S. and plan to increase spending limits to $10,000 per transaction in the second quarter. We opened up the Japanese market in Q1 making Xoom now available in 56 different countries around the world.","In the quarter Venmo continue to transform our millennials managed and engage with their money. In addition to being named is one of fast company\u2019s most innovative brands, the social P2P app process 6.8 billion in payments in the quarter. This more than double the volume processed year ago.","Importantly, beginning in Q2 we plan to significantly enhance the social P2P payment experience that has made Venmo environment phenomenon. PayPal made Venmo available as a payment option on the brand three platform. We have the opportunity to test and learn as preserved unique nature of Venmo as we move the experience into new context.","Today we are announcing the opening of our data for select U.S. PayPal merchants who accept Venmo as a mobile payment option. We anticipate the ability to pay with Venmo will be widely deployed across millions of our U.S. PayPal merchant base by the end of this year.","Investments we have made in our platform architecture now allow us to enable Venmo as a payment method for our PayPal merchants without any additional integration work on their end, mirroring the approach we use to successfully rollout One Touch.","While we continue to drive innovation inside PayPal, we are also always looking to acquire innovative companies that can bring great product experiences and technology talent to PayPal like we delivered entering, Venmo, Paydiant and Xoom.","In the first quarter we announced our agreement to acquire Tio Networks which will expand our two-sided network by adding bill payment is another key service to drive engagement and value to our consumers. On April 10th Tio shareholders approved our transaction and we expect to close the transaction in the second half of 2017.","Tio is a leading multichannel bill payment processor in North America and processed more than 7 billion in bill payment in its fiscal 2016. The company\u2019s digital platform and physical network of agent location make paying bill simpler, faster and more affordable.","And importantly, gift consumers may not have access to digital financial services, the ability to easily migrate cash into a digital network and as a result benefit from the convenience and speed of digital bill payments. With its network of 10,000 supported billers, Tio will meaningfully expand our ability to offer digital financial services to tens of millions of underserved consumers.","Reinventing the management and movement of money for people across the global creates opportunities for close partnerships with companies across our ecosystem. We continue to strengthen and forge additional strategic alliances with leading brands around the world. We just announced the partnership agreement with Wells Fargo, adding another strategic issuer to the growing list of companies working with PayPal to expand our services at the point of sale.","As a result of this partnership Wells Fargo customers will be able to use their debit and credit cards to make contactless mobile payments at millions in store merchants. This expands our longstanding relationship with Wells Fargo and build on the product capabilities. These are made available to PayPal as part of our strategic partnership.","We also extended our partnership with Visa into the Asia-Pacific region and in January we finalized a comprehensive strategic partnership with Discover. Along with Citi and FIS, these partnerships will make it easier for PayPal customers to find and choose the preferred financial instruments inside the PayPal Wallet and use the PayPal account in multiple context. Our conversations with other leading issuers continue to be positive and constructive.","Over the past nine months we have rolled out consumer choice against across our on boarding, servicing and checkout experiences. Multiple millions of our consumers have already opted into choice and have formatted the payment option best suited for their particular checkout experience. Consequently, we now have additional visibility into the early results of choice and we are quite pleased that what we are seeing.","First, choice is having a notable positive impact on our net active adds. Second, it is driving higher spend per customer. Third, we are experience a reduction across into our customer service centers leading to cost reductions in our global operations. And finally, the impact of choice on our transaction margins is well within our expectations.","In summary, we couldn\u2019t happier with our strategic move to choice and the corresponding benefits we are seeing. We plan to rollout choice in the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia, beginning in Q2.","We also announced a meaningful expansion of our growing relationship with Google. PayPal will be available within Android pay in United States and will be accepted as a way to pay both in app and at the millions of retailers that accept Android pay at the point of sale.","We are pleased to offer our customers another exciting way to pay with PayPal further expanding the choices and context within which they can use their PayPal Wallet. We expect that our relationships with technology companies like Google and Facebook will continue to grow and expand into additional context as we move through the next several quarters.","2017 continues the strong efforts we have undertaken to create strategic partnerships across multiple ecosystems. We have seen the transformative power of these partnerships across our business. It\u2019s hard to overstate the difference in the relationships we now have with companies across the multiple sectors who were previously viewed as potential competitors. We are now collaborating a strong and supportive allies to create value for our mutual customers.","As this quarter\u2019s results clearly demonstrate we are executing against our vision in a disciplined fashion. We operate one of world\u2019s most exciting and dynamic industry which energizes and inspires our entire team.","We still have much to accomplish, but I would like to take a moment and thank the entire PayPal team for another quarter of dedication and hard work on behalf of our customers. It is making a real difference in the value we can drive to consumers, merchants and to our shareholders.","And with that, I will turn the call over to John.","John Rainey","Thanks Dan. I also want to thank all of PayPal\u2019s customers and our employees worldwide for making this another great year. We outperformed in the first quarter on both revenue and earnings, building on our momentum for 2016. Solid growth across active accounts, payment volumes and revenue demonstrates that our customer first strategy coupled with our strategic partnerships are yielding results.","Before I go into the detail financial results, a few highlights for the quarter, revenue was $2.98 billion, growing 17% on a spot basis and 19% on a currency neutral basis. Non-GAAP EPS grew 19% to $0.44. We generated $751 million of operating cash flow and $603 million of free cash flow and we returned $517 million to shareholders during the quarter.","For the first quarter, our total payment volume was $99 billion, up 25% on a currency neutral basis, including U.S. payment volume growth of 27% and international volume growth of 23%. Our merchant services volume grew 30% on a currency neutral basis to $84 billion. Merchant services represent approximately 85% of our total volume in the quarter. Volume associated with eBay represented approximately 15% of the total compared to 16% in the prior quarter and 18% in the first quarter of 2016. In the first quarter, we added 5 million net new active accounts, ending with 203 million active accounts, representing growth of 11% from Q1 last year. Active account growth was predominantly driven by our PayPal core business.","The number of payment transactions per active accounts increased 12% year-over-year, continued solid growth of customer engagement in active accounts resulted in a 23% year-over-year increase in payment transactions to $1.7 million. ","In the first quarter 17% revenue growth resulted from a 60% in transaction revenue and a 23% increase in revenue from other value added services. Transaction revenue was driven by core PayPal and Braintree businesses and revenue from other value added services was predominantly driven by credit.","For Q1 our total take rate was 3% and our transaction take rate was 2.62%, both of these metrics reflect sequentially and down approximately 14 basis points from a year ago. Continuing a trend, our P2P businesses contributed meaningful in take rate decline in the quarter.","Again, I would like to point out the growth in our Venmo and our core P2P platform increases our ubiquity, strengthens our value proposition and support higher levels of engagement and reduce levels of churn across our consumer base. These businesses are important to our long-term success and we remain committed to both investing it and monetizing these high growth opportunities.","Our volume based expenses were up 28% year-over-year. Transaction expense was $987 million, up 31% year-over-year, driven primarily by increase funding cost across our core PayPal platform, as well as business mix from strong growth in Braintree.","On choice we are in the process of rolling this experience to all of our customers here in U.S. and as Dan articulated, we are pleased with the early success of this initiative. To date, the increase card based cost have been well within our expectation.","Transaction loss in the quarter was $171 million or 5.7% of revenue, representing 40 basis points of leverage. In the quarter loan losses for both the consumer and merchant credit finance were $129 million or 4.3% of revenue. Our consumer credit portfolio continues to perform in line with our expectations. The net charge-off rate was 6.9% in the first quarter. We ended the quarter with an aggregate gross receivable balance including both principle and interest of $5.7 billion in our consumer and merchant loan portfolio and a total reserve of $360 million.","Other operating expenses increased 4.5% to $1.05 billion or 35% of total revenue, representing 420 basis points of operating leverage year-over-year. This marks the lowest favored growth in operating expenses that we achieved as an independent company. We are very encouraged by the early progress of our initiatives to operate more efficiently.","Looking forward we will continue to seek opportunities to drive sustainable efficiencies and cost discipline, while at the same time foster innovation, reducing complexity in our processes and improving our service to our customers. We are positioning PayPal to operate and scale more profitably over the long-term.","Associated with these initiatives we recognize a $14 million restructuring charge in the first quarter, primarily related to strategic headcount reductions across our global organization. Less than 3% of our global work force will be affected and based on current plans we do not expect a net decrease in headcount for the year.","We expect to realize annualized savings of approximately $75 million, of that majority of which will be reinvested in our growth initiatives. We believe the changes we are making to how we are organize and how we run the business will allow us to deliver sustainably stronger results.","Non-GAAP operating margin in the first quarter was 21.6%, an increase of 50 basis points versus the same period last year. This is our best operating margin performance since separation. In addition, non-GAAP operating income grew 20% year-over-year to $643 million, resulting in non-GAAP EPS of $0.44 in the quarter.","I would now like to spend a moment discussing how changes in foreign currency impacted our results in the quarter. While we recognize hedge gains of $40 million in the first quarter, these gains were more than offset by the translation effect of the strong U.S. dollar. The effect of translation net of our hedge gains created revenue headwind of approximately $16 million.","Our hedging program is decided to minimize the operating income effect from changes in the currencies to which we have the largest exposure. On an operating income basis, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates were immaterial to our results in the quarter.","We ended Q1 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $6.3 billion. We generated $751 million of operating cash flow in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $148 million or 5% of revenue, resulting in $603 million of free cash flow in the quarter, representing $0.20 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue.","In addition to an already strong balance sheet, our balance generates substantial free cash flow. Effective capital allocation is an additional leverage to drive long-term value creation. We take a comprehensive view of our sources and uses of cash to ensure that we allocate resources and capital to what we consider to be the highest return on alternatives.","We are fortunate and we have many great options for the use of our free cash flow. Part of that is how we deploy the capital on our balance sheet to highest returning investments. We currently have $5.1 billion of consumer credit receivables on our balance sheet and are exploring different options including asset sales and partnership opportunities to free up cash for higher returning investments.","In the first quarter, we returned $517 million to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases. We now have approximately $500 million remaining on our buyback authorization further reinforcing our ongoing commitment to capital return and discipline capital allocation.","Today we are announcing a new buyback authorization in the amount of $5 billion. We are confident that the cash generated potential of our business will continue to allow us to invest organically, be equatative and return cash to shareholders.","We are pleased that we are positioned to increase the repurchase authorization and view this as the next step in providing a more comprehensive longer range plan for capital allocation. Consistent with the execution of our existing authorization we plan to repurchase share to offset the dilution from stock based compensation and use the remainder for opportunistic repurchases.","I would now like to discuss our guidance for the second and updated guidance for the full year 2017. For the full year, we are ranging our revenue guidance and now expect revenue between $12.52 billion and $12.72 billion, representing currency neutral growth of 17% to 19%. We are pleased that raising this outlook relative to the guidance that provided in January because of the momentum you are seeing across our business and initiatives.","At current exchange rates for the full year we expect currency translation to impact revenue by approximately 200 basis points, resulting in spot growth of 15% to 17%. We are also raising our full year EPS number and now expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of a $1.74 to $1.79. We expect the sequential trends in our quarterly revenues and earnings to be very similar to 2016. For the second quarter we expect revenue to be between $3.05 billion and $3.1 billion and we expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.41 and $0.43.","In closing we have started 2017 from a position of strength. We delivered strong results in the first quarter, executed successfully across our plans and achieve important goals both operationally and financially. We see substantial opportunity in the markets we are currently serving and those that are part our longer term addressable market.","We will continue expand and build on our market leadership position and remain focus on balancing investments in growth with profitability and discipline capital management, creating shareholder value for the long-term.","With that, let me turn it back over to the operator for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Darrin Pellar from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Darrin Pellar","Thanks guys. Thanks John. Just \u2013 it\u2019s great to see more operating leverage in the model, just wanted to be clear first, John, the $40 million in restructuring is more one-time nature? And then, perhaps, you can give us a bit more detail moves you are making to improve that operating expense growth, I think, you mentioned, you said 5% in other expense, where can that get you here, I mean, clearly showing more of the past due in operating leverage this quarter than in the past? Thanks.","John Rainey","Yes. Thanks, Darrin. Good question both. The $40 million restructuring charge is a result of a very targeted initiative here which actually goes into your second quarter that is really design to help us move forward in a very efficient manner as we scale our business. It is not what I would describe as your typical headcount reduction. It\u2019s a target reduction that really drives towards the efficiency of the business and in doing so is in a very customer centric fashion. So we don\u2019t expect that in the future necessarily that\u2019s one-time effect.","With respect to operating leverage, you are right, you could go back and look at the last several quarters and you have seen sequential declines in our operating expense growth rate each of those quarters. And to your point we grew 4.5% this quarter and even if you look at that on kind of an incremental margin basis, for every dollar of revenue that we brought in this quarter our operating expenses increased $0.10 and that\u2019s the best performance that we have ever seen as a company.","You can go back to prior years and that number would have been as high as $0.50 in some cases. So this is a demonstration of how we are going to operate moving forward and it really is across all aspects of our business. It\u2019s not specific to what you may think of generally as overhead. It\u2019s how build sales group and product development. How we build our product. How we sell to our customer. So it\u2019s a muscle that we are developing and we certainly hope that we can share more of these results going forward.","Darrin Pellar","All right. Nice job guys. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tien-tsin Huang","Thank you for the results. Just want to ask on the acceleration in active accounts and also in the U.S. payment volume metric looks like acceleration as well, is that the result of the customer choice or there are other factors to consider, just trying to segregate customer choice from the rest of the business if possible?","Dan Schulman","Yes. Tien-tsin, thanks for the question. I think, there are a couple of things that drove overall results. And I think one of the things is au (3144) around these things. It is the result of cumulative effect of lots of actions that we have been taking. Certainly, customer choice is being very helpful. We are seeing not only increase on board \u2013 on boarding is more streamlined but reduction in churn, which to me is a great checkmate for what we were trying to do with the choice. But that\u2019s still early days on that.","We are really seeing momentum across all regions right now. I think a lot of that is because over the past 18 to 24 months Bill and his team, the risk teams others around the company have really looked at our core value proposition. Things that you may not think about like availability and performance of our network are up time. We spent a tremendous amount of energy and resource to make sure that our platforms perform the way that our customers expect for us.","We obviously couldn\u2019t think like One Touch. One Touch is driving more engagement. More engagement typically means with our churn, which is held for on our net adds. I think, if you look at our noble performance and it\u2019s arguable that we are only not global checkout experience right now.","I look at things like our consumer app we put out, the merchant app we put out, new invoicing things, smaller things have the ability to recover passwords more easily, all of these things are starting to hit in the marketplace in quite impactful way. And I would say we are just beginning on this as well. I mean, if you think about choice for the first time, we are actually beginning to see banks that, we have even mentioned in our remarks, our press announcements that our marketing pays off to their consumers because if they can put their debt or credit into the PayPal Wallet, they know they are going to drive additional digital spend by doing that.","We have a lot more that we have got planned in the funnel whether that\u2019s additional functionality for Venmo users, whether that\u2019s international expansion, upticks in our consumer value proposition or all of the things we are doing with multiple partners across world, that\u2019s also helping to drive our net adds.","So as I mentioned in our remarks, we are now expecting more than 20 million net adds for the year since substantial step up from where we are and hopefully we will continue to see that momentum moving forward. We are certainly encourage by what we are seeing.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Bryan Keane","Hey, guys. Solid results. Just kind of a two part question, I guess, what came in better than previous guidance that cause the revenue and EPS guidance raise from fiscal year \u201917? And then just secondly on the Android paid partnership announcement, that seems like a unique deal. My understanding is PayPal will generate a fee on all transactions at the point of sell regardless of tender types, so even if it is a credit card. So maybe you can help us understand the economics that PayPal earns on those transactions? Thank so much and congrats on the quarter?","Dan Schulman","Thanks, Bryan. I will take the first part of the question then turn over to Bill for Android. Actually, Bryan, this is one of these quarters where we just hit on all cylinders. If you start at the top of the funnel you see that the 6 million net new adds, which is highest we have had in several years and then you walk away down, revenue came in and really all \u2013 across all regions came in better than what we have expected in core PayPal.","And then as I alluded to you in my prepared remarks, we are really pleased with what we are seeing in around discipline on the cost side of the business. We have got \u2013 we just -- we are changing our way that we operate as a company and this is Bill\u2019s evolution, but we are pretty excited and then we are beginning to seeing the results of what we are capable up here.","Bill Ready","Yeah. The Android pace probably just, the thing we are doing there, I mean, it\u2019s good to sort of take a step back a little bit and talk about some of the broader partnership that we are doing, be more specific your question on Android, hey Bryan is, what you are seeing happen on mobile that our two sided platform is allowing to connect consumers and merchants very efficiently across many different context and if you have seen people on ecosystem partner with us because we can help line up new experiences that they want to create for their customers and so that\u2019s across the number of partnerships that we have.","With Android Pay and PayPal becoming a payment options inside of Android Pay, number one, we are going to give the consumer great ability to access mobile app to pay transactions by be able to sign up at One Touch to be able to have a friction of on boarding into that experience. We have a great customer journey into mobile app to pay. And then at the end of that the economics of that we are starting with PayPal balance only and for those we will make money on those transactions must like it would any other transaction.","As we work through other payment methods we will use Visa, Mastercard tokens, tokens from other and this is one of the interesting things about deals we did there that the token that we import from Visa and Mastercard we \u2013 when we token out the estimate of an issuer, we will pass through a card present rates to the merchants, the merchant is card presently, and we only cost on those things.","It also means that we are not necessarily have revenue on all those transactions, but we don\u2019t have cost either and that let us have some of our transactions where we will make good margin on those, others basically are zero revenue and zero costs for us and the benefit of that is that we can drive engagement across our consumer base and you see that\u2019s across other parts of our business where take P2P as a good example we did tremendous volume on P2P.","And in many situations those are free transactions but those consumer engage with us on P2P are more engaged overall and we find that some of our most profitable customers because we have higher engagement them overall across other transactions where we monetize.","And we think about in store in a very similar way, with Android Pay in similar way that we will have some of those transactions that we monetize directly, others that are pass through for us but we expect it will drive overall engagement higher as we have more and more opportunities to engage with our PayPal users.","Dan Schulman","Yeah. Just to build on that a response though, one of the long-term aspirations we have with consumers is that, we first started this that they were transacting with us one to two times a month. We are now approaching almost three times a month, that\u2019s what we can say it for us that our long-term aspiration is that a PayPal consumer engagement with us one to two times a week.","And as Bill mentioned, the way to do that is to be much more involve in the everyday management and movement of money of the consumer, which means that we want to give them this optionality of not only what instrument they want to use and how they want to spend, but where they want to spend.","So whether that the international remittance, whether that be bill pay, whether that be a tax to pay in app or in store, we are trying to open up the PayPal Wallet through these partnership in multiple context and multiple different functions for our consumers to be much more engage with PayPal Wallet and we are beginning to see the early payoffs of that.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Paul Condra with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Paul Condra","Hey, guys. Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. John, I guess, on, just on the guidance, does that include any contribution from Venmo or Tio, just on Tio can you talk a little bit about margin profile, growth rate or anything just to help understand that, the way that business looks a little more? Thanks.","John Rainey","Sure. As Dan alluded to you in his remarks, we are beginning to expand pay with Venmo and we have got some improvement in the contribution assume there, but I wouldn\u2019t by any stretch the imagination suggested aggressive or that were dependent upon that for our results this year. We are going to be measured in this as Bill has said many times before this is something where we \u2013 it\u2019s too precious to get Venmo and we want to get the experience just right.","So if that requires us taking more measured approach that\u2019s absolutely fine with us. And so we are \u2013 we do expect to have daily improving economics with Venmo as we go forward. But there is not, I wouldn\u2019t describe our 2017 guidance is depending on the comp that is going to happen within that.","Dan Schulman","Yeah. As I mentioned in my opening remarks on Venmo side, we are really trying to take same approach with One Touch. We have now been able to engineer our platform just like with One Touch recently got such quick merchant acceptance as the merchant have to do no work on their part to be able accept our One Touch transaction. We have that initial on Braintree with automobile customers and we tested Venmo to see I take that experience, that\u2019s a social experience of payments and move it into a social experience for purchases as well.","And we now have the platform to be able to turn on PayPal merchants which obviously is the vast majority of base here in the U.S. to accept payment from Venmo as an option. And so that will roll out over the year but that will roll out more towards the back half of the year and so we will Venmo this year and as John said, we will start to see that improve as we look forward in our medium-term guidance.","On Tio, Tio is a publicly traded company right now, you can see the results that did about $80 million or so last year in their past quarter, this last quarter that they just reported. Obviously, we will look at with synergies are there. We are quite excited about having Tio come in. Bill payment is a very sticky solution.","We are really trying to build out how we can help underserved consumers manage and move their money and that can be done in a very profitable way for us and a very consumer friendly way for consumers as well. So we are really excited to close that acquisition. Again, we expect that to close in the second half of this. But in our overall results, it\u2019s a pretty small number in general.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is now open.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks. Dan you mentioned like discussions with other banks continue and you have some good experiences. I guess, what\u2019s holding some other announcements up when you have your discussions with banks? And then, just one for John, as part of the asset life strategy, is there any sense of timing? Thanks.","Dan Schulman","Yeah. So, Sanjay, just, we are actually announcing all of the different issuers and banks that we are working with, because we don\u2019t active, we don\u2019t -- they don\u2019t necessarily make the announcement. We don\u2019t need the announcement and so there are lot that adjusting to that end. Some of the very big ones take time to work with. That\u2019s really just take time to work through.","I think there is a single conversation that we are having right now that I feel, but optimistic about that everything being done with an eye from both parties to get deal done and these are big banks. They have a unique, some of them are very unique situations and we just need to work through large different documents with each of them.","We want to make sure that when we sign up with the bank that the product flows are right, that we exactly have experience right to make it as I mentioned in my remarks, mutually advantageous for our mutual customers. So, not really to read on that, just take some time to work through these things.","John Rainey","Sanjay, on asset life, I want to start by reminding everyone that we have no intention to start offering a credit product. Credit today compliments a holistic suite of payment offerings that we provide for our merchants and consumers and they find great value of that. What we do want to do though is put that that credit offering in a less capital intensive manner than what we do today, so that we can free up that cash potentially as much as $5 billion for higher returning investment. We have got various options there, some are more partnerships like opportunities, others are pure asset sale, some combination of the two.","Our preference that you do question on timing is to do something sooner, but we are not going to add on the side of experience that means giving a sale optimal deal for PayPal. So we are not under a self-imposed timeframe. We are going to take our time will be measured and do what is best for creating long-term shareholder value for PayPal.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura. Your line is now open.","Bill Carcache","Thank you. Good afternoon. Dan, I know you have said that you are pleased with the consumer choice results that you have seen far, but can you give us a little bit more detail around what\u2019s driving your confidence level over being able to continue to offset the increase in transaction margin compression with TPV growth and operating leverage? And John, separately for you, could we see the growth rate and other expenses turn negative for a time or is the goal just to keep other expenses growing more slowly than revenues? Thanks.","Dan Schulman","Yes. Thanks for your question, Bill. So, I will just take one step back on choice. We want the choice, because we really felt that into our long-term stage to be the ultimate customer champion company focused on customers and what their pain points are, what they need that offering them optionality of how and where they want to pay, giving them flexibility and transparency and powering them with essential for us to remain the market leader in digital payments.","And it also had the benefit which was great, enabling us to team with networks, financial institutions, carriers, tech companies to drive digital payment, we are all aligned and wanted to do that. And then remember that the partnership arrangements that we had enabled us to get certain things that we didn\u2019t have before cost certainty, elimination of digital wallet, sees what something that was hanging out in the market, we got access as Bill mentioned to industry standard tokens, card present rates.","We have network volume discounts that came back to us because we obviously drive a ton of volume over the various networks and we had instant access to funds coming off of the platform which was a \u2013 today which we have in our P2P product and we fill all of those gaps with this field. So we assume right now that we are now rolled out basically into across our on boarding, a servicing and our checkout experiences.","And we are not now looking at tens of thousands of data test and after test for hundreds of thousands of early adapters, we are looking at multiple millions of consumers that is opted into choice and the results we are seeing are, a frank and very pleasant as we see them. As I mentioned, we are going to see an increase in net adds and a notable part of that is going to be driven through choice and we are just beginning on that piece of it.","Our order sizes are up as people can figure out, so this order allows them to use our debit or credit cards, this transaction they wanted to use their ACH or debit card. And so people can now talk about for in fact nearly it\u2019s those who use PayPal less to finding the most value in choice right now and that is driving engagement and higher order sizes and we see our cost coming down as we expected, because people were confused about funding choices and we expected a reduction of course coming in the call center and that\u2019s exactly what we are seeing and that\u2019s sustainable cost reductions for us.","And then the transaction costs are well within the expectation, so we have well within that and so we had model all of these reasonably conservatively what we looked at our guidance and our medium-term guidance and all of them. We are quite pleased by what we are seeing and we are just getting start the marketing for the banks. In fact that we get additional funding options coming in like rewards points that will start to come in early next year as our another funding mechanism, all of these things are sort of begin early days on choice, but we were always sure that over the long-term this would make sense for us, we are frankly see any playing out much earlier than we expected.","John Rainey","Hey, Bill, the second part of your question, in terms of whether we would expect to see OpEx turn negative. I would reemphasis that this is not a one-time cost take out approach on cost. We are reengineering the way we work and so from one quarter to the next we certainly have seasonality in our business we may invest more in certain quarters versus other quarters, but at the end of day we are growth company and we are going to continue to add cost, where we think it generates value for us. And we don\u2019t overly rotate towards one metric like other operating expense or like transaction margin, the thing that drives us is being a customer champion and create shareholder value and so we are going to make decision whether it would be around revenue or costs that we think results in strong performance in both of those metrics.","Dan Schulman","I would say, senior leader shifting though, there has been a tremendous amount of focus kind of how we do that in a way that enables us to make decisions quickly, to innovate more rapidly, to do so in a much more efficient way and so when you think about costs, this is not necessarily taking cost out but it\u2019s eliminating cost.","So for instant in global ops, our global ops growth least than that that it has come forward. The reason for that is predominantly caller statement. That means calls are not coming in our customer care, because our product experience is better, since we have choice and so those are sustainable benefits that we have as a result of actions we are taking that and we are very focused on being both \u2013 focus on what customer pain points are. How we solve it. How we keep our lead in the marketplace that are operating in very efficient and effective way.","John Rainey","And Bill, I would add to that, maybe a better to think about the cost trajectory going forward with other operating expense is mid-single digits growth.","Bill Carcache","Great. Thank you both for the very detailed responses. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Dan Schulman","You bet. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Your line is now open.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Thanks. Hi, Dan, John, Bill. Solid quarter. Congratulations on that. My question is, now we have had obviously a number of initiatives one is consumer choice, you both acquired Xoom, contextual commerce, almost then sort of a kind of design to increase the size of the funnel, you draw more transactions and accounts on to the PayPal platform, you are having good payment now, banking other relationships. I guess, the question becomes, are you done buildings, what you could be building in terms of pulling transactions in, it become an execution story from now on, is that, I mean, what else could you be adding to the platform here strategically?","Bill Ready","Hi, Ashwin, it\u2019s Bill. One other things we really think a lot about is, how rapidly the consumer is moving into new context with MA transact and the interesting thing about PayPal, we talked about this the previously, it will really make PayPal is that we are one of the only player to operate on both the consumer merchant side of the payment ecosystem. They will do so globally and control the experience end-to-end.","And so what that means is that, every time consumer emerge they start to meet one and another in new context or consumers want to transact in the new context. We are able to light those up often times in far better late than what others could. And so on one hand, we \u2013 our cost are looking how we evolve the platform to make sure that as those new context emerge that we can serve customers.","However, we have a structural difference in our company that naturally allows us to be a primary player, enabling those transactions, because of the way that we operate on both the consumer and merchant side of the payment ecosystem and in fact that we can do so globally and control end-to-end experiences.","And I think you see that happening in what\u2019s going on in the ecosystem that you see in terms of mobile commerce, at 32 billion dollars in volume this quarter, more than $100 billion last year and what we are doing with the One Touch rollout and with 5 million plus merchants and 75% IRR 100, you are seeing that increasingly, our consumers, our merchants and others in the ecosystem are looking at us as the preferred partner to light up these types of experience for them.","So your question was around how much we are building, we continue to think on building for those new contexts, but we also have our platform is really set up to be a great way to connect consumers and merchants whenever they meet one another in new context. And then some of those specifically where on the consumer side, Dan, talks a lot about things that we want to do and become a part of the way people manage and move their money every day.","Those are places where we are just beginning our endeavors and look at the kind of growth, and Dan touched how we are approaching three transactions a month, while we had great growth overall. We think there is so much more of the consumers overall experience and we can help them with and the industry is moving toward us, that you have seen more and more transactions are moving towards e-commerce and to mobile and we are increasingly a preferred partner to our consumers, our merchants and others in the ecosystems as that happens.","Dan Schulman","I just like to add to that, if you think about the merchant side and you think about our strategy around the merchant side, as we move fundamentally over the last three or four years from predominantly being a button on our website to really now being a fundamental underlying platform provider to merchants as they think about how did they take advantage of mobile and that means that we are offering a host of services across a common platform that we never did before. Full checkout type of capabilities, credit capabilities, contextual commerce toolsets, rewards integration through API sets and the list goes on and on and so invoicing capabilities.","So if you think about the mission of PayPal of both on the consumer side as Bill just articulated and on the merchant side. It is a much more expansive mission and vision than we have ever had before and so I think that we obviously can grow in a couple of different ways going forward and this is fully what we expect. One is we are going cross sell more products and services to existing customers. We have a whole suite both on the consumer side and on the merchant side and we can tremendously expand the amount of services we provide to each and every customer.","Second thing though is we are just beginning on this journey here. We are beginning to see acceleration of our net ads coming consumers are beginning to recognize sort of network effect and we have merchants are beginning to see that and we have huge international expansion opportunities which is better performance and we can do on that side. So it\u2019s not just a matter of due coming in, it\u2019s a matter of taking what we have and be able to cross sell into existing as well. So that sort of combination of this two things, time gives us a lot of excitement about our growth prospect as we look forward.","Operator","And we have time for one last question from James Cakmak with Monness, Crespi, Hardt. Your line is now open.","James Cakmak","Hi. Thanks. Just one quick one, does your guidance contemplate any kind of incremental marketing expense build awareness on the pay with Venmo side as we progress with that. I guess is the look towards at the end of year is what?","Dan Schulman","Hi, James, thanks for the question. First of all, I think, one of the areas that as we have seen a bunch of fundamental really efficiency and improvement is in our whole marketing spend. We took what we are previously very desperate marketing functions in each of our regions either in headquarters, we put them all together and that group is both regions and I think central looking at our spend, figuring out how do we spend that in the most efficient manner.","We have ton of data and analytics around if you look at things both through an ROI perspective and we are not just more efficient but way more effective on our marketing spend and I can\u2019t say enough good things about what that team has done. And by being more efficient we are actually getting more spend out of the existing dollars that we have.","With pay Venmo for all of our growth initiatives, you heard John talk about we are going to take the money that we are saving and reinvest it back into our group initiatives, pay with Venmo where we a part of that that gets additional investment for us.","John Rainey","Yeah. I would just add to that, while, as just Dan mentioned, we have great efficiency around marketing and billing considering the ability to assist, pay within what\u2019s marketing, the $6.8 million a month we did in the quarter and 114% year-over-year growth came with almost no marketing for Venmo. It\u2019s a product that have been inherently viral and so we certainly think about how we will support the product going forward, but it is a great place to be when you have a product that customers truly love and is inherently viral and grows without having to go through tons of marketing dollars added and so that is something we think about with that as we build pay with Venmo the social aspect of that we have kept very much at the core of what we are doing and we think that can really help to build upon the virality of the core product. So it\u2019s not a product that we have to go support with massive amounts of marketing. It\u2019s a product that is inherently viral and that we can complement with couple marketing.","James Cakmak","Yeah. Great.","Dan Schulman","So, James, thank you for that question. And thank you to everybody for joining us today. We really appreciate your time and we look forward to speaking with you soon. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect.

Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. ","I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Ms. Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Gabrielle Rabinovitch","Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal Holdings earnings conference call for the fourth quarter and full year 2019. Joining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO; and John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer and EVP Global Customer Operations.","We're providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary.

We expressly disclaim any obligation to update the information.","With that, let me turn the call over to Dan.","Dan Schulman","Thank you, Gabrielle, and thanks everyone for taking the time to join us on today\u2019s call. I\u2019m pleased to report that PayPal had a strong quarter ending 2019 with record results across key customer and financial metrics. Over the past year, we meaningfully improved and expanded the PayPal platform. We strengthened our value proposition for consumers and merchants, expanded our international scope and scale, and announced transformative, strategic acquisitions, investments, and commercial agreements.","For the year, we delivered $17.8 billion in revenue, that's up 19% on an FX-neutral basis, adjusted for our receivable sale to Synchrony. In the fourth quarter, we generated $4.96 billion of revenue, growing 18% on an FX-neutral basis. Our strong revenue growth combined with disciplined expense management enabled a 28% year-over-year increase in our non-GAAP earnings per share to $3.10.","Excluding net unrealized gains on our strategic investments, we delivered $2.96 of non-GAAP EPS, up 25% on a year-over-year basis. On that same basis, in Q4 we delivered $0.84 of non-GAAP EPS, growing 28%. For 2019, our overall payment volume grew 25% on an FX-neutral basis to $712 billion. ","Excluding eBay, TPV grew 29% on an FX-neutral basis to $649 billion, as we continue to grow market share. In Q4 alone, we processed just shy of $200 billion of TPV, a new record for us. We've processed more than 12 billion transactions in the year, including nearly 3.5 billion transactions in Q4 alone. eBay's TPV continues to decline shrinking by 4% on an FX-neutral basis. Consequently, we anticipate that eBay will be approximately 6% of our total TPV by midyear. ","We added 9.3 million net new actives in the quarter, ending the year with 305 million active accounts on our platform, up 14% year-over-year, including 24 million merchants. In 2020, we expect to add approximately 35 million net new active accounts, inclusive of our acquisitions, and this does not include any one-time impact on NNAs associated with the acquisition of Honey. ","I'm pleased to report that engagement continues to consistently increase. For the first time this year, engagement grew by double-digits, increasing by 10% to 40.6 transactions per active account. Mobile transactions are a major driver of our growth, representing 44% of TPV. One Touch adoption is now at a 199 million consumers and 14 million merchants. Venmo processed $29 billion in volume for the quarter, growing 56%. And for the year, volume increased to $102 billion. We ended the year with Venmo's customer base exceeding 52 million active accounts, driving its current revenue run rate of more than $450 million. ","Last quarter, we announced that Venmo had signed a deal with Synchrony to provide a Venmo credit card, and I'm pleased to announce that Visa will be our exclusive network partner for this new product. We also recently announced our first-ever Venmo Rewards Program with select merchants for Venmo debit card holders. These merchant funded rewards are deposited directly into a customer's account so that they can be used in-app with merchants or transferred to a bank account or debit card, providing consumers with ease and choice. ","Last year, we saw brands like Netflix, Pepsi and Chipotle use Venmo payouts to reward their customers and pay them via Venmo. We're excited to introduce new, monetizable, value-added services through our Venmo platform over the course of 2020.","We continue to see strong demand for our payouts capabilities, enabled by our Hyperwallet acquisition. Digital payouts are attractive to multiple industries, including the insurance industry where consumers are demanding faster payments. In the quarter, we began delivering claims payments on behalf of insurance providers like Chubb Insurance, Asurion, and Combined Insurance. In addition, United Airlines is now leveraging our platform to pay passengers all over the world for baggage claims, and Walmart is using our capabilities to pay merchants on its marketplace. I expect to see continued growth in our payouts products.","Earlier this month, we closed the acquisition of Honey. The addition of Honey and its complementary capabilities to the PayPal network will significantly transform our relevance and drive engagement with our consumers and merchants at the earliest stages of their commerce journey. Our integration activities are off to a strong start. Our early joint marketing activities have already produced nearly 100,000 downloads of the Honey browser extension, and on day one our customers could use their PayPal credentials to log into Honey.","I continue to be impressed by the caliber of the Honey team, and I couldn't be happier to welcome them to PayPal. ","We are deepening our relationships with financial institution partners around the world. We recently announced the ability for Citibank institutional clients to make payments directly into their customers\u2019 PayPal wallets. In December, we finalized the deal with FIS, which will enable us to scale our Pay with Rewards capabilities across thousands of financial institutions in the United States, and U.S. Bank has currently integrated functionality to support both account linking and Pay with Rewards capabilities. ","We continue to expand our platform capabilities around the world. We've recently expanded our relationship with Uber, and we will be processing their payments in Europe, Brazil, India, and across the Middle East. ","In December, we also signed a commercial agreement with MercadoLibre that has a potential to drive a meaningful increase in our international scope and scale. As part of the agreement, PayPal will be made available as a payment option in the Mercado Pago online checkout for people in Brazil and Mexico, which opens the door for PayPal consumers to shop at hundreds of thousands of new merchants. PayPal will also be accepted in MercadoLibre marketplace for cross-border purchases. In return, we will offer Mercado Pago as a payment method at PayPal merchants around the world, allowing approximately 50 million Mercado Pago users in Brazil and Mexico to pay with their preferred digital wallet. And we will expand Xoom\u2019s presence by allowing Mercado Pago users to receive remittances directly into the Mercado Pago wallet. I'm pleased with our growing partnership and look forward to continued collaboration with Marcos and the MELI team. ","In addition to the continued international expansion of Xoom, in Q4, we launched the ability for Xoom customers to send money to recipients in the U.S. through strategic alliances with Walmart and Euronet. Customers in the U.S. can now use Xoom to quickly send money for cash pickup, typically within minutes at nearly 5,000 locations across the country. This is a positive step in our mission to make the movement and management of money quick, easy and affordable for everyone.","In December, we closed our acquisition of GoPay becoming the first foreign payment platform to be licensed to provide online payment services in China. This transaction has the potential to dramatically increase our total addressable market opportunity. Digital payments in China are expected to grow from $1.5 trillion to $3 trillion over the next four years, and the number of users is set to grow to well over 1 billion.","Last week, we announced a wide reaching partnership with UnionPay International. UnionPay International has issued over 130 million cards outside of Mainland China and as part of the China UnionPay Group, which has over 7.5 billion cards on their network. As part of the agreement, our mutual customers will be able to add UnionPay cards to their PayPal wallet in more than 30 countries, allowing UnionPay customers to seamlessly shop at PayPal's 24 million merchants globally.","In addition, China UnionPay will enable Chinese merchants to accept PayPal in person where CUP cards are accepted. Our two companies will collaborate to accelerate both online and offline acceptance of PayPal for Chinese merchants. This is a landmark agreement and will have global impact for our joint customers. We look forward to partnering with other Chinese financial institutions and technology platforms to expand both cross-border and in-country digital payments. ","Our efforts to drive social impact and create value for all of our stakeholders continues to evolve and expand. This past year saw a record volume of funds raised by the PayPal Community for charity. For the full year of 2019 the PayPal Community donated more than $10 billion to charity, including over $1 billion in the month of December. On GivingTuesday we raised a record, $106 million. ","The world's secular trend towards digital payments and commerce continues to rapidly grow. Our total addressable market has significantly expanded with the acquisitions of Honey and GoPay, and our commercial partnership with MercadoLibre. ","In 2020 our growth investments are focused on our recent acquisitions, growing our infrastructure in China and other international markets, Venmo monetization and our in-store point of sale initiatives.","Our ability to drive and benefit from these trends and initiatives is reflected in our strong results and our expectations for 2020. We are very excited about the year in front of us. Our brand reputation and trust are stronger than ever. ","We obviously need to execute, stay vigilant and remain steadfast customer champions, but we have our sights set high and we aim to aggressively expand our capabilities and geographic footprint. And I'm confident that our efforts will drive our market leadership and growth over the foreseeable future. ","And with that, I'll turn the call over to John. ","John Rainey","Thanks, Dan. I want to start off by thanking our customers, partners, and employees for helping us deliver an outstanding year. 2019 was another great year for PayPal and I'm pleased with our team's accomplishments. The results we're reporting today demonstrate the consistent execution of our strategy to realize long-term sustainable value creation. We're entering 2020 ready to build on our momentum, focused on our key initiatives and excited about the year ahead. ","Now to our fourth quarter results, revenue in the fourth quarter increased 17% on a spot basis and 18% on a currency neutral basis to $4.96 billion. The translation effect from the stronger dollar negatively impacted revenue by $35 million. This impact was more than offset by $58 million in hedge gains. Relative to the fourth quarter of 2018 U.S. revenue grew 19% and international revenue grew 17% on a currency neutral basis. ","Transaction revenue grew 18% and revenue from other value added services grew 14%. Strength across core PayPal, Braintree, and Venmo all contributed to transaction revenue growth. Other value added services revenue growth reflected solid performance of our credit business offset by the lapping of interim servicing revenue from Synchrony. As a reminder, this headwind will continue through the second quarter of this year. In the fourth quarter, transaction take rate was 2.27% and total take rate was 2.49%. Compared to Q4 2018, this was a decline of 8 basis points and 9 basis points respectively, which is the lowest level of decline we've reported.","Strong P2P growth continues to be the largest driver of the year-over-year decline for both transaction and total take rate. In addition, on a sequential basis, both transaction and total take rate improved. The diversification of our business and our pricing initiatives allowed us to deliver these results.","Volume-based expenses increased 20% in the fourth quarter to $2.3 billion. Transaction expense was 96 basis points as a rate of TPV, consistent with the fourth quarter of 2018. Transaction loss was 15 basis points as a rate of TPV, an improvement of 3 basis points from Q4 2018. Continued improvements in our risk management capabilities contributed to the strong performance in our loss rate. Loan losses were 4 basis points as a rate of TPV, an increase of 1 basis point from Q4 last year. This increase primarily resulted from growth in both our merchant and international consumer loan portfolios. ","Transaction margin dollars grew 16% to $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter. Transaction margin as a rate was 53.8%, a decline of approximately 90 basis points versus Q4 '18.","Non-transaction related expenses grew 7% versus last year, and increased only $0.13 for every incremental dollar of revenue. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income in the fourth quarter grew 28% to $1.2 billion. Our operating margin was 23.6%, expanding 204 basis points from last year as we delivered leverage across all of our non-transaction related expenses. This represents our strongest performance ever, demonstrating our sustainability to scale at a low incremental cost.","Other income in the fourth quarter declined by $33 million relative to last year. Net interest expense resulting from our debt issuance in September, as well as lower net unrealized gains from our strategic investments contributed to this result. As we disclosed in our 8-K issued on January 9th, in the fourth quarter, on a per share basis, net unrealized gains contributed $0.02 to EPS versus $0.04 last year.","Starting in 2020, we're updating our non-GAAP methodology to exclude the impact of gains and losses on our strategic investments. We believe this presentation will provide a better understanding of our operating performance and a more meaningful comparison of our results between periods. With this change, we no longer will issue an 8-K following quarter end, disclosing the effect of net unrealized gains and losses on our results.","In the fourth quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 17.2% versus 17.7% last year. Non-GAAP EPS for the fourth quarter grew 24% to $0.86. Adjusting for net unrealized gains non-GAAP EPS grew 28%. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $13.6 billion. In addition, we generated more than $1 billion of free cash flow or approximately $0.22 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue. During the quarter, we've returned $305 million in capital to shareholders through share repurchases.","I'd now like to discuss our guidance for the full year and the first quarter. Relative to the preliminary outlook for 2020 that we provided in October, we raising our revenue expectations. We are also raising our earnings outlook excluding the dilutive effect of acquisitions announced in 2019. ","The guidance we're providing has been updated to reflect the impacts from our recent acquisitions of Honey and GoPay, the adoption of CECL, the new accounting standard for recognizing credit losses and our expectations for currency movements. ","For the full year, we expect TPV to grow in the mid 20 percentage range. We expect to generate revenue between $20.8 billion and $21 billion. This range represents currency neutral growth of 18% to 19%, an increase from our initial outlook of 17%. Our guidance includes about 1.5 points of growth from the acquisition of Honey at the midpoint of the range. ","Consistent with our preliminary outlook, this revenue guidance includes an approximate 1 point headwind to growth from the lapping of our acquisitions of iZettle and Hyperwallet as well as an approximate 1 point headwind from eBay's managed payments transition. ","In 2019 revenue from eBay's Marketplaces business declined 4% and represented 14% of our revenue, and approximate 300 basis point decline from 2018. Since the end of 2015, eBay's annual contribution to our revenue has consistently declined from 26% of our total to 14% today and has grown at a compound annual rate of 2%. ","Over the same period, the rate of growth for the rest of our business has been 22% or 10 times eBay's growth rate. As a result, we remain confident in our ability to successfully navigate eBay's continued transition to its managed payments program.","I would now like to turn to our EPS guidance. On our third quarter call, we indicated that our preliminary outlook for EPS growth in 2020 was 17% to 18%. Since then our expectations for core earnings growth have improved. Before incorporating the impact of the two acquisitions we recently closed, we now expect our EPS to grow between 18% and 20%. This growth rate of 18% to 20% incorporates a 1 point headwind to earnings growth from CECL, while reflecting our underlying business strength. ","In addition, we expect $0.08 to $0.10 in dilution or about a 3 point headwind to earnings growth from our acquisitions of Honey and GoPay. As a result, we now expect non-GAAP earnings per share to grow 15% to 17% and be in the range of $3.39 to $3.46. While we expect the acquisition of Honey to be diluted this year, we expect this transaction to be accretive to earnings in 2021. Honey is an exciting addition to our platform and this year we will be accelerating investments to develop a truly integrated and differentiated wallet experience for our customers. We're also realizing dilution in 2020 from funding this acquisition with cash. ","In addition in 2020 following our acquisition of GoPay, we're investing in our local Chinese infrastructure and capabilities and building upon our new partnership with China UnionPay to strengthen the foundation of our cross-border platform for small and medium sized Chinese businesses and develop a cross-border shopping experience for Chinese consumers. We will also be investing to enable in-store shopping experiences for non-Chinese consumers visiting China.","I'd also like to provide some context for our expectations related to our operating margin performance. In 2019, we expanded our operating margin by approximately 160 basis points or nearly 3 times the average annual rate of expansion contemplated by our medium-term guidance. In 2020, we expect our operating margin to remain essentially flat as a result of absorbing acquisition-related dilution, while continuing to invest in our other key strategic initiatives. This year as Dan just discussed, in addition to prioritizing spending on our recent acquisitions, we're also investing in Venmo, our new partnerships, international expansion and our in-store point-of-sale strategies. We expect to deliver operating margin performance consistent with the highest in our history, while investing in these significant growth opportunities. ","We anticipate our non-GAAP effective tax rate will be between 16% and 18%. For 2020, we expect free cash flow to exceed $4 billion, as we continue to generate approximately $0.20 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue. In 2019, we returned more than $1.4 billion in cash to shareholders through stock repurchases and announced approximately $4.1 billion of acquisitions. In 2020, we will continue to balance return of capital with growth investments while maintaining an efficient capital structure. Our acquisition pipeline is healthy and our balance sheet gives us the flexibility to be opportunistic. At the same time, we plan to continue to return cash to shareholders, consistent with our stated commitment for long-term capital return.","For the first quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $4.78 billion to $4.84 billion or 17% to 18% growth on a currency-neutral basis. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.76 to $0.78, representing growth of 15% to 18%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, our earnings guidance represents 19% to 22% growth. We expect our acquisitions announced in 2019 to have a more dilutive impact on earnings in the first half of 2020 than in the back half of the year. As a result, the $0.08 to $0.10 per share of expected non-GAAP earnings dilution is more heavily weighted to the first and second quarters of 2020.","In summary, we're pleased with our performance in 2019. We delivered strong revenue growth, our highest operating margin and record operating margin expansion and free cash flow generation. At the same time, we advanced our strategic priorities in our core and developing markets, strengthened our consumer and merchant value propositions, and launched new partnerships that are expanding our total addressable market. We're committed to our medium-term financial targets and are confident that the strength of our diversified platform, flexibility of our balance sheet and execution capabilities will allow us to continue delivering value to our stakeholders.","With that, I'll hand it back over to the operator for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.","Tien Tsin Huang","Thanks. Good afternoon. A lot of good information here. So, I'll ask on the outlook if you don't mind, just your guidance this year versus last year. Aside from Honey, how would you characterize overall visibility this year versus this time a year ago? It seems like you have more in your control but still lots of moving pieces, so would love your thoughts on visibility.","Dan Schulman","Yes. Thanks, Tien-Tsin. This is Dan. I'll start on that and then may be John will fill in on it. First of all, we had a strong Q4, and actually an even stronger back half of Q4. The holiday season was strong for us. December was strong. And frankly, we're seeing a strong January as well. And that comes from a couple of things that we actually really didn't have the year before. First of all, I think we are executing a lot better than we have for quite some time. Second and really important, because we have the visibility in this, we have seen the pricing that we talked about start to get implemented. It's implemented in a number of countries. We still have more countries to even roll that out into, but that's going exactly according to plan. We signed a number of very large deals at the end of the year. We implemented many of those in December, and we are seeing that those growth rates begin to kick in. Those are deals like Paymentus that we\u2019ve talked about, but other very large multi-billion dollar deals as well. And so, we\u2019re entering this year in really a fundamentally different place than we entered the year before, a lot of momentum. For instance, we feel very comfortable with our forecast around TPV. We're talking about TPV being in the mid-20s. That was 22% in Q4, but of that 22% actually 200 basis points I guess was because of the lapping of iZettle.","So, if you normalize for that, you're at 24, a little weakness in eBay; and then we've got these big deals that are already implemented and accelerating, others like Uber to come. And we feel very comfortable with our TPV accelerating into the mid-20s. So, I'd say overall we're pretty excited about where we're starting off the year, things that we already have in place, and we have a ton of initiatives that we're excited about as well. So, I don\u2019t know John, if you add to that?","John Rainey","Yes. I\u2019d maybe underscore a couple points that Dan mentioned. I think what's notable Tien-Tsin about this year versus last year is, in particular how we are starting off the year. There's always a certain amount of trepidation that exists about the macro economy, but I think the macro economy was maybe a little wobblier last year. And as we certainly enjoyed, I think a better holiday season this period as we look the month of December, even going into January. And so, we're starting off on the right start but also I'd underscore the point he mentioned around execution. We recognize that we have a pretty precious opportunity here at PayPal when you combine the secular tailwinds of our business with the incredible assets that we have when you look at our portfolio of products, and it\u2019s incumbent upon us to execute. And I think the team is executing as well now as they ever have. So, again I think that gives us more confidence than on a relative basis versus last year.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.","James Faucette","Great. Thank you very much. I wanted to touch on a lot of different incremental market opportunities, but I want to touch on Venmo and the efforts to continue to develop that as a separate brand. Can you talk a little bit about kind of what the objectives are for growing Venmo monetization during 2020 and beyond, and how we should be measuring those? And I guess, kind of dovetailed with that, now that, Visa owns Plaid, it seems like -- just wondering how that may impact the ability to grow Venmo and some of these other ancillary services whether it be internationally, et cetera? Thanks a lot.","Dan Schulman","Yes, James. Thanks for the question. We continued to be pleased every quarter with the performance of Venmo. Even as it\u2019s gotten larger, we've seen strong net new actives, and we\u2019ve got 52 million now at year end. We\u2019ve always said we thought Venmo would wind up with over 100 billion of TPV and it wound up at 102 billion, and it\u2019s up about 60% for the year exited, I think at about 56% of growth rate. Its revenue run rate right now is over $450 million. And as we're getting that scale on the revenue side, we're beginning to see losses reduce as well each year. So, we kind of have a line of sight to when breakeven is and when this starts to actually turn profitable as well. We don't want to slow down its growth at all. We want to keep enabling Venmo to grow as rapidly as possible, but we\u2019re really pleased with this trajectory and I expect to see good revenue growth, continued strong, strong revenue growth on the Venmo side.","We're adding new capabilities all the time. Debit is continuing to expand. We're going to put a big emphasis on Pay with Venmo. There's a lot of work going on around that right now because we think that's a very big opportunity that we did not take as much advantage of last year as we probably could have. As I mentioned, we are going to be developing a credit card. That was a very competitive process with a number of issuers looking to work with us on that. It\u2019s very competitive on the network side too. So, we're really pleased with the economics around that. You will see us add things like just like goods and services. Goods and services is one of the biggest moneymakers on the PayPal P2P side. We're going to add that into the Venmo side, and there are a number of other monetizable services that you'll see come out that will reveal in good time as they're introduced.","In terms of Plaid, we've worked quite closely with Plaid in terms of using Plaid to integrate into bank accounts of different banks. We're working sometimes with some of the larger banks to integrate directly and with Plaid really for quite a number of the banks and really for that long tail. We were really happy with the acquisition of Plaid by Visa. We work obviously very, very closely with Visa and MasterCard and the other networks, but very closely with Visa. We're an investor in Plaid, so we know them quite well. And I think the security enhancements that Visa will do on top of the Plaid network will have the banks more comfortable in utilizing Plaid. Visa obviously has a tremendous global scale. And as you saw in the Plaid announcement from Visa, I was one of the folks quoted on that, because we really look forward to working with Visa to see how we can take advantage of this joint platform now that they own Plaid and there could be a lot of different opportunities as a result of that. I hope that answers. Anything else, John?","John Rainey","No. ","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane","Hey, guys. Good afternoon. John, I was just hoping to get clarification on the TPV. The FX-neutral growth dropped from 27% in 3Q to 22% in 4Q. So, I just want to understand that delta, but probably the more importantly is the walk or reacceleration to the mid-20% going into this year. So, I know I'm not sure how much Honey is a factor there or the Uber, UnionPay, MELI deals. Maybe you can give us a walk on how to get back to that mid-20s TPV? Thanks.","John Rainey","Sure, Bryan. It\u2019s good to speak with you. So, if you look at our TPV whether you will get overall or international, the biggest single driver of the decline is related to the lapping of the iZettle acquisition. In fact, if you just look at international TPV, the entirety of that 4 point decline is attributable to iZettle. But looking at TPV in total, there are some other factors but one is obviously eBay. We saw about 1 point decline related to eBay. And if you sort of decompose that a little bit even look at our transactions, and you look at the various parts of our business, the transactions related to eBay declined 6% for us in the quarter. ","And so, this has been something that we\u2019ve talked about. The next year we will begin that period where we will transition away from that but we are still seeing the rest of our business grow quite well. So as we look into 2020, there are a number of things that will bridge that back to the mid-20s. A part of it is just the acceleration we are seeing in the business right now as Dan alluded to in the December, January timeframe. But we've got international expansion going on next year. We have got some work being done with large merchants. You know that we're are ramping up with Paymentus and other parts of our business that we are emphasizing more like recurring payments, subscriptions, bill pay that give us confidence that we will be able to achieve that mid-20s TPV number even in a period where we are transitioning away from the eBay. And I think it's worth mentioning, in doing it, while expanding operating margins in 2019 and given us the latitude to make the investments that we need in 2020 to continue this trend of mid 20s TPV growth into the future. ","Dan Schulman","Yes. I\u2019ll just add a little bit onto what John said, what probably pleased me the most about Q4 is to see coming out of it the reacceleration of a lot of our core trends. Our core business started to accelerate. Braintree, even though it's gotten larger and larger, I\u2019ll bet its growth rate will be larger than it was this year going forward. We know what deals we have in place and we know we've got, I would say, quite good visibility into what our TPV looks like. So we're very comfortable with that projection on that and we're seeing it in our trend lines.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. ","Lisa Ellis","Good afternoon guys. A question on China. Now that you've successfully acquired the majority stake of GoPay and then signed the more recent expanded agreement with CUP, could you just provide a bit of color on your overall market entry strategy to the domestic market there? Meaning, are you more focused on say building out the presence of the PayPal wallet as a competitor to some of the local digital wallets? Or are you more focused on Braintree and building out broader payment processing? Could you give us a little bit of color there? Thank you. ","Dan Schulman","Yes, sure. I'll take that. And then John can do that. I\u2019d say Lisa the first idea that we had working with the PBoC is people now need to have a legal basis to have a payments license inside China to provide both cross-border and domestic payments capability. We worked over the last several years closely with the PBoC and we invested a lot of dollars and resources into our compliance and risk management efforts across the business. ","So not only do we have a close relationship with PBoC, but now with regulators around the world. That legal basis allows us to look at cross-border and work very closely with multinational that have established shop in China, one of the few platforms where that international payments traffic go over. We also now have the ability to work inside of China with either folks like CUP, other tech platforms, financial institutions inside China to link their cards into our wallet so Chinese consumers can use our platform to do purchases at our 24 million merchants outside of China. ","One of the most exciting things that we have though going on, because it has agreement that we have with UnionPay International and China UnionPay is really a landmark arrangement. I mean inside China, China UnionPay is the network, it's equivalent of deals that we might've struck with Visa, MasterCard, Discover and AmEx all in one. That's significant in terms of a player. Obviously, we have very close relationships with the banks and we believe that we can start linking their payment instruments into our wallet and China UnionPay and PayPal will be looking to expand acceptance of the PayPal wallet with Chinese merchants. And that will enable also travelers coming into China to be able to use PayPal wallet to purchase and as you know Lisa probably better than anybody on this call, if you're going to be buying things inside China, it is with your mobile phone, it is with QR codes, and if you\u2019re visitor coming it\u2019s difficult to start to do those purchases and you will now be able to use your PayPal account to go and do that. Again, this will take some time to develop and to implement but that is our vision. ","And I would also say in our conversations with some of the key players inside of China, other capabilities on our platform like full-stack processing. They are interested in utilizing those capabilities and working with merchants as well. So, it's a relatively comprehensive set of opportunities we have. I know some folks believe because obviously the strong positions that Ali and WeChat have inside the company, wondering how much opportunity. This is an exclusive market. We are going to be working hand-in-hand with key Chinese players inside the market. It's a strength in cross-border. And we think the combination of that offers a significant opportunity for us. Again, this will play out over time, but I have to say, we're pretty excited and investing against this opportunity.","John Rainey","Lisa, I'd add to that I think a couple of points. It is a significant investment that we are managing in 2020, and that we will carry into 2021. But it's also a significant opportunity. Just the estimates that I see is, by next year, China will be 40% of worldwide cross-border TPV. And this is a market where we have roughly 1% penetration into their 0.5 billion digital users. And you compare that to our core markets where we're significantly penetrated, if we can turn that 1% into 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%, that's a big opportunity for us. But I think one thing I want to emphasize around this investment is, the things that we're doing in China and the way that we're investing there, it\u2019s a scalable solution for other markets. So, we're approaching it as if there will be other opportunities where we can have a much more prominent presence in those markets versus kind of dabbling in some of these markets like we do today without our full product. And so, we're taking a very long-term perspective and investing appropriately given the significance of the opportunity.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research.","Darrin Peller","Hey. Thanks guys. Look, it\u2019s good to see your confidence in TPV growth being mid-20s again for the year. I assume a part of that is engagement. Engagement obviously did well this quarter, it was up 10%, it accelerated. Just I'd love to hear more about the drivers of that. How sustainable that is, do you expect that 10% growth rate to either stay the same or get better? And then when we think about Honey, a big part of our thesis on Honey is that the flywheel effect could help that even more. Can you just touch on the opportunity there as well? Thanks guys. ","Dan Schulman","Yes. Darrin, it\u2019s Dan. Thanks for that question. I think you know from talking to us that engagement is one of the most important drivers for us and we are very focused on it. When I started some almost six years ago now, we were at 17 times a year. We're at 41 right now. But our goal and we realize that this is aspirational, it's for somebody to use PayPal or Venmo every single day. That is our goal is to have daily engagement with that and we have a long ways to go before we get there. ","Honey, we think significantly increases our engagement with consumers. It allows us to be more towards the beginning of the shopping journey more towards the intent piece of this. The great thing is that one-third of all commerce transactions start with some sort of trigger based event whether that be a promotion or some kind of deal and Honey enables us to take a full advantage of this trigger based type of capabilities. ","And Honey is not just coupons, it's far from it, it's a mobile shopping assistance. It's an offers platform, it provides rewards. It has price tracking tools and alerts that are droplist and wishlist, that kind of thing. And so we think -- and by the way, Honey team had already saved, last year alone, its customers, a $1 billion of opportunity on products and services. And so we think there's a lot of opportunity for engagement and scaling of that Honey app is we integrate it into the PayPal and Venmo apps. ","But that's only one part of what we're thinking about in terms of engagement. We talked about Paymentus and a lot of what we -- people think about Paymentus as the full-stack integration that we're doing with them. But we're also going to be implementing bill pay capabilities into our consumer apps. ","Bill pay is obviously another form of engagement. John mentioned recurring payments whether it be your Spotify, Hulu, Disney, any of a number of recurring payment streams where we can make it simple and easy for you to pay that if your credit card expires, we'll automatically update it. You don\u2019t have to keep pulling that out. So we're going to do a turnaround that. And one of the big areas of opportunity for us is starting to move into the offline space. 10%, 12% of commerce is done online in mobile, that\u2019s obviously growing rapidly. But you look at the tremendous opportunity around the world and even here in the United States beginning to move into offline through things like whether it be iZettle capabilities on the merchant side, whether it be through all the parts and we are major issuer of cards right now tied into your PayPal account or through QR codes which we are already experimenting with. And if you look inside your PayPal app or your Venmo app, you will see prominently displayed a scan capability or the ability to show your own QR code to be scanned by merchant and we have the wherewithal in all Android phones but not Apple phones yet to be able to use the NFC chip to be able to do tap-to-pay capabilities. And so, that will be another big thing that we will be investing in this year, all around driving engagement. ","And the big thing about engagement, as you think about net new actives, when you get to be the scale that we are now with 305 million people on our platform, every time you start to improve that engagement, churns comes down as well and lifetime value starts to go up. And so, this can be a real flywheel for us and we are investing heavily in our engagement activities, and I would expect to see good engagement growth.","Operator","Thank you. And we have time for one last question from David Togut with Evercore.","David Togut","Thank you. Good afternoon. Bridging to Darrin's question, if you could perhaps expand upon integration plans and priorities for Honey Science? And then just as a quick follow-up, now that own Honey for a few weeks, any updated thoughts on capital allocation priorities between share repurchase and further acquisitions?","John Rainey","David, I'll start with the last part of your question and let Dan talk a little bit about some of the integration plans. We don't anticipate changing our capital allocation priorities going forward. And as a reminder, that's spending about 40% to 50% of our free cash flow towards returning -- buying back stock, returning cash to shareholders and then $1 billion to $3 billion per year in acquisitions. Again, I'd point you to the cash generation of our business and I think that gives us in some ways a competitive advantage versus the other players in the landscape that we compete with because we have the opportunity to go out and acquire companies and acquire capabilities as well as invest internally, as well as return cash to shareholders. And many times things that we want to go after inorganically allow us to be faster to market or to provide capabilities that we maybe think are better than others. And so, we will continue to be acquisitive. We will continue to return cash to shareholders and we will continue to invest in our shelves.","Dan Schulman","And David, let me drill in. But before I answer that, operator, I think we have time for one more question after this. So, maybe we will just keep the line open for one more additional question. So, a quick update on Honey. First of all, I said this in my opening remarks, I want to emphasize it, the caliber of that Honey team is extraordinary. They have great product and engineers. They react extraordinarily quickly. When we acquired Xoom, admittedly that was a number of years ago and our tech stack did not have a whole of the service-oriented architecture that we have today but we were able to -- with Xoom, it took us something like six to nine months to integrate log in with PayPal on to the Xoom app. With Honey, day number one, PayPal customers could log-in with their credentials right on to the Honey app. Day number one, they are doing cross-marketing together. We have a full plan over the course of the year by quarter on exactly functionality that we are integrating together. ","The big thing for us is to integrate Honey into our mobile apps. We have significant scale on those mobile apps and it\u2019s relatively heavy engineering lift. But we're looking at that in the back half of this year. But there are host of payment capabilities that we will integrate into the Honey app going forward that are our payment capabilities, credit type of capabilities. And so we've got a full integration plan in place. I'm pretty pleased with the execution against that. ","As John mentioned, our execution capabilities are humming along pretty well right now, and I do think the combination of Honey and PayPal is a very, very strong one. I think we can enhance the ways we serve both consumers and merchants. Merchants who are looking to us for full solutions right now are looking to our products to basically increase their sales in a world of digital commerce and Honey is a big tool set for that. And we're excited about working with not just 30,000 merchants they have today but pretty dramatically accelerating that. And obviously it drives engagement and savings for consumers. It enables us to move beyond checkout. We can enable personalized time and relevant offers for consumers and become a highly value-added partner to our merchants. So, we're quite excited about it, pleased with the integration so far, a lot to do, but we are very focused on it.","One more question, operator.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.","Heath Terry","Great. Thank you. I know you\u2019ve talked a lot about China and some of the other bigger initiatives in 2020 already. But can we step back and just talk about -- and maybe even prioritize sort of where those investment priorities in 2020 fall and the incremental costs that you see associated with them, where those fall in the guidance? And then, as we look out over time sort of the ability that you see to sustain operating margin expansion over time as you take on those incremental costs?","John Rainey","Sure, Heath. This is John. I'll tackle that. Well it's not a comprehensive list. I would say a couple of things that stand out in terms of our investment priorities for 2020. One would be the consumer value proposition, and a sub-bullet or sub-bullets underneath that are Honey as well as what we're doing with expanding offline point-of-sale offerings. So that's a big investment priority. Also Venmo is a big investment priority and I'd also throw in there international expansion, all of those -- and international expansion includes China. ","So all of those things are of significant cost and really are of a significant magnitude that absent that we'd be expanding operating margins again next year. But I'll point you to a number that I think maybe can help direct you to how think about our long-term capability to expand operating margin. So in the quarter, if you looked at our incremental operating margin, so the incremental growth in operating income divided by the incremental revenue was roughly 35%. And I think that's a fantastic number and one that's really been pretty consistent throughout the year, but at a much higher level than what it's been in previous years. And this is the point that I continue to go back to about our ability to grow our platform at a low incremental cost. ","And if we can continue to generate the type of revenue growth that we have and do it at a low marginal cost that results in incremental operating margins north of 30%, then I'm confident we're going to create a lot of shareholder value here. And I think that's a good way to think about our business long-term. ","Dan Schulman","Yes. I\u2019d just add to that. I mean I think about our guidance for 2020, this is the beginning of the eBay transition. We're ending the year closing in on $18 billion and we are talking about FX-neutral revenue growth of 18% to 19%. We're looking at, excluding acquisitions, something like 19% to 21% EPS growth especially absorbing the CECL impact on that. If you look over the last three years, our EPS CAGR has grown at 27%. And so we have really strong conviction in our ability to execute against our medium term guidance. And I think John is right, we want to invest, we want to seize growth opportunities that are ahead of us and do that in a way that's consistent with the medium term guidance that we've put out as well as execute year-over-year. ","So I think we're feeling like we're entering into 2020 in a strong position and it gives us more confidence than we had when we entered into last year and a lot of conviction around our medium term guidance.","Dan Schulman","So I want to thank you, Heath, for that question and thank all of you for joining us today. We really appreciate your time and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon. Thanks a lot. ","Operator","This concludes today's Q&A session.

Please go ahead.","Gabrielle Rabinovitch","Thank you, Sheri. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal Holdings' earnings conference call for the second quarter 2018. Joining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO, John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer and EVP, Global Customer Operations, and Bill Ready, our EVP, Chief Operating Officer.","We are providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being webcast and both the presentation and call are available through the Investor Relations section of our website. We will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about our company's performance. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call.","In addition, management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for third quarter and full year 2018, our medium term guidance and the impact and timing of our acquisitions. Our actual results may differ materially from these statements. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our results in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on the Investor Relations section of our website.","You should not rely on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today's date July 25, 2018. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update the information.","With that, let me turn the call over to Dan.","Dan Schulman","Thank you, Gabrielle, and thanks everyone for joining us. I'm pleased to report that PayPal had another strong quarter. As I said at our Investor Day, PayPal\u2019s greatest potential lies ahead of us and I believe the moves we made this past quarter position us to win in multiple segments of our total addressable market.","At the same time, we also continue to produce consistent and strong quarterly financial results. In Q2, we generated $3.86 billion of revenue, growing at 23% on a spot basis and 22% on a currency neutral basis.","We delivered $820 million in non-GAAP operating income, up 24% year-over-year, driven by our non-GAAP operating margin of 21.3%, which was up 25 basis points from last year. And we delivered $0.58 of non-GAAP EPS, up 28% year-over-year. These results set us up for a strong second half of the year and consequently we are raising our full year revenue and EPS guidance.","We had another quarter of strong customer growth and engagement. We added 7.7 million net new actives with new user growth up 18% year-over-year. This brings our total active accounts to 244 million.","Engagement on our platform increased 9% to just under 36 times per year, up from 33, a year ago. For the first half of the year, our net new actives equaled almost 16 million and we anticipate adding over 30 million net new actives for the year.","Our continued customer growth and engagement is driven in part by the success of three important areas of focus, our Customer Choice initiatives; our partnership strategy; and our focus on always being the customer champion.","Our commitment to Customer Choice continues to yield strong results. Today almost 85% of our active customers have Choice available to them and more than 45 million PayPal customers have adopted Choice. We anticipate Choice will be live in more than 200 countries by year-end.","Since we implemented Choice, calls per transaction into our contact centers are now at their lowest level since we began tracking this metric more than seven years ago.","In addition, we see a meaningful lift in engagement when our customers use Choice. Choice has also unleashed productive relationships with key strategic partners across the globe. PayPal increased our presence in the U.K. and India through partnerships with Santander, Clydesdale, and HDFC Bank.","Each of those financial institutions will now enable their customers to easily link their bank issued cards to their PayPal Wallet and open a PayPal account from their online channels.","We continue to build on our strategic partnership with South Korean credit card issuer ShinhanCard, where customers can now use an easy registration process to open a PayPal account through the ShinhanCard app and will receive a cash back reward from ShinhanCard for using PayPal.","Our relationship with Google continues to deliver more streamlined payment experiences. We announced this quarter that users in the US who add PayPal to any one of Google's services will soon be able to pay across the Google ecosystem anywhere that PayPal is offered as a payment method.","For example when a user adds PayPal to their Google Play account, it will automatically enable their linked PayPal account to be a payment option across popular Google services like Gmail, YouTube, Google Pay and Google Store, including where Google offers peer to peer payments. We strengthened our partnership with eBay. We signed an agreement to extend our long standing consumer financing offer to eBay's marketplace.","With this agreement, eBay will continue to accept and promote PayPal Credit through 2025. We are fully committed to being the ultimate Customer Champion company. Our focus on putting customer\u2019s first and delivering exceptional experiences has created meaningful customer trust and deep loyalty to the PayPal brand.","According to a recent ComScore study 52% of mobile consumers said they made more online purchases because PayPal was offered and fully one third of all PayPal mobile customers surveyed said they will abandon a purchase if PayPal is not offered as a checkout option.","This loyalty combined with our ability to offer experiences that drive checkout conversion rates of 89% is a truly differentiated value proposition for merchants around the world.","To further extend the value we deliver our merchant customers, we recently announced several new merchant products, including a brand new checkout experience with an exciting new tool called Smart Payment Buttons.","This new feature enables merchants to create personalized checkout experiences for their customers by dynamically presenting the most relevant payment methods at checkout.","In addition to being the only checkout solution to offer support for Pay with Venmo and PayPal Credit, the new PayPal checkout also includes the ability to enable local wallets and funding sources without additional integration work.","As part of PayPal checkout, we are also leveraging the power of One Touch to help merchants increase their customer acquisition efforts by reducing friction in their registration process.","When a customer was opting One Touch is creating or updating their user account with a merchant they can now choose to leverage their personal data securely stored within One Touch in order to auto populate most of the required account information.","Not only does this greatly simplify the registration process, but it also secures a funding source for their new account with the merchant enabling the consumer to start shopping immediately.","One Touch is the fastest adopted product in our history and it's now crossed 100 million consumers with 102 million consumers opted in and 9.5 million merchants offering One Touch.","84% of the IR100 now offer One Touch and the same ComScore survey I referenced earlier reveals that 55% of PayPal customers say they made more online purchases because of One Touch. These are game changing results for a product that was introduced only a few years ago and you can see that impact clearly in our mobile results.","Our mobile growth in Q2 was 49% with almost 54 billion of mobile volume processed in the quarter. Mobile checkout now represents 39% of our total payment volume.","And it's important to remember that the power of our two sided network combined with our revamp text app enables PayPal to provide all of these new experiences to our merchant customers without them needing to do any costly or inconvenient integration work.","Not only do these products and partnerships strengthen our proposition to merchants but they also further our mission to give our consumers more choice and flexibility in how they manage and move their money.","A clear example of this is our recently launched Venmo card. Developed in partnership with MasterCard the card lets Venmo customers use their balance to pay everywhere MasterCard is accepted in the United States both online and in store and the card can be used to withdraw funds from an ATM.","This offers Venmo customers more flexibility in where and how they want to pay and will give merchants more access to the coveted millennial segment.","We are quite pleased with the surge of initial demand for the Venmo card and it's another great indicator of the tremendous brand affinity that the millennial generation feels towards Venmo.","We continue to make good progress with our Pay with Venmo service. In the quarter, we added Uber and UberEATS to the list of major brands offering distinct Venmo buttons to their customers.","We have also seen considerable growth in our service that gives customers a faster way to transfer funds to their bank account for a small fee. Since launch 17% of Venmo users have engaged in a monetized experience.","In the quarter, Venmo continued its impressive growth by processing $14.2 billion in payment volume, an increase of 78% year-over-year. And Venmo net new actives hit another all-time record high in Q2, as its network effect and value proposition continue to strongly resonate.","I would now like to turn to capital allocation. We laid out our general thoughts around capital allocation at our Investor Day in May including returning cash to shareholders, acquisitions and investing organically in our company.","The addition of almost $7 billion of capital from the close of the Synchrony transaction provides us with both enhanced strategic flexibility and the opportunity to further increase the momentum in our consumer and merchant credit offerings.","In the quarter, we announced 4 acquisitions and several strategic investments. Each of these acquisitions is strategically focused around platform capabilities that will advance our merchant value proposition and geographic reach.","Between our acquisitions and the continuing drumbeat of new products and services being introduced by our product and engineering teams, we have catapulted into a leading digital payments platform for our merchant, technology and financial institution partners around the world.","In May, we announced our intention to acquire iZettle, a leading small business on the e commerce platform in Europe and Latin America. This acquisition which is expected to close in late Q3 will significantly expand our international and in-store presence and is strategically aligned with our desire to be a one stop full service solutions provider.","We share a common mission with iZettle and together we are committed to helping millions small businesses around the world grow and thrive in an increasingly global and competitive omni channel retail environment.","In May we announced the acquisition of Jetlore an AI powered prediction platform which is used by the world's top retailers including Uniqlo and Nordstrom. With Jetlore's talented team and their AI powered technology, we plan to enhance and accelerate PayPal Marketing Solutions, adding new capabilities that will continue to expand our value proposition for merchants beyond the online checkout experience.","This is an important area for us, as we increasingly become a full commerce solution for merchants focused on helping them grow their sales in a mobile first digital commerce world.","In June, we announced our intention to acquire Hyperwallet and earlier this month we closed the acquisition of Simility, building on our integrated payment solutions for fast growing e-commerce platforms and marketplaces. Hyperwallet is a leading global payouts platform that enables localized multicurrency payment distribution in more than 200 countries and territories.","Combining Hyperwallet's powerful payout solution with PayPal's scale and platform capabilities will bring increasing value to our customers particularly in the growing sharing economy. It immediately positions us as a leader in this increasingly important payments category.","Simility helps companies prevent fraud and manage risk in real time through advanced machine learning, big data analytics and data visualization capabilities. ","While PayPal already provides leading edge fraud management to our merchants, this acquisition will provide PayPal merchants the ability to more actively manage and control their fraud exposure. We believe this will naturally lead to increased sales volumes for our merchants.","Additionally we announced our participation in a $125 million round of investment in Pine Labs, one of India's leading point-of-sale solutions providers. Pine Labs offers POS devices that accept credit and debit cards, mobile wallets and services that run on India's unified payments interface, which is a government backed system that allows for instant bank to bank transfers.","This investment comes on the heels of PayPal launching our domestic operations in India and will further our focus in one of the most important markets in the world.","And finally, last week we announced a strategic investment in PPRO. This investment combined with a comprehensive commercial agreement provides us with the ability to extend over 100 alternate payment methods to our merchant and marketplace customers. The combination of these acquisitions and investments significantly enhances the breadth of services we can offer to consumers, merchants and online marketplaces.","PayPal is committed to being a comprehensive digital payments platform, offering complete solutions to our customers, as the world rapidly digitizes across both retail and financial services.","This was truly a remarkable quarter for us with teams across the globe delivering meaningful results and intensifying our focus on our customers. We successfully completed our transaction with Synchrony to free up cash for strategic and high value opportunities.","We brought innovative and differentiated products and services to our customers. We expanded our relationships with key strategic partners; and we continue discussions with many others around the world. I'd like to thank the PayPal team for their tremendous commitment to our customers and shareholders.","And with that I'll now turn the call to John.","John Rainey","Thanks Dan. The second quarter was another good quarter for PayPal. We delivered strong results financially and operationally demonstrating our continued momentum and the scalability of our model.","As Dan just highlighted we announced four acquisitions during the quarter, strengthening our two sided platform and further solidifying our position as a leading open digital platform for payments globally.","At our Investor Day in May we laid out our longer term strategic vision raised our medium term guidance and outlined our capital allocation priorities. And in the quarter, we returned $500 million to shareholders through share repurchases. In addition, earlier this month, we announced the closing of our sale of consumer credit receivables to Synchrony for approximately $6.9 billion in total consideration.","With the completion of this transaction PayPal and Synchrony have extended their existing co brand consumer credit card program and Synchrony is now the exclusive issuer of the PayPal Credit consumer financing program in the U.S. through 2028.","The interim accounting reclassification of the credit portfolio to held for sale from held for investment affected the presentation of our results in the quarter. These changes in addition to the cost to transition the portfolio reduced comparability to prior periods. Where relevant to the discussion I'll provide normalized results to adjust for these changes","Now for our financial performance in the second quarter. Our total payment volume was $139 billion up 27% on a currency neutral basis. Our merchant services volume grew 30% on a currency neutral basis to $123 billion.","Volume associated with eBay grew 6% on a currency neutral basis to $17 billion. eBay related volumes represented less than 12% of total payment volume for the quarter versus more than 14% in Q2 2017.","P2P volume which is a component of merchant services and includes volumes across core PayPal Venmo and Xoom grew 50% to $33 billion and represented approximately 24% of total payment volume versus 21% in Q2 2017.","In the second quarter, we added 7.7 million net new active accounts. We ended the quarter with 244 million active accounts which represents 15% growth over Q2 last year. This is the third consecutive quarter of 15% growth in active accounts.","On the consumer side active account growth was predominantly driven by core PayPal and Venmo. We also added more than 600000 merchants to our platform ending the quarter with more than 19.5 million merchants.","The number of payment transactions per active account on a trailing 12 month basis reached 35.7 with 8.7 billion transactions occurring on our payment platform over that period. In the second quarter transactions grew 28% to 2.3 billion.","Revenue in the quarter increased 23% on a spot basis and 22% on a currency neutral basis to $3.86 billion. Transaction revenue grew 20% on a spot basis from strength in core PayPal and Braintree.","Revenue from other value added services grew 49% driven by the acquisition of Swift and from held for sale accounting. Revenue also benefited from foreign exchange. Overall, our total revenue increased $52 million from a weaker U.S. dollar with $75 million of translation benefits partially offset by $23 million of hedging losses. This $23 million hedge loss compares to a $19 million hedge gains last year.","For Q2, our transaction take rate was 2.38% a decline of 19 basis points from the second quarter of 2017. And our total take rate was 2.77%, down 14 basis points year-over-year. More than 70% of the decline in total take rate is related to the growth in our P2P payment volumes and the $42 million headwind from hedging losses relative to last year.","Volume based expenses grew 24% in Q2 to $1.7 billion. Transaction expense was $1.4 billion and represented 98 basis points of TPV, a 1 basis point improvement over Q2 last year.","Lower funding costs from growth in P2P as well as the effect of foreign exchange more than offset funding mix pressure in growth in Braintree. Transaction loss in the quarter was $262 million or 19 basis points of TPV.","Loan losses were $72 million or five basis points as a rate of TPV down more than 40% from Q2 2017 as a result of held for sale accounting. For modeling purposes, we continue to expect loan losses to be in the range of five basis points as a rate of TPV for 2018.","Transaction margin dollars grew 23% to $2.2 billion adjusted for held for sale accounting transaction margin dollars were $2 billion representing 14% growth versus last year. For the quarter transaction margin as a rate was 56%. Again, adjusting for held for sale accounting transaction margin was 53%.","Non-transaction related expenses grew 21% in the quarter to $1.3 billion. Normalizing for the Synchrony transaction these expenses would have grown approximately 10% resulting in 345 basis points of operating leverage.","Further adjusting for acquisitions, we would've seen non-transaction related expenses grow only 7% for the quarter or $0.125 for every incremental dollar of revenue.","Relative to our recent trend, we experienced higher growth in G&A expenses in the second quarter. These expenses increased 33% or $73 million. The primary drivers of this increase were costs associated with our acquisitions and cost associated with the transition of the credit portfolio to Synchrony. In addition, we continue to see strong scalability in our customer support and operations organization.","In the second quarter, we experienced a record low customer contact rate. As a result customer support and operations expenses as a percentage of revenue leveraged 135 basis points in Q2 in comparison to the same period last year.","In the second quarter, operating income grew 24% to $820 million on 23% top line growth. This resulted in an operating margin of 21.3%.","Adjusting for the sale of the Synchrony and acquisitions, operating income grew 22% to $804 million. We continue to balance delivering operating margin expansion with reinvesting back into the business to further strengthen our platform and competitive positioning.","In the second quarter, other non-operating income increased $20 million year-over-year to $37 million. This increase was due primarily to an unrealized gain we recognized on an equity investment which was offset by net interest expense.","Our effective tax rate was flat to Q2 last year. And on a diluted basis, our weighted average share count was down 1% in the second quarter versus Q2 2017 as a result of share repurchases. Solid top line growth, in conjunction with operating discipline resulted in 28% growth in non-GAAP EPS to $0.58.","We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $6.3 billion and short term borrowings of $2 billion. Our cash balance does not include the proceeds from our Synchrony transaction, as it closed on July 2.","On a reported basis, our free cash flow was negative $170 million. Net new loans, included in cash flow from operations as a result of held for sale accounting reduced our free cash flow by $907 million.","However, on a normalized basis, adjusting for this accounting designation, our free cash flow in the second quarter was $737 million. This equates to approximately $0.19 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue.","Second quarter free cash flow also included a $161 million increase in cash taxes versus last year, primarily related to our first annual U.S. transition tax payment of $125 million. During the quarter we returned $500 million to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases, and year-to-date, we have completed $2.3 billion of buybacks.","We are pleased with the results of our previously announced capital allocation policy. It has so far achieved our goal of balancing organic and inorganic growth investments with the return of a significant portion of our free cash flow to shareholders.","Since separation in July 2015, we have announced $4.5 billion in acquisitions; and since our first repurchase authorization in early 2016, we have executed $4.3 billion in share repurchases. In May, at our Investor Day, we updated our guidance related to capital allocation and our plans for the next three to five years.","On average, we are targeting $1 billion to $3 billion of M&A per year and returning 40% to 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders over that period. We are also committed to optimizing our capital structure, while maintaining an investment grade rating, balancing inorganic and organic investing with margin expansion and continuing our strategy to diversify funding sources for our credit business to reduce capital intensity.","In support of the capital allocation framework that we articulated at Investor Day, today we are also announcing a new $10 billion share repurchase authorization. This new authorization further reinforces our ongoing commitment to capital return and disciplined capital allocation to support shareholder value creation.","Given the evolving and highly competitive payments landscape maintaining flexibility as it relates to our balance sheet is a priority. Even with the capital allocation framework we have outlined, our cash position and borrowing capacity will allow us to move aggressively where we see opportunities to bolster our position as a leading open digital payments platform.","It is also worth noting that meeting our customers' requirements to access their cash while meeting our commitments to global regulators are important aspects of our cash management activities.","Our cash balances are required not only to provide operational liquidity to our business but also to support these regulatory requirements. As such not all of our corporate cash is available for general corporate purposes.","At our Investor Day, we also provided an updated 3 to 5 year outlook to reflect the acceleration of our financial performance. This raised guidance incorporates our capital allocation priorities among acquisitions, share repurchase and capital expenditures.","Importantly, it also contemplates the Synchrony transaction as well as the evolution of our relationship with eBay following the expiration of the operating agreement. We raised our outlook on currency neutral compound annual revenue growth to 17% to 18% from 16% to 17% reflecting the strength of our business.","While we did not explicitly guide payment volume growth, we expect it to remain in the range of our previous guidance of mid 20% growth. In addition we indicated that we expect to realize operating margin expansion each year at approximately 20% compound annual growth and non-GAAP EPS.","Before I discuss our guidance for the remainder of 2018 I would like to discuss the impacts we expect in 2019 from our recently announced acquisitions. We currently anticipate $0.08 to $0.10 of EPS dilution on a non-GAAP basis from these transactions and we expect these acquisitions to be accretive to our earnings in 2020.","We plan to provide additional commentary on our expectations for 2019 when we report Q3. I'd now like to discuss our updated guidance for the full year as well as our outlook for the third quarter of 2018.","Our strong performance in the first half of 2018 has resulted in 23% revenue growth and 29% non-GAAP EPS growth. Incorporating both our performance year-to-date as well as our expectations for the back half of 2018 we are raising our full year 2018 revenue guidance to be in the range of $15.3 billion to $15.5 billion and raising non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $2.32 to $2.35.","At the midpoint of our range is this represents 18% revenue growth and 23% earnings growth. Excluding the revenue impact from the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables top-line growth at the midpoint of our range will be 21% on a currency neutral basis.","We are pleased to be providing this outlook today. We are raising our revenue and EPS guidance on meaningful momentum while absorbing the foreign exchange headwinds from the strengthening U.S. dollar and near-term earnings dilution from our acquisitions. Relative to our expectations when we last provided guidance, the U.S. dollar has strengthened versus our main international currencies by approximately 5%.","At current exchange rates revenue is negatively impacted by approximately $80 million in the back half of the year. Our earnings for the full year are largely protected from currency movements but revenue will continue to be partially exposed if the dollar continues to strengthen.","In addition, as it relates to our earnings for the full year we expect the iZettle acquisition to close late in the third quarter and the Hyperwallet acquisition to close in the fourth quarter.","We expect non-GAAP EPS dilution for 2018 to be approximately $0.02 from the combined impact of our acquisitions this year. For the year, we are raising revenue by $100 million.","This raise includes approximately $100 million of incremental revenue from momentum approximately $50 million of incremental revenue from acquisitions and our out-performance in Q2 partially offset by approximately $80 million of FX headwinds.","On EPS for the year we have raised our outlook by $0.01. Again this raise is meaningful given our expectation of $0.02 of dilution from acquisitions. Offsetting the dilutive effect from our acquisitions is our out-performance in the second quarter in addition to a $0.01 raise on momentum.","For the third quarter, we expect our revenue to be in the range of $3.6 billion to $3.67 billion. We expect earnings per share in the third quarter to be in the range of $0.53 to $0.55.","In Q3 at the midpoint of our ranges we expect non-GAAP EPS to grow approximately 500 basis points ahead of revenue growth and more than 50 basis points of operating margin expansion.","In summary we continue to make progress against our key strategic initiatives and we have good momentum across our business heading into the back half of the year. I would like to thank our customers and partners as well as our global team for delivering a strong quarter.","With that I'll hand it over to the operator for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from James Fossett with Morgan Stanley.","James Fossett","Thanks very much. I wanted to just ask quickly about the engagement and certainly impressive statistics there. But wondering if you're doing anything specifically to drive that engagement or how you can continue to move that forward. And I guess is a follow up one place where we noticed that things were varied versus our model is that the year-over-year decline in tax rate seems to -- or take rate excuse me seems to have picked up pace again in the first half of the year.","Can you breakout kind of what the key drivers are in take rate right now, and what our expectations should be going forward? Thank you.","Dan Schulman","So John will take that take rate James and I'll take the engagement question. I'll start off with that given the order of your questions. So first of all our net new actives and engagement we're obviously pleased with both the growth of engagement.","Q2 is a seasonally low quarter for us and we did 7.7 million net new actives 16 million in H1. And we're on track to do over 30 million in 2018 which is above our 2017 full year results. And as you know, that was by far in a way our best year by a long shot.","So to your point, specifically though engagement actually accelerated to 9%. It had been growing by about 8% for the previous two or three quarters and it went up to 9% and to almost now three times a month. And our view on that is we expect that to continue. We've got a number of tailwinds around engagement.","First of all, I think our customer experiences are better than they've ever been before. You look at One Touch, its conversion rate at -- as you saw from some of those ComScore studies and the surveys that have been done, people want to use the service more.","As a result of that, we've done a tremendous amount of enhancements around P2P. Choice is leading to more engagement. We've got a new app, and we have a whole new suite of services. The Venmo card is going to lead to more engagement. We have the PayPal Cash Card, that's going to lead to more engagement.","And so I think - and then of course, we've got rewards coming on in the later part of this year with some of our key financial institution partners. And so I think we're going to continue to see engagement grow at a nice clip going forward.","And I think it bodes well obviously to have both more customers coming on than ever before, using this service more than they ever have. And if you look at new cohorts versus older cohorts, our new cohorts are more engaged than our older cohorts.","Most of the time, you'd expect as you grow your net new actives, you get more and more that maybe the quality of those net new actives aren't the same as what they were before. It's actually the opposite here.","The new net new actives are more engaged than our previous cohorts, which by the way means, we have a potential opportunity to educate our older customers on all the new services that we have as well. So, we\u2019re feeling pretty good about both net new actives and engagement. I'll turn it over to John to talk about take rate.","John Rainey","Sure. It's good to speak with you James. If you look at the composition of the decline in our take rate, just take our total take rate of 2.77% for the quarter, the 14 basis points decline, approximately 70% of that was due to two things. First is P2P. The growth in P2P, which has been a familiar story for several quarters right now.","But maybe more pronounced this quarter the second thing was the year-over-year swing in hedges. That's a $42 million delta year-over-year. So that accounts for that. So I believe those were about 10 basis points of the 14 basis point decline. Beyond that, it's just the normal changes related to mix in our business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from George Mihalos with Cowen.","George Mihalos","Great. Thanks guys and congrats on another strong quarter. Dan, just again as you think about the competitive environment now with some newer participants going public and the like, can you maybe talk a little bit about differentiating the PayPal value proposition?","And just maybe more specifically is the big differentiator really the conversion rate of the PayPal Wallet and your ability to sort of deliver that seamlessly with Venmo sort of, one integration if you will into the merchant base?","Dan Schulman","Yes. First off thanks for the question, George. So I think a couple of things on competition. First of all, obviously, we respect all of our competitors. We learn from them but we are really focused on our customers and what their needs are.","And that's what we pay a tremendous amount of attention to and we feel that we can solve their pain points better than anybody else. We'll continue to win and be a leading platform in the digital payment space.","Secondly I'd say it's obviously not a zero sum game. Yes, we're operating in what we think is $100 trillion total addressable market which is rapidly digitizing as online and off line is blurring. And we have a very small share of that total TAM. So it's very early innings. And that's why we said at our Investor Day that we think our greatest potential lies ahead.","In terms of differentiation from the competitive set I think we have quite a number of different things that we've done. First of all with the advent of choice and becoming an open platform it did redefine the competitive landscape. We are now working with financial institutions networks and technology companies as partners.","I mean, before it was much more characterized as frenemies [ph] people were - many people question whether these allies of us now we're going to move into the payment space.","And really they're taking the best of our digital platform the best of their assets and we're working together to create unique value propositions that neither of us could do alone. So in many ways a lot of the competitive intensity is more benign than it was several years ago. But again there is much more it than that because this is all we do.","This is - we are a digital payments platform. We control the full end to end value proposition which is unlike many of our competitors. We actually are trying to redefine the game.","Many of the players in the space when they come to customers come with point solutions or point products. And we are coming with an overall solution set that goes beyond just either checkout or helping customers now to grow their sales and we're really trying to provide a differentiated not a commoditized service for our customers.","When you look at a scale that we have and the network effect and the loyalty to this sort of two sided platform it's very, very different than a lot of our competitors. A lot of our competitors offer one side of that network or try to offer the other side. Only we can offer this two sided platform.","And if you remember from that ComScore study having a consumer base that one-third of the mobile customers that were surveyed would abandon a purchase if it didn't have PayPal. That's an incredibly compelling thing for our merchant partners to want to always have a branded PayPal presence on their platform.","And honestly our products and our services they just perform better. I mean you mentioned conversion rate and I think that is one of the biggest things advantages that we have. Almost two times that of a general marketplace in terms of conversion at 89% and so I think there are a host of differentiated features that we have.","But I don't if you want to add to any of this. But we feel pretty good about our competitive position. And honestly with all the acquisitions that we've just done the new products we're putting into the market that actually - our differentiation is expanding as we look forward. Anything you'd want to add to that?","John Rainey","No. You covered it well. The point Dan was making about the breadth of the platform. I think that is most enhanced by the two sided nature of what we do and our ability to control the experience end to end.","So that conversion rate that Dan was alluding to at the end of the day when customers are being payment today they're looking more toward how do you help acquire a customer versus how you give better access to sort of legacy dial tone or point of sale solutions.","That two sided platform is what allows us to deliver that conversion rate. It's nearly double what you see from everything else out there and that that is extraordinarily difficult to replicate. Many have tried it is very difficult to do and I think we are quite distinct in that regard that stands out as one of our biggest differentiators as a key part of all those elements of our platform as we compare those up against others. And it\u2019s a big part why we're just taking market share tremendously.","Dan Schulman","I mean, I think the whole thing we're trying to do is to be the sort of operating system for digital commerce. If you think about merchants that are creating now apps to add value add to their customers one of the biggest issues they run into is friction in terms of getting people to sign up for those apps.","One of the things I talk about in my remarks is the ability for us when a customer opts in to seamlessly populate a merchant app and then not just populate with customer experience information but with the funding instrument so immediately that customer can shop. Those little types of things are incredibly valuable for merchant partners in general.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.","Heath Terry","Great. Thank you. Dan, I guess one thing on the decision to allocate as much as you have to share buybacks. Given the track record that you've got generally with your acquisitions is that reflective of the opportunity set that you see out there in potential acquisitions in the - post the four that you've done?","What's the right way to read the tradeoff there particularly given the kind of growth acceleration you have been able to get out of some of the acquisitions that you made in the past?","And then I guess just one area I want to make sure that we understand the right way the deceleration in growth in - particularly on the TPV side that we saw in the international business on an FX neutral basis any real distinction that you'd want to call out for the gap between that and the acceleration that you saw in the U.S?","Dan Schulman","Yeah. I'll start with the first one and then John will talk about the second one. So we're just trying to be consistent with the medium term guidance that we gave in -- at our Investor Day.","We said we were going to return somewhere around 40% to 50% of our free cash flow over the next three to five years which was our medium-term guidance. In order to assure shareholders that that would be the case the board authorized a $10 billion share buyback and so that's just consistent with that.","We firmly believe that there are a lot of opportunities for us to continue to acquire best in class capabilities to acquire positions in different geographies around the world through either investments or acquisitions. And as we said at the Investor Day, we are targeting $1 billion to $3 billion a year to go and do that.","Now we look at hundreds of different opportunities every single quarter. And also remember that obviously our internal innovation is accelerating. I think Bill and his team have done an incredible job over the last several years in just transforming, how much product we can put out into the marketplace.","Our partnerships are allowing us to do things that we might have had to acquire before or develop internally like a rewards program. Now that will happen in partnership with the financial institutions who are now our partners.","But there are always capabilities out there like a Hyperwallet or an iZettle where it would take us either a lot of time or a lot of resource to develop. They are solely focused on that capability as a best in class and a good customer list and a modern platform to go and do that. And where we see that we're going to obviously be disciplined and I would think about it financially, but we will continue to be quiet acquisitive going forward.","We do think we have a chance both on the merchant side from a platform perspective, but also from the consumer side as we look to be much more in the middle of how consumers manage and move their money that there are opportunities for us to continue to be acquisitive.","And we're not ruling out the ability for us to do a larger acquisition if that comes around. But we're going to be much more - have a lot more scrutiny around that kind of thing. Larger acquisitions are inherently more risky and they prevent us from doing other things.","So we're not ruling that out. But in our guidance that we've done in our medium-term outlook, there's that cash return to shareholders that $1 billion to $3 billion a year on average that we'll do an acquisition, so no change really from Investor Day.","John Rainey","Heath, this is John. As it pertains to what we're seeing internationally as it relates to TPV and revenue, there's two things maybe to call out. But the first is that anytime that - and this is what I'm about to say is very consistent with what we've seen historically.","But when there are sharp changes in currencies not only is there going to be an effect on the translation of those revenues into our financial statements, but we see the effect on consumer behavior as well.","And so there is \u2013 you are seeing a little bit of that with the movements in currency. There's also -- we see a little bit of weakness on the eBay part of the business. But I'll tell you that the fact that we are raising our guidance for the year despite that is I think a strong indication of the diversification of our portfolio the fact that we are much less reliant on them than we have been historically and we expect that trend to continue. So pretty excited about the trends in the business notwithstanding those couple of issues.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research.","Dan Schulman","Hi, Darrin.","Darrin Peller","Thanks, guys. Hey, guys. Thanks. Listen, you're trending at around 22% currently at constant currency on revenues. But if we were to add that to seven points of annualized from Synchrony in the second half it still implies a bit of a decel [ph] a couple of hundred bps for the second half of the year. And I guess a just wanted to hear if there's anything specific on that or it's just conservatism.","And then just a quick follow up for I guess either Dan or Bill, and it really has to do with monetization of Venmo which looks like you guys are calling out just so many more opportunities than just Pay with Venmo now with instant deposit and with a card. Can you give us more idea what inning are we on each of those. Because it seems like a bigger opportunity than we initially thought it could be.","Dan Schulman","I'll start with revenue and then turn it over to the others. The trends in our business are strong. I want to very clearly call that out as we talked about with a guide about $100 million of our increase is related to momentum. We certainly do see an impact being a multinational company from FX headwinds and that's pretty significant in the back half of the year so that has an impact.","And then Darrin there are always things that can affect one quarter to the next. One example is that we're lapping Tio from last year. That was $20 million of revenue for us in the third quarter so not an insignificant amount.","And then there are other things that we put in place last year, product changes that we monetized that we're lapping. So there are a couple of comps from one period to the next. But the trends in our business are still very strong and we're actually quite excited as we get ready to step up into 2019.","Bill Ready","Yes. And on the Venmo monetization side, we're certainly still in the early innings there for sure. We put out a great set of products that we see users really engaging with strongly.","As you called out you have Pay with Venmo that is seeing really nice demand from merchants the best merchants and apps out there putting dedicated Venmo. Like Uber and Uber Eats and Grubhub, Eat24, Seamless and many others and we think we'll see a steady drumbeat of those coming on.","There is a great pipeline of those adding in dedicated Venmo buttons. In addition to the two million plus merchants that are already accepting Pay with Venmo via PayPal, Instant Cash Out has seen really great pick up.","The Venmo card as Dan remarked earlier on has seen really, really strong interest from our customer base. And so we see a real composite of those things like smart buttons that will allow more people easily have a dedicated Venmo buy button.","We think there's a lot left in front of us there. It will be a multiyear journey. We're relieved following the path PayPal, PayPal started it out as P2P only. It was a multiyear journey as PayPal then became a broad merchant services platform with a broad set of commerce.","But we see Venmo trending along nicely, really positive response of 17% of users engaging in a monetized experience so far this year. And that's what's getting these products out to market.","And so we think we're very much in the early innings. There's a lot left ahead of us. And to be clear, it's a multiyear journey. We think these things will play over multiple years, but were off to a great start.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI.","David Togut","Thanks for taking my question. With the announcement by the U.K. payment system regulator this week that they're reviewing merchant acquiring practices in the UK, could you comment on whether you expect to be included or exempt from that? And clearly you have a unique two sided payment platform, but I'd be curious on your thoughts.","Dan Schulman","Bill you want to take that?","Bill Ready","Yes. I think I would just say it's evolving we're watching it closely, too early to comment on that. But we work closely with regulators. And generally, we have been a great partner to the ecosystem delivering a lot of value to our customers.","And so any of these kinds of regulatory movements we're hand in hand with the regulators on those things, still playing out too early to comment. But we think that there's not a particular exposure that we will call out at this time.","David Togut","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And we do have time from one last question and that is coming from Tien-tsin with JPMorgan.","Tien-tsin","Thanks so much. I wanted to ask maybe for Bill just the new PayPal checkout smartbuttons I mean it feels like a pretty big enhancement especially overseas. I know you had a question on international earlier. How would you rank the importance of this upgrade in relation to enhancements like say One Touch?","I mean, how can we gauge success? And just as my follow-up I'll ask it together on Venmo monetization. Could we see a step up in your marketing budget or a spend going to the holidays on both the cards and the commoners opportunity around Venmo? Thanks.","Bill Ready","So I'll start with Venmo and come back with smart buttons. The really interesting thing on Venmo is that there's always been such great rally and just inherent interest from consumers on it that we historically have seen very little marketing cult dollars to get to the growth that we have.","We just had our biggest quarter over ever of new users on Venmo and great growth of $14 billion and volume up 78% year-on-year. And we're basically spending next to nothing on marketing because our users to our marketing for us.","Really Venmo users tell other users about the product and platform. And so that has allowed us to really not have to spend a lot on marketing. Certainly though as we see good traction with these things we will absolutely think about how we can augment that.","But it's a great win. You don't have to artificially complete demand. There's a really strong demand for customers organically and then we can augment that as we need to, but we really has fantastic organic demand without us having to go do much of marketing.","Dan Schulman","Some of our partners will go marketing around it because they're excited about it.","Bill Ready","That's exactly right. And then on smart payment buttons as we've talked about before our ability to go distribute new experiences to merchants without merchants having to do work is a key structural advantage that we have versus legacy payment platforms.","And it's why we're able to deliver a greater conversion and rollout products like One Touch to 9.5 million plus merchants in 200 markets without them doing work. Smart payment buttons is an advanced to that.","So we see that this really quite important at the fact that it's got a handle not only our own payment method like PayPal, PayPal Credit, Venmo dynamically presenting those when they are most relevant so that merchants don't have to worry about the confusion of too many buttons at checkout. We are also adding an alternative payment method.","And we think it's quite meaningful in that it democratize is access to this long-tail of alternative payments as you go country by country. There\u2019s been some other providers out there that have done that but those have been big heavy enterprise type solution, so it's really only a handful of merchants that can get access to those things.","We think we can get that to many millions of merchants which is a game changer in terms of merchants having access to the most relevant payment methods to offer to the consumer at any moment in time.","And I think this further distances us from competition in terms of how we deliver better conversion and better customer acquisition, which is really the game that we play quite differently than others where we think of ourselves as in the business of driving conversion of customer acquisition versus much of the legacy payments industry or traditional players are providing access to dial tone access to peace of the payment ecosystem versus we\u2019re driving customer acquisition and smart paying button as a great examples of that.","Dan Schulman","Okay. Well, thank you everybody for joining us today. We appreciate your time and we look forward to speaking to all of you soon. Thanks very much.","Operator","This concludes today's question-and-answer session. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference call. This concludes the program.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Ms. Rabinovitch, you may begin.","Gabrielle Rabinovitch","Thank you, Andrea. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal Holding's earnings release conference call for the first quarter 2016. Joining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO; and John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer. We're providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being broadcast on the Internet and both the presentation and call are available through the Investor Relations section of our website.","In discussing year-over-year comparisons, including guidance growth rates for the second quarter and full year 2016, we have chosen to present non-GAAP pro forma metrics. We believe that these metrics provide investors a consistent basis for reviewing the company's performance across different periods. We will also discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about our company's performance including the non-GAAP pro forma metrics mentioned above. You can find a reconciliation of these metrics to the most directly comparable GAAP metrics in the presentation accompanying this conference call.","In addition, management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for second quarter and full year 2016. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in this call.

You should not rely on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today's date, April 27, 2016. We disclaim any obligation to update the information.","With that, let me turn the call over to Dan.","Daniel Schulman","Thank you, Gabrielle. Before I start my remarks, I want to take a quick moment to officially welcome you. We're thrilled to have you join PayPal as our new head of IR. And I want to thank all of you on the call for joining us. We know how busy your schedules are, so we appreciate your time.","I'm very pleased to report that PayPal delivered strong financial results for the first quarter of 2016. In many ways, this was our best quarter in the time since I joined PayPal and it's gratifying to see the company execute against our goals. The mission of PayPal is clear. We want to become an everyday essential financial service for consumers and provide a full service solution and platform that enables digital commerce for merchants around the globe. And we continue to make tangible and consistent progress towards that vision.","We are showing strong growth across all of our operational metrics. We ended the quarter with 184 million active accounts, up from 179 million last quarter. Our enhanced value proposition is attracting new users at an accelerating rate and in turn, attracting new partners, and new merchants. The larger our scale, the more important and relevant we become in the ecosystem as our network effect becomes ever stronger.","Our increased scale combined with continued growing engagement resulted in some of the strongest payment volume and revenue growth rates in our recent history, and clearly demonstrate our leadership in digital and mobile payments around the world. Our total payment volume growth, or TPV, accelerated to 31% on an FX-neutral basis. And our merchant services volume grew a record 39%, leading to revenue growth of 23% on an FX-neutral basis. We ended the quarter with over 14 million merchant accounts. I just pause on that number for a moment. Our two-sided network with 14 million merchants on one side and over 170 million buyers on the other is one of our key competitive advantages and extremely difficult to replicate.","We are proud to have added this quarter popular and influential brands like Crate and Barrel, Sephora, Air France, FreshDirect, Panera Bread and Woolworths, which is the largest grocery chain in Australia serving more than 28 million customers each week. These brands joined a growing list of companies that are choosing PayPal. As I mentioned, merchant services payment volume grew 39% on an FX-neutral basis, significantly higher than the rate of e-commerce growth. Our increasing ability to innovate and lead transformative change for merchants and consumers is not only accelerating our competitive differentiation, but enabling us to once again increase our share in a dynamic and competitive environment.","Each quarter, we measure the success of our business against four key metrics: our top line growth, our net active customer base, our customer engagement, and our ability to generate strong free cash flow.","I'm pleased to report we delivered strong performance against each of these metrics.","Let me start with revenue. We grew our top line to $2.54 billion, up 23% on an FX-neutral basis or 19% on a spot basis. This was our strongest quarter for revenue growth in the last five quarters. As I mentioned, we ended the quarter with 184 million active accounts, demonstrating another strong quarter of customer acquisition.","All of you know by now that our long-term aspiration is to position PayPal as an everyday part of our customers' financial lives. And increasing the level of customer engagement is one of our primary measures of success in that goal. And despite an ever increasing account base, I'm pleased to say we grew the annual transactions for active account from 25 in Q1 a year ago to 28 this quarter, which resulted in PayPal processing 1.4 billion transactions for our customers during the quarter, up 26% year-over-year. Customer engagement was driven by significant enhancements to our value proposition, and by the debut of PayPal's first Super Bowl ad, which drove significant increases in the perception of PayPal in the weeks that followed the commercial's first airing.","And last but certainly not least, we generated strong free cash flow of $605 million in Q1, up over 70% year-over-year. I'm obviously pleased with the quarter's results, but we still have much to execute throughout the rest of the year. We need to continually innovate if we are to widen the distance between our value proposition and that of our competition. And in keeping with that focus, Q1 saw the introduction of several strong new product experiences across our global customer base.","We launched a new fundamentally redesigned PayPal mobile app in 145 markets simultaneously, in 17 languages, across both iOS and Android operating systems. The app is built on an iterative platform so that we can now easily customize and localize new features across all the markets where it's live. The new experience is driving increased consumer engagement, increased send and request money transactions and will enable our consumers to use their mobile phone online, in app or in store with both NFC and QR capabilities.","Venmo continues to go from strength to strength, processing nearly $3.2 billion in payment volume in Q1, up over 150% from last year. And its subscriber base continues to grow at an ever-accelerating rate. We made good progress with our Pay with Venmo pilot. Early customer results and feedback have provided strong validation around the demand for Venmo as a way to pay in app. This feedback has helped us to fine tune our processes, procedures and value proposition. And we have now widened our pilot to include approximately 550,000 Venmo users. We are on track to expand to more merchants and open the service to our full Venmo customer base in the second half of this year.","We introduced PayPal Commerce, a set of tools and APIs which are currently in beta that make it easier for merchants to securely sell across multiple context; e-mail, social share, blogs, articles, ads, in-app, and anywhere consumers are online or on their mobile devices. This new offering is the result of the rapid integration of the technology and the team we gained through the acquisition of Modest in August 2015. It is a critical element of the full service suite of capabilities we are building into our merchant platform as we help retailers move fully into digital commerce.","Our increased pace and global scale of innovation is fueled by the investments we have made in our core infrastructure and platform. They are designed to drive agility and innovation across our entire software stack. We run one of the largest private cloud environments in the world. We follow industry best practices of agile software development, continuous integration and delivery using open source technologies. These investments have enabled our developers to push code several times a day, allowing them to iterate new features faster and get instant customer feedback.","To drive that point home, the number of production deployments has increased by 200% compared to last year. Our increased ability to innovate on a global scale and deliver on our commitments is a primary reason why PayPal is becoming the partner of choice for companies around the world, including some of the leading tech companies and the largest wireless carriers in Mexico, Latin America and Europe.","Telcel and Claro are implementing our platform to help their 140 million consumers manage their money and make every day purchases using their mobile devices. These digital wallet offerings are now in trial and we expect a full rollout in the second half of the year starting in Mexico and Brazil. The app will be available for download for both the Android and iOS and consumers will be able to easily create and manage a new PayPal account using only their smartphone and will be able to pay for basic Telco services including topping up their prepaid phones and buying related data plans.","Eventually, they will be able to conveniently pay for services from other merchants as well as paying bills, and sending money. Our partnership with Vodafone in Europe will have tens of millions of European customers to use PayPal as their preferred way to fund their payments. And for the first time, consumers with Android smartphones at Visa contactless terminals will be able to tap, to pay in store. We are now live in our first market, Spain, and we anticipate expanding across Europe throughout the back half of 2016. Our partnership with Vodafone delivers what consumers, businesses and European regulators want, better products, more choice and greater transparency.","In the quarter, we also extended our relationships with both Alibaba and Facebook. Our pilot with Alibaba Wholesaler has been extended and we will now do a full rollout to include new countries and merchants. And our partnership with Facebook continues to expand nicely, both in the Messenger and Facebook Shop applications and as a key partner across a wide range of their core payments' experiences.","Q1 also saw us deepen and expand our relationship with commerce platforms that make selling online and on mobile simpler for businesses around the world. We signed an agreement with WooCommerce to make PayPal their preferred payment extension for their platform. We also extended our relationship with Shopify, one of the largest commerce platforms which powers 243,000 businesses in approximately 150 countries to provide all new Shopify merchants with PayPal as their default payment experience.","One Touch expanded to merchants in an additional 121 markets across Asia, Europe and Central America, making it available to merchants in 144 markets and it's now available to consumers in all 203 markets in which we operate. One Touch is the most rapidly adopted product PayPal has ever launched. It now has some 21 million consumers who have proactively opted in and we anticipate well over 2 million merchants will have One Touch enabled by year end.","We continue to see meaningful engagement and conversion lift with the use of One Touch, enabling both consumers and merchants to have a more seamless and friction-free checkout experience. In fact, a recent comScore study rated PayPal's conversion rate for merchants at 87%, with the next highest service at 51%. Clearly for merchants and consumers, PayPal is a far superior choice.","I'm also very pleased with the performance of our Xoom acquisition and our integration efforts. Global expansion meaningfully accelerated in the first months following the close of the acquisition. So far this year, Xoom has expanded its service to 11 new countries with two more countries coming very shortly. These include Haiti, Nigeria and Slovakia and we also announced an integration with M-Pesa in Kenya.","Xoom continues to be a market leader in mobile, with some 70% of transactions in the quarter happening on a mobile device. And Q1 was a record activation quarter, with net new actives up over 70% year-over-year as we begin to see some of the synergies we expected come to fruition.","Being a leading global payments provider requires exceptional effort and continued investment in our risk and compliance functions across all of our markets and all of our product areas. There are many reasons to do this. We live in a time where global terrorism and cybercrime are on the rise and as a result, increasing our focus on compliance is obviously the right thing to do.","But we are also investing in these areas because we know that a strong risk and compliance infrastructure is a deep competitive advantage. And the more advanced our capabilities in these areas, the greater the trust our customers will have in PayPal and in our ever-expanding value proposition. A great example of this is the relationship we have built with our regulators as it relates to our PayPal Credit offerings. We have seen our Net Promoter Score for PayPal Credit jump to over 70% in March, a clear demonstration that what regulators want and what we want are truly aligned around delighting and protecting our customers.","I'll end my remarks with the following reflection. Although Q1 was clearly a strong start to 2016, we still have a lot of work ahead of us in order to deliver on our product roadmap and expand our leadership position. We have an expansive and an important mission. And I can assure you our team is focused on executing, partnering within our ecosystem and driving new innovative and meaningful value to our merchants and consumers.","And with that, let me hand it over to John.","John Rainey","Thanks, Dan. I also want to thank all PayPal's customers and our 17,000 employees worldwide for making this another great quarter.","Transactions, payment volume and revenue growth, all accelerated from the previous quarter. Total payment volume was $81 billion, an increase of 31% on a currency-neutral basis. Of that, U.S. payment volume grew 30% while international growth was 32%. We grew faster than e-commerce market and continue to gain market share.","Our share gain demonstrates that our strategy is working as we focus on being the customer champion and move from being a payment button to an end-to-end payment solution for merchants of all sizes. We added 4.5 million new active accounts, ending the quarter with 184 million. We continue to extend our global reach with 56% of the total active accounts outside of the U.S. The number of payment transactions in the quarter increased 26% year-over-year, driven predominantly by the increasing relevance and ubiquity of our platform, as we continue to have strong growth in our core business and Braintree.","In addition, PayPal is driving the growth of mobile payments and an increasing amount of our business is conducted on mobile devices. During the quarter, we processed $21 billion of mobile payment volume, which was up 54%. With capabilities and services like peer-to-peer, credit, and remittances, as well as strong mobile growth, we are becoming more relevant in our customers' daily lives. As a result, the number of payment transactions per active account increased to 28, up 12% from a year ago.","We generated more than $2.5 billion of revenue in the first quarter, up 23% on a currency-neutral basis. Of that, transaction revenue increased 21%, which benefited from rising engagement as reflected by the increase in the number of payment transactions for active customer account. This increase also reflects the growing relevancy of Braintree as we move from a payment button to a full services payment partner where we capture all of the merchants' processing volumes.","Revenue from other value-added services grew 38% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by the growth of PayPal Credit as well as the amended contract with Synchrony Financial last year. We continue to demonstrate good control of our expenses. Total expenses were $2 billion, up 20%. Our volume based expenses, which are transaction expense and transaction and loan losses, were up 32%, in line with payment volume. Other expenses grew at approximately half the rate of revenue growth as we gained economies of scale. Excluding Xoom, which was not in our results in the first quarter last year, our other expenses increased only 6%.","As we stated in the past, our strategy is to expand our presence with large merchants, which increases our relevance with consumers but results in a lower take rate from volume-based pricing. This strategy has driven accelerated volume and revenue growth as well as market share gains. Our fast-growing Braintree platform also provides solutions for large and next generation merchants and brings with it a higher mix of card payments. As a result, our overall transaction margin for the quarter declined 380 basis points.","While large merchants in Braintree contribute to a lower overall transaction margin, they increased our overall operating income dollars. In the quarter, operating margin declined 70 basis points from the same quarter a year ago. Excluding Xoom, however, our margin increased, demonstrating that our core business is performing well and we are doing a good job controlling costs. We are one quarter in after completing the acquisition of Xoom and we are even more excited about what it brings to the platform. But as I previously stated, Xoom will be dilutive to operating margin in 2016.","In the quarter, our capital expenditures were $133 million, or approximately 5% of revenue. Free cash flow in the quarter was $605 million, representing $0.24 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue. This was higher than we expected from better operating results as well as the timing of certain working capital items. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $6.4 billion, including approximately $1.4 billion in the U.S.","And now to guidance, our business is performing great and we are executing on our strategy and delivering on our commitments. Our strong performance in Q1 reinforces our conviction in our strategy and the opportunity before us. We still have three quarters to execute against for the year, but we are off to a good start. As a result, we are affirming our full year guidance ranges for 2016.","However, I'd like to provide you with some context for how we're thinking about the year. The retail landscape continues to be mixed. And we still face pressure from the movement of currencies relative to the dollar on our international business. We continue to see volume accelerate across our platform, driven in part by strong growth of our newer businesses. The mix shift to these newer businesses where we are investing puts pressure on our transaction margin, which good cost control will help offset. There is still much of the year to play out but our first quarter performance provides us with increased confidence in achieving our goals.","As I stated on the call last quarter, we had some lumpiness in our revenue growth due to several one-time items in 2015. Consistent with our guidance last quarter, we expect an approximate six point deceleration in year-over-year revenue growth from the first quarter to the second quarter, primarily due to the sale of a portion of our credit receivables, and the impact of the amended Synchrony agreement last year, both of which were virtually 100% margin. For the second quarter, we expect revenue growth on a currency-neutral basis to be between 16% and 18%.","We expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.34 and $0.36. We plan to return to a more normalized growth rate in the back half of the year. Our business model of strong top line growth, expense control and low capital intensity, gives us the ability to consistently generate strong free cash flow. We have a tremendous opportunity to increase shareholder value with the deployment of that cash flow. We initiated the share buyback program that was announced on our last earnings call and repurchased 17 million shares at an average price of $35 per share.","I'd like to take a moment to talk about our credit products, which complement our digital payments platform. Credit represents approximately 2% of TPV and has been relatively consistent at that level over the last couple of years. Credit is a flywheel for PayPal, which benefits both our consumers as well as our merchants. It drives payment volume growth and increases choice for our customers by providing them with flexible payment options and allowing customers to pay over time.","But credit benefits PayPal in many ways beyond just a payment transaction. Credit reduces cart abandonment, leading to increased conversion for merchants and an increase in basket size on purchases for the average purchase of a credit customer is 20% to 30% larger. Additionally, our working capital product continues to gain momentum and helps to deepen our relationship with merchants while helping them grow. We typically see merchant sales increase after receiving our working capital loan. Satisfaction rates are very high and we experience reduced merchant churn.","Beginning this quarter, we designated $800 million of European customer balances held in our Luxembourg banking subsidiary to be used to extend credit to our European customers, which would have previously been funded with our own cash. The use of the full amount of these funds will depend upon the growth of our European credit business. This is a highly efficient source of funding to support our credit business and we continue to explore alternatives to pursue an asset-light model.","In closing, we are off to a strong start to the year. As a technology platform leader, operating globally at scale, we are driving the digitization of payments in a large, dynamic and growing industry. We are focused on delivering shareholder value with our strong revenue growth and cash generation. We're excited about the opportunity ahead, and look forward to sharing more at our Analyst Day next month.","With that, let me turn it back to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks. You guys spoke to the decline in the transaction margin and it was pretty significant year-over-year. I guess two related questions. One is how should we think about the trajectory of that margin going forward in terms of the declines related to mix? And then second, as far as lower European Interchange is concerned, should we assume that the first quarter is fully loaded for that impact? Thanks.","John Rainey","Sanjay, this is John. How's it going? First, with respect to transaction margin, as we've seen for a couple quarters now, there's definitely pressure there. But I would remind you that's a deliberate part of our strategy as we're trying to increase the ubiquity of PayPal and allow our customers to use PayPal at larger merchants where we're going to see pressure on take rate. Fortunately for us, we have the ability to offset that with the operating leverage in our business. And as a management team, we're focused on our margins, our generation of free cash flow and growing EPS and not getting so focused on just one aspect of the P&L being the transaction margin.","So, you'll continue to see us demonstrate the ability to offset some of that decline. With respect to mix, as we said before, we expected the impact of that 2016 to be relatively de minimis and our first quarter results actually validated that. It was fairly negligible in the quarter and we would expect, to your question, a similar impact for the balance of the year.","Daniel Schulman","I'd just add a couple of things.","Sanjay Sakhrani","And my follow-up...","Daniel Schulman","Just [indiscernible]\u2026","Sanjay Sakhrani","Just around the new account growth, maybe you can just parse out which channels you're seeing the most success in terms of growth? Thanks.","Daniel Schulman","Yeah, let me first jump on a little bit of John's answer and just supplement it. First of all, as we've said all along, the margins in this business tend to want to go up. In fact, if you excluded Xoom from our results in the quarter, our margins would have gone up year-over-year. The take rate is a direct result of the strategy that we're implementing. First thing is we want more ubiquity for PayPal consumers. The more ubiquity there is for them to shop, the more they use us, the more engagements they have, the more satisfied they are with the service and it gives us a flywheel effect. And as John mentioned, every one of those dollars that come in from our merchants are obviously profitable dollars for us. The large merchants have lower take rates. That's just the way of the world, more volume, more pricing leverage.","The second piece is we are trying to become a full services platform to enable merchants to move into digital commerce. That means we want to do 100% share of their payment processing. We want to be a strategic partner with them. We want to enable their business strategy. And the more we do that, the closer we get to our merchants, the better off that is for us. Churn goes down, more branded business comes towards us. But of course, as we go move more towards that product mix, you also see some margin because that mix of product has a lower margin set as well. But overall, when we include our branded on that, that's a net positive for us.","So we're really comfortable with the strategy. It inevitably leads to at least for now because we are penetrating a lot of that larger merchant base and we'll start to see more normalized stuff come out of that. But for now, that is the right strategy for us and it is paying off in all sorts of benefits for us. In terms of net new account growth, we are seeing that throughout the world right now. As John mentioned, over half of our actives are outside of the U.S. So we're seeing good growth across the world. We're obviously seeing very good growth in our core PayPal acquisition as well as in Venmo.","So I would basically say we've got good, consistent growth that spans from our newer services to our core business. I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that our value proposition has significantly improved over the course of the last year, year and a half or so and consumers are beginning to see that.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you.","Daniel Schulman","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tien-tsin Huang","Great, thanks. Good results here. Just wanted to dig into what's driving the TPV acceleration. I think you called out a mixed retail landscape. So how much of the acceleration is from, say, merchant additions you called out, the backlog of full service deals, et cetera?","Daniel Schulman","Yeah, I'll take that. I think what's really driving the TPV growth is obviously and no surprise here, our net new actives have grown by some 19 million, 20 million net new active additions over the past year. Over the last two quarters, you've seen acceleration in the number of net new ads that we put on to the business. Engagement is growing. Engagement is growing because our value proposition is getting better. One Touch is increasing engagement, our new mobile app is increasing engagement and conversion is also going up because of those value propositions.","We obviously are also expanding partnerships right now. All the investment that we've done in the tech stack over the course of the last three plus years is really paying off in our ability to work with the most technically savvy and sophisticated partners and be able to deliver digital and mobile payment experience that we think is best-in-class. So these new partnerships are helping. And the more merchant \u2013 consumers we get, more merchants want to come onboard and you saw some of those in my remarks. But we're now over 14 million merchants. So it's a combination of a better value proposition, more partnerships, expanded merchants and then really driving our net new consumers and the engagement per consumer; all of that is adding up to very strong volume growth.","Tien-tsin Huang","Got it, that's helpful. Just as my follow-up, just on Xoom, I think last call you talked about how you still see a line of sight to that becoming margin accretive. How much of the current drag is driven by your accelerated country expansion efforts and maybe some integration caused that you'll maybe lap sooner rather than later? Thanks.","John Rainey","Yeah, we've said that we expect Xoom to be margin dilutive this year. And I wouldn't expect necessarily the back half of the year to look that much different than the front half. But it's \u2013 to your point, as you can see from and hear from Dan's prepared remarks, this is an area that we're investing in and we would expect it to start generating more significant profits in 2017.","Tien-tsin Huang","Great. Thank you.","John Rainey","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache with Nomura. Your line is open.","Bill Carcache","Thank you. Dan and John, I wanted to follow up on your comments about PayPal Credit. You've made it clear that credit is important because it helps fuel growth and has the flywheel effects that you described. But how much do you worry about the lower valuation multiple that the market ascribes to businesses that face credit risk? And is that really the reason why you are exploring asset-light to basically identify a partner with a strong balance sheet so that they could help you retain all the benefits of the credit product without taking on the credit risk?","Daniel Schulman","Yeah, hey, Bill. It's a great question. So as we've said pretty consistently, we are not in credit for credit sake. We are in credit because it drives both consumer benefits and merchant benefits and drives the overall flywheel for PayPal. Any which way you look at it, it drives increased basket size, increased conversion, PayPal Working Capital, significantly increases the volume that we see coming on to PayPal, significantly increases the NPS scores. So we see a lot of benefit in the overall PayPal ecosystem.","But we can do this, and will continue to do this in an asset-light manner. Credit is a small part of our overall business. It will likely remain a small part of our overall business. And ways of figuring out how to do that in asset-light and capital efficient manners are a goal of ours. Synchrony, the partnership we have with them is a good example of that. I think you can expect us to be looking at those kinds of things to become increasingly asset-light. We don't need to do all of this or even a great portion of this necessarily on our own balance sheet. We can work with partners because the important thing to us is the flywheel effect.","John Rainey","I would just \u2013 I would add to that, Bill, that another aspect that we look at is the volatility or \u2013 and one of the things that we really try to focus on is reducing the volatility of our earnings. And I think it's important that you understand that we have a lot of ways that we can manage any volatility irrespective whether it comes from credit or other aspects of our business. But to Dan's point, credit is about 2% of our volume today. And if you were to just take 2015 growth rates of credit and the rest of our business, it would take a couple decades before credit even got to 20% to 25% of our overall revenue. So this is something that, to Dan's point, we want to utilize it because it complements our platform, but I'd like to allay some of the concerns that are out there right now around this because it's not something that I think is going to have any kind of dramatic impact in terms of the volatility to us.","Bill Carcache","Thank you. I wanted to also follow up on your comments around partnering with other players in the ecosystem. You guys have previously said that steering and data sharing were two issues that were at the center of your discussions with other players, but that those were very solvable. Maybe could you talk about whether there have been any changes in philosophy around how you think about the sharing of data, and perhaps any commentary around the steering issue? It was interesting to hear MasterCard say at a recent conference that they're okay with the notion that PayPal has been \u2013 has thrown out around customer choice, and that's something that they could live with. I was hoping \u2013 there's a lot there, but just around those topics, just hoping you could give a little bit of color and that's it. Thank you.","Daniel Schulman","Yeah. Sure, of course. So we're in good and meaningful discussions across the entire ecosystem right now. And I'm hopeful that that leads to a win-win for a number of parties. Just take a step back and give a little bit of context. One of the things that we talked about inside PayPal all the time now is how do we become the ultimate customer champion company. And being a customer champion company means providing the very best experience to our customers. And when we think about the very best experience; that means giving our customers full choice and optionality about where they want to pay and how they want to pay. And to us, that just makes a ton of sense and we've done a lot of work around this as you can imagine and a lot of research and a lot of experimentation.","And here's what we see. When we do that, we drive a heck of a lot of more net ads than we have in our traditional signup process. And engagement and conversion go up meaningfully. So that obviously drives increased revenues and volumes for us. Funding mix may shift slightly but the difference between ACH and debit has narrowed substantially over the last couple of years. Different regulatory environments have narrowed a lot of the payment option tightened. So \u2013 and we would also expect some tradeoff with incremental volumes that we could drive on to networks and pricing that we would receive from potential partners.","In addition, we are very willing to share data back with the issuers and the networks. That really is a legacy of the past as best as I can see. And this sort of new model of customer choice of data sharing, and all of us having a common foe in cash transactions. We all want to electronify more and more payments and that's all attractive and additive to the entire ecosystem.","And so that eliminates a lot of the previous perceived friction that might have been out in the ecosystem. And furthermore, we want a partner. We think that's the right thing to go and do. And so we'll see where all this goes but as I said, it has the opportunity to be a win for all of us in the ecosystem.","Bill Carcache","Thank you.","Daniel Schulman","Yeah. You bet.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Heath Terry","Great. Dan, you've talked in the past and provided some specifics around the state of the pipeline of business or merchants that you're on-boarding. Just wondering if you could give us a bit of an update on that [indiscernible] how it compares to where you were back when you last updated in January or the business that you did last year?","And then just as we \u2013 as you talk through the improved engagement around One Touch, is there any way that you can quantify that for us, either in the amount of TPV that One Touch users use or are using after they sign up for One Touch or their engagements in a specific period that would provide some additional color around that benefit?","Daniel Schulman","Yeah, yeah. Thanks for the question, Heath. So first thing in terms of pipeline, we're improving our capabilities as rapidly as we can to onboard live to site that pipeline of sales that we have for Braintree and in our core business. So that's improved quite a bit, but I will say despite the improvement, we are still seeing a large demand and pipeline of additional sales coming in for our platforms.","Yeah, I'd say it's a high class problem to have. And the value proposition of Braintree is, I think, the whole team there is doing a great job in driving that. The core propositions of PayPal are getting better really. They're really starting to execute against this idea of being a full services platform, really being almost the underlying operating system for digital commerce. And then that is \u2013 that's resonating with the merchant population and so we still have a very strong pipeline being \u2013 waiting to go live to site and a strong pipeline of merchants that we're talking to in the middle of the sales process with them as well.","In terms of One Touch, we've said from the very beginning that we see meaningful lift in not just conversion vis-\u00e0-vis our other products but also engagement in terms of how often a consumer uses PayPal because really as you can imagine, taking friction out of the checkout experience is just a really positive thing. It's really positive for consumers and it's really positive for merchants. And seeing that comScore study that basically, as you know, our nearest alternative service at 51% and us at 87% can give you an idea of the lift in conversion.","The other place that I would point to is you can see kind of where PayPal conversion was before One Touch and other comScore studies and where it is now and you can get a sense of some of the lift for that by looking at some of those external studies. But you'll see it's a meaningful lift in conversion overall. That's obviously beginning to help us in our results. And hopefully as we continue to onboard more and more consumers on that, we'll continue to help drive some of our future growth.","Heath Terry","Great. Thanks, Dan.","Daniel Schulman","You're welcome, Heath.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with Bernstein. Your line is open.","Lisa Ellis","Hi. Good afternoon, guys. All right, very quickly, can you just illuminate a little bit what drove the couple of basis point uptick in transaction expenses? Is it mix in Braintree or is it actually underlying card mix in the core PayPal platform? And then similarly, it looked like transaction and loan losses upticked again, even though you said that PayPal Credit is holding steady at 2% of TPV. So, can you just give a little color around those drivers? Thanks.","John Rainey","Sure, Lisa. So the first \u2013 the answer to your first question about the increase in transaction expense is related to mix of Braintree. Of course, that being more card-based, but that as opposed to what we're seeing in the core business on the transaction and loan losses, that's actually a result of increased risk pressures that we saw in the quarter as opposed to anything that we saw specific to credit.","Lisa Ellis","Terrific, thanks. And then one real quick follow-up. You've mentioned that you've got some initiatives underway to drive use of the stored balances in PayPal, so meaning being able to deposit paychecks, et cetera. But it looked like the balance sheet line item there only grew about 6% year-on-year. So can you just give a little color around usage of stored balances in your initiatives there?","Daniel Schulman","Yeah, first of all, Lisa, welcome to the coverage universe of us and glad to have you.","Lisa Ellis","Thank you.","Daniel Schulman","Yeah. In terms of additional funding sources, I think, is what you're talking about in there. We have not introduced additional funding sources coming in. You can now add cash into your balance at several thousand retail stores across the U.S. But this idea about us opening our platform up to more funding types to be more in the middle of how people manage and move their money is still a future initiative for us. So you wouldn't have seen that in today's results.","John Rainey","Yeah. And with respect to the customer balances, Lisa, recall that in my prepared remarks I suggested that we moved $800 million from our customer balances to our cash to help fund some of the European originated credit.","Lisa Ellis","Yeah. Yes. I got that. I was looking actually at the liabilities line item.","Daniel Schulman","Yeah.","Lisa Ellis","Thank you.","Daniel Schulman","Thank you, Lisa.","Gabrielle Rabinovitch","Andrea, we have time for one last question.","Operator","All right. Our last question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Bryan Keane","Hi, guys. Congrats on the good, solid results here.","Daniel Schulman","Thanks, Bryan.","Bryan Keane","I just want to go back to the whole question around funding mix since that's a popular one. You guys did mention that there's not a lot of difference between ACH and debit, although to us, we think of ACH as being only $0.02 and debit being a little north of $0.21. So just exactly what do you mean on that? On a funding mix change there, wouldn't there be an extra cost?","And then secondly, on credit, there is a worry that if there is more transactions on the network's credit cards that you will make zero money or less money, obviously, if you open it up to consumer choice. Thanks.","Daniel Schulman","Yeah. So we've done \u2013 as I mentioned, we've done a ton of experimentation on this and what we have seen with consumer choice is a much better experience for consumers, much more engagement, much more conversion and many more incremental net adds to that. And on the mix, when you look at ACH you also need to look into not just the cost of ACH, but when we take from an ACH balance, there's risk associated with that. And so as we look at the environment and we look at the differences in mix shift, we look at the advantages of choice, we look at the partnering with the ecosystem, we think this is a net positive not just for us but for other players in the ecosystem as well. And that's what has us cautiously optimistic about this.","Any time that you can find solutions that actually provide a win for all players in the system, that's a real positive. And I think that's what we're finding in our conversations. It doesn't mean that things lead to one thing or another but it does mean that there's a lot more understanding and a lot more commonality in what we're trying to do than before.","Bryan Keane","Okay. And since I'm the last one to ask a question, let me ask the follow-up on just PayPal's new mobile app. What's the change in value proposition for PayPal in-store for both merchants and consumers? Because obviously you guys sound excited about that, and it looks like PayPal in-store could be a big part of this. Thanks so much.","Daniel Schulman","Yeah, you bet. Well, first of all, the mobile app is a fundamentally redesigned app. It really brings us into the mobile world. It puts up front the things that customers want to go out and do, it doesn't clutter it up. It's simple, easy. As I mentioned, it's driving increased consumer engagement. And it also enables us for consumers to now be able to use their mobile phone in-store whether that be through NFC or QR codes. And the way that I think about in-store is really in-store, online, in-app, they're all coming together. It's just commerce is the way to think about it. It's all moving towards mobile. And we basically want to be able to utilize for merchants this underlying platform so that we can be their OS, do 100% share of checkout, enable merchants to create their own application, tie in their rewards into our platform, do things like split tender at checkout and create a real value proposition change for consumers so that merchants can use mobile to get closer to their customers. And we're trying to power that experience there.","We want to be OS agnostic. We want to be POS, point-of-sale, agnostic as well. And then we want to use our PayPal wallet, which, as we mentioned now, is growing quite quickly to basically light up that merchant app. Part of the issue with merchant apps is when they can create a good value proposition, they need somebody to help power that. But then they need volume on that application. And with things like our One Touch technology, our new re-platforming, as long as a consumer opts in, we can credentialize their IDs and make that signing up for that app much more friction-free than previously. And so not only can we provide the underlying infrastructure for that merchant, but we can then light up that application with our consumer base.","We've had great success with Shell in the U.K. They're doing a trial now in Brazil with Subway, with Burger King, with Dollar General, with Macy's, with Papa John's. We have thousands of retailers that now are part of our order-ahead application on our mobile app where you can just order ahead, pay with PayPal and then pick up in store. And so this is what I mean. Basically you have mobile, bridging the gap between online, in-app and in-store and we're really pleased with the initial results, it's obviously early on but a lot of potential for us there. So thank you for that question.","Bryan Keane","Thank you for that color.","Daniel Schulman","And thank you, everybody, for joining us today. We appreciate your time.","Operator","And this concludes today's Q&A session. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day."],"16903":["PayPal Holdings, Inc.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call may be recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Gabrielle Rabinovitch","Thank you, Sherrie. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal Holdings' earnings conference call for the first quarter 2018. Joining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO; John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer and EVP Global Customer Operations; and Bill Ready, our EVP Chief Operating Officer. We're providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being webcast and both the presentation and call are available through the Investor Relations section of our website.","We will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about our company's performance. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call. Earlier this month, we announced updated definitions of active accounts and total payment volume or TPV to capture the diversification of PayPal's products and services through strategic partnerships, new products and acquisitions. The rates of growth discussed on this call related to these metrics reflect revised results from prior year periods for comparability. We do not consider the historical impacts of the updated definitions to be material.","In addition, management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for the second quarter and full year 2018. Our actual results may differ materially from these statements.","You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our results in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on the Investor Relations section of our website. You should not rely on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today's date, April 25, 2018. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update the information.","With that, let me turn the call over to Dan.","Dan Schulman","Thank you, Gabrielle, and thanks everyone for joining us on today's call. I'm pleased to say that PayPal had another quarter of strong results and we are off to a great start for the year. We generated 3.69 billion of revenue in Q1, growing at 24% on a spot basis and 22% on a currency neutral basis.","We delivered 829 million in non-GAAP operating income, that's up 29% year-over-year, driven by 90 basis point increase in our non-GAAP operating margin, which was 22.5% for the quarter. As a result, we delivered $0.57 of non-GAAP EPS, up 29% year-over-year.","We also had another quarter of strong customer growth and engagement. We added 8.1 million net new actives, up 35% year-over-year, bringing our total active accounts to 237 million. This strong performance was driven by continued growth of core PayPal and Venmo users and our Customer Choice initiative.","Choice continues to produce strong customer activations and the year-over-year reduction in our overall churn rate. We expanded the global roll out of Choice by launching in China and nine additional countries across Southeast Asia and further expanding and further expanding into Europe by launching in France, Germany, Italy and Spain.","Following the addition of a record 29 million net new actives in 2017, we're pleased to see continued strength in our customer acquisition. We remain confident that net new actives for this year will be in line with the record additions we experienced last year. And as our consumer base expands, the growth of merchants signing up to our platform is also accelerating.","Our merchant base now totals 19 million accounts. This powerful network effect along with continued improvements to our technology platform and enhancements in our product experiences continues to drive increasing engagement. PayPal ended the first quarter with 34.7 transactions per active account, up once again by 8%.","Our efforts to redefine our ecosystem with landmark partnerships, the introduction of new products and services and the continued expansion of our global footprint led to strong volume growth. PayPal processed 132 billion in TPV in the quarter, up 32% on a spot basis and up 27% on a currency neutral basis.","On an FX-neutral basis our merchant services TPV grew at five times the rate of our eBay market places TPV. There's no doubt that we are benefiting from the explosion of mobile and as cards finding impact on the digitization of commerce and all forms of currency. We're executing against a focused and strategic plan intended to maximize the benefit of these trends and extend our market leadership.","We're clearly transforming from a payments button to an open digital payments platform. And by doing so we're redefining our relationship with partners, retailers and consumers in a much more expansive manner. We continue to grow our relationships with technology platforms and companies across the globe as well as with card networks and issuing banks.","Through these partnerships, we are able to increase our addressable market as well as accelerate the introduction of innovative payment experiences. For instance, our relationship with Visa continues to strengthen around the world as we collaborate on multiple initiatives, including tokenization and the increasing use of their services like Visa OCT for instant cash out.","JP Morgan Chase added PayPal as a new category for its freedom rewards members, allowing then to earn up to 5% cash back when making PayPal purchases funded by their Chase freedom card. We introduced two new experiences with Bank of America, one that enables PayPal as a way to disperse payments on behalf of their corporate clients and another that provides the away customers a streamlined way to link their debit and credit cards to their PayPal accounts from their Bank of America mobile and online channels.","We announced partnership agreements with CaixaBank and Bankia, two of the leading banks in Spain. CaixaBank's business customers can now seamlessly offer PayPal as a way to pay on their websites. Helping Spanish SMB's [ph], participate more fully in Spain's growing ecommerce market. Bankia, now enables its customers to seamlessly link their Bankia cards to their PayPal wallet and open a PayPal account from Bankia's online channels.","HSBC announced a new integrated service to allow their corporate customers to make payments to beneficiaries with PayPal accounts in the UK. And this partnership will be rolling out across Europe throughout 2018. And Barclays Bank, one of the largest banks in the UK is announcing a strategic partnership with us that will enable their UK and US customers to more easily link their accounts to their PayPal wallet.","US Barclays' credit card holders will soon be able to use their reward points as a funding source in their PayPal wallet. We're pleased to be working with all of our partners to roll out compelling and engaging experiences. Our financial institution partners are now experiencing, first hand, the benefits of our joint efforts. It's exciting to see them actively encouraging their customers to link their accounts to PayPal in order to enrich the digital experiences available to our mutual customers.","In our relationships with some of the world's largest technology platform partners like Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft, continue to expand and grow in the quarter. These experiences allows for PayPal to be more present in the everyday lives of our customers, driving engagement as well as introducing millions of potential new customers to the PayPal brand and value proposition.","For instance, last year we announced an expanded agreement with Samsung and I'm pleased to share that in the next few weeks, users will be able to load PayPal into Samsung pad, enabling our mutual customers to pay with their phone at millions of retailers in the US. We also continue to innovate around our core platform capabilities.","For instance, P2P has increasingly become a powerful driver of customer acquisition and engagement on our platform. We continue to see record levels of customer acquisition through P2P and Venmo as we continue to innovate and consequently differentiate the services we offer. Venmo continues to gain increasing traction as preferred way for millennials to manage and move their money.","Venmo acquired more net new actives in Q1 than in any previous quarter and processed 12.3 billion in payment volume, up over 80% versus last year. Venmo is now on a run rate to generate over 50 billion in TPV in 2018. We're making strong progress in monetizing Venmo. Pay with Venmo has deployed more than 2 million merchants across the US with major brands such as Grubhub, Seamless and Williams-Sonoma, installing dedicated pay with Venmo button.","We expect the deployment of a distinct Venmo button with our leading brands will accelerate throughout the year, as well the deployment of dynamic buttons. The use of convenient instant cash out capabilities at a fee of $0.25 per transaction is dramatically accelerating across the Venmo consumer base. Overall adoption of monetized services is exceeding our original expectations.","One Touch continues to set the standard for speed and simplicity for mobile check out. We concluded the quarter with 92 million consumers using One Touch and 8.6 million merchants. We're proud that 78% of the IR-100 now use One Touch, enabling mobile check out conversions at almost two times the industry average. In fact the latest comp score study now states PayPal's conversion has further improved to 89% by far in a way the leader in mobile check out.","We processed 49 billion in mobile payment volume in the quarter, up 52% year-over-year and mobile payments now represent 37% of our total payment volume. Credit is and will continue to be a strategic part of PayPal's offering to consumers and businesses. It is an important way that we help small and midsized businesses compete, grow and thrive.","I'm pleased to announce that PayPal working capital has now extended more than 5 billion in working capital to more 150,000 merchants since its launch in 2013. In the quarter, we also launched new services to give our customers more flexibility in how and where they can spend, manage and move their money on the PayPal platform. As the world becomes increasingly digital too many consumers are challenged by gaps in the current financial system to find convenient and affordable ways to manage their financial health.","We recently introduced the PayPal cash master card aimed at giving greater financial flexibility to underserved and unbanked consumers in the United States. It lets card holders spend their PayPal bonds at millions of physical store locations, access cash from ATMs and load their PayPal account with cash at over 20,000 retail locations. Consumers can also add to their balance via direct deposit as well as depositing checks via their mobile device.","We're working closely with partners across the financial ecosystem to introduce what will be a comprehensive value proposition for the tens of millions of US consumers that currently rely on shadow banking services like check cashers and pay their lenders. It is the central tenant of our mission to provide underserved consumers better access to the opportunities afforded by the digital economy and I'm very pleased that we're taking the first steps on this journey.","Around the world, we continue to expand and grow our relationships and footprint. We've introduced advanced capabilities to accelerate our ability to onboard new sellers on AliExpress in order to expand the selection of products available to shoppers around the globe. We now have approximately half of all AliExpress active sellers accepting PayPal as a way to pay. In addition, we're excited to launch our partnership with BYJU in the coming months.","We've now successfully moved from pilot to general availability of PayPal for domestic customers in India. We're now pleased to welcome merchants across India to offer PayPal to local consumers in India as well as to our millions of consumers around the globe. We recently announce the partnership with M-Pesa, the transformative mobile payment system in Kenya. Through our relationship, Kenyans can now seamlessly move money between their M-Pesa and PayPal accounts, removing barriers that had prevented Kenyan consumers and businesses from fully participating in the global digital economy.","Kenyan consumers can now shop the millions of global businesses that accept PayPal and Kenyan businesses can sell to PayPal's consumers around the world. With almost 28 million M-Pesa customers in Kenya, we see this as a meaningful step forward in working with partners to drive the democratization of financial services. Finally, we have formalized a signed contract with eBay through July 2023 to extend our branded relationship.","We're actively working with Devin Wenig and his team to deepen our relationship in ways that drive profitable growth for both companies. It's my belief that eBay and PayPal will continue to be close strategic partners for the foreseeable future and we're committed to that outcome. As we shared previously, this gradual transition in our relationship with eBay was anticipated by both parties and was outlined in the original operating agreement. Consequently, it does not change either our short or medium term financial values.","We're pleased that the opportunity to extend our strategic relationship with eBay. While at the same time expand our ability to partner with some of the world's fastest growing market places. Based on numerous direct conversations, we know that our rapidly expanding two sided network and our increasing platform capabilities are very attractive to our host of next generation market places. And they're looking forward to deepening their strategic relationship with us.","After a strong 2017, it's encouraging to enter 2018 with continued momentum in the seer strategy delivering results on multiple fronts. Our merchants, consumers and partners will always remain at the heart of everything we do and I'd like to extend my thanks to the entire PayPal team for their consistent dedication to our customers. We still have much to accomplish and as always a lot of hard work ahead, but the opportunity for us to make a real difference in the lives of so many of our customers has never been greater.","And with that, I'll now turn the call over to John.","John Rainey","Thanks Dan. In the first quarter we outperformed on both revenue and earnings, building on our momentum from 2017. [indiscernible] across active accounts, payment volume and revenue demonstrates the strength of our two sided platform. And our ability to grow operating income while expanding operating margin highlights the sustainable scalability of our model.","During the quarter, we continued to invest in our strategic initiatives and at the same time delivered strong earnings growth. Before I go into detailed financial results, a few highlights for the quarter, revenue was $3.69 billion, growing 24% on a spot basis and 22% on a currency neutral basis.","Non-GAAP EPS grew 29% to $0.57. During the quarter we also returned $1.8 billion to shareholders, repurchasing approximately 23.6 million shares as part of our buyback program. Consistent with Q4 '17 as a result of the sale of our US consumer credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony Financial and the associated reclassification of the receivables to held for sale, there are changes to the presentation of our results.","These changes reduce comparability to prior periods. Where relevant to the discussion, I'll provide normalized results to adjust for these changes. Following the closing of the transaction, which we expect to occur early Q3, the US consumer credit portfolio will no longer sit on our balance sheet. We will no longer incur any direct cost related to the charge offs of principal for interest.","This reclassification affects three areas on our income statement. First, revenue from other value added services benefited by approximately $38 million in the quarter as a result of no longer recognizing reserves on interest receivables; second, transaction and loan losses benefited by approximately $111 million from no longer recognizing reserves on principle receivables and third, non-transaction related expenses were negatively impacted by approximately $128 million from the recognition of incurred charge offs on principle and interest.","Turning to our financial performance in the first quarter, our total payment volume was $132 billion, up 27% on a currency neutral basis, including US payment volume growth of 28% and international volume growth of 25%. Our merchant services volume grew 30% on a currency neutral basis to $116 billion.","Volume associated with eBay grew 6% on a currency neutral basis to $17 billion. P2P volume, which is a component of merchant services and includes volumes across core Venmo and Zoom, grew 50% to $30 billion and represented approximately 23% of total payment volume versus 20% in Q1 '17.","In the first quarter, we added 8.1 million net new active accounts, ending with 237 million active accounts, representing 15% growth over Q1 last year. On the consumer side, active account growth was predominantly driven by core PayPal and Venmo and we added nearly 900,000 merchants to our platform.","The number of payment transactions per active account on a trailing 12 months basis reached 34.7 with 8.2 billion transactions occurring on our payment platform over that period. In the first quarter, transactions once again grew 25% to 2.2 billion.","Revenue increased 24% on a spot basis and 22% on a currency neutral basis to $3.69 billion. US revenue increased 26% versus Q1 '17 and international revenue increased 18% year-over-year on a currency neutral basis. Revenue growth on a currency neutral basis accelerated nearly 3.5% from strength in our US and APAC businesses, including our acquisition of Swift Financial.","Overall, our total revenue benefited from the weaker dollar by $91 million, with $141 million of translation benefits, partially offset by $50 million of hedging losses. This $50 million hedging loss compares to $40 million gain last year.","In the first quarter transaction revenue grew 22% and revenue from other value added services grew 39%. Transaction revenue growth was driven by our core PayPal and Braintree businesses, while revenue from other value added services benefited from the acquisition of Swift and from the reclassifications related to held for sale accounting. Adjusting for these events, other value added services revenue grew at approximately the same rate as transaction revenues.","For Q1, our transaction take rate was 2.42%, a decline of 19 basis points from the first quarter of 2017. And our total take rate was 2.78%, down 17 basis points year-over-year. Almost half of the decline in take rate is related to the $90 million headwind from hedging losses. This combined with the growth in our P2P businesses led by Venmo contributed to more than 75% of the transaction take rate decline with the remainder being driven by business mix.","Volume based expenses grew 23% in Q1. Transaction expense was $1.3 billion and represented 96 basis points of TPV, a decrease of 2 basis points year-over-year. Funding mix pressure was offset by lower funding costs from growth in P2P. Transaction loss in the quarter was $243 million or 18 basis points of TPV, an increase of 1 basis point versus the same period a year ago. This 1 basis point increase relates to the introduction of new products and services where we look to balance our risk tolerance with our growth plans.","Loan losses were $62 million or 5 basis points as a rate of TPV, down more than 50% from Q1 '17 as a result of the effect of held for sale accounting. For modeling purposes, we expect loan losses to be in the range of 5 basis points as a rate of TPV for the year. Transaction margin dollars grew 25% to $2.1 billion.","Adjusted for the impact of held for sale accounting transaction margin dollar were $2 billion, representing 16% growth versus last year. For the quarter, transaction margin as a rate was 57.1%. Adjusting for held for sale accounting, transaction margin was 53.6%.","Non-transaction related expenses grew 22% in the quarter. Normalizing for the held for sale accounting adjustments, these expenses would have grown approximately 10% resulting in 365 basis points of operating leverage.","Further adjusting for our 2017 acquisitions, we would have seen non-transactional related expenses grow at 6.9% for the quarter, which is in line with our target of mid-single digit growth. After adjusting for held for sale accounting treatment and backing out incremental revenue and cost associated with our acquisitions from last year, these expenses increased only $0.11 for every incremental dollar of revenue.","We believe that we can sustainably grow our business with this level of investment in our non-transactional related expenses, allowing us to continue to deliver operating margin expansion. In the first quarter, operating income grew 29% to $829 million on 24% top-line growth. This resulted in an operating margin of 22.5% or 90 basis points of operating leverage.","It's worth noting. This is the highest operating margin we've reported as an independent company. Adjusting for held for sale accounting and acquisitions, operating income grew 29% to $833 million delivering organic margin expansion of approximately 100 employee basis points.","Non-GAAP earnings per share grew 29% in the first quarter to $0.57. Capital expenditures were $178 million or approximately 5% of revenue. As a result of changes from the designation of our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio, net new loans of $1.26 billion reduced cash flow from operations in the quarter.","Prior to this change in designation, this amount would have been recognized in cash flows from investing activities. As a result, cash flow from operations in the first quarter was negative $349 million with free cash flow of negative 500 in $27 million. But on a normalized basis, we would have recognized $733 million in free cash flow generating approximately $0.20 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue.","We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $7.8 billion. In addition, we ended the quarter with short-term borrowings of $3 billion drawing down on our unsecured credit facility. During Q1 we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases.","I would now like to discuss our outlook for the second quarter of 2018 and our updated guidance for the full year. For the second quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.78 billion to $3.83 billion or 19% or 20% growth on a currency neutral basis. We also expect non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.54 to $0.56 representing an 18% to 23% growth.","Before I discuss full year 2018 guidance, I would like to discuss a change to our GAAP EPS outlook for the year. We now expect GAAP EPS to be within the range of $1.73 to $1.76. This updated outlook reflects a $19 million increase in our estimate for non-GAAP adjustments. Approximately two-thirds of this increase is attributable to additional stock-based compensation based on our financial outperformance.","The remaining third is from a restructuring charge that we recognized in the quarter related to reductions of our global workforce and the decision to wind down TIO Networks operations, which was not in our original guidance. For the full year 2018 based on current trends, we are raising our revenue outlook by $175 million at the midpoint of our prior range.","We now expect revenue between $15.2 billion and $15.4 billion representing current neutral growth of 15% to 16%. We expect our sale for Synchrony of approximately $6 billion of US consumer credit receivables to close early in the third quarter. Following the completion of this sale, we will no longer recognize revenue from interest and late fees related to this portfolio.","Overall we continue to estimate a 3.5 percentage point impact to 2018 revenue growth from this transaction. We expect revenue from other value-added services to decline in the back half of 2018 relative to 2017. At the same time transaction revenue is on track to continue growing at approximately 20%.","Our full year 2018 guidance contemplates modest expansion in our non-GAAP operating margin. We continue to balance delivering operating margin expansion with reinvesting back into the business to further strengthen our platform and competitive positioning. Given our growth opportunities, we have a bias toward investing.","We are also narrowing our range for non-GAAP effective tax rate and now estimated to be between 17% and 19% and we are raising non-GAAP earnings per share to $2.31 to $2.34 representing 22% to 23% growth. To wrap up, our first quarter results position us well for another year of strong financial performance. I would like to thank all of our employees, customers, and partners for a great quarter.","And with that I will turn it over to the operator for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tien-tsin Huang from JP Morgan.","Tien-tsin Huang","Thanks so much. So that for me was the level of buyback that you guys executed in Q1. It looks like it was mostly 80% or more than what you bought in all of '17. So I'm curious is this PayPal just being more opportunistic or is this sort of a signal of your capital allocation priorities, maybe shipping the buyback or you are not seeing the adequate returns on potential M&A, any kind of comment there would be great? Thanks.","John Rainey","Sure, Tien-tsin. This is John. Our priorities have not changed. We still prioritize capital allocations first as investing for growth and that can be either organically or through M&A activity, but we also believe in returning cash to shareholders. This so happens that in the first quarter we had clarity on a couple of important issues. One is tax reform.","The other is the transaction that we announced with Synchrony and that allowed us to do more than what we have done in the past. But very importantly, a strong balance sheet for us is a strong competitive advantage. It's an asset that a lot of our peers don't have and we believe as a management team improving that cash to use to create shareholder value and you'll continue to see us allocate capital in that manner whether it's returning cash to shareholders and going out and looking at the M&A landscape.","I would not read anything into the amount of the share buyback as to suggest if there are not opportunities for us to go acquire companies. As you can appreciate those take time to complete a deal if not as if you can just start something and close the transaction in the quarter and so we will be measured and do what's right for PayPal and allocate capital in a manner that create shareholder value.","Tien-tsin Huang","Got it. Thanks for that. Just my quick follow-up then maybe just on the - Dan listed a bunch of bank promotions. Just curious are you funding some of these initiatives with the banks and I'm curious what kind of early returns you might be seeing that maybe hasn't shown up in the P&L so far in Q1?","Dan Schulman","Bill?","Bill Ready","Yeah, this is Bill. Hi, Tien-tsin. So we don't disclose the details of any one of those partnerships specifically. However, what we are seeing is tremendous receptivity from our banking partners to really drive their customers into PayPal because of the great source of digital transaction growth which was the primary place where issuers are growing right now and we are seeing really good response from the programs that are out there and they've been a tremendous support for us as well as for our issuing partners and so we are not committing any kind of unnatural acts to get those things to happen. In fact, our banking partners have found it very much to be in their interest to promote their customers to use PayPal. So we see that as something that is certainly indicative of the partnership, but also something we are not committing unnatural acts to make those things happen.","Tien-tsin Huang","Great, thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane","Hi, guys. Just wanted to ask about the move to the unreserved or, to go after the unbanked, what are some of the puts and takes on revenue and cost resulting from offering more comprehensive financial services?","Dan Schulman","Yeah, maybe I'll start off Byan with the answer on that and thanks for the question and then I'll turn it over to Bill on that. So first of all, we firmly believe as a company that everyone should have access to affordable convenient secure and low cost financial services. I mean that is our vision of marketizing financial services and we are working closely with the rest of the financial services ecosystem to do that. I mean think about the partners we have in there right now, MasterCard, Wells Fargo, Bank Corps just to name some of them.","And I think what we are trying to do is not try to compete or replace what's going on with banks, but work with the financial system to fill in the gaps in the current system, so that everyone can afford the opportunities that the digital economy is extending. If you think about the way that we are putting services into place, we are trying to be a consumer champion, provide for instance our PayPal Cash MasterCard with no monthly fee, no minimum, because that is being differentiated in the marketplace.","And the money we make from that is on transactions that occur at merchants just like we do typically. So we think that we can use technology reimagine financial services for sort of a mobile first customer and provide not only a great consumer value proposition but also a great proposition from merchants and the rest of the ecosystem as we bring people into the digital economy. Bill, do you want to?","Bill Ready","Yeah and I would just add to that to your question on what it means for us on economics. We've had some products in market for a while that give us exposure to how these products are, one, used by customers and, two, what those mean to us financially both prepaid cards we've had in market for a while, merchant debit cards, things like that.","And so there is no material difference in the way we would look to go monetize those customers and we've also had things for the unreserved such as being a little walk-in to a retail location like [indiscernible] for example and the cash onto PayPal accounts for somebody in the unreserved or unbanked community to participate in the digital economy. We've had exposure to those things and we don't see this as being any material difference in the way we would monetize on those customers versus how we monetize across the rest of our business.","Bryan Keane","Okay, helpful. And then just as a follow-up, the increase in the merchant count, is there something you guys are doing recently that's driving up merchant acceptance up to 19 million or just more a function of Venmo getting out more, PayPal getting out more and being kind of a separate paying entity has got the attention of numerous additional merchants?","Dan Schulman","Yeah, I think, look, probably the number one thing there is really a tipping point that we've reached from kind of a network effect perspective and we now have 237 million people on the platform. And as John mentioned, some 900,000 merchants this quarter signed up. We've been seeing that run rate as you have been hearing us talk about the number of merchants and so there is a great flywheel effect that happens.","The other thing that I would point out is that more and more consumers are using mobile as their primary device to shop. And the real big issue for merchants with mobile is that mobile conversion with a mobile phone is typically low. These people have to add in a ton of information on that small phone factor, but with our One Touch and our conversion rate now at 89% from mobile checkout and then One Touch is two times, maybe two times plus, the industry average and that obviously is a great thing for consumers, but an essential thing for merchants.","And I think that combination of those things, plus we are obviously adding more and more capabilities for small and midsize merchants, working capital being one that I talked about that, but we have a whole host of services that we are expanding through our platform as being just - as opposed to being just a payment button that is attracting not just consumers but an acceleration of merchants as well.","Bryan Keane","Okay. Thanks so much. Congrats on the solid results.","Dan Schulman","Thank you.","Bill Ready","Thanks, Bryan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from George Mihalos with Cowen.","Dan Schulman","Hi, George.","George Mihalos","Hey guys. Let me add my congrats on the strong results. Dan, just wanted to start off, there's obviously been a lot of - I really wonder on the market around the networks Visa MasterCard perhaps embracing sort of their own universal checkout button if you will. Maybe you can kind of address that as it relates to PayPal's positioning.","Dan Schulman","Yeah. Let me first [indiscernible] on this. Our relationships with the networks could not be stronger. We - just every single quarter we find more and more places where we can work together, combine their services and capabilities with our platform and offer incremental value to both merchants and consumers and very importantly throughout their issuing partners and financial institutions.","And you are seeing that through all of the partnerships that is just reflecting as I was writing my script on just this one quarter you've seen all of those banking partners working as Bill said very closely with us observing the firsthand the benefits that come from working hand in hand together for our mutual customers and so it's been a great partnership, a strong partnership and a growing partnership. In terms of the button specifically, I think Bill can talk a little bit about that and then I have a couple of comments on them.","Bill Ready","Sure. On the specific new news there, it was really about sort of interoperability between the paying buttons offered by the networks. And we have for quite a while now talked about how we want to go help power the complete move to digital buy button experiences and not only do we have PayPal and Venmo as those widely used for digital payment forms in the world, we also are one of the largest providers to other digital wallet form of the payment whether that's Visa Checkout or MasterPass or Apple Pay and Google Pay.","So we work with those others. Even as we work with those others, we are seeing that our own buy buttons continue to accelerate and so we really want to power the entire movement towards seamless digital wallet buying experiences and happy to partner those to do that. And this new news around interoperability is sort of a new technical specification.","But interoperability between Visa Checkout and MasterPass and some of these existed previously that you can put a MasterCard into Visa Checkout or Visa card into MasterPass. So there is a new technical certification there. But interoperability between those checkout forms is not meaningfully different than how we have seen those previously and we are excited to continue working with our network partners to help them with those efforts, as well as the many ways we're partnering on how we each advance digital payments.","George Mihalos","Great, I appreciate that. And then John, maybe just a quick follow-up, I think margins expanded, call it about 90 bps year-over-year in the first quarter, should we expect that to come down a little bit just looking at the $0.56 high end of the EPS guide for 2Q?","John Rainey","With any one period there is going to be seasonality or things in the business move around. I would really point you to the full year results. We do make discretionary investments from one period to the next, but if you look at the implied guidance for our full year it still shows us expanding margins at a nice rate. I think it's reflective of the overall progress in the business. This is, as I noticed in my prepared remarks, we had a record operating margin in the quarter. We've had four consecutive quarters of accelerating revenue growth. For the last three quarters, we've averaged 30% EPS growth and 25% growth in transactions. So I'm really pleased with how the business is doing.","George Mihalos","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from [Indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks for taking my question. Could you give us a little more color or granularity on Venmo? You've mentioned a couple of times including on this earnings call that it's tracking sort of above your expectations. If you had to adjust the input in your full year guidance, is that any type of a driver in the near term or any incremental color you can give us around Venmo monetization would be appreciated?","Bill Ready","Sure. This is Bill. So as was mentioned, we saw continued strong growth in Venmo up 80% on the quarter to $12.3 billion in volume and our biggest new year's quarter ever for Venmo. In addition to that, as you were calling out, we are quite pleased with our monetization efforts there and those really are along multiple fronts. One in adding new merchants that accept Venmo, we saw some great brands come into the pool with Grubhub, Seamless, Eat24, Williams-Sonoma, [indiscernible] and many others in addition to the 2 million plus retailers that we had already brought in through linking Venmo into its broader PayPal network.","So we are really feeling great about what we are seeing in terms of merchants' receptivity and desire to connect to the demographics that love them so much, as well as the other aspect is our monetizing through things like instant cash out where we earn $0.25 fee for giving instant access to funds out to a participating Visa or MasterCard debit card. So those things are tracking better than our expectations. We're quite pleased overall. I defer to John in terms of the guidance question, but very much tracking, better than our prior expectations.","John Rainey","Yeah. And with respect to the increase in both our revenue and our earnings guidance, guide is not directly attributable to Venmo. It's simply too early on at this point to get out of ourselves. And as - and Bill and Dan and I have talked about many times. We believe that what's important here is the long game. This is a tremendous opportunity to connect with this demographic and monetize it, but we don't want to be so impatient about that that we totally experience long term and so we have the luxury of being able to invest in this and get the experience right given our overall financial performance. The increase in guidance for earnings and revenue was really a reflection of the overall strength in the core business.","Dan Schulman","Yeah. And I would just add to it. I mean we've talked a lot about this, but I think the best metaphor for Venmo is PayPal. I think PayPal has started off as a P2P service, then expanded in the eBay merchants and then into merchants around the world. I think what we are seeing is adoption by merchants and by consumers that's ahead of what we were expecting. But as John said, we think there is a lot of room here on Venmo and we would be cautious with our expectations around that so far. I have to say we are all pretty pleased with what we are seeing.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. A quick follow-up and maybe this one is for John. In the context of the changes to your GAAP earnings guidance, can you just comment on your go forward trends with stock-based compensation? Are you expecting any changes of cadence or any changes to your prior thinking around that level going forward?","John Rainey","Sure. I appreciate the question. We don't other than what we have already noted and just as a reminder we made some changes when we separate from eBay to have our own compensation program, not eBay's compensation program. The effects of those changes were mostly realized in last year with the exception of the change in the vesting cycle related to that. So that is - you do see that a little bit in our results. But if you take - if you just look at the guidance range we provided for share based compensation this year, I think it's assuming around 18% growth. By the same token if you look at our GAAP operating income growth and I'm adjusting for held for sale, because that just creates noise. That's closer to 26% growth for the year. So some of the bigger impacts we were seeing last year and directly to answer your question, we are not anticipating further changes going forward.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks so much.","John Rainey","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Cantwell with Guggenheim Security.","Jeff Cantwell","Hi, good afternoon.","John Rainey","Hi, Jeff.","Jeff Cantwell","Good results and I just wanted to ask you about your bank partnership strategy that you called out this quarter and over the past few quarters or so. Can you just remind us is there provision of a strategy to lower your customer acquisition cost or your funding costs, or maybe you can just talk to us a little bit about what the pieces about bank partnership strategy that you find most important? Thanks.","Dan Schulman","Yeah. I'll start off and then Bill can fill in the color. I think first remember Jeff, the start of a choice where we are giving consumers full optionality to choose on every transaction how they want to pay and as a result of that really opened up the opportunity to work very closely with all the financial networks and the financial institutions issuing partners. Everybody is routed around choice. That's the right thing for consumers and everybody agrees that's the right strategy.","As a result of that, as you can see in our TPV growth of, what's called 30%, that's very, very attractive to the issuing partners. There is no reason as many of them have said directly to Bill and I when we were in conversations at the very highest levels of management within those institutions. There is no reason why we shouldn't be the largest digital distribution partner on that because we can drive incremental growth for them on mobile checkout.","Statistics are two times the industry average and our growth is multiple times out of the industry average and as a result of that they are actively linking their customers and encouraging them to get PayPal to go either established PayPal account or link their cards into an existing PayPal account. So obviously that drives acquisition for us, very low cost acquisition.","At the same time, remember, they were signed to add additional capabilities to us as well. Most of those deals not all of those deals include access to tokens as well, so that you can start to move offline. We have network tokens and the issuing tokens for the instruments so that we can start to embed tokenization in an offline capability within our application and as we've mentioned before you can assume that that's going to be something that we will do as we look forward.","They are also doing things that I think are really powerful for our mutual ecosystem by putting rewards points into their PayPal balance. What does that do for their consumers? It allows them to spend their rewards points at our 19 million merchants. For consumers it's a simple easy way to utilize those reward points or maybe there are other ways that were less easy for them.","And for us it's a low cost funding mechanism and a real value add for our consumers. And so there are multiple different ways that this partnership works and it really - it's moved from being kind of an uneasy front of me environment two years ago to really being one in which we are all, I would say, very close allies in more of the war on cash and the advancement of digitization together. Anything to add?","Jeff Cantwell","Great and then can you just talk to us a little bit about PayPal and bitcoin functionality in the wallet? I'm trying to understand what the big picture thinking is with bitcoin and blockchain, so you can file some blockchain related patents recently. Maybe you can just give us a sense of your blockchain strategy and what the longer term to think in this way? Thanks.","Dan Schulman","Yeah, of course. Thanks for the question. Obviously hot topic that everybody talks about, here is what I would say on that. I would say we are excited about the long term potential blockchain and what it might be able to do in terms of distributed trusted applications and when I say that I don't just mean crypto. I mean things like identity and how to protect identity in different and new ways using things like blockchain.","So as you saw from our patent filing, we have a number of initiatives underway where we are exploring from a long term perspective how we might utilize blockchain in innovative ways to create value propositions that may be even better than what we have today. But I'll tell you blockchain is still in the very first standings. I mean it's just realized at - for many of these things there are limitations not just in sort of the cryptocurrencies on top that are quite still volatile, which doesn't make for a good currency when things are volatile.","And there are also limitations in things like transactions process per second in terms of blockchain and how fast you can process those transactions, how long it takes to wait for the completion of that transaction. So we've experimented with coin base and others in terms of direct connection to crypto currencies. Right now we do not support directly crypto currencies. We don't see the demand for it from our merchants or our consumers. But that should not be any indication that we don't see nor are we excited about the potential of blockchain in the long run. Bill, anything you would add to that?","Jeff Cantwell","Thanks very much. I appreciate it.","Dan Schulman","Yeah, you bet.","Operator","Thank you. And we have time for one last question and that is from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.","Heath Terry","Great, thank you. Looking at the growth that you saw, the upsize growth you saw in P2P this quarter, I'm wondering if you can give us a sense of sort of how this is impacting your funding mix, what kind of benefits that you are seeing from that when we look at the relatively stable cost of funding over the - on a year-over-year basis and in the financials how we should think about what's going on with mix there and the individual costs of the different funding channels you have?","John Rainey","Sure. Heath, this is John. So you are framing the question I think in the appropriate way and that we are seeing - there is a lot of puts and takes to funding mix, but very importantly where there is inflation in the wallet that's being offset by more P2P usage. That said, if we were to look at this even stripping out P2P just looking at the rest of PayPal, there is not big swings. We are talking about a basis point or two here or there.","So even adjusting for the growth in P2P, we are still pretty comfortable with this level of transaction expense from a BPD basis and you will probably remember I noted I believe it was the second quarter last year that we had a high point about 100 basis points and I said that I expected it to come down to this range and really giving everything that we have going on in the business, we will expect it to kind of stay in this range for certainly the next year to two sort of the - for us we have good line of sighting too and not change principally.","Dan Schulman","Thank you, Heath for that question. Thanks everybody for joining us today. We really appreciate your time. We know there's a lot going on today and look forward to speaking to all of you soon. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's question-and-answer session. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference call. This concludes the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great afternoon."],"16902":["PayPal Holdings, Inc.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Ms. Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Gabrielle Rabinovitch","Thank you, Sherrie. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal Holdings\u2019 earnings conference call for the fourth quarter and full year 2017. Joining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO; John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer; and Bill Ready, our Chief Operating Officer. We\u2019re providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being webcast and both the presentation and call are available through the Investor Relations section of our website.","We will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about our company\u2019s performance. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call. In addition, management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for the first quarter and full year 2018 and the expected impact of tax reform. Our actual results may differ materially from these statements.","You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our results in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on the Investor Relations section of our website. You should not rely on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today\u2019s date, January 31, 2018. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update the information.","With that, let me turn the call over to Dan.","Dan Schulman","Thank you, Gabrielle, and thanks everyone for joining us on today\u2019s call. 2017 was a transformative year for PayPal with consistently strong and in many cases record breaking results.","I'd like to highlight couple of areas in particular. First, we achieved record net new actives and engagement on our core platform, by increasing our reach and relevant with both consumers and merchants. Importantly, we anticipate this elevated level of net new actives to continue in 2018. As we experience increasing network effects from our scale. Second, we continue to grow our market share through our increasing leadership in mobile and by introducing a suite of new and innovative services and project experiences for our customers.","Third, we meaningfully strengthen our competitive positioning due to rollout customer choice. The combination of customer choice and our move towards an open platform architecture enabled strategic partnership with many of the world leading companies. Several of these companies had previously been perceived as potential adversaries. The partnerships have opened new avenues of growth from geographic expansion to in-store payments.","Fourth, we announce a new long-term strategic partnership with Synchrony Financial, which will result in PayPal receiving more than $6 billion in cash proceeds at closing. The deal also freeze up more than $1 billion in free cash flow each year, which we will allocate the higher yielding organic and inorganic growth opportunities. Finally, we did all this while delivering consistently strong financial results.","I'll discuss the first four areas in more detail in a moment, but I want to start with our financial results for Q4. I am pleased to say that Q4 was our strongest quarter of the year, capping off landmarks 2017. Payment volume grew 29% on a currency neutral basis to a $131.4 billion, generating revenue of 3.71 billion. Revenue grew by 24% and this is our third consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue growth.","The strong revenue performance combined with disciplined OpEx management drove non-GAAP EPS of $0.55, which was up 30% year-over-year. Our customer metrics were particularly strong. We drove a record 8.7 of new active account [Technical Difficulty]","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, please stand by your conference will begin momentarily. Thank you. Speakers your line is now open.","Dan Schulman","Okay, I\u2019m back. I was in the middle of these exciting results and shocked even our speaker. So, okay, so let me start off just recapping our fourth quarter. As I mentioned, our payment volume was up 29% on a currency neutral basis to $131.4 billion, generating revenue of $3.71 billion. Revenue grew by 24% and this is our third consecutive quarter of accelerating revenue growth. This strong revenue performance combined with disciplined OpEx management drove our non-GAAP EPS to $0.55 up 30% year-over-year.","Our customer metrics were particular strong. We drove a record 8.7 million net new active accounts and that was up 61% over Q4 of 2016. And we ended the year with 227 million active accounts, adding more than 29 million net new actives for the year. And it\u2019s worth noting that we now serve 18 million merchants on our platform. Importantly, engagement was once again higher at 33.6 transactions for active account.","I think it's started to note that our accelerating net new active growth hides the true underlying growth of engagement. If our total net new ads have grown at the same rate last year, our growth in engagement would have increased a 11% to approximately 34.5%. It\u2019s particularly encouraging that our net new active cohorts acquired in 2017 are showing an acceleration and engagement versus similar cohorts from 2016.","The net take away as we are bringing on record, net new actives with higher engagement than ever before and that obviously bodes well as we look ahead. Our partnership with Synchrony Financial accomplishes every goal we set out for our asset life strategy. The transaction substantially reduces our overall risk profile. It provides us the opportunity to double down on our innovative credit experiences for our merchants and our consumers, while sharing in the profit growth.","And as I said earlier, it frees up approximately 1 billion in annualized cash flows and more than 6 billion in cash. If we combined this cash windfall with the ability to repatriate these funds due to the recently passed tax reform bill, we dramatically increase the flexibility of our cash position, enabling us to more efficiently outgain our capital, the higher yielding opportunities. John will be sharing more detail later in the call about the strategic benefits of our Synchrony Partnership and will discuss the impacts of the Synchrony transaction on our Q4 results and our expectations for 2018.","This past year, we saw strength in our leadership position in digital payments and we substantially expanded our opportunities for future growth. We introduced a host of new product experiences and they are driving further differentiation from our competitors. Customer choice essential to this effort and continues to be an important element in the evolution of Phase out. In the fourth quarter, we completed to rollout of choice in the United States, the UK, Australia, Canada and Japan with 30 million consumers now opted in.","In the United States where choice has been live to say more than 12 months, we continue to see a meaningful lift and engagement in payment volume and a significant reduction in churn. And consistent with previous quarters, our transaction expenses remain well within our expectations as evidenced by our increasing OI margin. Across the globe, contact rates into our customer service centers continue to decline.","In fact, in the fourth quarter of this year, we experienced lower overall call lines into our customer service centers than we did in Q4 of 2014, despite our base increasing by 65 million active accounts and literally billion of additional transaction. I attribute our reduction in call volume to not only choice, but to the tremendous strides Bill and as Steve have made in enhancing our core experiences from improved availability to decrease latency to increase feature functionality and reduce friction across our platform.","This quarter was particularly significant in the number of new and notable large merchants who joined the PayPal platform. Merchants are increasingly choosing PayPal for our ability to deliver the tools that need to compete and thrive in an increasingly competitive global and mobile environment. If you combine that with the value of the 209 million engage consumers we bring to their omni-channels, you can see why we have such a strong and compelling value acquisition for merchants.","This quarter, we signed a global agreement with the Walt Disney Company. We welcome Dillards, which ranks among the nation's largest fashion retailers. QVC has agreed to make PayPal available to their customers. The QVC Group is the number three in e-commerce in North America and number three in mobile commerce in the U.S. according to Internet Retailer.","In Europe, ePRICE which is the largest Italian market place began accepting PayPal payments and Dell began offering PayPal credit in the UK. In India, PayPal is available as a way to pay on BookMyShow and MakeMyTrip, the largest online entertainment ticketing platform and the largest online travel company in the country. This holiday season clearly demonstrated the powerful trends that are reshaping retail and driving new consumer behaviors driven by the increasing penetration of smartphones.","These trends drove strong mobile engagement on our platform over the busy holiday shopping season. PayPal processed 48 billion in mobile payment volume in the fourth quarter and that was at 63% growth year-over-year and 36% of our quarterly TPV. For the full year, mobile represented 34% of overall payment volume on our platform with total mobile payment volume growing 52% to 155 billion for the year. Our leadership in mobile continuously driven by the exceptional experiences we're able to deliver.","We continue to drive fast, frictionless and engaging consumer expenses with our One Touch product. We ended the fourth quarter with over 80 million consumers opted into One Touch, up from 40 million a year ago. And the number of merchants offering One Touch now totaled more than 80 million compared with 5 million a year ago. Venmo continues to define digital payments for a generation of passionate users here in the U.S. For the first time in the quarter, they're more surpassed 10 billion in payment volume with 10. 4 billion processed in Q4, an increase of 86% year-over-year.","For the full year, Venmo's volume increased 97% with almost 35 billion in payment volume process. We also experienced another very strong quarter of net new asset to Venmo and added the largest cohort of annual net new actives to Venmo in its history. We continue our rollout to pay with Venmo providing our Venmo users with more ways to pay with the service they love and giving our merchants access to this covenant demographic.","While we're still in the early stages of monetization, we're very encouraged by our initial leads on engagement. In fact, the adoption of services that we're able to monetize on Venmo is tracking above the P2P adoption Venmo experienced at a similar point in its history. Given our experience this past year, we believe our future opportunities are extensive and compelling. We\u2019re writing powerful and accelerating tailwinds created by two global trends, the digitization of cash and the mass adoption of mobile devices.","We're actively positioning ourselves to take full advantage of these trends and strategically moving our business into areas where we believe these transformations are creating the strongest opportunities. Throughout 2017, we redefined our competitive position in our echo system and during strategic partnerships with many of the companies leading the digital mobile transformation around the world. We are down the process of the implemented productive and expensive partnerships with Visa, MasterCard, Discover, Bank of America and China UnionPay.","We are working closely with over 20 of the largest credit card issuers in the world. The majority of which are kicked off campaigns to encourage and in many cases incent customers to engage with PayPal. For example, we are working with both Citi and FIS to create experiences that are driving enhanced consumer engagement and activation. With Citi customers can provision their Citi cards to new or existing PayPal accounts directly from Citi's online property. With FIS, the ability to link accounts directly to PayPal is now available to all of FIS banking customers.","We signed an agreement with Bank of America to enable PayPal as a way to disburse payments on behalf of their corporate clients. And this year, we will integrate credit card reward points from major issuers into our PayPal Wallet, as a funding source for consumers to use when they purchase at PayPal merchants. And we will also begin to rollout the use of industry standard tokens to pay in-store wherever NFC is accepted.","In the quarter, we expanded our partnership with Facebook Messenger, adding a contextual commerce experience that allows sellers send invoices to buyers as well as to adding PayPal as a way to fund P2P transactions within Messenger conversations. In China where mobile payments are a thriving part of everyday life, our relationships with strategic partners have the potential to substantially increase our opportunity.","PayPal is now used by 10s of 1000s of Chinese merchants on the AliExpress website in order to transact seamlessly with PayPal consumers outside of China. We are also purely looking forward to the upcoming launch of our Baidu partnership. In November, we announced a launch of our domestic operations in India opening another substantial market for PayPal, while we have been supporting Indian merchants for years by helping themselves to international buyers. We are now able to work with key merchants to sell domestically as well.","We planned our aggressively expand this programs to more merchants in India throughout 2018. Indian is the market in which the government is actively working towards demonetization and building a modern digital economy, and we view India as a strong and compelling opportunity for PayPal. With well more than a billion digital consumers and a thriving online merchant community deepening our engagement in China and India will continue to be a priority for PayPal in 2018. We believe these markets offers significant opportunities to drive substantial scale.","I would also like to comment on our relationships with eBay. We have a very close partnership and a long history with eBay. This is governed by an operating agreement that runs for another 2.5 years through July 2020. The operating agreement lays out a thoughtful transition and allows for smooth migration from jointly owned entities to independent companies through the five years following separation.","The agreement allows for eBay to eventually become merchant of record and play a more direct role in managing the payment experience on their platform and we\u2019re actively partnering with eBay to help their implementation of merchant of record capabilities. The operating agreement also allows for eBay to work with alternate payment service providers overtime as a transition to merchant of record. As part of that, I am very pleased to announce, the PayPal and eBay have signed a term sheet to provide our brand to services at least through July 2023.","Both our 2018 and our medium-term guidance already includes the anticipated economic impact of the eBay transition, which is quite manageable over a multi-year period. As such we see no need to change our medium-term guidance. Given our long history with eBay buyers and sellers, both Devin Wenig and I believe a manageable transition and sustained relationship is in the best interest of our mutual customers. I am very pleased we have agreed to extend our partnership and look forward to building on strong relationship we've established since separation.","As I said at the beginning of my remarks, 2017 was a landmark year for PayPal on multiple fronts. We entered 2018 with strong and accelerating trends, supporting our increasingly differentiated and expands the value propositions and scale. We\u2019ve expanded our branded PayPal relationship with eBay through July 2023, which was one of our primary goals in 2017. These accomplishments set us up for sustainable and predictable growth over the foreseeable future.","Before we understand the need to work even harder to leave up to and deliver on the value, our customers and shareholders expect from us. We have a substantial opportunity to shape the future of digital payments over the next decade and we are looking forward to another strong year in 2018.","And with that, I will turn the call over to John.","John Rainey","Thanks, Dan. I also want to thank our PayPal customers, partners and employees for making 2017 a great year. We achieved many significant milestones in 2017 and are well-positioned to continue delivering on our commitments and executing against our strategic plans.","Before I go into details of the fourth quarter, I would like to provide a few highlights for the full-year. For 2017, active accounts grew 15% to $227 million and acceleration of 500 basis points over the 2016 growth rate. Payment volume grew 27% on a currency neutral basis to $451 billion. Approximately 34% of this volume was mobile where we saw 52% volume growth for the year.","Revenue for 2017 exceeded $13 billion growing 21% on currency neutral basis. For the full year, revenue related to eBay market places grew 7%, while our merchants' service revenue grew 24% more than three times the rate with our legacy eBay market places business. For the year, non-GAAP earnings per share grew 27% to $1.90 and we return more than $1 billion to shareholders.","I'd first like to discuss the impact of tax reform. We believe the modernization of U.S. tax code is a significant step forward in a clear path of PayPal and its shareholders. The ability to work efficiently and strategically allocate capital is an unmitigated benefit. The full value of which we expect to utilize over the medium and long term, I would note if we\u2019re still the number of open items that require clarification and we may define our estimated impact in future quarters, its further information and interpretation become available.","Our fourth quarter GAAP results include a one-time charge for the 180 million related to the deemed repatriation of unrelated earnings on foreign subsidiaries and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. We expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be in the range of 17% to 20% over the next three years. We will tight this range as we'll give more clarity. I would now like to review the items included in non-GAAP results from the reclassification of our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio to held for sale relating to our November agreement with Synchrony Financial.","These changes reduce comparability to prior periods. We're relevant to the discussion. I will provide normalized results to adjust from these changes. Following the closing of the transaction which we expect to occur in the third quarter, the U.S. consumer credit portfolio will no longer sit on our balance sheet, and we will no longer encore any cost related to the charge off of principal for interest. First, other value added services revenue benefited by approximately $26 million in the quarter as a result of no longer recognized reserves on interest receivables for the U.S. consumer credit portfolio.","Second, transaction and loan losses benefited by approximately $74 million for no longer recognizing reserves on principal receivables for the U.S. consumer credit portfolio; and third, non-transactional related expenses were negatively impacted by $92 million from the recognition of incurred charge offs of principal and interest. There is also a GAAP earning impact from the transaction consistent with our prior quarters related to the agreement and those are noticed in the investor update closer to that.","Moving to our results, for the fourth quarter our total payments volumes was $1.31 billion up 30% on a spot basis and 29% on a currency neutral basis. Merchant services volume grew 33% on a currency neutral basis to $114 billion represented 87% of our volume in the quarter. Volume associated with eBay represented 13% of the total compared to 16% for the fourth quarter of 2016 and 19% two years ago. P2P volume, which is a component of merchant services, and includes volumes across core, Venmo and Zoom grew 50% to $27 billion and represented approximately 20% of total payment volume.","During the first quarter, growth in active accounts was 15%. We ended the quarter with 227 million customer accounts. We added 8.7 million active accounts in the quarter. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter where we have experienced an acceleration in the growth of active accounts, and in each of the last five quarters, we've added a record number of net new customer accounts. Account growth in the quarter was primarily driven by our core PayPal business followed by strong growth in Venmo accounts.","Revenue grew 24% on a spot basis in Q4 with 23% growth in transaction revenue and 32% growth in other value added services. Transaction revenue growth was primarily driven by our core PayPal and Braintree businesses, normalizing for the effect of held for sale accounting revenue growth from other value added services was driven by strong credit growth from the consumer side as well as the acquisition of Swift Financial, both total and transaction take rates are affected by our hedging program, as we recognized hedge gains and losses in international transaction revenue.","In the fourth quarter, we incurred a hedging loss of $29 million compared to a $50 million gain in Q4 of 2016 resulting in a $79 million headwind in the period. For the fourth quarter, our transaction take rate was 2.45%, a decline of 18 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2016, and our total take rate was 2.82%, also down 18 basis points year-over-year. Growth in our P2P businesses led by Venmo and impact from the hedging loss resulted in approximately two thirds of the take rate decline, with the remaining 5 basis points decline resulting from the business mix effect of lower eBay growth in conjunction with strong Braintree growth.","Volume based expenses grew 26% in Q4. Normalizing for the effect of held for sale accounting, these expenses would have grown in line with volume growth. Transaction expense was $1.3 billion and represented 96 basis points of TPV, consistent with the expense rate in Q4 2016, and our expectations that we would see less pressure in the back half of 2017 relative to the first half of the year. Increased core PayPal funding expenses were offset by lower funding costs from growth in P2P.","Transaction loss in the quarter was $248 million or 19 basis points of TPV flat for the same period last year as well as Q3 2017. Loan losses were $75 million, down nearly 40% from the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of the effect of held for sale accounting on the income statement. We estimate that this change in accounting designation benefitted loan losses by approximately $74 million. Due to the change to held for sale accounting we no longer maintain the result for losses and are reflecting incurred losses in the line item called restructuring and other charges on our income statement as part of our non-transaction related expenses.","Our consumer credit portfolio continues to perform in line with our expectations. Transaction margin in dollars was 2.1 billion growing 23%. Adjusted for the impact of held for sale accounting transaction margin was $2 billion, representing 17% growth versus last year. This represents the highest rate of growth since separation. For the quarter, transaction margin as a rate was 57.1%. On an adjusted basis, transaction margin was 54.8%. Non-transaction related expenses or other operating expenses grew 19% in the quarter. Normalizing for the held for sale accounting adjustments, these non-transaction related expenses would have grown approximately 10.5% resulted in 385 basis points to operating leverage.","Further adjusting for the acquisitions of Swift Financial and TIO Networks, we would have seen non-transactional rate of expenses grow at approximately 6% for the quarter. Relative to Q4 \u201916, fourth quarter this year sales and marketing expenses grew 25%, product development costs increased 10% and customer support in operations costs grew 7%. Consistent with the cadence of discretionary spending that we have previously discussed. In the quarter, they were incremental costs related to our acquisitions of Swift Financial and TIO, which expected to grow of our sales and marketing and customer support costs.","In addition, we launch marketing campaigns for our P2P businesses and support at the global launch of our choice initiatives. And in product development, we invested in our India domestic payments business, pay with Venmo and an improving our core merchant in consumer experiences. After adjusting for held for sale accounting treatment non-transactional related expenses increased $0.17 in Q4 for every incremental dollar revenue. After back out incremental revenue and costs associated with our acquisitions of Swift Financial and TIO, these expenses increased only $0.11 for every incremental dollar of revenue.","And for the full year, these expenses increased only $0.10 for every dollar increasing revenue indicative of the underlying leverage and scalability enhance in our operating model. In the fourth quarter, operating income grew 30% to 807 million on 24% top-line growth resulting in the 100 basis points of operating leverage. Non-GAAP earnings per share grew 30% in the fourth quarter to $0.55. Q4 capital expenses were $180 million or approximately 5% of revenue. As a result of changes from the designation of our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio, net new loans of $1.3 billion reduced cash flow from operations in the quarter.","Prior to this change in designation, this amount would have been recognized in cash flows from investing activities. As a result, cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter was negative $147 million with free cash flow in the quarter of negative $327 million. On a normalized basis, we would have recognized approximately $972 million in free cash flow generating approximately $0.26 free cash flow for every dollar of revenue. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $7.7 billion. In 2017, we return $1 billion to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases buying back our stock and the average price of $51.","Our business generates significant free cash flow. In addition, cash reform in conjunction with the expected proceeds from the Synchrony transaction and its implication for our go forward cash requirements position PayPal with meaningful liquidity, flexibility and optionality as it relates to capital allocation decisions. We expect to continue to deploy a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation to preserve this flexibility and make strategic investment to deliver durable increases in shareholder value and long term growth.","In 2018, we planned to continue investing organically pursue acquisitions and partnerships and increase our level of stock repurchases. We are currently executing on tax planning strategies to serve our long term business objectives. The consequences of these strategies in conjunction with regional regulatory and liquidity requirements may affect our cash repatriation plans. We continue to move toward more optical capital structure to support capital allocation decisions and maximize value. In the fourth quarter, we announced a new $3 billion unsecured credit facility and drove down $1 billion at the end of December.","I would now like to discuss our guidance for the first quarter of 2018 and the full year. For the full year 2018, we expect revenue between $15 billion and $15.25 billion representing currency neutral growth of 14% to 16%. This is in line with the guidance update we provided in mid-January and incorporates the expected impact of approximately 3.5 points through the sale of our U.S. consumer receivables.","Our guidance contemplates modest expansion in our non-GAAP operating margin in 2018 and we anticipate non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 17% and 20% and we expect non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.24 to $2.30. For 2018, we anticipate free cash flow to exceed $4.5 billion. This is higher than normal due to the sale of our credit receivables next year. The proceeds of which will be split between operating and investment activities on our cash flow segment.","For the first quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.58 billion to $3.63 billion or 20% to 21% growth on a currency neutral basis. We also expect non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.52 to $0.54. In closing we are pleased with 2017 and the progress we have made across many fronts.","We focused our efforts on building great experiences to our customers which led to a record consumer enrichment patterns to our and an acceleration of revenue and earnings growth. We've demonstrated the stable improvements to our cost structure and significantly de-risked our business with the U.S. consumer credit transaction with Synchrony. We look forward to the opportunities we have in 2018 to continue this progress and further increase shareholders value.","With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.","Heath Terry","Dan and John, there seems to be a bit of a disconnect between the way that eBay is presenting the new partnership or expansion versus the way that that it's coming across on this call in the press release, primarily that the difference being the Adyen partnership that their Adyen partnership that the eBay is talking about is being their primary partner now and that they intend to transition the majority of their marketplace customers to this new payment experience that Adyen's powering. Can you help clarify for us a little bit for how -- basically try and connect the dots between those two? And I know you've talked about they're not being any sort of meaningful financial impact here as we get to the end of the original 2020 date, how does that change?","Dan Schulman","So I start off with just saying that eBay and PayPal have had a close relationship and a long history together. And I\u2019m really pleased that we're expanding that partnership on the branded through July 2023. As I think most people on the call know, there is a five-year operating agreement that governs our separation, and we're halfway through that, we\u2019ve got another 2.5 years left till the end of July 2020. And with this announcement, here there are no changes to any of the terms. And the operating agreement was meant to assure both the thoughtful and a smooth transition for both companies post-separation. And it assumed in the operating agreement that as have we, that eBay will gradually transition to become an MOR.","And consequently all of our numbers, all of our plans have always included that assumption. So as we've given our medium-term guidance, that\u2019s a part of our assumption. And as a result, this announcement does not change our medium-term guidance or the way that we think about our long-term outlook. And let me give you some facts around that because we strongly believe that the eBay transition to MOR is quite manageable for us. So why do we think that? So today, eBay as John mentioned is about 13% of our TPV, our total process volume, transaction process volume and that down about 900 basis points in the last 2.5 years.","So let's just assume that exactly the same thing happens over the next 2.5 years. And that we have no acquisitions of ourselves which finds way as you know we are acquisitive, we are aggressive on that. We had a large cash balances coming to us. So we can talk about acquisitions that will be a part of our strategy going forward. But assuming no acquisition, eBay becomes approximately, at the end of the operating agreement about 4% of our TPV. That\u2019s assuming again the same amount first 2.5 years to the second 2.5 years. And they give less than 10% of our revenues.","If eBay is follows the example and we actually have the great insight because we actually see what happens to marketplaces as they go to MOR because we worked with a number of marketplaces. And where marketplaces go to MOR, it typically takes them several years before the majority of their moves MOR. And we\u2019ve seen this and we've experienced and host MOR, we still retain about a 50% share of check out, and so it takes several years post the end of the OA for the majority of customers to move that\u2019s with our experience that\u2019s been in the real market and post that we retain about 50% share of checkout.","So, we think that this is going to be a very manageable transition over a multiple years post the end of OA. And I'll give you two more thoughts on this and it's very important. One, we renewed the branded relationship with eBay because it is far in a way the most profitable element of the relationship. And two, it\u2019s the most important to our usual customers. And three, it also happens to see a large part of the business as far in a way today. On branded processing, it is highly undifferentiated, it's commoditized and as a result it yields little to low profit. And as we go through this, we're going to be able to set substantial cost because we\u2019re going to be doing that unbranded piece of it.","We'll still maintain the branded, we'll still maintain the most profitability part of this business and what is today the largest, but there is one other really important element, the OA, the operating agreement, also restricts PayPal from partnering with the largest and fastest growing market places in the world as an MOR. So, we\u2019ve simply done an extension of the full operating agreement that would keep that prohibition in place and prevented us from becoming a fully neutral third-party platform. And the opportunity to partner with the world largest market places is immense.","Today, the top 10 market places that were allowed to fully service, generates tens and tens and tens of billions of dollars of TPV, growing at 56% year-over-year and this is just a fraction of what it could be. So, if you sum it all up for us. One, we always assumes MOR. It's in our guidance, it's in our plans. Two, we think there is going to be a very manageable transitions over multiple years, three it opens up a very large and very real opportunities for us to work with the largest next generation market place post the OA.","And so all in this is the best thoughts for PayPal, we\u2019re now well position to continue our strong growth both on the top line and the bottom line actually look at. And so, we feel good about where all this is come out, we look that it very, very carefully, it's always been in our plans and we feel good, now that we have certainty on the direction that we're going.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane","I just want a follow-up on that. Just trying to understand -- my understanding is in 2020 that's when you guys will no longer be the MOR. And then just thinking about going forward then, my understanding is PayPal will still be a button of choice, but it just won't process some of the card payments. And just trying to figure out the economics, what that exactly means when you don't become the MOR? And how that impacts the P&L?","Bill Ready","It's a great question. One of the things to understand that is, as we work with many other retailers out there, they are merchant of record as we work with them and as we are able to go command, even a premium relative to card processing because we deliver greater customer acquisition, higher conversion rates, all those things, we're doing that across much of our business with the merchants or marketplace and it's now functioning as a merchant for the record.","So as Dan was commenting on earlier quite, a lot of insight into exactly how this plays out, and that led to us being able to fully contemplate that as we've laid our future plans and have been doing separation because we know how that works in other marketplaces and other small business forums and have either moved the merchant record or started the merchant record with PayPal still as a predominant way of paying inside of those marketplaces or small business forums.","John Rainey","Bryan, this is John. I would add to that maybe that I think what you're getting to is sort of the economic impact overall and there's a couple of things that point you to. First is, as Dan has suggested in his prepared remarks that our -- in terms of their percentage of our business, it's declined 900 basis points, over the last couple of years. And during that period, we've actually been able to keep margins flat to growing, all right. And if you look at the 10 quarters that we've had, since separation, the average revenue growth of those quarters for our eBay part of our business has been 4%.","If you look at the other 87% of our business that has grown 23%, so if you -- history is not necessarily -- you can't project that forward, but if you were just to take those numbers and project them through to mid 2020 at the end of the operating agreement, that would suggest that in 2021 our revenue growth each year is roughly 50% larger than the entire of the eBay business at that point in time.","So, the other thing I'd point to is that we actually incur quite a cost to support eBay today. So, when we look at things like our losses or our call volumes into op center, those disproportionately skewed towards eBay relatively to their percentage of the TPV. So, we feel very confident that we can continue this trajectory going forward and there's nothing about what's been announced today that changes our thoughts and our ability to continue to grow our top line and bottom line after we operate it here.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang with JP Morgan.","Tien-tsin Huang","A couple of follow-up questions to that, I am not sure if you could share, how much of your profits come from eBay today? But is your ability and your confidence to maintain your midterm guidance, does it require any sort of unusual mediation efforts like cost cutting or share repurchase like get the organic cost cutting or savings from the change? But just curious, if it requires any extra remediation efforts or even the assumption of new marketplace whence? And if I could just hack on one more, is it fair to think that your checkout share, the 50% numbers helpful. But it is fair to think that your checkout share would be higher longer term here just because of how integrated you\u2019ve been with eBay after all this year? Sorry for all the questions.","Dan Schulman","So Tien-tsin, I\u2019ll start. The assumption that we have going forward is that, we will continue to realize the benefits from our scale and our leverage going forward. And so this is not required massive restructuring or layoffs to continue kind of performance that we seen; as I suggested, we\u2019ve been doing this for two years. And we would expect this. We continue to grow other parts of our business that we can continue to generate this kind of leverage. I\u2019ll point you back to the fact that half of our cost based this year and we\u2019re growing $0.10 for every incremental dollar.","Now for other part of your question, does that assume like anything in terms of acquisitions anything like that? It does not and so we think about the -- and if you go back to my answer to Brian\u2019s question, and you think about losing some share of that business going forward. We\u2019re talking about a few points of impact to revenue growth of profitability and that can easily be backfill going out and looking at inorganic opportunities, and this doesn\u2019t also address the fact that with the operating agreement in the mid-2020. We now have the ability to go out and partner with the largest marketplaces in the world, largest and fastest growing market places in the world.","All of these give us an opportunity to backfill, we kind of gap that we might have as we transition to this next chapter with eBay.","John Rainey","Yes. And I think also say that our guidance assumed this. So what that means is that we knew this is going to happen and that guidance that we\u2019ve been giving in the medium-term guidance that we put out there has assumed this happening. So, that means that we've built into our models, costs and things that we know, we can target and take out revenues that we can target. So, this is not anything that we haven\u2019t covered in all of our modeling and all of our plans.","Otherwise, we wouldn\u2019t have been giving that medium term guidance. This isn't a surprise this is exactly what we assume, it was contemplated in the operating agreement and constantly, when I think about kind of the experiences we have, where eBay will be at the end of the operating agreement is multi-year transition and our place as they branded check-out solution. I feel like, this would be one of the events that will, that obviously will have to move, but it will be one of the quite manageable for us going forward.","Dan Schulman","And one of the Tien-tsin, you talk about, one of the market places things like that. As Dan alluded to earlier and as you know, we\u2019re hiring payment platform for many of the best next gen marketplaces in the world already Uber, Airbnb and many others. But as Dan alluded to, not only that many tens of billions of dollars of volume for us and growing 50% plus already, that growths in that business as we think in our other large marketplaces. As growth we seen on an absolute basis is already outpacing the growth we see from eBay. So just the way, we\u2019re already engaging our marketplaces outpace of the growth that we see from eBay and as we are able to contemplate are engaging there and at an un-federal way we think there is a lot more opportunity ahead for us there.","You touched one other points around share of checkout about being over penetrate to given our launch is for the relationship and we don\u2019t disclose specifics about the share of checkout that was certainly it's reasonable to expect as we see 50% approximately with other small business forum when we've been made and embedded overtime what would be a place where we yes or strongly preferred and if you've seen in our consumer base our engagement is going up consistently across our consumer base.","So your point there about our share of checking all we tend to see that our consumers are using PayPal and becoming more engagement with us overtime now left and so their preference for PayPal is increasing and so we think that is goes well for us across any marketplace we work with and certainly as a big part of the branded deals we've done with eBay why that's important to both us and eBay is a continuity of how a significant portions the buyers have been choosing to personally on eBay for a very long time and like we will continue to into the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Just on that point on these other partnerships that you can have with marketplaces. How many discussions that you had with some of the larger ones, that are opportunities? And how significant economically could those be road into sort of what you have with eBay? And then maybe just thinking about the transaction cost element of being a lesser merchant for the networks, does that have any impact to your interchange expenses?","Dan Schulman","We've just had conversations with other marketplaces, as part of the operating agreement, we're prohibited from offerings MOR services to I don't name it -- to the largest consensus for our marketplaces that are out there that are really direct to competitors with these that was part of the operating agreement.","Obviously, each of them have spoken with us, you've spoken to them, but they all know that we are respecting the terms of the operating agreement just as eBay does this well. And so, I do believe that those conversations are quite sincere, and they all do want to think about how they can work with us. But until we get closer to the end of DRA that's what we will be able to give you more about today's information everything out to this point is confidential.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Fawcett with Morgan Stanley.","James Fawcett","I wanted to ask always the qualitative, an additional qualitative follow-up question on eBay. And I'm just wondering how we should think about then what maybe you had to agree to give or give up in terms of being able to secure the extra years of presence of as checkout on eBay and next so that you would have a presence there through 2023? And I guess as part of that, I'm curious like why agree to whatever now instead of waiting to see there were some additional services that PayPal can deliver to eBay that to improve your positioning in long-term relationship there?","Dan Schulman","Yes. James, when we thought that within the OA, this year coming up versus first year that permitted eBay to experiment with MOR capabilities. It\u2019s laid out in the operating agreement as they can choose two countries and do up to 5% of the volume on an MOR solution. So it was the right time and we\u2019ve always thought that we\u2019d never do all these negotiations at the very end. We both feel like we\u2019re going to be partners for a long time and we looked carefully at all parts of this deal, both the unbranded and the branded.","And we felt that the unbranded piece of this was not something that made sense for us. One because we felt the most profitable part of the business was on the branded side and it\u2019s the largest part of the business today. And number two, we in no way wanted to be restricted post the OA in terms of our ability to work with the largest marketplaces around the globe. So for us to be really -- we thought like we didn't give everything up, it\u2019s going to do this now. It was a natural extension. This is important to eBay, it\u2019s important to us that we both signal that we're going to be very close partners going forward.","Bill Ready","Yes. I\u2019d just say on this point whatever given these things, it is as Dan was alluded to very much slightly with firm another large retailer. So when we serve large retailers, we certainly give them rates that are commensurate with their volumes. But we\u2019re not restricted in ways of how we would do that as of others or things like that. So it\u2019s very along the line of a standard commercial relationship that we would have regular retailer.","Dan Schulman","I\u2019ll just add too one other thing, James. As it relates to the unbranded part of the business, volume is obviously important to us but so is profitability. And where this was ending up is something that we weren\u2019t interested in from a profitability perspective. We can certainly go acquire volume as we\u2019ve demonstrated each quarter since separation from many other places. And we have a lot of confidence and conviction in our ability to do that going forward and do it at more profitable rates than what this unbranded agreement would have been.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Condra with Credit Suisse.","Paul Condra","I just wanted to -- can you just clarify a bit, I know that eBay, it sounds like they\u2019re starting this process now with Adyen. So I\u2019m wondering when are you actually no longer restricted to start looking partnerships of other marketplaces, and then my follow-up is just on a different topic. You did mention something about industry standard tokens in the point of sale setting, I wonder if you could just give a little bit more detail about that?","Dan Schulman","Yes. I\u2019ll take the first part of that and then Bill can take the second part. So, we have the ability to partner with many of marketplaces as you probably know, here the underlying payment platform for Airbnb, for Uber and for others. But there was a set of eBay competitors that were carved out within the operating agreement, in which we could not serve them as an MOR. And that goes away at the end of the operating agreement. So at the end of July 2020 that restriction is lifted.","So, and eBay has the ability to start to experiment with alternative PSPs beginning this year, so they can do up to 5% of volume in two countries they select and then that can go up to 10% within a volume within those two countries of the last year of the operating agreement. So they have a change to experiment. Just as we have chance to work with leading market places out there, it's just slow that we might think of this being competitive with eBay we then presented from working with them as part of their operating agreement and that makes sense for both of us as we separated from eBay.","Bill Ready","So for in-store, what we were really like about there just is the continuation of our implementation of Visa and MasterCard took it and network standard tokens around our in-store offering. So, as we discussed previously, we work with GooglePay and with other around in-store efforts, and we\u2019re continuing to rollout our deployment of standard network tokens around those things consistent with RBs and MasterCard relationship that we previously announced.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi","Ashwin Shirvaikar","CAN you comment on both the merchant and consumer engagement trends separately? And I think one related question is, it seems payment transactions and revenue per active are countered I mean higher, but the payment transaction per active account decelerated as well? And then would your answer change, if you separated out eBay or non eBay merchant engagement? Sorry for the multipart but just kind want to get there and get an idea of that.","Dan Schulman","So in terms of the overall engagement, which grew by 8%, in my opening remarks I said if you normalize that anything that change to be decelerating is because we're bringing on so many net new actives in comparisons to the year before. And so when a new customer comes on we would bring them on throughout this year they obviously had it ramped up to the engagement levels that somebody is been here for a year or two have been. So when we take a look at it, we look at every one of those cohorts that came on and we look at their patient levels to 2017 works versus the 2016 co work that we brought on.","And what we see is that our 2017 co work which was 20 over 29 million net new actives have more engagement than the cohort that we brought in 2016. So what that does, that bodes very well for the future of it as those large cohorts of net new actives that are more engaged there before start engaging with the platform overtime, that takes our engagement levels help. And so you would actually see from a double-digit increase and engagement if you normalize with the increase in net new actives.","I think and on the other things we don't break those out, and so we just do a one number although I will say one thing we could also see that we're having acceleration in the number of merchants that are coming out of the PayPal platform as well. So, we now have 18 million merchants on the platform, that's also experienced the same type of growth as we've seen, with our merchant -- our consumer growth as well.","Operator","Thank you. We've time for one last question from Darrin Peller with Barclays.","Darrin Peller","Look I mean I know you're describing the eBay contribution to be relatively minor, but this rolls off obviously, give you a lot of opportunities. One, other things you mentioned was deploying capital to help diversify further. I guess I just wanted to hear more given you now post Synchrony deal tax reform, there should be a ton of cash available for you guys like a considerable some unlevered cash. So can you give us more color on potential thoughts around incremental buybacks they way you've done before? And then what kind of M&A, how fast, it's been a while since we've seen the material size M&A?","John Rainey","It's John. So, in terms of our priorities for capital allocation, those haven't changed. Our top priority is always to invest for profitable growth and that can be both organic opportunities, and also be looking at the M&A landscape and we certainly do allude to given cash balance and the ability to move that across borders, that we can be much more aggressive there perhaps then we have in the past, we are pretty rigorous in looking at all of the different opportunities out there, but we're also pretty disciplined in making sure that there is the right return that creates shareholder value.","So, you can expect us to be active there. At the same point in time, we fundamentally believe that returning cash to shareholders is absolutely a good thing. The thing that I would want to press upon you know is that, we don't feel pressured to go loud and do that immediately to try to show additional accretion or anything like that. Being measured and thoughtful in this area creates opportunities and it creates opportunities that over the long term could pay -- payback much more going out and for example taking a large chunk of our international cash and doing a stock buyback.","So we believe there's a fine balance there and we'll do that and we'll acquire companies and return cash to shareholders as we -- when the time is right for all of those but you could expect us to be active on all of those fronts.","Dan Schulman","And I'd just say that to add to John's point that, we are happy with the set of assets and capabilities we have today. We've got a very robust product pipeline, and we're ready to compete as the leader of the market and I think we're planning from the position strength. I have to agree with John. I think that our balance sheet is a strong weapon for us, 7 billion of cash, bringing in another 6 billion that strong free cash flow, each year, and we intend to stay resilient and be a consolidator in the industry.","We do look at 100s of opportunities every quarter from small investments to larger ones, and as a set of criteria that we look at, we are very disciplined, needs to fit into our vision and mission and need to accelerate our progress across either key vertical and geography or some piece of technology that we don\u2019t have. But bottom-line expect this to be acquisitive, but as John said and both discipline and the thoughtful matter.","Okay. Well, I want to thank everybody for your time to joining us today. We really appreciate it and we look forward to speaking with you soon. Thank you. Thank you, operator.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Ms. Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Gabrielle Rabinovitch","Thank you, Cheri. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal Holdings\u2019 earnings conference call for the second quarter 2019. Joining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO; and John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer and EVP, Global Customer Operations.","We\u2019re providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being webcast, and both the presentation and call are available through the Investor Relations section of our website.","We will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about our company\u2019s performance. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call. In addition, management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties.

We expressly disclaim any obligation to update the information.","With that, let me turn the call over to Dan.","Dan Schulman","Thank you, Gabrielle, and thanks everyone for joining us on today. I\u2019m pleased to report that PayPal had a solid quarter. In the second quarter, we generated $4.31 billion in revenue, growing 12% year-over-year on an FX-neutral and spot basis, or 19% adjusted for the sale of our consumer credit receivables to Synchrony. For the second quarter, we delivered $0.86 of non-GAAP EPS, which included a $0.14 gain from our strategic investments, including MercadoLibre, Uber, and others. Non-GAAP EPS grew 47%, and excluding strategic investments grew by 27%. Our Q2 non-GAAP operating margin increased by approximately 200 basis points year-over-year to 23.2%. This represents the largest year-over-year increase in our non-GAAP OI margin since becoming an independent public company four years ago.","Another highlight of the quarter was our growth in both net new actives and engagement. We added 9 million net new actives in the quarter, up 17% year-over-year. We now have 286 million active accounts on our platform, including 23 million merchants, and we remain on pace to exceed 300 million active accounts by the end of the year. Over the past 12 months, we've added 41 million net new actives, a new record for us. Engagement also continues to consistently improve growing by 9.3% to 39 transactions per active account. Increasing use of our platform helped to drive 172 billion of TPV in the quarter, up 26% on an FX-neutral basis, an increase of approximately 100 basis points from last quarter. Total payment volume, excluding eBay grew 30% on an FX-neutral basis, up 70 basis points from last quarter and outpaced the overall payments market as we continue to gain share.","eBay Marketplaces TPV once again declined approximately 4% in the quarter, and now represents just 9% of our overall TPV, down nearly 300 basis points from Q2 last year. We processed approximately 1 billion transactions per month in Q2, up 28% year-over-year. Mobile TPV grew by 37% to more than 73 billion in Q2. One Touch with 149 million consumers and 13 million merchants remains a clear leader in mobile checkout, with nearly two times the conversion of competing wallets, helping merchants of all sizes increase sales in the competitive omni-channel retail environment. One Touch now enables over 80% of the Internet Retailer 100 in the U.S.","Venmo continues its significant momentum and is well on its way to becoming a daily part of our consumers' financial lives. Venmo total payment volume increased 70% year-over-year to 24 billion in Q2, and we continue to expect to drive nearly 100 billion in TPV by year-end. Venmo continues to significantly grow its revenues with approximately 15 million Venmo users having engaged in a monetizable transaction.","With another quarter of outstanding net new active growth, Venmo continues to offer significant opportunity for merchants to attract a valuable, engaged consumer base. In addition, to adding Fandango, Stitch Fix, 1-800-Flowers, TodayTix and TicketNetwork to our growing list of merchant partners offering Venmo as a way to pay, we continue to enrich the Venmo experience by making it even more engaging and personalized. In the second quarter, we added Bitmojis to the Venmo app allowing users to include a personalized Bitmoji along with the payment notes of their Venmo transactions.","As we work to improve the financial health of hundreds of millions of people across the globe, I'm thrilled that we recently expanded Xoom into 32 new send markets throughout Europe. Customers across Europe can now use Xoom to send money, pay bills, or reload phones to more than 130 markets internationally. Launching Xoom's full capabilities globally is an important development for us as our upgraded tech platform increasingly allows us to deploy capabilities across multiple countries as opposed to the country-by-country rollouts we've previously deployed.","This quarter, we announced the PayPal commerce platform, a new solution that will help our merchants drive their sales volumes in the digital commerce era. The PayPal commerce platform is designed to meet the specific needs of marketplaces, e-commerce platforms, and crowd-funding sites by bringing together a comprehensive set of technologies, tools, services, and financing solutions for businesses of all sizes.","Powered by PayPal's unique two-sided network, the PayPal commerce platform is nearly any business access to a flexible, customizable suite of services that enables global growth, simplifies compliance, provides risk protection, and empowers their end-to-end payment capabilities. Our business financing solutions are another way that we're helping businesses grow and achieve their ambitions.","This quarter, we began offering our PayPal business loan product to PayPal merchants in Canada, allowing them to access financing to build and sustain their businesses. This follows the expansion of our business financing solutions to Germany in Q4 2018, in Mexico earlier this year in partnership with Mexican lending platform Konfio. Since launching our business lending solutions, we provided access to more than 10 billion in funding through 650,000 loans and cash advances to more than 0.25 million small businesses around the world. In June, the UK Competition and Markets Authority provided final approval of our acquisition of iZettle. We are now beginning to integrate iZettle's products and themes around the globe, which we expect will significantly strengthen PayPal's in-store presence. ","Finally, we continue to partner with leading technology platforms and financial institutions to reimagine financial services. We believe that the full potential of FinTech can only be realized through partnerships that leverage the best of our collective assets. In the quarter, we expanded our collaboration with Google to allow businesses to accept PayPal with Google Pay through their apps and websites. This feature is now available in all 24 countries where Google Pay supports PayPal as a payment method.","We both solidified and extended our global partnership with Uber, and also announced that we intend to explore future commercial payment collaborations including the development of Uber's digital wallet. As part of this agreement, we invested $500 million in a private placement and we couldn't be more excited about deepening our relationship with this innovative partner, and we are almost complete with our MercadoLibre commercial agreement. This will significantly deepen our strategic relationship and expand our international scope and scale.","We expect this will include integration of PayPal into the MercadoLibre marketplace, open our merchant network through our smart payment's button platform to MercadoPago customers and link our respective consumers together for P2P and international remittances.","These developments represent significant milestones on our journey to be the worldwide payments platform of choice, helping to enable global commerce by connecting the world's leading marketplaces and payment networks. These are complex multifaceted partnerships and they take multiple quarters to come to fruition.","As we've deepened these relationships, we are frequently seeing the opportunity to deploy capabilities well beyond our initial scoping. While the scope expansion has delayed some of our initially planned deployment dates, it bodes well for the ultimate scale of these initiatives. And while these delays have slightly affected our revenue guidance for the year, we remain quite confident that the majority of these will be implemented by year-end. We are also raising our EPS guidance for the year and expanding our operating margin and we are confident in the medium-term targets outlined at our Investor Day last May.","We certainly have no shortage of opportunities in front of us and we look forward to shaping an exciting future with our partners, customers and employees. And with that I'll turn the call over to John.","John Rainey","Thanks Dan. I want to start off by thanking our customers, partners and global team for helping us deliver another solid quarter. We had strong performance both financially and operationally. We grew non-GAAP operating income 22% to $998 million and our reporting records for both operating margin and operating margin expansion. We also generated more than $1 billion in free cash flow in the quarter which grew 40% on a normalized basis. Operationally, trends in our net new active accounts, engagement and TPV remain strong. Our performance demonstrates the consistent strength of our platform and the scalability of our model.","Revenue in the second quarter increased 12% on both the spot and currency-neutral basis to $4.31 billion. Adjusting for the sale of U.S. receivables to Synchrony revenue growth was approximately 19%. Acquisitions contributed approximately 1.8 points to revenue growth in the quarter. In addition the effect of the stronger dollar net of hedging was a revenue headwind of $35 million. U.S. revenue grew 7% versus Q2, 2018 and approximately 20% adjusting for the credit receivable sell.","International revenue grew 18%. On a spot basis transaction revenue grew 17% in the quarter. Revenue from other value-added services decline 21% as a result of the receivable sell. On a normalized basis, it grew approximately 30%. In addition, we recognized $58 million in revenue from Synchrony related to loan servicing and collections. As planned, Synchrony took over these services at the end of June. Going forward, we will no longer benefit from the revenue related to these services.","In the second quarter, transaction take rate was 2.25%, compared to Q2 2018, this was a decline of 13 basis points. Strong growth in P2P contributed to approximately half of the decline. Ongoing weakness in eBay's Marketplaces business and pressure from the stronger dollar on a few key cross-border corridors were also responsible for the reduction.","Total take rate in Q2 declined 27 basis points from the prior year. Approximately 60% of this decline was attributable to the credit receivable sell. The same factors that affected transaction take rate also contributed to the decline in our total take rate. Both transaction take rate and total take rate benefited by approximately five basis points from revenue related to our hedge gains.","Volume-based expenses increased 15% in the second quarter to $1.9 billion. Transaction expense was 94 basis points as a rate of TPV improving four basis points from Q2 2018 and two basis points sequentially. The reduction in transaction expense as a rate was primarily due to the timing of the realization of benefits from volume incentives, which were recognized in the third quarter last year.","For the remainder of the year, we expect our transaction expense as a rate of TPV to be in the range of 95 basis points to 98 basis points. Transaction loss was 14 basis points as a rate of TPV, a decline of five basis points from Q2 2018 and four basis points sequentially. This reduction in transaction loss was driven by improvements in our risk management capabilities. Loan losses were four basis points as a rate of TPV in line with recent performance.","Transaction margin dollars grew 9% to $2.4 billion in the second quarter. Transaction margin as a rate was 55%, a decline of approximately 120 basis points versus Q2 2018. Over the past four quarters, the credit receivable sell has been a meaningful driver of the decline in transaction margin dollar growth. We expect growth to reaccelerate in the second half of 2019 and be in the range we reported prior to the Synchrony announcement.","Non-transaction-related expenses grew 2% versus last year. Growth in these expenses was affected by both the lapping of held-for-sale accounting changes, which resulted in a lower rate of growth year-over-year, as well as an increase in expenses related to our 2018 acquisitions. Normalizing for both non-transaction related expenses grew 6%.","On this adjusted basis, we delivered 300 basis points of operating leverage with these expenses increasing only $0.11 for every dollar increase in revenue. This is indicative of our sustained ability to grow at a low marginal costs. Across our business, we're pleased with our operating discipline and cost performance. Our scale continues to afford us leveraged opportunities.","On a non-GAAP basis, operating income in the second quarter grew 22% to $998 million and our operating margin expanded approximately 200 basis points from Q2, 2018. Adjusting for 2018 acquisitions, operating income grew 24% and our operating margin expanded 280 basis points in the quarter.","Other income in the quarter increased by $201 million, primarily due to a $187 million increase in net unrealized gains on strategic investments. On a per share basis, unrealized gains contributed approximately $0.14 after tax. $0.01 of this benefit was included in the EPS guidance we provided in April. The incremental $0.13 was not in our guidance and resulted predominantly from our investments in MercadoLibre and Uber.","Consistent with the plans we discussed on our last earnings call, we disclosed the expected effect of these unrealized gains on our second quarter earnings in our 8-K released on July 9th. Non-GAAP EPS for the second quarter grew 47% to $0.86. Adjusting for unrealized gains of $0.14 this year and $0.02 last year, non-GAAP EPS grew 27% in the quarter. Our strong EPS results reflect the operational outperformance with solid revenue growth, efficiencies and cost discipline, all contributing in a meaningful way.","We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $10.7 billion. In addition, we generated more than $1 billion of free cash flow or approximately $0.24 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue.","Now I'd like to discuss our updated guidance for 2019 and our guidance for the third quarter. For the full year 2019, we are raising our earnings outlook and lowering our revenue guidance, which I will speak to in a moment. We now expect non-GAAP earnings per share to grow 29% to 31% and be in the range of $3.12 to $3.17. Our raised earnings guidance reflects the outperformance of our business in the first half of 2019. It also incorporates the unrealized gains we have recognized from our strategic investment portfolio.","As a reminder, these investments may create earnings volatility as we move through the year. Subsequent to quarter end and prior to the release of our earnings, we plan to continue disclosing the effect of these investments on our results. We also expect to expand our non-GAAP operating margin by approximately 100 basis points this year, demonstrating our sustained ability to scale our business -- incremental costs. For the full year, we are lowering our revenue outlook to a range of $17.6 billion to $17.8 billion from our prior range of $17.85 billion to $18.1 billion. This new range reflects growth of 14% to 15% for the year, and adjusting for the sale of receivables 18% to 19% growth.","Since we last provided guidance in April, a few key factors have contributed to revisions to our forecast. First, as Dan mentioned, we have a few big product integrations with partners that are experiencing delays in part because of their expanded scope. Second, our previous guidance contemplated the implementation of certain price changes that we are now delaying. While the timing has shifted out a few quarters, we still expect to realize the full benefits of our partnership and pricing initiatives.","And finally, approximately 20% of our volume is cross-border and affected by changes in foreign exchange rates. We now anticipate that continued strength in the U.S. dollar will have a greater impact on our revenue in the second half of the year than we've previously expected. These changes to our 2019 revenue expectations are primarily related to the timing of initiatives. Our medium-term outlook for revenue and earnings, as provided in May 2018, has not changed.","For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $4.33 billion to $4.38 billion, or 18% to 19% growth on a currency-neutral basis. In addition, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.69 to $0.71, representing 20% to 23% growth. Our third quarter EPS guidance includes an estimated $0.03 benefit from unrealized gains we expect to recognize in the quarter.","In closing, we are pleased with the progress we are making across many fronts. We are advancing our strategic priorities and at the same time sustainably improving our cost structure. The cash flow generating power of our business continues to give us great flexibility, as we allocate capital with discipline. We are focused on creating value for our shareholders and strengthening our position as the world's leading digital payments platform for our customers.","With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We ask that you please limit yourself to one question and return to the queue for any follow ups. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. ","Jason Kupferberg","Hey, great. Good afternoon, guys.","Dan Schulman","Hey, how are you? How's it going?","Jason Kupferberg","Good. So just wanted to start with a question on the revised revenue outlook. So we're taking, I guess, about $300 million out and, John, you walk us through three factors driving that. Any way you can kind of give us the relative sizing on those factors. And then, if you could also just elaborate on some of the comments you alluded to about these revenues absolutely being delayed, not lost. Are we interpreting that properly and should we assume that the lion's share of this essentially ends up getting recognized in 2020 or does some of it bleed into 2021? We'd love some more color on that. Thank you. ","Dan Schulman","Sure, Jason. So without being specific on any one of the three items I've mentioned, I would say that the magnitude of them are in the order that I laid them out; product integration first; pricing second; and then macro FX being third. I think, to address your last point, we expect to realize the full 100% of the benefit from all of these. This is simply a delay in the realization of those benefits until 2020.","I'll emphasize that when you're a company our size that is growing at the rate that we are, oftentimes we have to make educated guesses about the time frame of a lot of these launches taking place. Sometimes, we do better than what we expected. Sometimes you get into something and you see scope expansion because of good opportunities or more complexity, and that results in a delay such as the case that we're seeing right now, but we still have a lot of excitement about what these opportunities present for us and do expect to realize the full benefit on a run rate basis.","John Rainey","Let me just jump in on this, Jason. Appreciate the question. Yes, this is a matter of when, not if. And when we talk about when, we're talking about the next several quarters. And so for us, we feel like we had strong operational performance in the quarter.","If you look at our net new actives, those were up by 17%. If you look at our engagement, again up by 9% plus. You look at just little things that actually matter a lot like our risk improvements that we've put into place, part of that is the result of acquisitions that we've done with Simility that's lowering our risks and helping our losses. These are all very sustainable types of things, and that, while the revenue is delayed, it's certainly not lost. In fact we're confident all of that revenue will come in.","The margin improvements are more permanent. And because we're just seeing those, this isn't taking away expenses from one thing to improve margins. These are sustainable margin improvements based on either better experiences that we're putting out or just better capabilities that we now have in the business.","So I would say, we feel really good as we look forward on this. It's unfortunate that some of these are slightly delayed, but I'll give you an example. One of these that were delayed was Paymentus.","Paymentus is an extremely large strategic partner of ours. It is a brand-new vertical and we're putting into our stack. It involves integrating all of their multiple pillars into our platform, involves integrating them into our app, and is a massive partnership for us. It's going to take a little bit longer than we thought, but everything we hoped for is there and actually more. So it's just a good example.","We probably underestimated the amount of work it would take to go and do that, and there is also as John mentioned, a lot of scope expansion that occurred. But it's a great partnership and we'll have other bill payment players that will join as well. And so, this is a matter of revenues being delayed not lost, and we're trying to do this in a way that assures that when we do implement whether its partnerships or pricing changes, they're done in a world-class manner.","And so, I don't want to jam something in, in the quarter. I want to make sure that we're building the right sustainable long-term things for this business. And if we've got to delay something a quarter or two, so be it to make sure that we do this the right way.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay, understood. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. ","Tien-Tsin Huang","Thanks. Good afternoon. I want to ask on margin again. It looks like you be able to take the bottom line hereby showing a little more operating leverage against the lower revenue outlook. So what levers exactly are you pulling to make this happen? Are you sacrificing growth investments to do it? And I guess very importantly here for a lot of us, do you have more margin levers available to you in the event revenue continues to face delays? Thanks.","John Rainey","Hey Tien-Tsin, thanks for the questions. I'll start and Dan may want to add a couple of things, but let me start with the headline that we are not turning away growth opportunities to achieve the leverage and the operating margin expansion that we have in business. We believe that, we've got significant opportunities. And we've talked a lot about these in the past, things like what we're doing around customer service for example, how we're driving the contact rate down, how we're actually lowering the cost of that service.","Even the very way that we develop product, we're becoming more efficient at. And then, you have to also remember over the last four years, we were propping up an independent public company, and that requires investment in things like compliance and a lot of the back-office functions. And so those are largely behind us. And so what you're beginning to see right now is the realization of those economies of scale. And that said, I think fundamentally the main point here, but there's also an added point that I would point to this quarter, which is slightly different than what you've seen in some of the more recent quarters, and that's what we've done in our volume-based expenses.","So if you look at both transaction expense and transaction losses, they appreciably declined as a rate of TPV from the prior quarters. Now, I called out the reasoning for the transaction expense decline, and that's certainly more of a transitory nature and sort of a timing impact on that, but transaction losses is one that has the potential to become more permanent. Now one quarter does not make a trend, so I don't want to call this out as what we should expect going forward, but this was truly based upon improved modeling and capabilities that we have in our fraud detection and risk management. And so, we're very encouraged about that. And as we begin to \u2013 or we continue to refine those models over time, hopefully that type of decrease in the rate of losses for TPV is something that can become more sustainable for us.","Dan Schulman","Yeah. I'd just add on top of that. When I look at like for instance our Q2 revenues. We're right in the range that we predicted. And we would have been at the high-end of the range were it not for some of these FX headwinds. And as everyone on the call knows, FX headwinds can be against you one quarter and with you another quarter and that's why we give a range on that. Even with that, we still grew our revenues by 19%, on a normalized basis, EPS was up 27%, and we generated more than $1 billion of free cash flow. But most important to me the operational metrics that we really look at whether it be net new actives, whether it be engagement, whether it be TPV were all close to records for us.","Like MS, TPV excluding Marketplaces or eBay was up 30.2%. I think that's like in the last six quarters is like at a high before that or type for high in the last six quarters. So when I think about our revenues, and I think about our operating metrics what the drivers of those are, they're all really quite strong. Yes, there are delays in some of these key partnerships and these key partnerships will drive a lot of revenue, but those key partnerships will happen. We're well underway. We understand exactly what the critical path is going forward on that, and the pricing as well. We have pricing. It's both up and down, but when we put pricing out there, I want to make sure that it's transparent, it's easy to be understood and we have all of our processes in place to support any pricing changes that we might make and just be sure we execute in a world-class manner.","So I think not only do I think the margin improvements are sustainable, and as John mentioned, potentially there are quite a bit more to be found, but there are drivers of our revenue are quite strong and I anticipate those to stay that way.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Understood. Thank you.","Dan Schulman","Yeah. Thanks, Tien-Tsin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research.","Darrin Peller","Hey thanks guys. Look when considering the medium-term outlook, it obviously looks like from at least the revenue side does sound like it's short-term in nature from what you're saying. But the drivers as you just mentioned, Dan are very strong. In fact I think they're better than what your medium-term typical guide suggests around, whether it's TPV or net active growth or even engagement levels. I guess first of all, just -- can you just reiterate if you can still see the same sustainability to that that those drivers you've been seeing? What gives you the confidence you can see that in the next year or two?","And then I guess just to follow-up on the partnerships, I mean it sounds like some of these are pretty material in terms of opportunities. So not only net new active growth and the drivers exactly in terms of the revenue flow-through, could that cause a pretty big reacceleration in 2020?","Dan Schulman","Yeah. So I do believe that the drivers of the business are not just sustainable, but we've got the potential to do better. I mean, we've got continued strong growth in our net new actives, 41 million over the last 12 months, nine million this quarter, up 17%. The 286 million active we have, that's up 17% year-over-year, and 23 million merchants on the platform, adding almost one million merchants a quarter right now.","So -- and you're seeing both PayPal and Venmo accelerate versus last year. And I talk a little bit about them on a second to your -- like your revenue review point. But look you've got, obviously, a network effect that's really kicking in right now. If you're a merchant, we have so many consumers that want to use PayPal or Venmo now as a way to pay. They almost have to be a part of the network and the same thing from a consumer perspective. We've got merchants everywhere that are accepting us. And so that network effect is continuing to kick in.","Very importantly though most people think about net new actives as the top of the funnel, but when you have a base as large as ours, the churn rate is just as important and all the improved customer experiences that we've done from choice to additional Venmo monetization efforts to P2P flows, to our new revised app those are all reducing our churns and making a big difference in the number of net new actives.","We've got global expansion that's happening. We're at the tip of that iceberg in global expansion for us. Obviously, we're getting more net new actives from Brazil, from India, from Japan but we're just beginning in those markets. And a partnerships like the ones we're going to do with MercadoLibre, ones that we're going to do with Uber are yet to kick in.","We're still -- we just rolled out Xoom expansion to 32 new send markets. We've got other international markets that we're planning to enter into. And so, I see net new actives as sustainable and maybe even being better than where we are.","And engagement, the same thing is happening. It's just improving. I'll give you an example of that. And this is a really -- it's quite a positive thing in numerous ways. The new net actives that are coming in on Venmo have more engagement than previous net new actives and that new engagement is around the monetizable services. Because that's what they're coming into.","They're coming into a value proposition that has all of that, so they're aware of it and they're using it more and more. And so, you've got increased engagement, increased monetization efforts and increased revenue. I mean, on the Venmo side, we're seeing really nice quarter-over-quarter revenue growth. We are well exceeding, not just our budget on Venmo, but our most recent forecast on Venmo revenues. And I really couldn't be more pleased with the efforts that that team is doing, with incremental monetization efforts still to come later this year.","John Rainey","Darrin, I would just add a couple of points, I think, to emphasize some of the items that Dan spoke to, but when you ask, like, what gives us confidence in our medium-term outlook, I put it in three categories. The first is that, our business is performing very well. If you take our quarterly results, growing revenue 19%, another quarter of 9 million net new actives, expanding operating margin to 200 basis points, the type of cost performance that our core business is performing well.","The second, as Dan mentioned, is that one of the best indicators about the future of our businesses is the new cohorts of customers that we're bringing on. And we are seeing those cohorts be more engaged in the previous cohorts. And the third category, I would put broadly into just the opportunity set that we have.","So when you look at things like the partnership with Paymentus or Facebook, or what we're doing in Venmo, what we're doing from a product development standpoint around reward points and card recovery, all these opportunities and more that we haven't listed, give us a lot of conviction about our ability to continue to deliver on that medium-term guidance. ","Dan Schulman","Yeah. And to your point, Darrin, when you think about something like Paymentus and what the revenue opportunity is there, it is quite significant, because we're entering into a brand-new vertical. And when we're entering into a brand-new vertical, it's a lot of work to get it done, but the reward is quite large and commensurate with that work as well.","Darrin Peller","All right. That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks guys.","Dan Schulman","Yeah. Thank you, Darrin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. ","Bryan Keane","Hi, guys. Just want to follow up on the pricing changes that are now delayed. I guess, where were the pricing changes delayed and why? And then, when does it get implemented now?","John Rainey","Hi, Bryan, I'll start with that. This is John. We made some changes to our user agreement that allowed us the ability to make certain pricing changes. And I would emphasize that, I think, sometimes the knee-jerk reaction is to assume that all price changes are up. Sometimes we can decrease prices to go after more volume.","So we haven't been real specific about what those are, but when we implement a price change, we always want to have that associated with a value proposition to the customer. And when we took a step back and we looked at the effort to improve some of those customer experiences around those price changes, it was more complex than what we imagined, and we want to be measured as we roll this out. We \u2013 I think a theme that you'll continue to hear from us is like we are trying to build a great company over the long-term and we're not going to be so rigid and pushing products out to market, or otherwise that we do something that is not to the standard that, we hold ourselves to. And so generally that's \u2013 that's how we're thinking about some of these pricing changes. We would expect though to go forward with these price changes and perhaps others, either at the tail end of this year, or early 2020 and realize the benefit from them.","Dan Schulman","Yeah. I'd just add on to John's comments, because I think we're right on. Look, pricing is like an ongoing journey for us. We're always assessing better maybe more transparent ways to serve our customers. We are always looking at the market dynamics out there, evolving practices of our competitors, and then we look at the value we provide and we try to price appropriately based on those factors. And as John said, we're absolutely determined to be sure that anything we put out into the market that the experience is a great one. So understand both transparent. We've got all the support necessary for it, and we'll make sure that happens. But as John said, we do anticipate all of these go into effect over the next several quarters.","Bryan Keane","Got it. Thanks for taking the question.","Dan Schulman","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from David Togut with Evercore ISI.","David Togut","Thanks so much. You highlighted that Venmo was exceeding your revenue growth forecast. Can you give us some color on where you stand with the biggest drivers in terms of monetizable experiences whether it be instant withdrawal Venmo debit card or a Pay with Venmo with merchants?","John Rainey","Sure, David. I'll take that. There's a \u2013 if you look at the composition of the various ways that we can monetize Venmo. It hasn't changed that much from previous quarters, to date still instant withdrawal is the largest contributor of monetization for us, and then the other half roughly is split between Venmo card and Pay with Venmo. We do expect those to change over time as we've said previously to where ultimately pay with Venmo will be the largest contributor of how we monetize Venmo.","So in terms of the progress there, I would say that, when we look at all of the initiatives that we've implemented this year, or have made progress on this year. This is one probably that stands out as performing better than what we initially expected going into the year. I don't want you to misread my comments. I don't think it's appreciably different from what we talked about, but certainly better than what our initial expectations are. So we're still very pleased about the progress that we're making there and it's well on track with our expectations.","David Togut","Thank you.","John Rainey","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.","Heath Terry","Great. Thank you. As we think about the string of deals that you announced back in the spring with Uber, MercadoLibre, Facebook, even iZettle's clearance, is there a benefit to the 2019 revenue expectations or guidance from those deals? Or maybe just more broadly when and to what degree do you expect to begin to see an impact from that spring of deals?","Dan Schulman","Yes. So I'll start off and then maybe John will talk. I think we'll talk a little bit more about next year on our next call. But overall, those are two relationships that we would do time and time again. MercadoLibre is going to significantly enhance our international scale and scope. We see a tremendous amount of opportunity as we integrate our two networks together.","If you think about it just in big generic terms, we'll have some 500 million people on our combined network together. MercadoPago customers will now be able to access PayPal merchants around the world. PayPal consumers will be able to buy from MercadoLibre marketplaces merchants. And we're very excited about the potential of linking wallet to wallet on international remittances, as well.","And so we see a tremendous amount of learning we'll get from each other and a tremendous amount of incremental opportunity as a result of that. Uber, we already had a very strong relationship, but this not only solidifies that relationship, but we're in deep conversations with them on how to expand the extent of our partnership and to help them drive growth and experiences that they want for their customers and our mutual subscribers.","And so that is really quite a bit of an everyday use case for us. We think that will help on both engagement metrics for us both on the Venmo and the PayPal site. These other partnerships that we have certainly going to add to our volumes and our capabilities, we have a lot of high hopes for what bill pay can do. It's obviously a huge vertical. We\u2019ve had numerous people talk to us about it. Our customers are clamoring for it. We'll do full-step processing around that as well. So it will drive quite a bit of incremental volume and revenues for us.","As John has mentioned numerous times, partnerships like Facebook take time to develop and to move forward. Facebook like us wants to assure that they have the right experience, but when you look at the volumes that can be driven there, we'll be measured and how we think about it as we look at next year, but we're excited about that potential. ","John Rainey","If I may add just one thing, as it relates to capital allocation some of the acquisitions that we've already made. And so, I think sometimes what is overlooked is the opportunity for a compounding effect with multiple of these acquisitions.","And so I'll give you two examples. The first are the acquisitions of Hyperwallet and Simility which provide capabilities like payouts and risk-as-a-service. That enables us to provide a more comprehensive suite of services and a new product rollout like PayPal Commerce Platform, very important to that.","Second example would be something like iZettle. So, I think, it's generally acknowledged that Latin America is an area that we are less strong. Certainly, that influenced our strategic investment in MELI, but iZettle has a presence in Latin America. And so, we can build upon these complementary capabilities from, either the partnerships or acquisitions that we've taken to strengthen our presence in some of these geographies where we are less strong today.","Heath Terry","Great, Dan and John, really appreciate that.","Dan Schulman","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson.","Lisa Ellis","Hi. Good evening, guys. Maybe bridging from that last question actually, can you give an update on your M&A plans, given it has now been over a year since Simility and Hyperwallet? Should we be thinking that additional acquisitions are imminent? Or is that part of your strategy, sort of, a back burner given the number of -- and the scope of these partnerships that you're working on? Also, I guess, I'll tuck-in there, given the three mega mergers elsewhere in the ecosystem, are you still exclusively focused on tuck-ins? Or are you sort of rethinking the possibility of potentially larger-scale deals? Thank you.","Dan Schulman","Any other questions you want to ask? Those are all good questions. So, look, I'll just say that, from an M&A perspective, I think, in general we're pretty well positioned. We've got a ton of internal innovation rate that is going on. Our toolsets for our engineers, the productivity improvements are dramatic there. And so, we're seeing more and more releases, more and more experiences that we can put out. We obviously have a lot of strong partnerships and a lot of capabilities that we can digest from those partnerships as well.","John mentioned it, but obviously our balance sheet is only getting stronger with $10.7 billion of cash-like assets on that. We generated over $1 billion of free cash flow. We still are consistent in that, we're looking to do anywhere between $1 billion and $3 billion of a tuck-in type of acquisitions that help us either from a time-to-market perspective or geographic expansion, or things that get scale and scope through things like partnerships.","So, we look at hundreds of potential acquisitions every single quarter. I think you can expect us to be acquisitive going forward. That will be a part of who we are on an ongoing basis. I don't -- as I think about these consolidation in the merchant acquiring space, we're partners with all of those combined entities.","I think there is a rational why they needed to do that as online and off-line started to blur, as some needed feet on the streets, others needed online acquiring capabilities. I would say those mergers in and of themselves don't make me feel like there's a need to do a larger acquisition, but we've never ruled out larger acquisitions. They just need a clear a very high strategic fit and hurdle for us, but we look at the potential for acquisitions from smaller to larger and we'll continue to do so.","Lisa Ellis","Terrific. Thank you.","Dan Schulman","Yep. You bet.","Lisa Ellis","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. And we have time for one final question from George Mihalos with Cowen.","George Mihalos","Hey, thanks. Thanks for squeezing me in guys. Maybe just building on that capital allocation theme, I think John you guys didn't buyback any stock this quarter. How are you thinking about the buyback going forward relative to some of the other capital allocation priorities M&A and like?","John Rainey","Sure, George. It's good to speak with you. So, if you go back to May of last year, where we laid out our capital allocation priorities they still remain the same. And that's over that medium-term time frame of the next call it three to five years. We expect that approximately 40% to 50% of our free cash flow will be used to return to shareholders and that we will spend on average about $1 billion to $3 billion, a year with acquisitions and strategic investments.","Now, as I'm sure, you appreciate that \u2013 we're going to be optimistic from one quarter to the next. And sometimes, there are competing priorities in a quarter. And also times, it's worth noting that, because of things we maybe working on, we maybe subject to blackout dates as well, in terms of when we can go buy back stocks. So I would discourage you from reading too much into the fact that, we didn't buy back stock.","We still intend to buy back the amount that we've talked about. But again, we \u2013 I think we have the sort of the fortunate position to be opportunistic given the opportunity set that's out there in the industry, and so we'll kind of bounce around from one quarter to the next with how we allocate capital, but over that medium term, we'll stick to those tenants that we've provided.","Dan Schulman","Thanks very much George for that question.

Please go ahead.","Gabrielle Rabinovitch","Thank you, Keith [ph]. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us.","Welcome to PayPal Holding's earnings release conference call for the second quarter of 2016. Joining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO, and John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer.","We're providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being broadcast on the Internet and both the presentation and call are available through the Investor Relations section of our website.","In discussing year-over-year comparisons, including guidance growth rates for the full year 2016, we have chosen to present non-GAAP pro forma metrics because we believe that these metrics provide investors a consistent basis for reviewing the Company's performance across different periods. We will also discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about our Company's performance including the non-GAAP pro forma metrics mentioned above. You can find a reconciliation of these metrics to the most directly comparable GAAP metrics in the presentation accompanying this conference call.","In addition, management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for second quarter and full year 2016. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in this call. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our operating results in our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on the Investor Relations section of our website. You should not rely on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today's date, July 21, 2016. We disclaim any obligation to update the information.","With that, let me turn the call over to Dan.","Dan Schulman","Thanks, Gabrielle. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today.","I'm pleased to say we had another strong quarter, with our financial results at the high end of our guidance, and in many cases exceeded our own expectations. And of course we announced earlier a multiyear partnership with Visa.","But before I discuss our results, I'd like to point out that it's been one year since PayPal became a publicly traded company for the second time. In many ways, our listing last year was a full circle moment for PayPal. It allowed us to return to the core mission of our founders, the mission they were pursuing when they took PayPal public in 2002. Even with the Internet in its infancy, they saw the opportunity for technology to democratize money.","Today our purpose is the same, but our opportunity is much greater, with the digitization of money accelerating and the adoption of mobile devices continuing its rapid pace globally. PayPal's total addressable market has grown to include all of digital commerce and digital money, a $100 trillion opportunity. Today's announcement with Visa brings us closer to capitalizing on that opportunity.","The mission of PayPal is clear. We're striving to become an everyday essential financial service for underserved customers. And for our merchants, we want to provide a full service solution and platform that enables digital commerce. We were making tangible and consistent progress towards achieving these twin goals, while consistently delivering strong financial performance.","I'm proud that Q2 was another strong quarter for PayPal, both financially and strategically. Our partnership with Visa will help drive consumer choice and provide enhanced value to the larger payment ecosystem. But first let's look at the financial metrics we delivered this quarter.","We grew revenue at 19.5%, delivering $2.65 billion on the top line. Given the challenging comps from Q2 last year, this exceeded our internal forecasts and guidance. We processed $86.2 billion in total payment volume, an increase of 29%. And our merchant services volume expanded 36%. Our mobile payments volumes continued to accelerate, up 56% this quarter, accelerating for the third straight quarter. And we hit a record of over $24 billion in mobile TTV [ph] in the quarter.","In the last 12 months we've added 19 million net active accounts, finishing the quarter with 188 million customer accounts transacting on the PayPal platform. And even as we add new active accounts, our transactions per account continue to expand, reaching 29 this quarter, up from 26 a year ago.","We generated $495 million of free cash flow in the quarter, giving our business tremendous flexibility to continue to reinvest in our growth. In the first six months of 2016 we produced $1.1 billion of free cash flow, on track to meet our guidance of more than $2.1 billion for the year.","And finally, we delivered $0.36 of non-GAAP EPS versus our guidance of $0.34 to $0.36. I'm proud of the PayPal team and they work hard to deliver these strong results.","I'd like to now spend some time talking about the partnership announcement we made today with Visa and the progress we are making towards enabling our strategy of being a true customer champion.","Being a customer champion company is not just words for us. In order to be a great company over the long term, we need to provide the very best experience for our customers. We believe that means giving our customers full choice and optionality in where they want to pay and how they want to pay. This change in our business model positions us to better serve our customers and is fundamental to the long-term growth and success of PayPal.","While we expect this to drive incremental expense, we now have evidence to support the assertion that customer choice will benefit both our business model and our customers' over the medium term. Our improved onboarding experience, which we began rolling out last quarter, gives customers more choice when opening a PayPal account and has already resulted in lifting our activations.","In the coming quarters we will be rolling out account setting and check-out experiences that also deliver enhanced customer choice. We believe these new experiences will result in improved engagement and a reduction in customer churn, all very good things for both our customers and for PayPal.","But we are already seeing another significant benefit. By making customer choice a priority for PayPal, we are opening up new opportunities for partnerships within our ecosystem.","Today PayPal and Visa announced a strategic partnership to further expand our longstanding relationship. This agreement will allow both companies to offer greater choice to merchants and consumers and increase value to Visa issuers and PayPal customers.","The benefits of this partnership include our ability to gain access to Visa's tokenization services, starting in the United States, for instore PayPal transactions. This will allow customers to pay with their Visa instruments and the PayPal wallet at the millions of retail locations where they see the Visa contactless logo. Importantly, retailers can expect to pay fees that are consistent with other contactless transactions they accept today.","We will provide greater accessibility for Visa payment instruments and the PayPal digital wallet. PayPal will also provide Visa, their issuers and their cardholders additional visibility into each Visa funded transaction, providing greater transparency and enhancing payment system security. The agreement affords PayPal certain economic incentives, including Visa incentives for increased volume and greater long-term Visa fee certainty and removes the threat of any targeted pricing actions.","This deal has the potential to be transformative for PayPal, Visa and the industry. We believe it provides us the flexibility and the capabilities to execute against our customer champion vision, to partner with issuers and others who share our vision, and to accelerate PayPal's instore access in new and profitable ways. We also believe it provides more options for growth and the ability to partner with others to mutually cross-sell our various current and projected services to consumers and merchants around the world.","All of these will take some time to come to fruition, but this agreement opens up a new chapter for PayPal. Giving customers choice in how and where they want to pay provides a pathway over the long term from our goal of two transactions a week from our current engagement of just over two per month.","It's also important to say that we welcome the opportunity to work with more partners like Visa to share our vision and we are in discussions with a variety of players in our ecosystem. This is a new PayPal, one that is actively partnering across the digital payments landscape.","For example, in the quarter, we also expanded the European rollout of the Vodafone Wallet we talked about last quarter. Consumers in Spain and Italy can now tap-and-pay in stores with PayPal and Visa, another example of how PayPal is opening our platform to a slew of new partnerships. Our partnership with Facebook continues to expand, as do our efforts with Google, Pinterest, Alibaba and eBay.","I'm pleased with the quarter's results, but we still have much to execute through the back half of the year. We need to continually innovate and deepen customer engagement in order to maintain and further widen the distance between our value proposition and that of our competition. And in keeping with that focus, Q2 saw a significant progress in consumer and merchant engagement on the PayPal platform. We are making steady strides in our efforts to become an everyday essential financial service for underserved customers.","In the second quarter, transactions per account increased to 29, and we processed 1.4 billion transactions, a new milestone for PayPal and an increase of 25% from the same period last year.","Deepening consumer engagement is no accident. It is driven by our innovative products and an increasingly robust platform, designed with our customers and their needs in mind. Our aim is to deliver transformative products that make payments easier, faster, more reliable and more secure, online, in mobile, in app, and in store. One Touch, our contextual commerce services, Venmo, and Xoom are all perfect examples of this.","One Touch is the most rapidly adopted product in PayPal's history. As of the second quarter, over 25 million consumers have opted in to One Touch, and I'm pleased to say that we now have over 2 million merchants offering this innovative way to pay. With a market-leading 87% conversion rate, we continue to see increased engagement and conversion with the use of One Touch.","We are continuing to invest and innovate in contextual commerce. Last year Pinterest launched its first foray into buyable buttons. Braintree powers 80% of the Pinterest launch merchants. Building on this infrastructure, we are now powering Pinterest's new shopping bag functionality that lets shoppers pick items from across the web, collect them in a shopping cart, and make a single purchase. This brings over 10 million unique products to pinners for even richer and more convenient in-context shopping experience.","And Venmo continues its rapid growth. In the quarter, Venmo processed some of $4 billion in P2P payments, an increase of 141% year over year. We are very focused in making steady progress with our Pay with Venmo pilot. We've added eight more next-generation apps, beyond Munchery and Gametime. These include Parking Panda, Priv [ph], Wish [ph], Box [ph], App Market [ph] and Pashmark [ph]. We have also further expanded the Venmo pilot from 1 million to 3.5 million Venmo users. We expect to add many more merchants and all of the Venmo consumer base later this year.","Xoom's U.S. customers can now send money to loved ones in 53 countries, and it continues to redefine global remittances through mobile technology, ending the quarter with more than 70% of transactions originating on a mobile device. We continue to see the benefits of our integration efforts, with Xoom adding more than double the number of net new actives this quarter versus a year ago. I'm pleased to say we're executing on how to position business case, and I have high hopes what Xoom can offer to PayPal consumers in the years ahead.","All of these innovative new experiences are driving PayPal's leadership in mobile payments. As I mentioned, PayPal processed over $24 billion on mobile payment volume, an increase of 56% year over year, and mobile now represents 28% of our total payment volume, up from 26% in the first quarter.","Mobile is arguably the most competitive arena in the digital payment's ecosystem, and PayPal continues to widen its lead and gain share. Two quarters ago we grew our mobile volumes 45% year over year, last quarter 54%. And despite a substantially increased base of mobile transactions, we grew 56% this quarter.","We also continue to make substantial progress in acquiring new merchants and now have more than 14.5 million merchants transacting on our platform. An increasing ability to provide a suite of innovative services for merchants is not only accelerating our competitive differentiation but enabling us to be seen as a true full services MS partner. PayPal's merchant services payment volume was $71.3 billion in the quarter, increasing 36%. Leading merchants continue to choose PayPal, including Ikea in multiple countries, the world's leading cruise brands of Carnival Corporation, including Carnival Cruise Line, Princess Cruises, Holland American Line, and Seaborne. Russia's Vkontakte, Europe's largest social media network with 360 million users. Women's fashion brand Talbot's. Cathay Pacific. And Evenbrite, the world's largest self-service ticketing platform, has now launched with Braintree full-step processing. And Braintree continues to gain momentum, rapidly adding new merchants, ending the quarter with 309 million cards on file, an increase of 101% from the same period a year ago.","Finally, PayPal working continues to be an important way we engage our small business merchants and support their growth. In Q2 we exceeded 2 billion in originations since our launch. We've now funded more than 90,000 small business merchants in the U.S., U.K. and Australia. Our working capital merchants see an almost $0.50 increase in payment volume for every dollar of working capital expended to them by PayPal, clearly a powerful tool for our merchants.","Finally, I'd like to mention a few accolades we've recently received at Highlight, the strong progress we've made in the past year as an independent company. First, our financial performance has earned us a place on the Fortune500 list at number 307.","Importantly, we are now being recognized for our leadership in innovation. Recently, InformationWeek named PayPal the number 11th company in the country in terms of technology innovation.","And the value of our brand is also on the rise. The Financial Times recently came out with the BrandZ listing of the top 100 most valuable global brands. PayPal was one of the top 10 brands that increased its value most in 2016, gaining 35% and rising from number 88 to the 65th most valuable brand across the globe.","And finally, and perhaps most meaningfully to many of us, consumers in the United States recently ranked 180 top brands across the world in terms of social impact and doing the most good in the world. PayPal was ranked among the top five companies across the globe.","We've made strong progress in the 12 months since becoming public. We have a lot of work ahead of us, but the opportunities are coming into sharper focus and are now clearly within our reach. We remain focused on executing with both discipline and excellence for our customers and for our shareholders.","I'd like to now turn the call over to John. John?","John Rainey","I also want to thank all of PayPal's customers and our employees worldwide for making this another great quarter.","Q2 marks another quarter where we advanced our goals of becoming a central part of our customers' daily financial lives, strengthened our position in the ecosystem, enhanced our value proposition as a customer champion company. First I will walk you through the highlights of our second quarter results.","On a currency-neutral basis, total payment volume was $86.2 billion, an increase of 29%. U.S. payment volume grew 27% and international volume grew 21%. Our merchant services business grew 36%, demonstrating that our strategy of being a customer champion and moving from being a payment button to an end-to-end payment solution for merchants of all sizes continues to gain transaction.","We ended the quarter with 188 million active accounts, an 11% increase from a year ago. Account growth was predominantly driven by our PayPal Afford [ph] offering, followed by Venmo. The number of payment transactions per account increased to 29, up 13% year over year, and an acceleration from the first quarter. This, when combined with the increase in active accounts, contributed to payment transaction growth of 25% year over year.","In the second quarter we generated revenue of $2.65 billion, up 19.5% on a currency-neutral basis and 15.6% on a spot basis. Q2 revenue exceeded our expectations as a result of strong performance in our core business and Braintree.","In the second quarter we faced difficult year-over-year comparisons from the amendment of our Synchrony co-branded credit card agreement and the sale of a portion of our credit receivables portfolio last year, as well as the larger currency hedging gains in Q2 '15. We are pleased with our very strong top-line performance and our ability to offset these year-over-year pressures.","Transaction revenue increased 23% on a currency-neutral basis in the quarter, an acceleration from the first quarter. Performance was driven by large merchant growth in our core business and strength in the Braintree business. This resulted in a transaction take rate of 2.69% for the second quarter, a decline of 22 basis points year over year. The decline was primarily driven by lower currency hedging revenue in the quarter versus last year, the growth of our P2P business, including Venmo, and the mix shift towards Braintree and larger merchants.","Revenue from other value-added services was flat versus last year, driven by the amendment of our Synchrony agreement and the sale of our credit receivables in Q2 of last year, offset by solid results from our credit products.","Transaction expense and transaction and loan losses, our volume-based expenses, increased 28%, in line with total payment volume growth. This resulted in a transaction margin of 59.8% versus 63.8% in Q2 '15. In the quarter, on a year-over-year basis, the transaction margin decline was driven primarily by strong performance by Braintree, which has a lower take rate and higher transaction expense, the lapping of the amendment to Synchrony agreement, and the sale of a portion of our credit receivables, and the high-margin hedge revenue we recognized in Q2 '15.","Other expenses grew 10%, well below revenue growth, and drove 185 basis points of leverage. Excluding the acquisition of Xoom, our other expenses increased approximately 7%, demonstrating good cost control. We continue to be focused on strong expense discipline. The scale of our platform allows us to carefully manage the growth of these other expenses, even as our revenue grew nearly 20% on a currency-neutral basis. We continue to see opportunity to manage these costs over time.","We delivered operating income of $528 million in the second quarter. For the first half of 2016, operating income increased 10% to $1.1 billion. Operating margin for the second quarter was 19.9%, a decline from last year, predominantly driven by the items I already mentioned affecting revenue: the amendment of our Synchrony agreement and the sale of our credit receivables, both of which dropped directly to the bottom line. We were also impacted by the acquisition of Xoom, which was approximately 40 basis points. But excluding these items, operating margin would have expanded approximately 100 basis points year over year.","We generated non-GAAP EPS of $0.36 per share for the quarter, the top end of our guidance range. For the first half of 2016, non-GAAP earnings per share increased 19% to $0.73.","Second quarter capital expenditures were $201 million or approximately 8% of revenue. Free cash flow in the second quarter was $495 million, representing $0.19 of free cash flow for ever dollar of revenue.","During the quarter we also returned approximately $300 million to shareholders by buying back an additional 8 million shares. Year to date we returned approximately $900 million to shareholders, repurchasing 25 million shares at an average price of $36.34.","We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $6.2 billion, including approximately $1.3 billion in the U.S.","I want to take a few -- make a few comments regarding the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union. First, we should acknowledge that we are in the very early days, and exactly what happens from here will take some time to unfold. Europe generally, and the U.K. specifically, are very important parts of our business that we will continue to serve.","In the second quarter, approximately 12% of our revenue was generated in the U.K. Because of the global nature of our business, we typically see a counterbalance effect when any one currency measurably weakens or strengthens. This is particularly pronounced in certain corridors like the U.S. and Canada and the U.K. and the E.U. due to proximity and consumers' awareness of currency shifts.","In the medium term we're obviously going to keep a close eye on the broader economic environment and any effect on customer behavior. From a foreign currency standpoint, the euro and the pound are the two currencies where we have the most exposure. For that reasons, we hedged both currencies and our exposure from a translation perspective in 2016 is minimal.","Importantly, our E.U. business is operated through our Luxembourg bank where we are allowed to passport our banking license among the E.U. member states. The U.K.'s decision to exit the E.U. will have some impact on the regulatory framework under which we operate. We have been assessing the ramifications of a Leave vote since the referendum was announced, and once we have better clarity on how the relationship between the U.K. and the E.U. with respect to financial services will be governed, we will take the necessary steps to be able to continue to serve our customers in the capacity that we do today.","Now I'd like to give you an update on our credit portfolio. Our credit products support and complement our platform, enhancing our digital payments offering for both our consumers and our merchants. Credit drives a positive network effect for our business, increasing volume and engagement on our platform. Credit represents approximately 2% of our TPV, and in the medium term, we expect the TPV contribution from our credit products to remain around this level.","In addition, as we've said previously, we continue to assess asset-light strategies to fund and grow our credit offering. The performance of our credit portfolio continues to be in line with our expectations. In the second quarter we saw improvement in our delinquency rates and most of our other credit quality metrics. We have, however, experienced a higher percentage of our late-stage delinquent consumer credit balances rolling to charge-off. This has resulted in a charge-off rate of 6.3% versus 6.1% last quarter. We attribute the increased charge-off to changes in our own collection efforts that were recently instituted. We've taken steps to address this impact on the back half of this year.","As Dan mentioned, our agreement with Visa, and more broadly, our strategic decision to invest in customer choice, is a great opportunity for our customers, our shareholders and other partners in the payment ecosystem. This partnership will help drive the digitization of payments both in mobile and in store. Much has been made about the blurring of the offline and online world through digital payments. The agreement with Visa is an important step allowing us to more fully participate in this powerful secular shift with our mobile-first strategy, complemented by Visa's instore strengths.","We have an expansive vision for PayPal, including being an everyday part of our customers' financial lives. Customer choice, as we refer to it, involves empowering our customers to use PayPal where they want to pay and how they want to pay, and is the vehicle for achieving that vision.","For the remainder of 2016, we do not anticipate any material impact to our results from the movement to choice. Beginning next year we expect changes to our funding mix from customer choice will increase transaction expense. But at the same time, we believe expanding customer choice will unlock future revenue opportunities. Moving to customer choice and our agreement with Visa lay the foundation for sustainable revenue growth, with more certainty in our cost structure. It's very early on and we're only six months through the year. As we get closer to yearend, we will provide more detail on the impacts of this and how it affects our 2017 performance.","Finally, I'd like to discuss our financial guidance for the third quarter and full year. Our strong performance in the first half of the year across our core business, Braintree and P2P, in addition to our growing mobile penetration further validates our strategies and our business priorities.","As a result, we are raising our full year 2016 revenue guidance to $10.75 billion to $10.85 billion, or 19% to 20% growth on a currency-neutral basis. We are also narrowing the non-GAAP earnings range to $1.47 to $1.50 per share, representing growth of 18% at the high end of the range. And we are reaffirming our full year 2016 guidance on free cash flow, CapEx and non-GAAP effective tax rate.","For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $2.6 to $2.67 billion, or 19% to 21% growth on a currency-neutral basis. And we expect non-GAAP earnings of $0.33 to $0.35 per share.","In conclusion, our second quarter results demonstrate the continued progress we are making in our business. Revenue is strong and we are combining that with excellent cost control to generate healthy margins and strong free cash flow. We continue to allocate capital in a way that generates shareholder value. And our partnership with Visa has removed an overhang on our business, giving us greater cost certainty going forward, allowing us to profitably participate in the offline market, and creating the foundation for being a customer champion.","With that I'll turn it over to the operator for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Our first question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your question please.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan","Thanks. Good afternoon. Congrats on the Visa deal. I was curious, can we still rely upon your midterm guidance after considering the Visa partnership? I know there's a lot of moving pieces obviously, but curious if the midterm guidance still applies.","John Rainey","Thanks, Tien-tsin, appreciate it. This is John. We'll update that, if it's appropriate, as we get closer to the yearend. Like I suggested in my prepared remarks, we're very early on into this. We're very encouraged by the agreement. We think it's a fantastic opportunity for PayPal. And it's likely to positively affect the way our financial outlook and for the future. But we're not prepared to update that at this time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry of Goldman Sachs. Your question please.","Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thanks. On the part of the Visa agreement around contactless payments and the enablement of offline acceptance, can you give us a sense of what the process is going to look like for that? Visa mentioned on their call that you still have to get sort of approval from the financial institutions, from the merchants. How do you intend to kind of get more out of this enablement than we saw out of the Discover deal and what's the roadmap look like to get there, you know, particularly from a timing perspective?","Dan Schulman","Hey, Heath, it's Dan. Thanks for your question. So we're very excited about the partnership with Visa. I think it's very important to understand that, I think as Charlie said on the Visa call, partnerships like the one we announced today work best when there's alignment for everyone. And we believe that we've designed an agreement that works for PayPal, Visa and the issuers. We've been in discussions with issuers, Visa has been in discussion with its issuers, and they're excited about the benefit from the volumes that we can bring to them and that we can bring to point of sale. And as Charlie pointed out, this agreement removes many of the concerns, if not all of the concerns, that issuers and others in the ecosystem have about working with PayPal.","You know, choice is something that everybody has been talking about. What issuers want, what we want, is the ability for a consumer to make a choice, to have options as to what payment tender type they want to pay with. What that basically means is that, you know, a consumer could pay with their credit, with ACAs, with debit, with cash, with P2P, with PayPal credit, any of those, but it's the option of the consumer to make that choice.","And then when you add on top of that optionality, the fact that we are very willing and happy to share the same sorts of data that somebody would get with a typical credit card swipe back to the network, back to the issuers and to customers, that's exactly what issuers have been asking for.","We actually think that this deal that we have with Visa offers a couple of benefits. Obviously it offers access to tokens at rates that are comparable to other contactless methods out there, and so we can compete with anybody now at a point of sale, there's no competitive disadvantage to anybody else out there. And we can go offline profitably.","Second, we get fee certainty, as we talked about, no targeted actions against PayPal, limits our new fees, even industry-based fees and volume-based discounts. So we have certainty around our cost structure. And very importantly, I think this opens us up to new partnerships: new partnerships with issuers, networks and others.","Choice and data turn us into their friends. And when I think about the partnerships that we have, we're an ideal distribution mechanism to drive more online and mobile spend to issuers. They're an idea partner to drive incremental net adds in customers into the PayPal platform. That's a win-win for both of us. And this is going to open up a new chapter for PayPal to partner with and for all of us to work together to advance digital payments going forward.","And as I mentioned in my remarks and John mentioned, a choice also is going to help us drive incremental new net adds. We're already seeing that in some of the changes we've made to our onboarding. When you look at One Touch and you see what our customers do when they're able to default a payment mechanism, their engagement goes up, the conversion rates go up. And obviously, when a customer gets to choose what instrument they want, we're going to see less calls come into customer care for us, we're going to see customer satisfaction go up. And typically when that happens, customer churn goes down.","So we think this is a very strong agreement that benefits Visa, its issuers, and us, allows us to work within the ecosystem. And the issuers don't need to sign any unique agreements with us. It's simply an opt in to participate with us. It's no additional work from them. And our movement to choice, data sharing, plus our commitment to quality, I think puts us on a par with others that are using Visa tokens in the ecosystem.","Heath Terry - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thanks, Dan.","Dan Schulman","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis of Bernstein. Your line is open.","Lisa Ellis - Bernstein","Hi guys. Good afternoon. So, one just follow-up question then on the Visa arrangements around activating at the point of sale, how -- in that scenario, do you guys remain the merchant of record? And does it flow over your acquiring platform? Or is the construct more of a pass-through wallet, as that's envisioned?","Dan Schulman","For the point of sale, we would do kind of pass-through on the token level, so that there'd be transparency on that. We've always said that we are perfectly willing to use the industry tokens and do that on a pass-through basis. And this agreement allows us to do that.","It allows us, one, to approach merchants with rates that are comparable to any digital wallets that are out there, so this whole card not present\/card present rate structure that people have talked about, this takes away that concern as well. So it's an agreement that our two teams spent a lot of time working with, a lot of time making sure that the issuer population was also comfortable with it. And we think it is a, really, a tremendous win for all the parties on that.","Lisa Ellis - Bernstein","Got it. And on those transactions, sorry, just to clarify though, it's still processing over your acquiring platform?","Dan Schulman","It is, yes.","Lisa Ellis - Bernstein","Right? Meaning like the merchant will be paying you directly their typical take rate.","Dan Schulman","That's correct.","Lisa Ellis - Bernstein","Okay. Okay. Terrific. Thanks guys.","Dan Schulman","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from James Friedman of Susquehanna. Your question please.","James Friedman - Susquehanna","Hi. I was going to pivot out of the Visa conversation and ask you about Braintree. I think in the past, Dan, you've disclosed, or discussed at least, some of the backlog in Braintree. I was wondering if you could update us in fact quantitatively, what does it take to actually active the merchant from the backlog from a Braintree perspective? Thank you.","Dan Schulman","Yeah. So we're making very good progress in terms of our ability to work through the large demand that we have for Braintree. In effect, we try to make it as easy as possible on a merchant. We have ADI sets [ph] that makes it easy to integrate. It really depends on the extent of the integration that we're doing in any of the customization [ph] that we have to do. But I'd say we're making really good progress on keeping up with the demand. Right now the demand is strong, as John mentioned. That's why we're -- part of the reason why we're taking up our revenue forecast. But I'm really pleased with our ability now to onboard these customers and bring them live, to say [ph].","James Friedman - Susquehanna","Thank you.","Dan Schulman","Yup.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from George Mihalos of Cowen. Your line is open.","George Mihalos - Cowen & Co.","Great. Thanks for taking the question guys. I was wondering if you can give us a rough sense how much of TPV now goes through the Visa network both on a credit and debit perspective? And I just want to be clear, there is no initial incentive that is going to be provided to that volume starting day one, right? You'll have to go negotiate that with the issuers.","Dan Schulman","We have volume-based incentives from Visa themselves. There are also other potential terms that we could do with issuers specifically.","Your first question was?","John Rainey","How much volume is on Visa.","Dan Schulman","Yeah.","John Rainey","And that's not something we'll disclose, but maybe, George, a construct or a framework to kind of think about this, because I understand why you're asking the question.","If you consider we have just rough order of magnitude $300 billion of TPV today, and if you were to look at funding shift on that, that would overstate the effect of funding shift, because this agreement for now is U.S.-only, and as we've disclosed in the past, that's roughly half of our TPV. We also see differences in funding mix between P2P versus goods and services, so you've got to strip that out or at least treat that differently. And we disclosed earlier this year that P2P is roughly $40 billion of our annual TPV.","And then lastly, you need to also consider that there's a large percentage of our customers today that only have a card in the wallet. So, choice for them, there'd be no other increase in cost by moving -- by adding additional card or doing a different card. So from the cost side, that's the right framework to think about this.","George Mihalos - Cowen & Co.","Okay. That's very helpful.","Dan Schulman","I'd also add to it, George, that, remember, this is about optionality. So, all tender types will be presented to the customer, present to choose the tender type that makes the most sense for them for that particular purchase. And we've seen that that is a beneficial thing when we offer customers that ability.","John Rainey","Yeah. Even the early stages of testing some of these experiences with customers, we see really encouraging signs just in things like customer activation where you remove some of the friction from that process. And as Dan alluded to earlier, One Touch has been a great testbed for us as we've seen pretty dramatic increases in engagement after someone activates there.","George Mihalos - Cowen & Co.","Okay, great. Just a quick follow-up. John, I think you talked about taking some steps on the PayPal credit side to maybe mitigate some of the increases that you've seen in charge-offs. Can you elaborate on that, what that might mean for the back half of the year?","John Rainey","Sure. So as Dan talked about on the call last quarter, since we've become an independent company, we've really tried to establish ourselves as at least aspiring to be best in class when it comes to compliance. We think that that's really important for us. That's part of being a customer champion. And so we've taken steps across every aspect of our business to improve our compliance.","And so, specifically, we changed some of the ways that both we contacted customers as well as the repayment options for credit. That had some effect that on the late-stage delinquencies. There are other methods that we can do to mitigate that impact and we're going ourselves with those options for the back half of the year.","Dan Schulman","And I'd also just say, John mentioned, we're seeing some improvements in the underlying credit quality of our base, delinquency write-offs on that. So it's just that one particular bucket that we saw an increase, and so we're taking actions to address that. But in terms of the overall portfolio, we're very comfortable with what we're seeing on that.","John Rainey","Yeah. If I can just add maybe a little bit more color to that, our total delinquencies were actually down year over year. When we look at the percentage of our portfolio that's rated prime or above, that grew by a point, a better credit quality year over year. The 90-day delinquency is down year over year. And our portfolio of FICO store is relatively flat with where it's been.","So it's -- look, we're very keen on all the concern around this, with other players in the ecosystem, and we're aware of that. So it's something that we're hyper-focused on.","George Mihalos - Cowen & Co.","Okay, great. Really appreciate the color.","Dan Schulman","Yeah. You bet.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi. Your line is open.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citi","Thank you. Good afternoon, Dan and John. Congratulations on getting the deal.","Two separate questions. On the Visa-related customer choice, when you say no impact in 2016, is that indicative of your view as to how long it might take to implement specific deals with issuers? I guess that's the first question.","And the second is with regards to, how does the agreement affect your relationship with merchants, and I guess your weighted average funding cost is an important part of the discussion but not the only factor. If you could comment on those.","Dan Schulman","So in terms of our guidance for 2016, incorporates any impact that there might be from customer choice. But you're right that this takes some time for this to be implemented and to move forward. So our guidance incorporates any impact that there might be from customer choice. And as John mentioned, we will wait until we get closer to 2017 to give 2017 guidance.","First of all, obviously we'll take a look at consumer behavior as a result of this. There are a number of discussions going on in the ecosystem and we want to look at the totality of the landscape before we really talk about what 2017 could look like. And finally, we're halfway through the year, we got a full another six months to execute against and let's see how our momentum takes us before we provide 2017 guidance.","And on the merchant side, merchants have been working with us quite closely as we're creating a platform for them to take advantage of digital commerce. And that basically means letting a merchant write their own application. And we power that application through a platform that enables them to extend our value proposition to their customers online, on the mobile, and instore.","And part of that instore environment, when it comes to the takeout wallet, we did not have tokenization schema, we've used different swarms of that. And so from a merchant perspective, the rates now that we can offer on an instore point of sale transaction are significantly more competitive for them. So it just strengthens our position in terms of working with merchants. No change in our strategy, but certainly strengthens it and opens up a wide opportunity for us. As we talk about the blurring of online and offline coming together, this really opens up our ability to move into any context, whether it be online, in app or instore with our digital wallet.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citi","Okay. I guess a quick follow-up if I may. In terms of the online choice, how is Paydiant affected by this, if it is?","Dan Schulman","Yeah, great question. Paydiant impact. Paydiant is part of our fundamental underlying platform. So when you think about the piece parts that we've started to put together, we had PayPal that was obviously very strong and online market. Braintree extremely strong in the mobile and in app marketplace. And Paydiant, very strong in the instore environment.","And so all of those are now coming together and being integrated, so that we can offer merchants the ability to look across any of those contexts and use our platform to power and enable their move to digital commerce. Then what we've done obviously is, because our base is so large, we take our branded PayPal wallet, which now available to go into more context, as I've just mentioned, and write up those applications, because we have so many subscribers that we can bring to those merchants.","And so you've got a platform play that's really unbranded, that supports a merchant's move into digital commerce, and then a branded wallet. And this helps us with our branded wallet to move into that offline space.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citi","That's great. Thank you for that explanation.","Dan Schulman","Yeah. You're welcome.","Operator, I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Yes, we do, sir. That question comes from the line of Bill Carcache of Nomura. Your line is open, sir.","Bill Carcache - Nomura","Thank you. Dan, there are some skepticism regarding the willingness of issuers to promote PayPal. Could you speak to what you think will lead issuers to want to promote their brands on PayPal during the exclusivity period? And maybe give a little more color on what the receptivity has been in your discussions with the large issuers. And finally, what your confidence level is that you'll be able to get some of them onboard.","Dan Schulman","Yup. So we have a high degree of confidence in that we haven't worked this agreement in a vacuum, nor has Visa worked it in a vacuum. We've obviously been working with the issuer community. We've obviously been very close communications with them. We've been in close communications actually throughout the whole payment ecosystem with quite a number of players. And this move towards choice, our ability to open up our data, is something that issuers have been asking us for for quite some time. I think they are, based on our conversations, conversations that Visa has had with its own issuers, and we've been a part of some of those, there's a lot of excitement about the ability to partner and work together.","We think we could be a very strong distribution channel for them. You've talked about that in some of your write-ups, and that's exactly the vision that we are moving towards, and we have a good degree of confidence around that.","Bill Carcache - Nomura","Thank you. If I may, a follow-up for John. John, I believe that you made the point at Investor Day that the increase in your transaction expense rate from the shift to consumer choice would be something that you could offset with the operating leverage inherent in the business. Given the partnership announcement and all of the different aspects to it, I guess you guys are saying tonight that that doesn't necessarily still hold, you'll reevaluate over the next couple of quarters when you give 2017 guidance, say whether that's still the case. Or just trying to get a sense of I guess applicability of that statement still.","John Rainey","Yeah. So, yeah, that's not entirely correct, but just talking directionally, we have -- I would describe this as very analogous still to like an investment that one would make, an acquisition for example, where there's perhaps an upfront cost but there's a revenue stream that more than offsets that to where it's very accretive to the business.","With respect to the increase in transaction expense, we'll give more specific guidance as we get towards the end of the year about 2017. But when you look at both the revenue benefit as well as the good demonstrated cost control that you've seen for several quarters now, just look at the over 180 basis points of leverage this quarter, the fact that our operating expenses, if you normalize for the Xoom acquisition, only went up 7% in the quarter, we continue to demonstrate that we have a laser focused on discipline here, while still not starving the business for investment as well. We're making sure that we're continuing to invest organically.","So all that in combination gives us a level of comfort with this, that it's absolutely the right thing to do for the business. But specific to 2017, we'll give you a heads-up on that towards yearend.","Bill Carcache - Nomura","Great. Thank you for taking my questions.","John Rainey","You bet.","Dan Schulman","Thank you.","Dan Schulman","Okay. Thank you everybody for joining us today. We really appreciate your time, and, operator, that will conclude our Q&A session. Thank you.","Operator","And this concludes today's Q&A session. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a great evening."],"16909":["PayPal Holdings, Inc.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Ms. Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Gabrielle Rabinovitch","Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal Holdings earnings conference call for third quarter 2019. Joining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO and John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer and EVP Global Customer Operations. We\u2019re providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being webcast and both the presentation and call are available through the Investor Relations section of our website.","We will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about our company\u2019s performance. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this call.","In addition, management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year 2019, our preliminary outlook for 2020, our medium-term outlook and the impact of our acquisitions. Our actual results may differ materially from these statements. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our results in our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on the Investor Relations section of our website.

We expressly disclaim any obligation to update the information.","With that, let me turn the call over to Dan.","Dan Schulman","Thank you, Gabrielle and thanks everyone for joining us on today\u2019s call. I\u2019m pleased to report that PayPal had a very strong quarter across all of our key metrics. Revenues grew by 19% on an FX-neutral and spot basis to $4.38 billion. Our revenue growth was driven by strong transaction and TPV volumes. For the first time ever, we processed over 1 billion transactions per month in the quarter, up 25% year-over-year to 3.1 billion transactions. TPV growth accelerated 80 basis points from last quarter and was up 27% on an FX-neutral basis to $179 billion.","TPV excluding eBay grew by 31%, up 240 basis points from Q3 2018. EBay TPV declined by 3% and now represents just 8% of our total TPV, down approximately 300 basis points from Q3 last year. As of now, our best estimate is that eBay will be approximately 6% of our total TPV at the end of the operating agreement in July 2020.","Excluding unrealized losses associated discretely with our investments in MercadoLibre and Uber, we delivered a very strong $0.79 of non-GAAP EPS as compared to our guidance on a similar basis of $0.69 to $0.71. Excluding the mark-to-market changes in our strategic investment portfolio, our non-GAAP EPS grew 31% driven by a year-over-year expansion of more than 200 basis points in our non-GAAP operating margin to 23.4%.","I\u2019m very pleased with the leverage of our operating model and the continued expansion of our operating margins. This leverage drove our largest ever quarterly EPS over performance versus our expectations and provides us with increased confidence in our medium-term guidance of 20% EPS growth compounded annually.","I\u2019m also very pleased to report strong growth in both net new actives and engagement. We added 9.8 million net new actives in the quarter, a record number for any previous Q3. We now have 295 million active accounts on our platform, up 16% year-over-year including over 23 million merchants. We anticipate ending the year at approximately 304 million active accounts above our stated target of 300 million.","Engagement continues to consistently increase, growing by 9% to almost 40 transactions per active account. Mobile is a major driver of our growth with One Touch at 172 million consumers and 13.8 million merchants. We are quite focused on growing our value proposition beyond checkout as our consumers look for more reasons to use PayPal as part of their everyday financial life.","I\u2019m quite pleased by the efforts of the PayPal team this quarter and I\u2019m encouraged by the strength of our business fundamentals. We are focused on executing against our strategic priorities. We\u2019ve made significant progress in driving forward our pricing initiatives as well as our product integration with Paymentus and we now anticipate live full stack integration by year-end.","Venmo continues to be an incredibly powerful platform for engaging consumers. We processed more than $27 billion in volume for the quarter, growing 64%. That\u2019s almost $300 million in payments per day and an annual run rate that now exceeds $100 billion. The Venmo team has made tremendous strides in enhancing the use cases of Venmo including a recently signed deal with Synchrony to provide a Venmo credit card. All of this is producing very strong monetization results. We ended Q3 with Venmo just shy of a $400 million annual revenue run rate.","Last year, we acquired Hyperwallet knowing that payouts are a powerful tool for fueling engagement as retailers and marketplaces look for new ways to interact with their customers. One year later, I\u2019m pleased to report that our payouts capabilities are gaining strong traction among leading brands. In the quarter, Travelers Insurance announced customers can now receive insurance claim payments via PayPal.","PepsiCo launched its first ever cash back loyalty program powered by Venmo and PayPal. Lime, the global scooter rental platform selected PayPal to facilitate payouts to its network of freelancers. And Epic Games is now using our capabilities for competitive Fortnite players to expedite their prize payout process. This month we added Venmo as a payout option providing merchants with another powerful way to reach Venmo\u2019s highly engaged user base.","Credit continues to be another strong driver of engagement on our platform. This quarter, we launched new consumer installment plans in the United States and Germany, which allow PayPal customers to pay for their purchases with easy to understand monthly payments. This capability is already leading to incremental sales for our merchants. And we signed a long-term strategic partnership agreement with Citi Australia to develop consumer credit products for PayPal\u2019s customers in Australia.","We continue to gain strong adoption among merchants around the world in daily spend categories. In the quarter, we further expanded our relationship with Walmart, launching PayPal Checkout as the sole payment solution for its online grocery business in Mexico. In Japan, PayPal is one of the official partners for the Japanese government\u2019s initiative to promote cashless payments throughout the country. We made significant strides this quarter with multiple strategic partners to create better experiences for our shared customers. With American Express, we\u2019ve launched a feature where Amex card members can split a purchase in the Amex app via PayPal or Venmo.","We now offer account linking on mobile devices with Capital One and PNC Bank in the United States. We launched instant transfer to bank accounts for Venmo customers through our partnership with JPMorgan Chase and we\u2019ve launched cashback programs with both Chase and Discover. I\u2019m pleased that we are beginning to see increasing traction with the results of our pay with rewards initiative. To date, six million consumers are enabled to use eligible rewards points to pay for a purchase. And those customers who are using their rewards currency currently do so nearly 10% of the time and we are seeing increased engagement and spend as a result.","In September, we announced that the People\u2019s Bank of China has approved our acquisition of a 70% equity interest in GoPay, a license provider of online payment services. We are honored to become the first non-Chinese payments company to be licensed to provide online payment services in China. This is a very significant development for us and it has the potential to dramatically expand our total addressable market and our long-term growth prospects. The license enables us to expand upon our relationships with existing partners like China Union Pay and AliExpress and forge new partnerships with China\u2019s financial institutions and technology platforms, allowing us to provide a comprehensive set of differentiated payment solutions to businesses and consumers in China and globally.","Our initial focus will be on providing cross-border payment solutions to China\u2019s merchants and consumers, linking China\u2019s commerce ecosystem to PayPal\u2019s vast two-sided network. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2019 and is subject to customary closing conditions. We will share much more about our plans early next year, but sufficed to say, we are very excited about our growth opportunities as a result of this landmark agreement.","Q3 was an important quarter for us and our results demonstrate the strength of our expanding two-sided network. More importantly, I\u2019m optimistic about the opportunities in front of us and our ability to shape the financial services landscape. I\u2019ve been leading the PayPal team for the past five years and I\u2019ve never seen it more united, focused and excited about our future. We think the next five years will be as defining and value creating as the past five.","And with that, let me turn the call over to John.","John Rainey","Thanks, Dan. I want to start off by thanking our customers, partners and global team for helping us deliver a great quarter. The strong results we are reporting today demonstrate the continued execution of our strategy to deliver long-term sustainable growth. Our volume growth accelerated to 27%. Our revenue grew 19%. We delivered more than 200 basis points of operating margin expansion on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. And we realized operating leverage across each of our non-transaction related expenses.","Excluding the effect of unrealized losses from our strategic investment portfolio, which I will discuss later, non-GAAP EPS grew 31%. Our Q3 performance shows the consistent strength of our platform and the scalability of our business. Revenue in the third quarter increased 19% on both the spot and currency-neutral basis to $4.38 billion. Hyperwallet and iZettle contributed approximately 1.9 points to revenue growth versus the third quarter of 2018, U.S. revenue grew 19% and international revenue grew 20% on a currency-neutral basis. On a spot basis, transaction revenue grew 18%, accelerating a point from last year in the second quarter of this year. Revenue from other value-added services grew 24%.","In the third quarter, transaction take rate was 2.21% and total take rate was 2.45% compared to Q3 2018. This was a decline of 12 basis points and 13 basis points respectively. Continued strength in P2P contributed to approximately half of the decline for both transaction and total take rate. The performance of eBay's Marketplaces business and the headwinds from the stronger dollar also contributed to the reduction in take rate. $70 million in revenue from hedge gains benefited both transaction take rate and total take rate by approximately 3 basis points. Volume-based expenses increased 23% in the third quarter to $2 billion.","Transaction expense was 95 basis points as a rate of TPV, improving 1 basis point from Q3 2018. Transaction loss was 14 basis points as a rate of TPV, an improvement of 4 basis points from Q3 2018 and flat to last quarter. This level of transaction loss as a rate of TPV maxed the lowest we've ever achieved and we realized this result while accelerating TPV growth. This reduction in transaction loss was driven by continued improvements in our risk management capabilities.","Loan losses were 5 basis points as a rate of TPV, which represents an increase of 2 basis points from Q3 last year. This increase was due primarily to growth in both our merchant and international consumer loan portfolios. Transaction margin dollars grew 16% to $2.3 billion in the third quarter. Transaction margin as a rate was 53.4%, a decline of approximately 150 basis points versus Q3 2018.","Non-transaction related expenses grew 6% versus last year. Normalizing for cost related to our 2018 acquisitions, these expenses grew 1.9% or $0.04 for every dollar increase in revenue. This performance highlights the scalability of our model, our operating discipline and our ability to grow at a low marginal cost. On a non-GAAP basis, operating income in the third quarter grew 30% and exceeded $1 billion for the first time. In addition, our operating margin expanded more than 200 basis points from Q3 2018. We delivered leverage across each of our non-transaction related expenses.","Adjusting for 2018 acquisitions, operating income grew 31% and our operating margin expanded 250 basis points in the quarter. Other income in the quarter declined by $256 million relative to Q3 2018, primarily due to $228 million net unrealized loss on our strategic investment portfolio. On a per share basis, these unrealized losses negatively affected our results by approximately $0.15 after-tax.","When we guided Q3 2019 EPS in July, we included an expected benefit of $0.03 related to a funding round for Toss, a privately held company in which we have an equity investment. A few weeks later this funding round closed and as expected, we recognized a $0.03 per share benefit to GAAP and non-GAAP EPS. In addition, in the quarter, our strategic equity investments in Uber and MercadoLibre resulted in an unrealized loss of approximately $0.18 per share.","Consistent with the plans we discussed in April on our first quarter earnings call, we disclosed the expected effect of these net unrealized losses for the third quarter in our 8-K released on October 8. Since January 2018, certain equity investments are required to be revalued based on observable price movements. This new standard had a relatively minor impact on our results in 2018. This year, however, our strategic investments in MercadoLibre and Uber have created more earnings volatility. Starting in 2020, we will update our non-GAAP methodology to exclude the impact of these gains and losses on our strategic investments as we believe this will provide a better understanding of our operating performance and a more meaningful comparison of our results between periods.","In the third quarter, our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 11.1% versus 16.4% last year. Excluding the impact of unrealized losses from our strategic investment portfolio, our tax rate would have been 13.5%. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate also benefited from a favorable geographic mix of pretax income.","Non-GAAP EPS for the third quarter grew 5% to $0.61. Adjusting for unrealized losses of $0.15 this year, non-GAAP EPS grew 31% in the quarter. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $13.2 billion. In addition, we generated $923 million of free cash flow or approximately $0.21 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue. Normalizing for the proceeds, we received from selling our U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio last year, free cash flow grew 20%.","During the quarter, we returned $350 million to shareholders through share repurchases. In addition in Q3, we also access the public debt markets for the first time, raising $5 billion in gross proceeds. The senior fixed rate notes are trenched in three, five, seven and 10 year terms. The average life of this debt is 6.6 years with a weighted average interest rate of 2.56%.","We use a portion of the proceeds to repay our outstanding borrowings on our 364 day credit facility and plan to use the remainder of the proceeds consistent with our capital allocation priorities.","I\u2019d now like to discuss our guidance for the fourth quarter of 2019 and the full year, as well as our preliminary thoughts for 2020. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $4.89 billion to $4.95 billion or 17% to 18% growth on a currency neutral basis. In the fourth quarter for the first time, we\u2019re lapping the acquisitions of both iZettle and Hyperwallet.","Last year, as we disclosed when we reported Q4 2018 results, these acquisitions contributed approximately 1.5 points of growth. Relative to when we provided guidance in July, the U.S. dollar strengthened. We estimate this headwind to be approximately $30 million in the fourth quarter.","Both our integration with Paymentus and the pricing initiatives that we discussed last quarter are on track and we expect to be substantially complete by the early part of next year. For Q4, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.81 to $0.83, representing 18% to 21% growth. Our guidance includes no expectation of any gains or losses on our strategic investment portfolio.","As a result, for the full year, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $17.7 billion to $17.76 billion or approximately 15% growth on a currency neutral basis. Normalizing for the sale of the U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio, the implied revenue growth rate would be approximately 18.5% for the full year.","We now expect our non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $3.06 to $3.08, representing 26% to 27% growth, excluding the net unrealized gains year-to-date of $0.11 from our strategic investment portfolio. This guidance implies non-GAAP earnings growth of 25% to 26% for the year, which represents a raise in our EPS outlook. In addition, given the strong free cash flow we generated year-to-date, we now expect free cash flow for the full year to be approximately $3.5 billion.","I\u2019d now like to provide an initial framework for how we\u2019re thinking about 2020. As a reminder, our medium-term outlook calls for 17% to 18% revenue growth on a currency neutral basis compounded annually, which includes approximately 1.5 points of revenue growth each year on average from acquisitions.","We\u2019re very pleased with the strength of our business and expect our core trends to continue. Our current expectation is that revenue will grow 17% organically on a currency neutral basis next year, without the effect of any acquisitions. 2020 also has two dynamics, I\u2019d like to discuss. First, our operating agreement with eBay expires in July and we estimate that this transition will impact revenue growth by approximately 1 point next year. Second, we will be lapping the contributions to revenue in 2019 from our acquisitions of Hyperwallet and iZettle, which we expect to be an additional point of headwind.","Together, these factors pressure revenue growth by approximately 2 points in 2020. Even with this, the strength of our core business provides us with the ability to grow revenue in the range contemplated in our medium-term guidance. Our initial 2020 framework also calls for at least 50 basis points of operating margin expansion.","Next year, we\u2019re accelerating our investment in several key initiatives to drive long-term growth and strengthen our platform. At the same time, our ongoing focus on efficiency and natural leverage opportunities will allow us to sustainably deliver operating margin expansion. We expect a portion of this operating leverage to be offset by below the line items, including additional interest expense on a recent debt issuance and lower interest income earned on corporate cash.","As a result, our initial outlook is for approximately 17% to 18% growth on non-GAAP EPS in 2020. It is important to note, we are confident that we will grow non-GAAP EPS by approximately 20% compounded annually over the medium-term, consistent with our previous guidance. The strength, diversification and durability of our business give us confidence in our medium-term outlook.","In conclusion, our third quarter results demonstrate our ability to deliver strong revenue and earnings growth and generate significant free cash flow, while advancing our strategic priorities. Our scale affords us continued leverage opportunities. We\u2019re focused on creating value for our customers and shareholders and strengthening our position as the world\u2019s leading digital payments platform.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to the operator for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Thanks so much. A nice acceleration here, especially in the U.S. It looks like revenue up 19%, so just curious, I know that you have eBay drag, you have some pricing that\u2019s coming up here in the fourth quarter. So maybe can you help us unpack the drivers this quarter for the 19% or overall with the acceleration, just curious how sustainable this is given some of the puts and takes that we\u2019re all expecting here? Thanks.","Dan Schulman","So maybe I\u2019ll start off with that and then turn it over to John. We\u2019re quite pleased with the revenue growth that we had in the third quarter and really what we expect in fourth quarter and going into 2020. So there are a couple of things, and you\u2019re right, these are before pricing initiatives really come to play as well as our full integration with Paymentus.","Our net new actives and our engagement are really beginning to kick in and start to drive incremental growth in our revenues. We had records in net new actives for the quarter, almost 10 million. You\u2019ve got engagement going up again by another 9% to 40 times a year. Just those couple of things are really starting to put more and more acceleration in. And what we\u2019re beginning to see right now is that sales into our back book and a lot of sales into the front book are coming in much more strong than we\u2019ve ever had before. We\u2019re just winning more business right now.","There is a bit of a network effect going on. We have most 300 million active accounts now. Merchants understand the scale we have. They want to be a part of that. We do start to see right now the beginnings of our capabilities of selling as a platform provider and not just a product. So as I mentioned with payouts in my earnings script, we\u2019re seeing that really start to take hold. We\u2019re really starting to see a lot more full stack processing start to take hold.","And so we\u2019re having a lot more incremental product sales both in the back book as well as in the front book including just basic things like presentment of the PayPal button where it\u2019s presented. Given the scale we have now, merchants are putting us into more and more prime positions at presentment.","Partnerships are beginning to kick in right now. We now have nine out of the top 10 U.S. banks working with us. The marketplaces outside of eBay, they have over $100 billion of TPV right now growing at 36% with us. And so we\u2019re really beginning to see a bend in the curve in our core organic PayPal growth and that is really encouraging for us. And then of course, yes, Venmo rapidly growing its monetization efforts right now. We\u2019re really pleased with that. And I think what we\u2019re equally as pleased with is we see a lot of good runway in front of Venmo as well.","John Rainey","I would just add. As Dan suggested, we\u2019re seeing good trends across many aspects of our business. I think it\u2019s important to remember for the first part of this year, at least the first three quarters we\u2019ve had some more difficult comps with things like cross-border with some currency effects and things like that. And so we are sort of lapping some of the beginning impacts of that, not that I think the currency environment seems to be getting much improved from where it was.","But with respect to the couple of things that you alluded to around Paymentus and pricing, we are live with both of those. There is a metered ramp on each of them. So we\u2019ve launched in three countries on the pricing initiative that we\u2019ve referred to previously. And not to overly fixate on that, because we make pricing changes all the time, but I know there were some questions about that given our last call. And Paymentus, we\u2019re excited about the progress that we\u2019re making there. We\u2019re ramping up in the fourth quarter. And as I noted in my remarks, we expect to be complete with each of those by the early part of next year.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Bryan Keane","Hi guys. Solid results here. I wanted to ask about the purpose of the additional debt issuance back in September. Could we see more aggressive stock buybacks or more M&A? I see the GoPay acquisition and I\u2019m also wondering if we\u2019ll see more acquisitions in Asia or elsewhere? Thanks.","John Rainey","Thanks, Brian. Good to speak with you. I\u2019d say the debt issuance was perhaps two-fold. One, it was opportunistic. And two, it gives us more flexibility. Opportunistic in the sense that it\u2019s just it was a good time to tap into the debt markets. I talked about the various tranches of our debt and we literally secure 10-year debt at less than 3%. And so that\u2019s a very attractive rate for us and we\u2019ve got ample opportunities to allocate that capital. And it does give us more flexibility given our strategic initiatives. But there is not \u2013 don\u2019t read into that and that there is a change and how we\u2019re thinking about capital allocation.","So as a reminder, we said when we provided our medium-term guidance that we expect over that time frame of approximately five years that we would spend 40% to 45% of our free cash flow to buy back stock and that we would spend between $1 billion and $3 billion in M&A activity. Now that\u2019s not necessarily each year, but that\u2019s on average over that period of time. This allows us the flexibility to do that.","And importantly, as you think about the cash generating ability of our business, we will generate $3.5 billion of free cash flow this year, but that comes sort of ratably throughout the year. Going and tapping into the debt markets at this point in time gives us the opportunity to access that cash on our timing versus when we\u2019re earning that cash throughout the year. So no change to our plans. We still believe that effective capital allocation supports and contributes to long-term value creation and this was really just an opportunity to tap into the debt markets to get to a more optimal capital structure as we\u2019ve suggested for some time that gives us more flexibility.","Dan Schulman","Maybe, I can just a quick add on to John\u2019s great answer there. I think on the M&A front, we obviously have quite a strong balance sheet right now some $13 billion of cash and as John mentioned, generating about $3.5 billion of free cash flow this year. We have stated that we will be acquisitive. We look at some 200 to 300 companies every quarter. We will over time and on average, as John mentioned, spend somewhere between $1 billion and $3 billion. We anticipate on acquisitions, last year was a light year, but you should expect us to be acquisitive.","Those acquisitions would obviously any revenues that come from would be additive to our 2020 plans. We\u2019re at 17% organic. And I think we would do \u2013 we\u2019d be on top of that. And we\u2019re continuing to look at capabilities that would improve things like consumer engagement. We would look at geographic expansion opportunities. GoPay would be a good example of that scale and scope with different partners; MELI and Uber would be good examples of that. And so no change in our capital allocation, but you should expect us to use our balance sheet in areas that would complement our internal development efforts and allow us to continue to seize growth opportunities, where we see them.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Jason Kupferberg","Hey, good afternoon guys. Good numbers here. I just had a question and a clarification on 2020. The question is on the eBay front. So, only a 1% revenue headwind for next year, certainly less than the investment community had feared. So, I\u2019m just wondering, is this largely a timing issue in terms of how much of the eBay take rate comes down in 2020 specifically as well as the pace at which you expect unbranded volume to roll off? And then just a quick clarification is on the EPS growth for next year at a 17% to 18%. Is that off the new 306 to 308 number in 2019 or is the base 295 to 297 excluding the $0.11 of year-to-date mark-to-market gains?","John Rainey","Hey, Jason. So, on eBay, there\u2019s a couple of dynamics going on there. The \u2013 our expectation right now is that eBay is about fully ramped to the 10% that they\u2019re allowed in each of the two entities that where they\u2019re doing managed payments, which are Germany and the U.S. So, going into the back half of next year, we would expect that those would ramp much more appreciably as they\u2019re already live in those markets.","There is a more or our expectation anyway is that there is a more metered ramp for when they launch in some of these other geographies, which is consistent with kind of what we\u2019ve seen in the first two geographies, where they\u2019ve launched. I think also related to that is our expectation about what share of checkout we retain. And based upon what we\u2019ve seen in both Germany and the U.S., it\u2019s consistent to what we said back in January of 2018 around our expectations there. So, each of those elements influences our expectation around eBay, but obviously, that\u2019s an estimate at this point in time and that can change, and we will certainly let you know if something does.","Dan Schulman","John, just before you get to that part, let me maybe, expand a little bit on eBay. So Jason, I think obviously, there is going to be an important and strategic partner with us for a long time to come, but it\u2019s obviously shrinking in terms of its overall volumes and its impacts on our financials. It\u2019s been three quarters in a row, where they\u2019ve had negative TPV growth. Yes, they\u2019re negative 3%, outside of that. we\u2019re growing at 31% in our TPV. And we think at the end of the OA, they\u2019re going to be down to about 6% of our overall TPV volumes. And if you think about it, like when we initially split from eBay, TPV, their percentage of TPV was around 20%, now it\u2019s dropped down to about 8%. If you look at their revenues, the revenues have dropped in half as a percent overall.","And so I think it\u2019s really worth noting that while all of that\u2019s been happening, our revenues have been growing on average, call it 18% to 20% during that timeframe. Our margins have been going up. And so they\u2019re obviously a much smaller part of PayPal than we expected when we were first thinking about the OA. And therefore the transition at the end of the OA is going to be much less of an impact, much more manageable and we think that 1% of revenue growth impact is probably a pretty reasonable expectation.","I\u2019d say nothing in their intermediated payouts. Right now, it gives me any incremental cause for concern. I mean maybe, even the opposite. They need regulatory approvals in all of the countries that they\u2019re going to roll out into. There is going to be a long tail that that\u2019s going to be hard to get to. China is obviously going to be an interesting discussion item on that. Merchants are increasingly beginning to sell on multiple platforms right now and they\u2019re using PayPal One Touch activation to do that. And so they\u2019re quite tight into PayPal. And we are seeing the PayPal share of checkout on intermediated payments rising significantly.","And so you put all of those into place along with the growth that we\u2019re seeing in other marketplaces and our ability to start to work with some marketplaces that we weren\u2019t able to our work with before. And we think this is going to be a very manageable transition and we hope to be close partners with eBay as we go through that.","John Rainey","Jason and to address your second question, which I probably should have anticipated given the noise that we\u2019ve had in some of these mark-to-market adjustments. But the earnings growth that we talked about of 17% to 18% in 2020 is on a similar base in 2019. So, it excludes the mark-to-market adjustments in 2019.","Dan Schulman","Does that answer your question? Presumed so. Yes.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Darrin Peller","Hey, thanks guys. Your margin came in materially above our estimate, it looks like operating leverage on sales and marketing and G&A, and I guess better losses I know, I think John, you mentioned, we\u2019re a lot more pronounced. What are your thoughts on what\u2019s allowing that kind of margin uptick now versus before? And just when considering I guess the pricing changes, the partial offset of eBay mid-year integrations, can you just touch on sustainability and maybe, how the 50 bps expected in 2020 would have looked if not for eBay? Thanks guys.","John Rainey","Sure, Darrin. So, a couple of things; one, as we look at the outperformance in the quarter, we provide a range of estimates around revenue and earnings, and we came in at the higher end of that range that we expected. So, the revenue outperformance is one of the bigger drivers within the quarter for how we perform. But as you noted, we also performed very well on the expense side.","I think it\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019ll our caution you about assuming that that level of sales and marketing is a run rate basis. There are a number of initiatives going on there as we go to market in a different way that have affected that quarter. And so that\u2019s just kind of a side point. But the general point around operating margin leverage and what we can do there, this is a very sustainable initiative for us. And you\u2019ll remember, Darrin, a couple of years ago when we first started this, the work in this area, there were some question about was this a one-time cost take out or was this really sustainable.","I hope that we\u2019re beginning to allay the concerns around people about the sustainability of that. This is perhaps the best performance that we\u2019ve ever seen in any particular quarter, growing our organic cost, non-transaction related costs at 1.9%. And this is really just \u2013 well, if you remember, I described it at the time as we were re-plumbing our business or rewiring our business to be able to grow at a very low marginal cost. And it\u2019s literally in every aspect of the business, but I\u2019ll give you one example that maybe will really give you a flavor of how these are coming about.","So we obviously have a significant number of calls that come in each month in our call center, five million on average per month. And we aspire to be able to address each of those issues that our customers have and to be on the phone with or not have them have to wait on the phone, but we\u2019re not perfect. And if you go back to last December, we had 33,000 calls that a customer had to wait over 45 minutes. I looked right before I came in here today and in the month of October we have 526 calls. Now that\u2019s a dramatic improvement, but what\u2019s noteworthy about that is we achieved that without adding a single human being to address that problem. Those were all issues around schedule efficiency, better routing when someone goes into the IVR, things like that. It just enables us to provide a better customer experience, but at the same time lower our cost.","And in the scheme of five million calls a month, 33,000 is maybe not a lot, but each of those customers has an experience and that impacts whether they use us again, whether they churn in the future. So it\u2019s things like that that drive dramatic improvements in our business both on the cost line, but also what it can do for the customer experience as well.","Dan Schulman","I had a couple of things to add, Darrin that I think are really important. First of all, things that you don\u2019t see that are really important to us are things like what are we doing with developer tool sets, our development platform, which makes our engineers so much more productive. Before we would have to hire a lot of people that just couldn\u2019t get their code through and now we have tool sets and an environment that is much more efficient, maybe two times the efficiency that we had before. Things like losses as we grow bigger and our transaction volume becomes larger, our ability to do machine learning on that combined with the acquisition we did of Simility, those losses now are at a lower level that we think continues as well and probably may even improve as we get larger.","And finally, I would just say Venmo. Venmo used to have more and more money that we would have to put into Venmo each year as a group and it is now, instead of a drain on our margin structure, help on our margin structure as we go forward and I would expect that to continue to happen. And so all-in, I think we feel pretty good about the leverage of the model and it\u2019s why we have such strong confidence around that 20% compounding annually EPS number.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore. Your line is now open.","David Togut","Thanks so much. Could you give us sort of a deeper dive or status update on some of the delayed new pricing initiatives and new product integrations with partners that you called out on the second quarter earnings call. And to the extent any of those impacts are embedded in the 2020 guidance. It would be helpful to have insight? Thanks so much.","John Rainey","Sure, David. This is John. I\u2019ll address that. So when we announced the delay in those initiatives initially on the last call, I think it\u2019s fair to say that we probably erred on the side of conservatism as we thought about the back half of the year and that they are both, specifically the Paymentus initiative as well as the price initiatives, they are both performing moderately better than what we expected at that point in time in terms of the pace of the integration of each of those. And we do expect to have a benefit as we have a full \u2013 as those are rolled in at the beginning of next year and we get \u2013 for the vast majority of the year get the full run rate benefit of each of those.","With respect to pricing, that\u2019s been rolled out in three countries in Q4 and we\u2019ll expand that further into next year. And as a reminder, this is with respect to refund pricing and in line with industry practice, we don\u2019t charge fees to process refunds, but also in line with industry practice we are retaining the fixed and the variable piece of that and certain merchants are excluded if you have negotiated pricing and so forth, but those are performing as expected. But as we look at 2020, we\u2019ll go live with additional merchants and we will have additional price changes, always looking to price to the value that we create for our customer base as we offer expanded capabilities and experiences for them we want to be able to price to that as well.","Dan Schulman","I would just say, David that pricing is an ongoing process for us. We had certain things baked into our plans and we were late on those. We had certain expectations on integration especially into Paymentus and we were late on those. It\u2019s one of the reasons why I\u2019m really happy with the performance of so many people on the PayPal team. They were really laser-focused on getting those implemented in the right way. And these are complicated integrations and we want to make sure that we\u2019re fully transparent in the way we roll these things out. And so I\u2019m pretty pleased with the way the team stepped up and addressed all of that.","As John mentioned, I think on the Paymentus side, we\u2019ll have full stack integration live by the end of the year. And then we start to roll in, Paymentus has almost 1,500 billers, we want to roll in all of those billers into a bill pay app right on the PayPal app and that will take into the first and second quarter before we have that completed, but the full stack integration on to our Braintree platform will happen by the end of the year.","Pricing, just to reiterate what John said, pricing is an ongoing process for us. We\u2019re going to have pricing initiatives this year, next year, the year after and then the year after that. I mean we continually assess market dynamics. We look at the evolving practices of our competitors. We take a hard look at the value we provide. And then we try to price appropriately based on all those factors. And yes, we price sometimes up, sometimes we take prices down, it depends on product, it depends on corridors, it depends on regions in the world, but we\u2019re very considered about it. We do have some degree of latitude in all of those things. And right now, I think John and I are both pretty pleased where we are.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.","Lisa Ellis","Hey, good afternoon guys. Looks like other value-added services beat pretty handily in the quarter. I'm looking at it, it looks like loan growth was up about 65% year-on-year and also sequentially. So now that we're kind of clear of the Synchrony transition, can you just give \u2013 can you give us an update on how you're thinking about the role of credit in your strategy going forward and specifically, like how much of this OVAS growth is going on balance sheet versus off-balance sheet and can OVAS continue to grow like this well, well above TPV and revenue growth going forward? Thank you.","John Rainey","Sure, Lisa. It's good to speak with you. So as we think about our credit strategy, obviously you're very familiar with what we did with the U.S. consumer loan portfolio when we sold that $6 billion portfolio and now we have a partnership with Synchrony going forward. That's a strategy that we like because it's very much asset light.","When we look at the opportunities for credit in our business both on the merchant side as well as international consumer, they are significant growth opportunities. And we think that particularly like when we look at the merchant lending, that's where our value proposition shines when we can provide working capital loans, understanding the seasonality and the cyclicality of a merchant's business in a way that others can't with access to some of their payment flows. And so we want to continue to grow that. But what we don't want and again we've demonstrated this with our past experience, we don't want credit to become too capital intensive to where it takes away from other opportunities that we have.","And so I do think that OVAS revenue and specifically credit revenue can continue to grow at a rate higher than overall TPV for PayPal. So I think that's definitely true. But if you look at our total credit receivables today, there are about $3.5 billion inclusive of both merchant and international consumer, far or less roughly half of what the U.S. consumer credit receivables were for us when we sold those and we were a much smaller company then as well.","And so we will get to a point seemingly given the opportunity that's in front of us on credit where we will likely go asset light with some of one or both of those portfolios as well. I think that's further down the road, but we want to be very mindful around how we allocate capital in this business to both drive value for our shareholders, but also provide good offerings like credit for our customers.","Operator","Thank you. And we have time for one last question from the line of...","Dan Schulman","We're going to do actually two more questions I think.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Heath Terry","Great. Thanks. Dan, I realized it hasn't closed yet, but can you give us a sense, maybe a little bit of a history of how it came about that PayPal was chosen to do the GoPay deal, I would imagine there was a lot of competition, particularly to be the first of its kind? And then what the road map could look like for the rollout of those services and the integration that you want to see there? And then when could we see a material cross-border offering in China and how would that compare to what you're currently able to offer through Alipay relationship?","Dan Schulman","Yes. Those are all good questions, Heath. And I think actually, Heath, given the extent of that question, we'll probably end after this. So first of all, obviously it's incredibly meaningful event to be the first non-Chinese company obtain a payments license to process domestic online payments in China. It's a tangible example of China opening its financial market.","We have been working this diligently for years. When I say diligent, I mean literally almost every single day we've had calls and have been working this. And we worked quite closely with the PBOC, with other authorities inside of China. We worked with the administration here to enable all this to happen. And then I think what we've demonstrated across the globe and I think was appreciated by various entities within China is our ability to work closely with regulators. We've invested quite heavily in compliance and risk management and we're a strong collaborator with the financial ecosystem. We're much more partners with the financial ecosystem than go around the financial ecosystem and be a disruptor. We're innovative, but we're partners with the existing structure.","And so I think all of that combined in a very good working relationship and many years of that enabled this event to happen. It's obviously pretty significant for us. It obviously increases our total addressable market quite substantially. China is the world's largest e-commerce market. I think there is something like 500 million online shoppers and they're going to drive something like $2 trillion of online sales this year, which is more than 50% of global online retail. And China is obviously an advanced and sophisticated digital marketplace, but we believe that we can offer a quite differentiated value proposition to both Chinese merchants and consumers by working closely with Chinese financial institutions, various tech platforms inside of China to connect sort of their vast commerce ecosystem with sort of our vast network of consumers and merchants outside of China.","And so this is actually a substantial \u2013 substantially more than what we can do right now. So for instance, think of before we cannot work with companies and allow Chinese consumers to purchase from PayPal merchants outside of China and now we can start to facilitate that, working again in partnership with Chinese tech platforms and\/or Chinese financial institutions.","We can take Chinese merchants who may want \u2013 may be want to sell on other platforms and do payouts back into China through cross-border, we'll be able to enable that through our platform. Multinationals that are doing business in China can use our platform to enable their transactions and for us to process those digital payments coming across there.","So, a lot of people are focusing just on the domestic consumer part of China, there's obviously opportunities there working in connection with partners inside of China, but there is a tremendous amount that we leverage, kind of the strength of our network and the strength of the vast commerce ecosystem inside China, which is significantly digital and that we think affords us some pretty significant opportunities over at least the medium to long-term. So we're quite excited about the opportunity. We'll give a lot more details as we go into next year as the transaction closes and we'll make sure that we continue to update everybody on this.","So, again, Heath, thank you for that question. Operator that will be the last question. I want to thank everybody for joining us today. We appreciate your time and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to hand the floor over to Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Gabrielle Scheibe Rabinovitch","Thank you, Karen. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal Holdings\u2019 earnings conference call for the fourth quarter and full year 2016. Joining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO; John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer; and Bill Ready, our Chief Operating Officer.","We\u2019re providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being broadcast on the Internet. And both the presentation and call are available through the Investor Relations section of our website.","In discussing certain historical year-over-year comparisons, we have chosen to present non-GAAP pro forma metrics because we believe that these metrics provide investors a consistent basis for reviewing the company\u2019s performance across different periods. We will also discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about our company\u2019s performance, including the non-GAAP pro forma metrics mentioned above.","You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP metrics to the most directly comparable GAAP metrics in the presentation accompanying this conference call.

We disclaim any obligation to update the information.","With that, let me turn the call over to Dan.","Dan Schulman","Thanks, Gabrielle. I\u2019m pleased to report that PayPal ended 2016 with another solid quarter of financial results. I\u2019m proud of all the accomplishments that the PayPal team delivered, yet in so many ways we were just scratching the surface of the market opportunities in front of us. Payments are rapidly digitizing. Mobile is re-defining the phase of retail. And with the world wide adoption of smart phone consumers have all the power of a bank branch in the palm of their hands, which will no doubt transform the way they manage and move money.","We believe all of these secular trends play into our strengths and leave us well positioned to drive our future growth. In the phase of a noisy competitive market, we extended our industry leaderships by growing our active account base by 18 million with greater engagements than ever before. We introduced a host of new innovations across our merchant and consumer value propositions. We took the clear lead in online conversion through one touch. ","We now offer a full suite of products and services to our merchants on an integrated platform that supports 100% share of processing and textual commerce API and toolsets, rewards integration and credit. And we bring to our merchants an increasingly active and growing days of consumers who are ready to transact across online, in-app, and in-store environments. In the past year, we significantly increased our market opportunity for the series of transformative strategic partnerships with the networks, financial institutions, tax companies, and mobile carriers.","We accomplish this by putting our customers first in everything we do. We call this being a customer champion and this philosophy guides our every action. At the end of a land mark year for PayPal, we feel well positioned to deliver sustainable and profitable growth in 2017 and beyond. ","Let me start with a quick recap of our results and John will provide more details in his remarks. As I mentioned, we delivered a solid fourth quarter. We reported $0.42 of non-GAAP EPS at the top end of our non-GAAP guidance of $0.42. We delivered $2.981 billion in revenues, an increase of 19% on an FX neutral basis. This is at the high-end of our guidance of 16% to 19% growth, and we generated $771 million in free cash flow. ","For the full year we delivered $1.50 of non-GAAP EPS, which came in at the top of our initial full-year guidance of $1.45 to $1.50. Our revenues grew 21% on a pro forma FX neutral basis above our initial 2016 guidance of 19%. And despite the increased size of our revenue base, we grew faster in 2016 than in 2015. We ended the year at $10.84 billion of revenue and we generated $2.5 billion in free cash flow, well above the initial guidance we provided.","Perhaps more importantly, the underlining drivers of our revenue growth saw continued strong performance throughout 2016. We ended the year with $197 million active customer accounts, adding 5.4 million new accounts in Q4, our highest organic total in two years. Customer engagement in the fourth quarter increased to 31 transactions for active accounts up from 27 a year ago, and 30 last quarter. ","Our growth in Q4 came from across our global platform and we benefited from a notable shift in consumer behavior. Holiday shoppers increasingly bought gifts online and with their mobile devices through convenient omni-channel shopping experiences. For PayPal, this helps drive a 25% increase in payment volume, resulting in $99.3 billion of payment volume in the quarter.","According to Internet retailer, Black Friday 2016 was the largest mobile shopping day in history. Between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday PayPal processed more than 2 billion in mobile payments. And mobile accounted for a third of our overall payment volume during the quarter. Mobile is becoming an increasingly important competitive differentiator for PayPal. More than half of our active account base transacted on the PayPal platform using their mobile device over the last 12 months. ","The scale and reach of our platform clearly separates PayPal as one of the world's leading FinTech companies. In 2016, we processed 6 billion payments, an increase of 24%. This represented a total payment volume of 354 billion flowing through the PayPal platform of which more than 100 billion was mobile payment volume, an increase of 55%. We saw strong growth in peer-to-peer payments, with P2P payment volume growing 57%, more than $64 billion for the year.","Braintree ended the quarter with 428 million cards on file, and PayPal has well over a billion financial instruments on file. In Venmo, was one of Time magazine's best apps of the year and one of Fortunes 10 breakthrough brands. In Q4, Venmo processed 5.6 billion volume, an increase of 126%. In December, for the first, Venmo passed the 2 billion mark in monthly payment volume further demonstrating its rapid growth. ","As you may recall, Venmo processed 1 billion in monthly TPV for the first time just last January. For the full year, Venmo processed $17.6 billion, up 135%. It\u2019s been several years since we expanded our mission to be more than a button on the website. We have evolved to become the platform and payments partner of choice for merchants around the world, as they move towards a multichannel retail experience driven by the mobile phone. ","For example, with Braintree's commerce infrastructure tools, we are creating simpler ways for merchant install for contextual commerce experiences that transform the way consumers shop and pay. For entries forward API, which merchants securely share, payment data with other sites and apps, allowing customers to purchase from multiple merchants in a single convenient and secure experience. This capability was initially deployed to support interest viable pins and is now being used by merchants across the world, including global, travel site, sky scanner and by Yelp for their new product, Yelp cash back.","One Touch has redefined online checkout. Simply put it produces by its and away the best conversion rate in the payments industry by making it faster and simpler for customers to pay with the single tax. Its adoption has well exceeded our projections. We ended the year with over 5 million merchants offering One Touch to more than 40 million consumers. PayPal has the unique distinction in the corresponding benefit of having a deep and trusted relationship with almost 200 million merchants and consumer accounts through our two sided network. ","This means we can deliver new payment experiences like One Touch for the speed and impact that there is truly differentiated. eBay and PayPal have always enjoyed a close partnership. eBay CEO Devin Wenig and I are committed to further strengthening what is already a strong relationship. We are working closely to creating better payment experiences for their buyers and sellers. ","For example, our teams collaborated this past year on new customized checkout experiences that helps to reduce card abandonment, increase loyalty, and help buyers seamlessly transact on eBay's platform. As we look to 2017, we see even greater opportunities to work together. In the quarter, we were also proud to welcome several great brands to our platform. These include auto. DE, the second-largest retailer in Europe, Crate and Barrel, which now offers PayPal as a payment option on its web and mobile sites, and on the CB2 and landed not cite for their global customers.","Squarespace, an all in one website publishing e-commerce platform. Now it\u2019s more than 1 million paid subscribers. Seamlessly integrate PayPal into their online stores. To give you an idea of the demand for PayPal within the first 24 hours of launching, we saw hundreds of Squarespace merchants integrate into PayPal and that demand continues. Finally, consumers can now create a campaign on go funding on behalf of their favorite charity.","By doing so they take advantage of the PayPal giving funds facility to receive and process donations and avoid the complexity of having to handle the funds themselves. Last year, highlighted our commitment to putting our customer\u2019s front and centre. That led to our decision to offer greater customer choice in our payments experiences. This in turn has a recast to competitive landscape for PayPal and enables landmark partnerships and alliances that continue to expand and extend our opportunity for growth. ","These partnerships are focused on giving consumers the freedom and flexibility to use PayPal anywhere they want, in stores, in apps, online and a new context for the consistent, convenient, and secure experience, following the announcements of our strategic partnership with Visa on our Q2 earnings call and MasterCard in Q3. In the fourth quarter, we announced our first partnership agreement with financial institutions. These include agreements with Citi, the largest global credit card issuer and Fidelity National Information Services known as FIS, which represents thousands of financial institutions. This is just the beginning. ","As our conversation with almost all leading financial service players are warm and welcoming. Earlier this month, we announced the strategic agreement with Discover Financial Services. This partnership allows the PayPal wallet to be closely linked and Discover cardholders acquires and merchants. ","It will allow PayPal credit customers who link their discover cards to purchase online, in-app and in-store at contact listed enable merchants in the US. And in a first for us, PayPal customers will be able to use their discover cash back bonus to pay for purchases at the millions of online and mobile merchants that accept PayPal. We expect that the reward points will become an easy convenient and alternative source for customers of PayPal and our financial institution partners, the pay for online and mobile shopping due to PayPal platform. ","As mobile and digital payments continue to provide new opportunities for bringing cost consumers and companies close together, we're partnering with other market leaders across a variety of industries. In the fourth quarter, we entered into an extended partnership with cellular carriers, software providers and leading consumer brands. One prominent example of this is the global partnership agreement we announced with Intuit. ","Building on successful regional agreements, we are not deploying our express checkout and more than 1.5 million quick book small businesses and self-employed customers worldwide. The PayPal and Intuit partnerships due to business owners simpler and faster ways to accept invoice payments and significantly accelerate the fees with which they can collect funds. ","Based on our role out in Australia, we found that merchants who offered PayPal payments in their quick book invoices will pay two times faster than it to get paid without PayPal. This meaningful improvement in cash flow is crucial for the SMB market. We are proud to bring this benefit to Intuits customers. Our partnerships with Facebook, Google, American Mobile, Vodafone, AliExpress, and other financial institutions and major retailers continue to grow as our platform and capabilities expand.","2016 was a transformative year for PayPal. Our separation from eBay afforded us an opportunity to sign a unique, meaningful, and expansive mission for our company. I believe our expanded focus and value proposition allowed us to widen the distance from our competitors. We upgraded our platform invested significantly in our global compliance capabilities, improved our developer tool sets, and drove our scale and engagement through a unique and enhanced value proposition.","We are inspired and focused on the opportunities in front of us and we look forward to providing ever more value to our customers and our shareholders. Before I conclude my remarks I\u2019d like to just take this opportunity to publicly welcome the newest member of PayPal\u2019s Board Belinda Johnson. Belinda has filled an impressive track record at Airbnb. She has been a key architect in their growth and has held to chart new business approaches and innovative customer experiences. She\u2019s already proving to be a great addition to our board and we look forward to her valuable contributions. ","And with that, let me hand it over to John.","John Rainey","Thanks Dan. I also wanted to that thank all of PayPal's customers and employees worldwide for making 2016 great year. Since our founding in 1998, this is the first full year that PayPal has been an independent public company and we achieved many significant milestones that set us up for success for many years to come. We are strategically positioned to deliver sustainable and profitable growth. Our comprehensive partnership strategy and focus on mobile first product innovation, which our customers at the center of everything we do while giving us access to multiple developing channels across the digital payments ecosystem. ","Before I go into details on the quarter, I\u2019d like to provide a few highlights for the full year. Revenue for the year was $10.84 billion growing 21% on a pro forma currency neutral basis. Non-GAAP EPS grew 17% on a pro forma basis for $1.50. Free cash flow grew 36% to $2.5 billion and in the year we returned $1 billion to shareholders. For the fourth quarter, total payment volume was $99 billion, up 25% on a currency neutral basis. Excluding the year over year impact of Xoom currency neutral TPV growth would have been similar to the third quarter. ","In Q4, U.S. payment volume grew 23% and international volume grew 27%. Our merchant services volume grew 30% on a currency neutral basis to $84 billion. Merchant services now represent approximately 84% of our total volume with our eBay volume, representing approximately 16%. In the fourth quarter, we added more than 5 million active accounts, ending the year with 197 million active accounts and representing growth of 10% from Q4 last year. ","Active account growth was driven by our PayPal core business as well as in Venmo. The number of payment transactions per active accounts increased to 31, up 13%. Each quarter since separation we have seen double-digit growth in both active accounts and engagement. Growth in these two metrics resulted in a 23% year-over-year increase and payment transactions to $1.8 billion.","In the fourth quarter, we generated revenue of approximately $3 billion, representing growth of 19% on a currency neutral basis and 17% on a spot basis. Transaction revenue increased 18% on a currency neutral basis in the quarter, driven by our core PayPal and Braintree businesses, both of which continued to perform very well. ","Included in transaction revenue were hedge gains of $50 million in the quarter. In addition, revenue from other value-added services grew 26% on a currency neutral basis driven predominantly by credit. For Q4, our total take rate was 3% and our transaction take rate was 2.63%. As we moved through 2016, we saw diminishing pressure on transaction take rate. ","The decline in transaction take rate has improved for each of the last three quarters and in Q4 the rate of decline on a year-over-year basis was the lowest since separation. The primary factor contributing to the year-over-year decline in take rate is the performance of our P2P business, a strong growth from Venmo and core P2P continue to impact the rate. While these contribute to the year-over-year change in take rate, they also strengthened our value proposition and support higher levels of engagement across our consumer base. ","Our fourth quarter results demonstrate that we can invest in our long-term growth opportunities, while managing the take rate decline. Transaction margin in the fourth quarter was 57.7%. Our volume based expenses were up 27% in the quarter. Transaction expense was $954 million, up 27%, driven by fund index. To date, the impact of our consumer choice initiatives has been well within the range of outcomes we previously contemplated. ","Transaction loss in the quarter was $184 million or 6% of revenue. Loan losses in the quarter were $123 million. The consumer net charge-off rate was 7% in Q4 and 6.4% for the full year. The overall performance of our credit products in Q4 was consistent with our expectations entering the quarter. Across consumer and merchant credit, we ended the year with a gross receivables balance of $5.7 billion and a total reserve of $336 million. This year we increased the reserve to reflect the growth in our home portfolio, as well as our loss experience in later stage delinquency buckets.","Other operating expenses increased 7%, the lowest rate of growth since separation driven by strong expense discipline. Excluding Xoom, other operating expenses only increased 6%. We completely offset the decline in transaction margin would leverage from other operating expenses. Looking forward, we see discipline cost performance across every area of our business. We are in the early stages of a journey that we expect will transform our business into one that scales more efficiently, and we are encouraged that we are already seeing results.","In the fourth quarter, non-GAAP operating margin was 20.8%, consistent with last year. Non-GAAP operating income grew 16% year-over-year to $619 million, resulting in non-GAAP EPS of $0.42 in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $152 million or 5% of revenue. In addition, we generated $771 million of free cash flow in the quarter, up 37% year-over-year and representing $0.26 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue.","For the full year, we returned $1 billion to shareholders and we ended the year with cash, cash equivalents, and investments of $6.5 billion, including approximately $1.5 billion in the U.S. Now I\u2019d like to discuss our guidance for 2017, as well as provide context for our priorities and expectations for the year ahead. For the full year 2017, we expect revenue between $12.45 billion and $12.65 billion, representing currency neutral growth of 17% to 19%.","We are pleased to be raising this outlook relative to the guidance we provided in October because of the momentum we are seeing in across our business and initiatives. At the same time, since we last spoke with you, we are seeing the currency markets move against us with a further strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Since November, we are seeing pressure from several of the currencies to which we have exposure. Notably, the euro and the Australian dollar have weakened by 5% and 7% respectively. This is on top of the all already sharp decline we saw on the pound last year.","We are a global company operating in more than 200 markets with close to 50% of our revenue in a greater mix of our earnings coming from outside the U.S. Our hedging program is designed to reduce earnings volatility and we had to select basket of currencies to which we have the greatest earnings exposure. Given the timing at how we build our hedge positions and recent moments across a broad range of currencies that affect our business, we expect FX headwinds throughout the year.","We anticipate a greater impact in the first half and will continue to update you on a currency exposure as we move through the year. At current exchange rates for the full year, we expect currency translation to impact revenue by approximately 200 basis points, resulting in sport growth of 15% to 17%. We expect our non-GAAP operating margin in 2017 to be flat to slightly up or approximately 20%.","Given that many of our initiatives ramped throughout the year, we expect to deliver greater operating income growth in the second half relative to the first. We anticipate our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be between 18% and 19% and we expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $1.69 and $1.74. Our business continues to generate significant free cash flow. For 2017, we anticipate free cash flow to exceed $2.7 billion, including CapEx of approximately 5% of revenue. For the first quarter, we expect revenue to be between $2.9 billion and $2.95 billion and we expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.40 and $.42. ","Now I would like to spend a moment talking about capital allocation. We take a disciplined approach to how we deploy cash flow and continue to pursue a capital allocation strategy balancing organic investment, M&A, and returning capital to shareholders. As we discussed last quarter, we were assessing a more asset life strategy for our credit business. While it is too early to provide additional detail, moving more of our credit receivables of balance sheet and potentially further partnering on the origination side and free up cash and give us additional flexibility.","In addition, our guidance includes our initial $500 million in share repurchases for 2017 and we will continue to be opportunistic as it relates to our buyback program. We will keep a close eye on the evolving landscape for taxes and repatriation and evaluate how that may alter or enhance our capital allocation going forward. We are committed to allocating capital in a manner to maximize returns and increase shareholder value.","In closing, 2016 was a great first year for PayPal as a separate public company. As we move through 2017, we're focused on delivering increased shareholder value with our growth strategies.","With that, let me turn it back over to the operator for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan.","Tien-tsin Huang","Great thank you, good afternoon. Just, maybe can you be a little bit more specific to what\u2019s driving the upside to of fiscal 2017 guidance versus the outlook you provided last quarter and is there any material contribution from customer choice for example in your guidance, thanks.","Dan Schulman","You're talking about the increase in our revenue guidance?","Tien-tsin Huang","Correct. Versus what you gave last quarter for fiscal 2017.","Dan Schulman","So, we are taking off our revenue guidance on an FX neutral basis and the reason we are doing that is there is a tremendous amount of secular tailwinds that we are seeing right now. As I mentioned in my remarks, seeing money digitizing is a big move to mobile, it is a big move to really online being sort of online payments and then pick up in stores or commerce is really just becoming commerce. I mean a great example of that is this was the best retail holiday season in five years, but you saw - in-store sales actually drop and online move up to almost 17%, 18% or so. And so as we look at these secular tailwinds behind us, we look at the performance of things like One Touch and its clear advantage that we have now in mobile and the scale we have the increased engagement we are seeing. New market opportunities frankly internationally that we are beginning to see and have a platform now that we can extend to many more markets of Venmo. ","We see the beginning of monetization as we come into this year. And we are seeing the back of the year, the beginnings of some in-store volumes based on tokenization and our partnerships with both the network and financial institutions and then we've got a tremendous number of new partnerships, whether it be with Facebook, or Intuit or FI\u2019s really around the world right now that is growing exponentially since we've announced our network agreement. So there are a host of reasons right now that our confidence has improved in terms of our top line growth rate and by the way that\u2019s also lacking 200 million of Xoom. So think about that, as well as you think about kind of the revenue guidance we gave. So, we think they are good prospects ahead of us. We are very focused on those opportunities and we are comfortable with that guidance. John.","Tien-tsin Huang","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Thanks, good afternoon. So, a question on transaction and loss expenses growth, can you desegregate that into transaction growth in loan loss, I might have missed that. In view of the other expense leverage you are getting, can you provide details on what sort of actions that are leading to this and the sustainability of those actions?","John Rainey","Yes, Ashwin you cut out a little bit on the first part of your question. I will answer what I think you asked related to the transaction and loan losses, but I think I want to take the second part first because that\u2019s the big story, and I think sub context probably worth repeating that we completely offset the transaction margin decline with the operating leverage that we have in business. And it\u2019s not just one area of the business it\u2019s really across the board. It\u2019s probably hard to pass through our P&L and identify that because there is noise related to the year-over-year comparisons from separation, but this really covers every aspect of what we do, and what I would encourage you to think about all this is it\u2019s not a one-time cost take-out opportunity. We are rewiring the way that we work, that we do business in a manner so that we can grow and scale at the rate that we've identified, but do it in a very efficient way. ","So, whether it\u2019s where our real estate footprint is or where we - how we buy things, how we market to customers even getting down to the very product development aspects of our business to do it in a way where we can roll our products in a much grander fashion rather than doing it in a sort of small products rollouts one country at a time. It\u2019s changing the way that we operate. And this is not easy work to be clear. This is requiring us to be to really step back and reexamine ourselves, but I think you probably quickly see that cost performance is expected to continue when you look at our guidance in 2017 that enables us to keep our operating margin flat to growing. ","With respect to the transaction expense and transactional loan losses growing, we did see an uptick in transaction expense on a unit basis by 4 basis points or 5 basis points during the quarter and that\u2019s really related to the mix of our business, it\u2019s a continuation of what you've seen in other quarters as some parts of our business are going faster than others that may carry higher transaction expense.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane","Good afternoon just wanted to ask on the move to announce a light strategy, how could you guys potentially limit the EPS dilution hit from a move like that and then secondly John just on the hedge gains just curious if there is a number we can get for the quarter and what\u2019s in the expectation for hedge gains in fiscal year 2017? Thanks so much.","Dan Schulman","Bryan it\u2019s Dan. I\u2019ll take the first part of that and then I\u2019ll wisely let John take the next part of it. So, let me just back up a little bit, as you know and everyone on the call knows credit is and will continue to be an important flywheel for us. Credit gives flexible payment option to both our margins and to consumers. It reduces card abandonment, it increases basket size for our merchants and consumers. When somebody uses credit they do two times the spend on our PayPal network than somebody who doesn't. When we do PayPal working capital on average those that we lend to, they see their sales go up 20% plus, and so it\u2019s a tremendous flywheel for us. ","It is a small part of a business and it\u2019s likely to remain so as well. We don't need to chase growth here, we can be very responsible and who we lend to and how much we lend to them. And we have great amounts of data and really I think world class modeling around this. That said that is no reason really to use our balance sheet or the receivables and there are, as we've mentioned before, a lot of benefits of asset right. Obviously, we tie up a lot of our free cash flow in the receivables with free cash flow, for other capital allocation that we might do, we have reduced exposure, we still have a differentiated proposition that we would use our data and our modeling with our partner to bring back a differentiated proposition into our phase and there are very attractive economics to share. ","And as we've seen right now, from people who are very interested in partnering with us, our portfolio is very effective. The size of our basement doesn't have credit and the ability to expand that is very attractive and the risk involving capabilities we have also very attractive, and so there are a lot of economics here to share and we believe that we can significantly reduce our risk exposure, but maintain strong economics for our business. ","That is a working hypothesis as we are going through this. We are in the early process of looking through this right now because it is a very competitive process out there as people look to potentially partner with us, you know we look to make a decision as we digest and sort through all the different proposals that we\u2019re seeing, that said very much likely to be a - if we go and how we do this exactly with the back half of 2017 event, but clearly there is a lot of demand, there is a lot of benefits for us moving towards asset light and we think as I mentioned you reduce risk and maintain strong economics for the business.","John Rainey","And Brian with respect to hedges, I said in my prepared remarks that we expect about 200 basis points of headwind in 2017 from foreign currency that\u2019s actually net of the hedge position that we have. So, to fill in more detail on that in the quarter, in the fourth quarter we had a $50 million hedge gain. And you will see in our K that\u2019s released here, in the next couple of weeks they had about 120 million of hedge gains for the year. That makes our current position today that\u2019s about and where markets are today. That\u2019s about what we are expecting for 2017. ","I think maybe if there has been a moment to talk about our exposure because as you know more of our customers are international than here in the U.S. and a significant portion of our business is outside of the US. Just to use round numbers, as we said before, half of the revenue is outside of the U.S. and on a $12-ish billion base that $6 billion. Of that $6 billion about three quarters of it is denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar or that aren\u2019t tied to the U.S. dollar. And so that gives us about $4 billion of the basket that we\u2019re exposed to. ","So you can do quick math and recognize that a 1% change in the U.S. dollar relative to the basket of currencies on our revenue basis for us is about $40 billion annually. So, we're pretty sensitive to those moments, which is why we hedge the way that we do. We do hedge though to mitigate earnings volatility, not necessarily revenue. So, if you work your way down from that 40 million for a 1% change and you take the transaction margin on that and then you overlay the operating expenses that we have that are denominated in other currencies, as well as they are hedged, then the impact to operating income is much less than that. And as you will see when we release our K, we were able to mute a lot of the impact of the currency movements in 2016 with that hedge position.","Bryan Keane","Okay very helpful, thanks for the details.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis from Bernstein.","Lisa Ellis","Hi, good afternoon guys. You did not, I don\u2019t think call out in your prepared remarks any metrics around Braintree, I think historically you said that Braintree was running at more than 100% volume growth year-on-year is that somewhat of what you are seeing now and then also just can you comment on the transaction expense uptick you\u2019ve seen in 2016, which I think has also been driven a bit by Braintree and just what the outlook is for both of those looking out into 2017?","John Rainey","Sure. I\u2019ll start and allow Bill to jump in if he chooses. We continue to see great performance out of the Braintree part of our platform And in particular it\u2019s probably worth noting as we look at sequentially the year-over-year change in the third quarter compared to the year-over-year change in the fourth quarter, I highlighted in my prepared remarks that some of that was a result of Xoom and that for the same point in time in the fourth quarter of last year - of 2015 rather it was a quarter where we had exceptionally large growth for Braintree, which presented a more difficult comp.","All that said Braintree is still growing very much in line with our expectations and continues to be a great and complimentary part of our platform. And as I cited in my earlier response to a Ashwin, part of the uptick and transaction expense is related to the mix of our portfolio specifically Braintree tends to be more card-based and as we\u2019ve seen that growth that\u2019s the transaction expense that\u2019s for the fourth quarter. ","Bill Ready","This is Bill. I would like to add to that that not only the Braintree business itself is doing well, the B0 [ph] API that really brings together the 100% share to check out the Braintree processes, as well as PayPal\u2019s best experience including PayPal One Touch, and PayPal credit, all those things. We are seeing that really become a preferred way that merchants integrate to pay now and get access to the full breadth of our experiences. It\u2019s a big part of our mobile first strategy and a big part of it is driving PayPal's presence in many of the most interesting new commerce experiences out there. ","So, you heard us talk about what we are doing at interest buy buttons, Facebook messenger having commerce experiences for companies like Uber and others. Those things are all running through our Braintree platform. So we are seeing the strategy of Braintree and a 100% share of checkout, not only driving good great growth for our business, but getting our best experiences out there to more merchants to really interesting margins, really just to commerce experiences and available to our consumers as they encounter to those new commerce experience. So, we've been quite pleased with that and see that momentum continue to build in terms of Braintree as a key enabler of many of those interesting commerce experiences out there.","Lisa Ellis","Terrific thanks John and Bill.","Dan Schulman","Next question.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of James Cakmak, Monness, Crespi, Hardt.","James Cakmak","Hi, just two quick ones. Just on the regulatory environment, anything you can provide on how you're thinking about this year as you look at Durbin, the [indiscernible] so forth and then just on mobile, I know it is up 53% this quarter, and we saw the step up in 2016 versus 2015. I guess as we anniversary one such and I guess Xoom next year, what\u2019s the magnitude of the step down that we should expect? Thanks a lot.","Dan Schulman","Let me try and jump the two questions in there. So let me start with the mobile and then I will go into the impact of some regulatory and change of administrations. Mobile, mobile is driving growth in the industry right now. I mean more half the sales that are going online are being driven by mobile. Mobile is blurring lines of distinction between in-store environment and online environments, where like commerce is just becoming commerce. And truthfully, mobile is the biggest competitive differentiator for us. If we think about mobile, the real problem that merchants have with mobile is that when a browser begins the shopping experience on mobile between 65% and 74% of the time there is card abandonment because it\u2019s such a small screen, it\u2019s difficult to put of the payment information in there et cetera. So with One Touch we have 87% conversion on mobile. 87%. ","The next closest is 51%, the industry average is like 44%. So, we are at almost double the industry average in terms of the mobile experience that we see and mobile is exploring across the world, as well as I mentioned in terms of why did we take up our revenue guidance, pick it up because we see opportunity across the world and that\u2019s predominantly driven by mobile. So, I had spent mobile to continue to fewer our growth. Remember one other thing I said in my remarks with over half of our active basis on mobile payment transaction is through the PayPal platform in the last 12 months, over 100 billion in the volume of 55% for the year. So expect that to, not particular what the growth rate will be one way or the other, but mobile is going to be a strong driver of growth and it\u2019s a big differentiator for us.","John Rainey","The only thing I would add to that is just because you are talking about lapping effect on some of that, what we\u2019ve done with PayPal One Touch, we\u2019ve demonstrated that we can role that out to millions of merchants and millions of consumers, without them having to make changes and so PayPal One Touch is the first in many generations and that\u2019s a real competitive advantage for us that has others in the industry are out there trying to convince merchants to integrate new experience and things like that. We're just showing up and solving the problem for them without them having to do work. ","So, as you think of about playing that forward, we expect as many generations of us continuing to improve mobile experience, and uniquely we can do that without merchants having to do work on their end because we control the foreign experience. So as Dan was commenting, we expect that to continue for because of the secular trend. We also think we have a better ability than to talking about everybody else in the industry to continue to iterate and improve on those experiences because we can push out more fully for the day and upgrade those experiences whereas other have cycle that will be many, many months long because merchants have to make changes on their end.","Bill Ready","Good point. Let me talk a little bit about the change in administration and how we think about it in terms of the impact in our business. I start off, of course it\u2019s incredibly early days and there is a lot of talk about different things, but we are yet to see specifics around that. So, let's just talk about a couple of them because I know they are on your mind. From a regulatory perspective, obviously people are talking about changes and frank changes and potentially have CNTV [ph], is managed, but the first and most important thing is we are completely focused on being acquired with any and all regulatory environments that are out there. ","We believe that what regulators want, what we want are completely aligned and we are investing a tremendous amount of resource, but from a development or platform human resource perspective to assure that we are at compliance as we possibly can be regardless about the regulatory environment shifts, it is not just here in the U.S. but obviously across the world. Second, within Dodd Frank, a lot of people talk about Durban. We feel Durban is very unlikely to be over turned. First of all, as bad conversions, is bad for small business, not good for consumers. The only people who benefit are big banks from that and there is a big lobby of people that we think tried very hard for Durbin, it need 16 votes in the Senate. They will return this is not a of lightning rod issue, for Democrats or Republicans and so we think it is very unlikely given everything else that\u2019s going on at Durbin is overturned. ","We've also pointed out as John mentioned, the great deal of our business is overseas, not impacted by the Durbin at all, the impact even if it wasn't overturned, it is probably a lot smaller than you might imagine and we work on our way through that, but we will - again I think it is very unlikely to be overturned. Tax is something people talk about and we obviously have a lot of our business that is overseas. I think net, net still very early days, we would probably see a small net benefit in some of the Braintree or other things that have been thrown around in terms of tax changes, but maybe a little bit less than others might see, given our current tax environment. If we are allowed to repatriate funds from offshore in a more tax efficient manner, that might make a big difference in the way we think about capital allocation, and so we think that will be made net positive. There is a lot of talk about protectionism of large percentage of our cross-border trade happens outside the U.S. It\u2019s not impacted by any of this at all. ","Our average selling price is $60. Think about that. Tariff only applied to goods and services over $800. So most of this is not going to apply to what we do on a day in and day out basis and in a rising interest rate environment plus a net benefit to our revenue and our net income, if we see that happen. So, all in there is likely a good net positive impact to our business based on the change in the administration, but again, very early days to see how it plays out and then we will report out to you as we learn more.","James Cakmak","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Scott Devitt from Stifel.","Scott Devitt","Yes, hi. A question first on One Touch, I was just wondering if you could provide a new more detail about adoption within the $ 40 million consumer accounts in terms of maybe the penetration of the addressable TPV that they are actually using that product that have adopted into or opted into One Touch, and then secondly what the friction points are, you know of growing that penetration rate from here against the other 150 accounts and that haven\u2019t yet adopted the product? Thank you.","John Rainey","So we have 14 million of approximately 2 million users that are on One Touch already and that's happened really in the course of just over a year. So the adoption there is more rapidly than anything that PayPal ever put out and we see that adoption continuing. So, we think there is lot more left there in terms of the 40 million that have opted in to it versus the nearly 200 million total users that we have. Same on the margin side, we have more than half of the internet retailer at 500, accepting One Touch and costing 5 million of our 15 million merchants accepting it, but we have more growth left in that as well and we are working through those pretty rapidly. ","So all that to say, we think there is great moment with One Touch, but we think that continued as we make that a level to more for our merchants and as more consumers get exposed to it. As Dan mentioned in his remarks, more than half of our active users have engaged in a mobile transaction with us and so we know there is going to be good demand as more, and more users get exposed to it.","Scott Devitt","And if I could follow-up just, I'm sorry Dan, did you have a comment on that?","Dan Schulman","No, I was thinking in, see if I can [indiscernible].","Scott Devitt","Okay and we are just on a different topic, so feel free to expand on that, but we are just wondering John if there is some indication in the market in terms of that you didn't reiterate the three year guidance. And my assumption is it is not something you're going to be doing every quarter, you raised 2017 if you can just kind of address that that would be great, thanks. ","John Rainey","Sure. And you are exactly correct Scott. We are not going to get in the habit of updating three year guidance every quarter. There is no change to the guidance that we provided previously last quarter.","Scott Devitt","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Darrin Pellar from Barclays.","Darrin Pellar","Thanks guys. Can you just touch on what\u2019s included in your guidance with regard to Venmo monetization or pricing permit and then just also on the margin side, it seems your guidance were flat just to improving margins, it is actually despite the headwinds and I think you called that in Xoom, so what that has been, if you would have backed those items out and then maybe also stock, I mean it is also impacting margins, can you give us some more color on the driving, of course on the increase is there, thanks a lot guys. Nice job.","Dan Schulman","I will start of a little bit and then you can jump in. So, like I say in terms of Venmo monetization pricing very little actually built into our guidance for 2017. We fully intend to rollout out Venmo, previous Venmo in a much broader basis in 2017. And we will see some impact in that, but really the big impact on that happens in 2018 and 2019. And so just see that and that\u2019s, when we talk about feeling well positioned or profitable growth in 2017 and beyond it\u2019s because what we're seeing right now are things that we clearly see here and now and we've got a ton of things that we think we can monetize and fully intend to go due, but let\u2019s model them in more in the 2018 timeframes adhere and so not much is built into that. Not as much built into the customer choice piece of it, although I will say we\u2019re pretty encouraged by the initial results that we\u2019re seeing on choice. ","We rolled that choice through all of North America, right now on the servicing piece of choice, as well as the on boarding of that, we are just beginning in checkout right now, but as John mentioned in his remarks from a cost perspective it is well within our expectations in terms of transaction expense and engagement, it is better than we expected in terms of engagement which by the way is not really surprising. If you give somebody the choice to pay, they become more engaged, the average price that they pay or the basket size that they have goes up, as well these are not surprising. We anticipated, but it\u2019s nice to see those things starting to really happen in the market, but we have a ton of that built into our guidance as well that to me is more of a 2018, 2019 phenomenon.","Bill Ready ","And just on a couple of points on hedge and stock comp. If you look at hedge and currency impact in total in the fourth quarter, it had a rather immaterial impact on our overall results when you consider the offset that we have from other operating expenses - from operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies as well. That wasn't a big driver. With respect to stock comp, we had $127 million of share-based compensation in the quarter and that was relative to 90 last year, I think it\u2019s important to point out that a couple of things related to that. One when we separate it from eBay we basically did a lifted shift with respect to our compensation programs and we change that in 2016 to make those compensation programs appropriate for PayPal. ","And as part of that we change the vesting period related to our long-term compensation from four years previously to now 3 years. That element combined with just the natural increase in employees resulted in almost the entirety of that change year-over-year. I will say that we are a big believer in share-based compensation for our employees. We think get the alliance, their motivations without our shareholders, which we would all agree is a very good thing and if you look broadly across the industry stat and our comparables and you look at virtually any measure, take share-based compensation as a percent of revenue for example, we are in the lower quartile, the better quartile related to our peer group and there are various other ways you can look at that. We compare very favorably in all of them.","Darrin Pellar","All right that's helpful there. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would like to turn the conference back over to PayPal management for any additional comments.","Dan Schulman","It's Dan. I just want to thank everybody for joining us on the call. We know how busy all of you are and we look forward to seeing you at our investor conferences and talking to you on our next earnings call as well. So, thank you very much for your time.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Ms. Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Gabrielle Rabinovitch","Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal Holdings\u2019 earnings conference call for the first quarter 2019. Joining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO; Bill Ready, our EVP, Chief Operating Officer; and John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer and EVP, Global Customer Operations.","We\u2019re providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being webcast, and both the presentation and call are available through the Investor Relations section of our website. We will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about our Company\u2019s performance. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call.","In addition, please note that beginning with the first quarter of 2019, we reclassified certain operating expenses within our consolidated statements of income.

You should not rely on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today\u2019s date, April 24, 2019. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update the information.","With that, let me turn the call over to Dan.","Dan Schulman","Thank you, Gabrielle, and thanks everyone for joining us on today's call.","I'm pleased to report that PayPal had a strong start to the year. In the first quarter, we generated $4.13 billion in revenue, in line with our expectations. This represents year-over-year growth of 12% on an FX neutral basis or approximately 19% revenue growth, normalized for the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables. For the first quarter, we delivered $0.78 of non-GAAP EPS, $0.08 of which came as a result of our recent MercadoLibre investment. Excluding that gain, we delivered $0.70 in Q1, up 23% year-over-year, outperforming our expectation.","Once again, a highlight of the quarter was our growth in both net new active and engagement. We added 9.3 million net new actives in the quarter, up 15% year-over-year. We now have 277 million active accounts on our platform, with approximately 255 million consumers shopping at 22 million merchants. We are on pace to exceed 300 million active accounts by year end. We added 40 million net new actives in the past 12 months, an all-time record. That is over 2 times our trajectory from just two years ago. And even as we add record net new actives, our customer engagement continues to grow. Engagement grew by 9% to 38 transactions per active account. This increasing use of our platform helped to drive $161 billion of TPV in the quarter, up 25% on an FX-neutral basis, consistent with the past two quarters.","Total payment volume excluding eBay grew 29% on an FX-neutral basis, outpacing the overall payments market as we continue to gain share. eBay had negative TPV growth of 4% this quarter, and now represents just 9.7% of our overall TPV. Our Merchant Services TPV growth rate has accelerated over the past two quarters, offsetting a 700 basis-point decline in eBay\u2019s TPV the growth rate during that same period.","Mobile continues to fuel our growth with over 66 billion of mobile TPV in Q1. And One Touch with 136 million consumers and 12.1 million merchants remains the clear market leader in mobile checkout with almost 2 times the conversion of competing wallets. Venmo continues its significant momentum. At the end of Q1, over 40 million active Venmo customers drove significant increases in volume growth and monetizable transactions. Venmo total payment volume increased 73% year-over-year to $21 billion and we remain on pace to drive nearly $100 billion in TVP through Venmo in 2019.","As user growth continues to accelerate, merchants are increasingly turning to Venmo as a way to attract a valuable and engaged consumer base. For example, in the first quarter, we launched a customer engagement partnership with [indiscernible], engaging customers through Venmo payouts to drive awareness for their new rewards program. In less than one week, they surpassed their launch campaign objective with 1 million signups. And this is just the beginning of brands leveraging Venmo to drive engagement and conversation within the social feeds.","In January, we reported that Venmo had an annualized revenue run rate going into 2019 that exceeded $200 million. I'm very pleased to report that our annual revenue run rate coming out of Q1 is now over $300 million. And with over 40 million active users growing substantially each and every quarter, we fully expect to see that annualized revenue number continue to grow.","In addition to Venmo, core peer to peer continues to experience strong growth. P2P is the large source of net new active users on our platform, as well as a significant driver of lifetime value. Total P2P volume was $42 billion, growing 41% year-over-year.","Over the past several years, we've announced more than 40 partnerships with leaders across the tech and financial services industries. These partnerships have enabled new experiences for customers and have helped to connect business and consumers across new platforms and marketplaces.","Last month, we extended our partnership with Facebook to support the payments infrastructure for Instagram shopping, starting in the U.S. which will allow users on the platform to pay in context using their PayPal account or with other financial instruments. We are building deep platform integrations with Facebook, which also include product experiences within Facebook messenger and donations. Instagram shopping is an important expansion of our strategic relationship as we work to create new experiences for our joint customers.","We continue to help consumers and businesses get faster access to their money. We are rolling out the ability to complete instant transfer to bank accounts for consumers and businesses in the U.S. with international expansion expected in the near future. For too long, digital payments offered a faster and better technology, but in many cases it actually made getting access to money slower. We\u2019ve launched multiple initiatives over the last few years to get people and businesses more ways to instantly move money using their PayPal account. Through our partnership with JPMorgan Chase, PayPal is one of the first companies to introduce real-time payments for both consumers and merchants as part of our ongoing effort to offer our customers faster and flexible access to their funds.","Our $750 million investment in MercadoLibre was a meaningful development in our drive to increase our international scope and scale. We expect to significantly expand our footprint with a strong global partnership. Our aspiration is to be the global digital payments platform of choice for merchants and consumers around the world. Our full suite of services and products are intended to bring everyone into the digital economy. MercadoLibre is one of the largest online commerce and payments ecosystems in Latin America. Our two companies share a common vision. We both want to help small businesses compete globally and offer innovative, financial solutions to help people that may be underserved by the traditional financial system.","By working closely together, we can jointly leverage our scale and platform capabilities to help drive inclusion and access to the global digital economy. As part of our investment, our teams are working hard to develop a robust commercial agreement that brings together our respective payments capabilities to unleash incremental value to our combined 500 million plus customers around the world. We look forward to sharing more about our plans to work together as we finalize our agreement.","I would like to end my remarks by reiterating our commitment to our values and to being a role model corporate citizen. I strongly believe that company is in stand [ph] up and take responsibility to adjust the issues that face every global citizen. In a few days, we will release our Annual Global Impact report, highlighting the progress we've made in driving social impact, managing our environmental footprint and supporting our employees and their communities.","We had a strong start to 2019 and we remain confident in the annual targets we outlined during our last earnings call. We will continue operating in a disciplined manner, leveraging our wide range of unique assets, strategically investing, both organically and inorganically with the goal of strengthening our two-sided platform. We look forward to delivering another strong set of results this coming year. And with that I'll turn the call over to John.","John Rainey","Thanks, Dan.","We started the year with the great first quarter. Our financial and operational performance was a continuation of our trends exiting 2018. Our results demonstrate the increasing relevance, functionality and utility of our payments platform. We delivered solid volume and revenue growth with strong expense discipline and earnings growth. Importantly, similar to the fourth quarter of last year, we achieved these results in the face of declining eBay volumes, ongoing year-over-year pressure from a stronger dollar and a continued mixed macro environment.","Overall, our first quarter performance is consistent with the recent results that our business has been delivering in terms of growth, volume based expense dynamics as well as operating leverage in our non-transaction related expenses.","I will discuss our financial results and then I will spend some time on our investment in MercadoLibre, our restructuring charge and our updated guidance.","Revenue in the first quarter increased 12% on both the spot and currency neutral basis, to $4.13 billion. Adjusting for the sale of receivables to synchrony, revenue growth would have been approximately 19%. Acquisitions contributed approximately 1.5 points to revenue growth in the quarter. The translation effect from the stronger dollar negatively impacted revenue by $116 million. This impact was offset by $52 million in revenue from hedge gains. As a result, the net effect of the stronger dollar was a revenue headwind of $64 million in the quarter.","U.S. revenue grew 8% versus Q1 2018, and approximately 22% adjusting for the credit receivable sale. International revenue grew 17% on a currency-neutral basis. On a spot basis, transaction revenue grew 17% in the quarter. Revenue from other value-added services declined 19%. Normalizing for the receivable sales this revenue would have grown approximately 35%. In the quarter, we recognized $55 million of revenue from Synchrony related to transitional loan servicing and collections.","In the first quarter, transaction take rate was 2.31%. Compared to Q1 2018 transaction take rate declined 11 basis points. Strong P2P growth contributed to two thirds of the decline. Weakness in eBay\u2019s marketplaces business as well as pressure on some of our key cross-border corridors from stronger dollar were also drivers of the reduction in transaction take rate.","Total take rate in Q1 declined 22 basis points from the prior year. Approximately two thirds of this decline was attributable to the credit receivables sale. The same factors that affect the transaction take rate also contributed to the decline in our total take rate. Both, transaction take rate and total take rate, benefited from revenue related to our hedge gains.","Volume-based expenses increased 20% in the first quarter to $1.9 billion. Transaction expense represented 96 basis points as a rate of TPV, flat sequentially and versus last year. Transaction loss was 18 basis points as a rate of TPV, also flat sequentially and versus last year. Loan losses were 3 basis points as a rate of TPV.","Transaction margin dollars grew 6% to $2.2 billion in the first quarter. Transaction margin as a rate was 54%, a decline of approximately 290 basis points versus Q1 \u201818. The credit receivable sale was a meaningful driver of this decline. We expect to see transaction margin dollar growth reaccelerate in Q3. Non-transaction related expenses grew 2% versus last year, growth in these expenses was affected by both the lapping of the held for sale accounting changes, which resulted in a lower rate of growth year-over-year as well as an increase in expenses related to our 2018 acquisitions. Normalizing for both of these, non-transaction related expenses grew 7%. On this adjusted basis, we delivered 280 basis points of operating leverage.","Operating income in the first quarter grew 13% to $934 million and our operating margin modestly improved versus last year. Adjusting for 2018 acquisitions, operating income would have grown 16% and our operating margin would have expanded 110 basis points in the quarter. Other income in the quarter increased by $185 million, primarily from net unrealized gains on strategic investments. On a per share basis, unrealized gains contributed approximately $0.12 after-tax, $0.04 of the benefit was included in the EPS guidance we provided in January. The incremental $0.08 was not in our guidance and resulted from our investment in MercadoLibre, which closed on March 15th. Going forward, our other income line item will be affected each quarter by movements in MercadoLibre\u2019s stock price. I will discuss this more in moment.","Non-GAAP EPS for the first quarter grew 37% to $0.78. We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $9.5 billion. In addition, we generated $809 million of free cash flow and repurchased $750 million of stock.","Before discussing guidance for the second quarter and updated guidance for the full year, I would like to provide more color on how we plan to disclose the effect of unrealized gains and losses from strategic investments on our income statement as well as context for the restructuring charge that we recorded in Q1.","Our strategic investments create earnings volatility, given that unrealized gains and losses are recognized from observable price movements. As a reminder, as of January 2018, equity investments are required to be mark-to-market when reportable event occurs. Given the difficulty and predicting public market valuation changes when we provide quarterly guidance, we will not be able to estimate the overall EPS impact from our strategic investment portfolio.","For the remainder of the year, as soon as practicable following quarter end, we will issue an 8-K providing the net gains or losses and related earnings impact on the entire strategic investment portfolio for the prior quarter. In addition, going forward, to the extent that our guidance includes an expectation of gains or losses related to these investments, we will quantify this estimated impact when we provide that guidance.","In the first quarter, we also recorded a $78 million GAAP-only restructuring charge. This charge relates to workforce actions that are intended to better align our teams in support of our key business priorities as well as actions related to the transitioning of our credit and collection operations to Synchrony. As we grow and evolve, we will continue to evaluate our structure, processes and resource allocation for improvement opportunities. We expect to reinvest the majority of the related savings back into our business to drive growth. This charge was previously contemplated by the GAAP guidance we provided in January for the first quarter and the full-year 2019.","Now, I'd like to discuss our updated guidance for 2019 and our guidance for the second quarter. For the full-year 2019, we are raising our earnings outlook and affirming the revenue guidance we previously provided in January. We now expect GAAP earnings per share to be in the range -- sorry, non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $2.94 to $3.01, representing 22% to 24% growth. Our raised earnings guidance incorporates both our core earnings outperformance in the first quarter as well as the unrealized gain we recognized from our investment in MercadoLibre. As a reminder, we expect this investment to create earnings volatility as we move through the year.","For the second quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $4.3 billion to $4.34 billion or 12% to 13% growth on a currency-neutral basis. Adjusted for the credit receivable sale, we expect our revenue growth rate to be 19% to 20%. In addition, we expect non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.68 to $0.70, representing 16% to 20% growth. Our second quarter EPS guidance includes an estimated benefit from unrealized gains we expect to recognize in the quarter of slightly less than $0.01.","To wrap up, our first quarter results set us up well for another year of strong financial performance. I would like to thank all of our employees, our customers and our partners for a great quarter. And with that I will turn it over to the operator for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Jason Kupferberg","Thanks for the updated Venmo revenue disclosure, pretty impressive growth there in a very short period of time, but I actually want to ask you about eBay. I know you were down 4% on the volume side there in Q1. So, how does that affect your thought process on the full year outlook for eBay volume? And maybe if you can talk a little bit about the impact -- quantifying the impact that eBay had on the first quarter number. And then, we also need to get some more questions about the potential shape of 2020, just given obviously the operating agreement expiring in the middle of next year. And I know it\u2019s clearly too early for actual guidance. But just directionally, should people be thinking about a noticeable declaration in the P&L in the second half of next, or is that not foregone conclusion because of certain offset that you guys still have found to continue development?","Dan Schulman","Thanks Jason for the question, we will spend the next 45 minutes answering it. There is a lot in that. So, let me start off and then maybe I will turn it over to John to talk a little bit about some of your -- some parts of your question. The first, I would just say is, look, I expect eBay and PayPal to be close strategic partners for a long time to come. eBay just added PayPal into their intermediated payments. Our mutual customers, whether they be consumers or merchants, basically demand that we work together and that PayPal be there. We\u2019ve got 277 million people now on the platform. And consumers are 54% more likely to buy when a merchants accepts PayPal. So, the eBay sellers know that, they know people abandon if they don\u2019t use PayPal. And so, I think we're going to be close partners on an ongoing basis. And eBay adding PayPal into their intermediated payments I think is net incremental benefit for us as we look forward.","On the OA, the operating agreement, goes through July of 2020. And so, today, our eBay TPV is at 9.7%. now under 10%. It's likely to be, if you just extrapolate out, by the end of the operating agreement, somewhere between like 5% to 6% of our overall TPV. And by the end of 2020, as you probably heard Devin talk about, this ends at the end of July 2020, with very rapidly right after that you\u2019re going into a holiday selling season. And so, there aren\u2019t a lot of changes that merchants will do in that interim period to make any major changes. So, by the end of that 2020, you're going to see our TPV well under 5% at that point.","And I feel like what we're seeing right now is not really an impact from intermediated payments but really more of an impact from the decline in GMV in the marketplaces of eBay. And so, even with that decline -- they declined from a TPV prospective 700 basis points in the last couple of quarters. Even with that, you're seeing on adjusted basis, our margins would have been up a 110 basis points this quarter. You\u2019re seeing us reaffirm our guidance for revenues. And by the way, our revenue guidance for the year is between 19.5% revenue growth and 20.5% revenue growth, and we just upped our EPS guidance for the year.","So, I would say, they are just becoming a much smaller part of PayPal at a more rapid pace, which by the way is great because it\u2019s just a more even decline than we might have expected. And I think we can easily contain that within our guidance.","I would also just say, there is nothing we see in eBay\u2019s intermediated payments that gives us any cause for concern, right now. I might even say the opposite of that. I think we feel very well positioned as we go forward.","Bill talked about this on the previous call but I\u2019d just reiterate because the trends are still valid. Merchants who use PayPal to list in multiple markets, see a 3 times lift in sales and often pay less in total expenses than they would on eBay when you look at commissions and payments in total. And we're helping small businesses to list in multiple marketplaces with our One Touch activation. And so, that's helping small businesses. And we feel like that's a big part of our responsibility.","The other thing I\u2019d point out is our top 20 marketplaces, excluding eBay, drove $90 billion of TPV in the last 12 months, growing at 39%. So, you can see, we are really integrated into these marketplaces. They are growing substantially. We have a big opportunity once the OA expires to work much more closely with couple of major marketplaces around the world that we have prohibited from working with for. And so, we're feeling pretty good about where we sit right now and nothing in the eBay results would change that perspective.","John Rainey","I\u2019d just add a couple of things, Jason, to address your question on cross-border as well as the outlook for the back half of the year. First on cross-border. Like a lot of companies that have the global breadth that we do, we are affected by the stronger dollar. And eBay is part of that cross-border activity. I wouldn\u2019t say that they are an outsized portion of that cross-border activity though. So, that does affect our numbers.","Secondly, with respect to the outlook for the year, certainly to a certain extent we have to rely on the guidance that eBay provides, and that influences our expectations around our business. And we\u2019ve certainly seen slowing growth there and they are becoming a declining percentage of our business.","But at the same point in time we\u2019re demonstrating that we can expand operating margins and grow our revenue on an adjusted basis 20% while observing this decline and in fact observing the dilutive effect from some of the acquisitions that we had in 2018. And we\u2019re able to do that through all of the other portfolio of products that we have, like we talked about the new experience with Instagram, what we're doing with Venmo, and we\u2019re excited about the relationship with MercadoLibre. All of these things and others that we\u2019re working on, enable us to achieve those kind of financial results, while we absorb the declining percentage of eBay business.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Bryan Keane","I wanted to ask about Venmo. The 40 million Venmo users, that\u2019s an impressive number. I think that\u2019s ahead of the most people\u2019s estimates. But, even the Q1 exit revenue run rate now, $300 million is above our expectations. So, just trying to get a feel where the excess growth is coming from or just give us a sense of the magnitude of the growth. Is it pay with Venmo, debit, instant transfer? And then, secondly, hearing plans to come out with a Venmo credit, maybe you could talk about that as well. Thanks.","Bill Ready","This is Bill. Yes, we\u2019re certainly pleased with the monetization of Venmo and the rate at which that\u2019s progressing. And as we talked about before, it\u2019s not really concentrated on any one thing. We\u2019ve got multiple initiatives that are monetizing for Venmo. We got the Venmo debit card, we got pay with Venmo, we got instant transfer. And instant transfer is what we're getting a lot of the discussions. If you go back sort of six months ago, and talked about on the last call that approximately half of monetization is coming from our initiatives in commence outside of instant transfer. So, we feel like there is a really good balance between the multiple initiatives we have there going from the $200 million annual run rate a quarter ago to -- or over $20 million a quarter ago to over $300 million. Now, we feel like it\u2019s great progress but, it\u2019s not really concentrated in any one of those things. And what we're really seeing across the user base is those Venmo users while still growing in number quite rapidly are also deepening their engagement with us and are looking for more and more products from us.","So, to your second question on a Venmo credit card, there is nothing we\u2019ve announced cards beyond the Venmo debit card. But, we certainly see great demand for that. And we see great demand across our user base from more and more products from Venmo. And we are engaging with the banking ecosystem in a very broad way across PayPal and Venmo. And so, we're always looking for new ways that we can go deepen engagement with our users as well as work with our bank partners to deliver great services to our users. But to be very clear, there is nothing beyond the Venmo debit card that we're announcing at this moment in time.","Dan Schulman","Bryan, if I can add a little bit to what Bill said. One of the reasons why we announced 40 million is really a lot of numbers that we saw flying out there that were inaccurate. And we thought it was important to set the record straight and lot of people talk about downloads and different things. To us, what\u2019s really important is, how many customers do you have, how many engaged customers do you have. And we've seen a tremendous number of new customers coming on board. But, we actually have an increasing engagement curve. In other words, the engagement of Venmo users increased over time, not churn over time. And so, to us, that really demonstrates some of what Bill was just saying that our base truly does want to engage in the service, is looking for more and more functionality from us. And brands are also increasingly seeing the value of that. I think, the Chipotle [ph] example is a really powerful one. Within a week, they hit their campaign objective with over 1 million sign ups. These are pretty impressive numbers. And we see a lot more opportunities to work with brands to engage with their consumers inside the structural fees.","John Rainey","I\u2019ll also add that one of the reasons that we\u2019re providing as much information as we are right now on Venmo is because of some of the questions that are out there about our ability to monetize that, which we've never questioned. But, giving you these nuggets of information around revenue growth and active accounts, it's not something we're going to do every quarter. We don't report different aspects of our business that way. But given the importance of the Venmo and the focus of that, we thought that early on, we would give a couple data points to markers out there to better understand the trajectory of Venmo.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tien-tsin Huang","I wanted to build actually on both Jason and Bryan's question with the margin clarification. You beat our forecast in this quarter but with eBay slowing again and across border slowing a little bit. And then just describe Venmo and the opportunities there to invest and monetize et cetera. I'm curious how often are you in delivering on the margin expansion this year, what kind of levers do you have to grow that confidence. And may be just a bigger picture question, does it make sense to expand margins when there is lot of potential, sounds like really shape consumer behavior on here, consumer platforms like Venom et cetera by helping marketing or promotions or what have you, so a big picture question on margins if that makes sense?","Dan Schulman","Sure. Tein-tsin, I'll start and others can jump in. Certainly, as we look at this quarter that we're reporting today, we're able to modestly expand operating margins even with absorbing some of the headwinds that were discussed as well as the acquisitions that we brought on last year. But, we're constantly looking at our ability to invest in the business as well as expand margins and we believe that we can do both. We\u2019ve got significant growth opportunities but we're beginning to really demonstrate the scalability of our platform at a low marginal cost. And we demonstrated that by 280 basis points of operating leverage this quarter, but at the same point in time, investing in things like Venmo, investing in other things that we\u2019re doing or organically and still using our free cash flow to go out and augment that with inorganic investments.","So, I guess to summarize my answer to your question is, yes, we do believe that we can do both. But at the same time, we are not going to be a prisoner to trying to show operating margin expansion each individual quarter. We're managing this business for the long term. And we will periodically make investments that might cause us to in one quarter, see a decline in operating margin but maybe there is a better growth opportunity. Other quarters that may be the opposite of that. But, we believe over the long term, we can invest in our business to grow it at the rates that we talked about with mid 20% TPV and revenue growth that\u2019s in the high teens and also expand our operating margins.","John Rainey","Also remember, I think it's important to point out that operating margin expansion doesn't just come with for instance, expense reduction. As we grow revenues on Venmo, you see that improvement in our margin structure there, and that will continue going forward. And that's really -- that's a great way to grow your margins because you\u2019re growing your revenues. And we see that in other parts of the business as well. And so we think there is a lot of areas where we can still be more efficient, we\u2019re continuing to see that as a company but there are also a lot of areas where we will grow margins, by growing our top line in certain parts of the business as well and filling holes that we had in the income statement.","Dan Schulman","One more thing I would add too Tien-tsin is that when we look at some of these below the line benefits that we had and not MercadoLibre but the $0.04 that was contemplated as we gave our guidance and went into the quarter as well as some of the benefit that we had in our fourth quarter results. We very deliberately talked about it, reinvesting in the business. These are -- this is earnings growth. And while one could argue that it's a lesser quality because its below the line, it gives us an opportunity to grow earnings and pour some of that reinvestment back into the business, so that we can grow our core platform in some of the better parts of our business like Venmo.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore. Your line is now open. ","David Togut","Thanks so much and congrats on the strong customer metrics, especially. Looking at the 15% growth in net adds in the quarter and the 9% increase in customer engagement, can you talk about what you're seeing in some of these newer cohorts overall in terms of engagement? You touched on that with respect to Venmo, but I\u2019d be curious in terms of what you're seeing for PayPal overall in terms of the new cohorts.","Dan Schulman","Thanks David for the question. I'll start off, and I'm sure Bill will add in. So, I\u2019ll just start off by reiterating a little bit what I said on call. This was a very strong quarter for us in net new actives, it was our -- I think our second best quarter ever in net new activities. The majority is driven by core PayPal but a good amount through Venmo as well. And both PayPal and Venmo increased year-over-year as we look at net new actives. And the reason I think both our engagement is up and our net new actives are up are couple of reasons. One, obviously, we\u2019ve got a network effect going on right now that is clearly helpful. Clearly up on the Venmo side of 40 million with a social fee that connects people together, but also when you look at 22 million merchants and 255 million consumers is a little bit of a must-have for both sides of the two-sided platform.","I think the product teams have done a great job on improving customer experiences. Whether it be One Touch, P2P enhancements, choice that we put in place, new things that we\u2019re just beginning to see some nice impact from like rewards being on the platform, not only are we seeing increasing engagement as a result of that but we're seeing best churn as a result too.","So, net new actives are a combination of top of the funnel and bottom of the funnel, and we're seeing improvements on both sides. Obviously, partnerships are helping us. We've got a lot of partnerships. They're driving a lot of marketing dollars towards us. We think we're at the very beginning. We've met with senior leaders of a ton of the FIs, financial institutions recently they are all looking at driving incremental volume to us because we drive so much incremental transaction volume to them.","Obviously, Venmo, as we talked about that, that's going from strength-to-strength. And I am pretty pleased with our global expansion right now, whether it be in India, Japan. We\u2019ve just done some things with EKYC; Brazil, our partnership with Ita\u00fa is really starting to take off. And so, I am feeling pretty good about a wide range of activities here that that are helping to drive both the engagement and the net new actives.","Bill Ready","And I would just say, with regard to how the cohorts are performing, we\u2019ve talked about this on prior calls. For the last three years or so, you're seeing a kind of a steady trend line up on increasing the number of net new actives each quarter. And we closely watched the quality of those cohorts, and we\u2019ve seen that each cohorts has gotten better and better and better over time. And that really just speaks to everything Dan was describing in terms of how well-rounded our offerings are. We\u2019ve expanded the range of services we can provide to consumers, the different places that a consumer can engage with us. And so, engagement is up overall and the quality of our cohorts even as we really widened the top of the funnel, so to speak, in terms of getting new users onto the platform, the quality of the cohorts does not only remain strong but we see each successive cohort, being stronger and stronger than the prior cohorts. There is nothing we\u2019ve seen has really changed in that overall trend.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Heath Terry","Just to dig into the acceleration in merchant services growth a little bit, now that we\u2019ve seen it for a few quarters. Dan, you've talked us in the past about the leverage that you're seeing, processing payments for companies like Uber and Airbnb and Apple Pay and now you're adding Instagram shopping. How much of these named partners impacting the acceleration and merchant services growth? And particularly something that's relatively early stage, like Instagram shopping. How do you think about the impact that it or may be other partners that we haven't talked about yet are meaningfully contributing to future growth.","Dan Schulman","Yes. I think, some of those, as you mentioned, are just starting. So, we're going to see quite a bit of future growth, Instagram shopping would be a good example of that. Another good example Heath that you didn\u2019t mentioned but we think is a really meaningful vertical that we\u2019re just moving into, would be built, like our partnership with Paymentus. We think that there are at a minimum, tens and tens of billions of dollars of incremental TPV to just that vertical, maybe significantly more. So, these partnerships are obviously growing rapidly. We talked about the top 20 generating 90 billion of TPV growing at 39%. And also remember, there are other big marketplaces out there that we\u2019re prohibited from working with because of the operating agreement. And we are honor that operating agreement completely to letter of it in and spirit of it. And so -- but those marketplaces are ready to start partnering with us and we\u2019re ready to start partnering with them on a much deeper basis. I think, you look at partners like Uber and Airbnb and others. We think they\u2019ve got tremendous growth opportunities yet. We\u2019ve been partnering with them for quite some time going forward. And we think being deep strategic partners with some of them is a really important element for both -- for our mutual customers. ","Bill Ready","I would just say, Dan described, these partnerships are varying stages of maturity, like Uber and Airbnb that we work with from almost inception to newer things like Instagram. But across each of these are seeing PayPal, both the payment market as well as our broader platform to connect to number of commerce experiences, will be coming the preferred platform for the best commerce experiences out there. As Dan cited earlier that our top 20 marketplace and partners outside eBay were $90 billion plus volume over the last 12 months, growing at 39% plus year-on-year. I think this is one of the most important trends in e-commerce right now is that if you are a small to midsize seller or a small seller, a decade ago there was sort of one place you could go to sell. And there has been an explosion of those places. And some of those are newer and more nascent, others of those are more mature. But across those, PayPal is a partner of choice both for those marketplace and partner providers as well as the small, midsize businesses that selling those places that are using PayPal to connect into those many forums. And so that's been a great area of growth for us. And it's -- there is partners of varying phases of maturity. And I think it's great that there is no one of those partners that dominates for us. At the same time, it's -- this trend is well along its path. And we have become a primary partner to the eco system, both in terms of those marketplaces as well that people want to sell within those marketplaces.","Dan Schulman","Yes. Just adding 22 million merchants, we talk about our overall 277 million, but 22 million merchants that are growing quite nicely every single quarter as well, being able to take those predominantly small merchants and be able with One Touch authentication, get them into all these marketplaces that Bill just talked about, helps to marketplaces and helps us to deliver incremental sales to those small business partners.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Darrin Peller","Hey, guys. Thanks again. Look, I mean, net new active numbers continues to clearly outperform the 300 million year end expectations, and I know it\u2019s just on this last quarter. But, I kind of want to hone in again on just to make sure these kinds of trends can be sustainable around. If I could Venmo and core, the international side still seems to be something -- an area we think is a big opportunity. And I'd love to hear more about how India is going and then may be the MELI deal. I mean, the commercial agreement to us seems like it could be a big opportunity for something kind of like when you went after as I do is enabling cross border transactions from maybe all of those tons of millions of Latin American users to use international or PayPal accept it.","Are we thinking about that right and other international opportunities? And then just maybe also update us on the pipeline of incremental marketplaces, beyond like we saw and Instagram would be great. Thanks so much, guys.","Dan Schulman","Let me start off a little bit maybe with how we thought about MercadoLibre, and Bill can talk about maybe the sustainability of the net new actives going forward. So, Darrin, you are exactly right, I mean, we see international as tremendous opportunity space for us. And if I take a step back, we're willing to invest in companies or acquire companies that we believe advance our strategic agenda. I said this in my remarks, we do want to be the leading global digital payments platform. And that means, looking across the world who are the leading players there, and how might we partner together in some way to take our respective platforms, the respective number of customers we each have. MercadoLibre, between their marketplace and part [ph] of their payments infrastructure, 200 million plus customers themselves.","And so, you\u2019ve put that together with ours, you have almost 500 million customers. And there to your point, you can see that combination being quite powerful for driving growth for both companies. And so, there are companies like MercadoLibre where a strategic partnership may make a sense for us, and they allow us to expand our presence into geographies or set of capabilities. And by the way there may be other companies around the world that offer similar strategic options for us. And we\u2019d be willing to explore partnerships, very akin to what we did with MercadoLibre. None of our investments, whether it\u2019d be MercadoLibre or others, prevent us from working with anybody else.","We are an open platform, we intend to work with everyone in driving this agenda helping consumers and businesses have access to the digital economy. And so, we're very pretty pleased with the overall partnership and relationship we\u2019re developing with MercadoLibre. We do have a Board observer seat, I think it\u2019s going to allow for deep collaboration and maybe our platforms into a commercial relationship, I think will drive a lot of value for us. But again, there are others like this that we see around the world as well.","Bill Ready","And on the sustainability of the net new actives, it's really about three years now if you mid-2016 when started to bend the curve on accelerating net new assets. And we\u2019ve gotten this question on sustainability consistently since I think three years in and I think we\u2019re demonstrating that sustainability. And the thing that we\u2019ve talked about throughout that has been that it\u2019s not about any one particular product experience, it\u2019s not about any one particular geography, it\u2019s that we revamped all of our product experience and broaden the set of services that customers engage in across many geographies. And so, the fact that that acceleration and that new actives is not tied to any one particular product experience, not tied to any one particular geography and is well diversified across product experience and across geographies, I think this speaks to the ongoing sustainability that we demonstrated over the last three years.","I think further on the marketplaces, you asked about pipeline there but Dan alluded to this earlier, but what we can deliver for those marketplaces, we talk a lot about what we drive in terms of much better conversion for consumers on a front end. If you are a marketplace, the fuel that sees the marketplace oftentimes attracting sellers on the other side of the marketplace. And those $22 million sellers that we have that can be One Touch activation, as Dan was describing earlier, that\u2019s quite significant for those marketplaces because it\u2019s not just that you're taking friction out of the sign-up in terms of having to provide information, those marketplaces are looking for vetted sellers with proven selling history, wanting to understand what vertical those sellers engage in. And all those things that we can do to really bring sellers into this exclusion of new marketplaces out there, really makes us a partner of choice, not only on the consumer buying side but in terms of fueling those marketplaces with proven sellers, it is a tremendous benefit. So, we see really rich pipeline of marketplaces there, both for the infrastructure that we provide with our PayPal for Partners platform as well as what we're able to do to go bring customers and enter those marketplaces both on the consumer side as well as on the merchant side. ","Operator","Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi. Your line is now open.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Thanks, guys. I appreciate the insight so far. My question is on Synchrony, on the Synchrony relationship. And I was hoping you could update us on how to think of the ongoing growth of the revenue share for the year, consumer lending business. And also if you can clarify maybe the magnitude and timing of the servicing part of that agreement. Is that sort of -- does that end inter quarter in 2Q or does it end at the end of the quarter, how should we think about that?","John Rainey","Sure, Ashwin. I will take that. With respect to the agreement, the transition of that, it\u2019s at the end of the June of this quarter. And we will, as we noted in the prepared remarks, we received a payment from Synchrony related to some of the servicing of that. But, we will also, as part of the charge that we announced -- we will have a reduction in workforce related to employees that currently serves that business today. So there will be sort of an offsetting benefit there going forward. In terms of the growth, I think that it\u2019s more in line with the overall business that we\u2019re doing. Credit in general, including merchant credit here as well, as well as the international credit, they tend to be growing little bit faster than the rest of our business because of some of the opportunities that we have there. But all of those numbers are built into our full-year guidance. I think, fortunately for us -- we\u2019ll be happy to get passed past this next quarter where we have to quit making -- where we can quit making adjustments for things like held for sale accounting and then the revenue impact to other value-added services and so forth. But, the second half of the year will be more of an ongoing -- more representative of what the ongoing business will look like.","Dan Schulman","Yes. And let me may be add to that. We just had our credit operations review yesterday. And I'm really pleased with what I'm seeing from that team right now. They are really embracing partnership. Synchrony is unleashing our ability to look at all forms of growth on the credit side. There is a ton of new innovative incremental things that they're looking at. Our merchant lending business is right now over $10 billion, since we started. We think we're one of the top lenders of working capital small businesses.","So, on every front, I'd say I\u2019m quite pleased with what I'm seeing and what the future falls as a result of what we've done in our partnership with Synchrony. So, I think we'll continue to see good growth on that side. And as John said, we will be glad to get through second quarter, so we don't have to keep adjusting results and you will be able to see that clearly in our revenues.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of George Mihalos with Cowen. Your line is now open. ","George Mihalos","Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Just a quick one, maybe going back to Jason\u2019s question around cross-border. I mean, obviously, the volume there of TPV has been under some pressure for the myriad of reasons that you talked about. But now going into 2Q and through the rest of the year, the comparisons ease, FX should be less of a headwind than what we had before. And obviously sort of international opportunities are sort of front and center. Do you think that the volume growth or the TPV growth has slowed there, has bottomed, and is there a reason why that shouldn't really start to accelerate over the back half of the year? Thank you.","John Rainey","Hey, George. It\u2019s John. I\u2019ll take this. So, the back half of the year, we do expect an acceleration in cross-border. Q2 will look probably pretty similar to Q1. But, there are two things going on there. One is that we simply have sort of a translation effect, and that corrects itself as we as we lap the previous periods where we saw changes in the relative value of the currencies. But, the second thing is there is a behavioral aspect to cross-border activity that if you live in a country where the currency there has depreciated appreciably versus say the U.S. dollar, it doesn\u2019t -- when you lap that four quarters later, it doesn't all of a sudden make it less expensive to buy something. So, that\u2019s sort of an ongoing pressure. But I'll remind you, that certainly works both ways. We\u2019re in 200 markets across the world and these things ebb and flow. There will be periods where we have headwinds related to this and there will be periods where there are tailwinds. I think, very fortunately for us, given the diversity of our portfolio in the various regions that we operate in around the world, there is sort of a natural hedge that goes on.","And relative to I believe Darrin's question earlier around some of the other opportunities, when we think about our growth opportunities and investment opportunities around the globe, this is something that we certainly keep in mind. And if you think about the MercadoLibre investment, Latin America is an area where we\u2019re less strong than we are in other institution. And we will continue to focus our investments around building up our presence in some of these areas where there's more opportunity to grow where we don't have the footprint that we do today. And that enables us to have sort of this natural hedge, if you will, to currency pressures that are going to happen from one period to the next.","Dan Schulman","Thanks so much for that. And thanks everybody for joining us today, really appreciate your time. And we look forward to speaking with all of you soon. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's question-and-answer session. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference call. This concludes the program.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Ms. Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Gabrielle Rabinovitch","Thank you, Andrew. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal Holdings\u2019 earnings conference call for the third quarter of 2017. Joining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO; John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer; and Bill Ready, our Chief Operating Officer.","We\u2019re providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being webcast and both the presentation and call are available through the Investor Relations section of our website.","We will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about our company\u2019s performance. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call.","In addition, management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve risks and uncertainties.

We expressly disclaim any obligation to update the information.","With that, let me turn the call over to Dan.","Dan Schulman","Thank you, Gabrielle and thanks everyone for taking the time to join us today. I'm pleased to share that PayPal delivered what is perhaps our strongest quarter since our separation from eBay. Our revenues were up 22% on a currency neutral basis, coming in at 3.24 billion. Revenue growth accelerated for second consecutive quarter and was once again driven by strong PayPal core growth. ","We continued to drive operating leverage across multiple areas of our business. As a result, our non-GAAP operating income grew by 32%, while our operating income margin increased approximately 160 basis points from Q3, 2016. Consequently, we delivered $0.46 of non-GAAP EPS, up 31% versus last year. Free cash flow grew by 36% to a record 841 million in the quarter and it\u2019s worth noting that we now expect our free cash flow for the year to be greater than $3 billion. ","Our customer metrics, which include net new active accounts and engagement for active accounts were record setting. I pay particular attention to these measures as they represent a direct form of feedback on our value proposition, customer experiences and brand. We acquired 8.2 million net new active accounts this quarter. That is up almost 90% year-over-year and is a record number in our recent history. ","We ended the period with 218 million active customer accounts with over 200 million consumers now shopping at our more than 17 million merchants. We now expect we will acquire close to 30 million net new active accounts in 2017. Even with this record breaking net new active growth in our denominator, engagement per active account continues to improve, increasing to 32.8 times for the year, up from approximately 30 in the third quarter of 2016. ","The combination of our growing base and continued growth in engagement drove year-over-year total payment volume growth at swap rates of 30% in the period, sequentially accelerating 335 basis points from Q2. We generated $114 billion in payment volume. Our Merchant Services volume outside of eBay grew by 34%, as we continued to grow our market share. Mobile payments led our growth again, growing approximately 54% to $40 billion in the quarter. These positive trends are the direct result of investments made across the business. ","We've increased the availability of our platform and significantly improved our customer experience across an ever growing suite of products and services. Putting our customers first in everything we do and opening our platform to partners across the ecosystem has redefined our business model and our aspirations. Customer choice is one of the most visible examples of this, with approximately 20 million customers, engaging with our choice experience by actively choosing a funding option. ","We continue to see consistently positive results. Customers who use Choice have much higher engagement levels and tend to spend more per transaction. They have an increased appreciation for our value proposition and as a result, increased satisfaction levels. This naturally leads to a meaningful reduction of calls to our service centers and reduced churn levels. Our streamlined sign up process is generating more net new actives. And as is evidenced by our increasing OI margin, expenses are well within our expectations. ","Another measurable result from the improvements we've made in our core product experiences is the increasing value of the PayPal brand. Interbrand just named PayPal for the third year in a row as a top 100 global brand. In our first year as an independent company, we came in at number 97. Last year, we improved to number 90. This year, we were cited as one of the fastest rising brands, improving our brand rating by 10 spots to reach number 80 in the world. ","Cohn & Wolfe in their influential annual index of global brands ranked by consumer perception of authenticity saw PayPal jump by 20 spots to join Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Google as one of the top five most authentic brands in the world. Mobile is becoming the defining force in digital payments and it is a rapidly blurring the distinction between online and offline and accelerating the adoption of digital payments. ","PayPal\u2019s One Touch experience continues to set the standard in mobile check out conversion with almost two times the conversion rate of the industry average. We now have 70 million consumers who benefit from the speed inconvenience of a Single Touch checkout and over 6 million merchants around the world now offer this transformative checkout experience. As I mentioned earlier, we processed $40 billion of mobile transactions, accounting for 35% of our TPV in the quarter. ","Earlier this week, we announced that Venmo's broad and engaged base of millennial customers can now pay with Venmo at over 2 million PayPal merchants across the United States. This is an important milestone for us as we both add differentiated functionality for Venmo consumers and begin to monetize Venmo. Our existing PayPal merchants are also excited to offer Venmo as a way to pay on their sites. In fact, Venmo has prompted some of the largest and most influential merchants in the US to come to PayPal for the first time. ","In the quarter, we signed an agreement with the Williams-Sonoma Inc. brands to bring both Venmo and PayPal to their web and mobile properties in early 2018. That includes West Elm, Pottery Barn, Pottery Barn Kids and Williams-Sonoma. Our priority is to enrich and expand the Venmo experience, adding to the magic that has made Venmo a viral phenomenon. We are pleased that in the quarter, Venmo reported 9.4 billion of payment volume, growing 93% year-over-year. ","In addition, Venmo had its strongest net new active quarter in its history, demonstrating its growing popularity and its corresponding network effect. Our partnership strategy is a key pillar in our efforts to broaden the availability of PayPal. Combining with best of our platform capabilities and services with the best assets of some of the world's most popular brands enables us to offer our mutual consumers and merchants unparalleled value. We are very pleased to be building on these partnerships. ","In the quarter, we announced that consumers can now use PayPal on Nintendo gaming systems in 34 countries across North America, Europe and Asia. Microsoft announced that Skype users in 22 countries can use PayPal to send and receive money via the Skype mobile app. Mastercard announced the extension of our strategic relationship into markets around the globe. And we\u2019re very pleased to announce additional financial partnerships outside of the United States. ","We signed partnership agreements with Banorte in Mexico and Shinhan Card, the largest credit card issuer in South Korea that mirror our US partner agreements. Here in the US, more than 185 issuers are updating their PayPal experiences as part of our choice initiative. We continue to deepen our ever growing partnership with Facebook with new capabilities constantly being introduced. We firmly believe that great results come from doing the right things. This is fundamental to our values. ","We believe that access to innovative technology must be an engine of inclusion and opportunity around the world and we are deeply committed to advancing that goal. When hurricanes Irma, Harvey and Maria battered the United States and the Caribbean, earthquakes throughout Mexico and fire swept through Northern California, PayPal is quick to respond. Like many other generous organizations, we made direct donations to global and local agencies. With the power and reach of our platform also allows us to do more in times of crisis. ","We launched appeals to the PayPal community, agreed to cover the fees for donations, sponsored the hand-in-hand telethon and provided our fundraising platform to support many other appeals. In total, to date, we have helped to raise more than $55 million in donations to support the families and communities devastated by these natural disasters. Increasing inclusion and diversity inside our company is also a direct reflection of our values. ","I'm proud to report that the PayPal Board of Directors has now reached 45% gender and ethnic diversity, up from 20% at the start of the year. And our just released diversity and inclusion report showed significant progress in our percentage of female leaders, including a 20% increase in our female Vice Presidents. We also announced 100% pay equity across gender on a global basis and a 100% pay equity across ethnicity in the US. I'm pleased with our overall progress, but we obviously have so much more to accomplish. ","In many ways, we are just at the beginning of our journey. The world is rapidly accelerating to digital payments and we know that we have a tremendous opportunity in front of us and we have the ability to make a real difference to all the constituencies we serve. ","I would like to end my remarks by thanking the global PayPal team for their passion, focus and commitment to our customers and our shareholders.","And with that, I'll now turn the call over to John.","John Rainey","Thanks, Dan. We're reporting another solid quarter with results ahead of our expectations. Our operational metrics for the quarter in addition to the financial results that we delivered demonstrate the strength of our position as the world's largest open digital payments platform. There is great momentum in our business as we approach the end of 2017. ","First, I will walk you through the financial highlights for the third quarter, followed by a more detailed discussion of the drivers of our financial performance. And then I will provide a framework for how we\u2019re thinking about 2018.","For the third quarter, revenue was $3.24 billion, growing 21% on a spot basis and 22% on a currency neutral basis. Non-GAAP operating income grew 32% to $646 million and non-GAAP EPS grew 31% to $0.46. We generated more than $1 billion in operating cash flow and free cash flow grew 36% to $841 million. For the third quarter, our total payment volume was $114 billion, up 30% on a spot basis and 29% on a currency neutral basis, consisting of US payment volume growth of 31% and international volume growth of 27%. ","Our merchant services volume grew 34% on a currency neutral basis to $98.6 billion. This represented 86.5% of our total volume in the quarter. Volume associated with eBay represented 13.5% of the total compared to 16% for the third quarter of 2016 and 20% two years ago. P2P volume, which is a component of merchant services, grew 47% to $24 billion and represented approximately 21% of total payment volume. During the third quarter, growth in active accounts was 14% and we ended the quarter with 218 million customer accounts. ","Account growth was driven by the strength of our core PayPal business, followed by growth on the Venmo platform. Improvements to our on-boarding and checkout experiences and across our P2P flows enabled us to add 8.2 million new customer accounts, a record addition to our platform in a quarter. The number of payment transactions for active account on a trailing 12 month basis reached 32.8 with 7.2 billion transactions occurring on our payment platform over that period. ","In the third quarter, transactions grew 26% to 1.9 billion. Revenue grew 21% on a spot basic in Q3. US revenue grew 21% versus Q3 \u201916 and international revenues grew 22% year-over-year on a currency neutral basis. In the third quarter, we saw strong revenue growth across all key geographies. At the same time, there was a partially offsetting impact from our hedging program, as we recognized $13 million in hedge losses versus a gain of $28 million last year, resulting in a headwind of more than $40 million in the period. ","In the third quarter, transaction revenue grew 22% and revenues from other value added services grew 15%. Transaction revenue growth was driven by our core PayPal and BrainTree businesses and revenue from other value added services was driven by credit. For Q3, our transaction take rate was 2.48%, a decline of 16 basis points from the third quarter of 2016 and our total take rate was 2.84%, down 21 basis points year-over-year. ","In recent quarters, our take rate declines have compressed and the pressure on our take rate has been predominantly driven by growth in P2P. While this was the largest single contributor to the take rate decline in the third quarter, we also saw increased pressure from our hedge loss, from lower growth in credit revenue and from the inclusion of TIO Networks in our results. Volume based expenses grew 33% in Q3. ","Transaction expense was $1.1 billion and represented 97 basis points of TPV, consistent with our expectations that we would see less pressure in Q3 relative to the first and second quarters of 2017. Transaction loss in the quarter was $219 million or 19 basis points of TPV, an increase of 1 basis point versus the same period a year ago. Loan losses across our consumer and merchant credit products were $144 million, representing 26% growth in line with the growth of our receivables portfolio. ","Our consumer credit portfolio continues to perform in line with our expectations. The net charge-off rate was 6.4% in the third quarter. We ended the quarter with an aggregate gross receivables balance, including both principal and interest of $6.7 billion in our consumer and merchant loan portfolios and a total reserve of $424 million. We continue to see excellent results in managing the cost of our business. ","In the third quarter, other operating expenses increased only 4.8% to $1.1 billion, growing at less than a quarter of the rate of growth of revenue. The slower rate of growth in non-volume based expenses drove 550 basis points of operating leverage versus Q3 \u201916 and represent 35% of total revenue. Normalizing for the acquisitions of TIO Networks, and Swift Financial, other operating expenses increased only 3.5%. Considering we grew revenue by more than 20%, this is exceptional performance. ","We're managing costs very efficiently, allowing us to deliver better cost performance, relative to our expectations, while at the same time, investing in our growth initiatives. Consistent with the first half of the year, other operating expenses increased $0.09 for every incremental dollar of revenue, demonstrating the scalability of our platform. Year-to-date, we have consistently demonstrated our ability to scale with minimal incremental cost. Strong revenue growth and cost discipline resulted in record non-GAAP operating income and EPS growth. ","Non-GAAP operating income grew 32% to $646 million and operating margin expanded approximately 160 basis points to 20% compared to Q3 \u201916. GAAP operating income grew 22% in the third quarter to $423 million with an operating margin of 13%, flat to last year. Non-GAAP EPS grew 31% in the third quarter to $0.46 and GAAP EPS grew 17% to $0.31. The hurricanes in the southeast also affected our performance in the quarter. Waiving late fees and increasing reserves for our credit customers had an approximate $0.01 per share impact on our results. ","We ended Q3 with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $7 billion. Strong cash earnings generation resulted in 36% growth in free cash flow year-over-year. Our free cash flow for the third quarter was $841 million, representing $0.26 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue. Third quarter capital expenditures were $165 million or approximately 5% of revenue. We also funded two acquisitions during the third quarter, as the TIO Networks and Swift Financial transactions closed in July and September respectively. ","Capital return continues to be a core component of our overall capital allocation strategy. And year-to-date, we\u2019ve returned more than $700 million to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases. We now have approximately $300 million remaining on our original $2 billion authorization, after which time, we will begin buying back stock under the $5 billion authorization that was approved earlier this year. Our business generates significant cash flow and we will continue to take a long term view of capital allocation to maximize value creation, while optimizing our capital structure and investing for growth. ","I would now like to discuss our updated guidance for the fourth quarter of 2017 and the full year as well as our initial thoughts on 2018. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $3.57 billion to $3.63 billion or 20% to 22% growth on a currency neutral basis. We also expect non-GAAP earnings of $0.50 to $0.52 per share. I\u2019d also like to give you some detail on how we're thinking about other operating expense growth in the fourth quarter. ","Our current plans contemplate discretionary investments and product development and sales and marketing in the fourth quarter that are over and above our current trend and will result in elevated growth in other OpEx, relative to the first three quarters of 2017. Importantly, these investments will benefit our results in 2018. For the full year, we expect other operating expenses to grow in the mid single digits. ","We now expect revenue for 2017 to be in the range of $12.92 billion to $12.98 billion or 20% to 21% growth on a currency neutral basis. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $1.86 to $1.88. In addition, given the strong free cash flow that we have generated all year, we now expect free cash flow for the full year to exceed $3 billion. We're also reaffirming our prior full year 2017 guidance on CapEx of approximately 5% of revenue and a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 17.5% to 18.5%. ","We are still in our planning process for 2018, but I'd like to provide you with an initial framework for how we\u2019re thinking about our business next year. We are planning for payment volume on a spot basis to grow at a rate -- in the range of mid to high 20%. Also, on a spot basis, we expect approximately 20% growth in both revenue and non-GAAP operating income with our GAAP operating margin expanding in line with non-GAAP operating margin. ","This view incorporates our initial integration and investment assumptions for the acquisitions of TIO Networks and Swift Financial, offset by modest operating margin expansion in the rest of our business. As we have not yet announced our plans for consumer credit as they relate to pursuing a more asset light approach, our initial framework for 2018 does not incorporate the financial impact of this initiative. ","Our process is on track and we're in ongoing negotiations and at the current pace, we expect to announce the deal towards the end of the year. We're committed to structuring the best partnership for PayPal that will create the most shareholder value over the long term. We\u2019ll provide additional detail on our outlook for 2018 when we announce our plans for consumer credit. ","As we reflect on the first three quarters of 2017, we're very encouraged by our performance and the opportunities ahead. This year, we have accelerated our revenue growth and earnings growth and generated record free cash flow. We're building superior experiences for our consumers and merchants. ","The sustained momentum we see in the business gives us the confidence to invest in high potential areas such as Venmo and PayPal working capital. We\u2019re extremely pleased with our progress and I also want to thank all PayPal\u2019s customers and our colleagues worldwide for making this another outstanding quarter.","With that, let me turn it back over to the operator for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Jason Kupferberg","So just wanted to ask a question, if we go back to the Analyst Day in 2016, you guys had indicated at that point that the credit business was about almost 10% of revenue and a little bit more than that as a percentage of operating profit. So I wanted to see if those numbers are still valid today. And then just related, can you give us an idea of what percent of your operating profit currently comes from eBay.","Bill Ready","Sure, Jason. I'll take that. So the way you think about credit is, it has more or less grown in line with the rest of our business since we gave that guidance at that point in time. Credit represented - depending upon the quarter about 2% or 2.5% of TPV. And that was the case when we gave that guidance on revenue and profit at that Analyst Day. So it's fair to conclude that it represents a similar portion today. To be clear on asset-light, what we'd like to do is continue to very much be in the credit business for our merchants and our consumers and provide all of the benefit that they derive from that. But we can do that in a much more asset-light way where we can free up that capital to utilize for other maybe seemingly higher turning alternatives. At the same point in time we would continue to share in the economics of that business if we were to elect to pursue a partnership type of arrangement there.","And then the second part of your question was eBay. eBay - we hadn\u2019t disclosed what percentage of our business that represents in terms of profit. As I said in my prepared remarks, we've - that's about 13.5% of our volume today that\u2019s come down from 20% just a couple of years ago. And whether it's TPV or revenue what you've seen is that that declined 300 to 400 basis points each year in terms of the percentage of our overall volume in the business and revenue in the business in this case maybe.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of James Fawcett with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","James Fawcett","I just had a question on account adds those have been very strong 30 million or 25 expectation. What's driving that strength and how much benefit are you getting from recent partnerships and I guess a little color on how many accounts has Venmo have and how is that growth versus the core PayPal? Thanks.","Dan Schulman","This is Dan, I\u2019ll take that question and Bill you can jump in on this. So this is not any one thing that\u2019s driving our growth, it\u2019s multiple initiates that we\u2019ve launched. In general as we get bigger we\u2019re seeing a network effect start to take haul, we have over 17 million merchants on a network now, now over 200 million consumers and there is distinctly a network effect. We've also seen all the core experiences that Bill and his team and others in the company that worked on whether that be availability, latency, One Touch, choice, our new mobile app out there that are all kind of bending multi-year curves now with all of our product curves bending upwards reversing a many year trend line that we had before. That\u2019s reducing churn and also attracting a lot of new customers. We\u2019ve got a bunch of new products out there right now from bill pay to international remittances to new services on P2P, new flows on P2P and so those are driving a ton of net new adds as well.","Really interesting thing right now is obviously choice has streamlined the sign-up process and we\u2019re seeing good benefit from that. But I would say on the partnership front, we are at the very beginning of that. There is much more ahead of us than behind us. We've had some marketing campaign launched within financial institutions to drive card linking to PayPal, but the vast majority of that is still ahead us. In terms of the ratios of Venmo to the core, we never really announced those specifically. What I would say again as I said in my remarks is Venmo had a record net new active quarter. But the core had an even stronger, a record net new actives. So you see more than a majority coming from core PayPal as opposed to Venmo on this. Anything else, Bill, you'd add. Hope that answers your question, James.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now.","Heath Terry","Wondering if you can kind of give us a bit of a sense as you sign more and more merchants up to the platform. Kind of where you are both from a partnership and a technology standpoint on in-store transactions. And then one just sort of quick follow-up on the comments that were made around transactional margins, you called out several things that are sort of driving the modest pressure that we're seeing there. Unless I missed it, funding mix wasn't one of them. Given what you're seeing in choice, I'm assuming that was intentional, but just wanted to confirm.","Dan Schulman","So you have a couple of questions there, Heath, as usual we respect. So let met talk a little bit about some of our purchase, turn it over to Bill and then John will address the last part of your question. So, we are increasingly turning from being a product company into a platform company and what we mean by that is we\u2019re moving well beyond just check out as a button to really offering a full suite of capabilities and services that enable merchants to move into digital commerce to take advantage of mobile which is something every single one of our retailers from small merchants to the very largest are thinking about right now. Because the face of commerce is rapidly changing driven by mobile, and mobile as I mentioned is blurring that distinction between online and offline. Because it\u2019s blurring that distinction our platform capabilities are increasingly omni in nature.","Now one of the things that still ahead of us and one of the things that accrued to us as part of our network agreement that we had with Mastercard and Visa and Discover as well as all of our relationships with financial institutions is access to tokens. We're not going to do bespoke customization coming into the offline world, but we can use industry standard tokenization and add that capability into our app which we expect to do next year to start to move into the offline marketplace. Again, we think that a lot of what\u2019s going to happen at offline will be value proposition driven not form factor driven. But our PayPal digital wallet will have the ability for somebody to use their mobile phone eventually at a point of sale expect NFC solutions. Bill, anything you\u2019d add on top of that.","Bill Ready","I would just say on in-store one of the fantastic things that\u2019s happening on top of what Dan was describing where we have great partnerships both with networks as well as Google and Android Pay and Vodafone and others that allow us to do in-store point of sale. We\u2019re also seeing just amazing momentum on e-commerce style experiences coming into the store, which really plays to our strengths. So things like buy online pick up in-store, you can witness in most major retailers around the country are starting to carve off sections of the stores that are specifically devoted to buy online pick up in-store as you see more and more of that happening. That\u2019s really home field advantage for us that we are becoming the primary way that consumers think about accessing great new digital experiences like that. So we certainly see growth across the board in mobile, but this is a really interesting area for us where we see mobile starting to really come into the stores to buy online pick up in-store and those types of things in addition to the way that folks thought about it traditionally of using the mobile device at point of sale where you\u2019ve got great partnerships as Dan describes that help get us into those.","John Rainey","And Heath, this is John, just on the last part of your question with respect to transaction expense. You\u2019re right, while it\u2019s a small year-over-year increase. This was down on a unit basis in terms of TPV from what we saw in the first half of year. And we indicated that would be the case. At 97 bps this quarter, it\u2019s down from the high watermark of 100 bps in the second quarter. It\u2019s a result of couple of things. But one we talked about before as our customers are opting into choice. There is much more balance across the various funding instruments that they choose than what our initial expectations were. At the same point in time with great growth on platforms like Venmo, which come at a very low expense rate that actually helps suppress the rate of growth in that unit level. A good way to think about this even going to the fourth quarter and into 2018 is this is more or less for that period of time the level that we expect. I did note again 100 basis points was the - at least the high watermark for the foreseeable future for us in this areas. So we expect to contain the inflation in this area going forward.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is now open.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Dan, during the quarter there were some press articles implying you guys were on the lookout for acquisitions. I know you made a bunch already, but I assume you might have been talking about something larger or more transformative. Could you just talk about where you guys might feel like you lack and some areas that you're looking at in size. Thanks.","Dan Schulman","So yeah I did read some of those articles that were out there. Look I start off by saying that I really need pleased and I'm happy with the set of assets and capabilities we have today. We've got a leading market position in those. I feel really good about where we stand. We have a very robust product pipeline and roadmap. And we're ready with the assets we have to compete as a leader in the market today. I think we're playing from a position of strength as we go into the market and look at what\u2019s available. Obviously we have a very strong balance sheet and it's a potential weapon for us as we think about competing going forward. We\u2019ve got some $7 billion on our balance sheet. As John mentioned over $3 billion of free cash flow that we\u2019ll have this year. And our intention is to stay acquisitive and be a consolidator in the industry. We look at hundreds of opportunities every single quarter from small investments we make in some interesting start ups to much larger. And we look at the whole gamut of that.","Now the criteria we look at this it got to fit into the vision and mission that we've set out for ourselves, it needs to accelerate our progress, I\u2019m going to talk about that in a second, across key vertical like a Bill Pay would be an example of that, a geography or some technology that could be a security bolt-o something like that helps our platform overall. And we look at all of that through the lens of build, partner and buy. And on the build side as I\u2019ve not mentioned before and Bill has talked about, we are so much more productive and innovative internally than we've ever been before. We had something like 300% increase in releases that we're doing now in what used to be a necessity for us to buy several years ago to innovate. Is now quite well covered by what we built internally.","The other thing obviously is we've created a fundamentally different technological architecture an open-platform that allow us to partner in ways that we've never been able to go do before and so there used to be capabilities we need that now we can merge the assets of a partner into our platform and vice a versa without needing to acquire. And then obviously there's buying. And as I mentioned we look at that across the world and at all levels of different investment that we might make on that. But we're very disciplined in a way we look at that. Honestly we don't mind if it\u2019s small or a large acquisition but it\u2019s got to make sense to us on the criteria that aligned above and it\u2019s got to make sense to us from a cost basis. And so you can expect us to be acquisitive, but in a disciplined and thoughtful manner.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Bryan Keane","Just wanted to ask on the 2018 guidance. Does that include any Venmo monetization and if not, how are you thinking about that the size and timing of the Venmo monetization opportunity. And then just a quick on \u201918, the \u201918 numbers, does it include and how much FX and acquisitions? Thanks.","John Rainey","Bryan, it\u2019s John. Good to speak with you. We do have some modest assumptions about monetizing Venmo going into next year. We\u2019re courage by the launch of Pay with Venmo with 2 million merchants right now. We\u2019ll continue to expand that. But as we said before this is has been an area of investment for us. We're looking forward to being able to monetize this. But we've got pretty measures expectations around this. So we don't want to get too far out in front of ourselves. This is a pretty precious experience. So we\u2019re going to make sure that we get it right. And so given in the guidance that we gave approximately 20% revenue growth and 20% earnings growth that does include some assumptions about Venmo. But this is a leg of growth for us, profitable growth into the future. And we've got a multi-year outlook on what this will be. In terms of the guidance that we gave with respect to FX that basically assume the currency environment that we're in right now. That answers your question.","Bryan Keane","And then acquisitions, is there any acquisitions in that?","John Rainey","No, that\u2019s an organic assumption say for the two acquisitions that we already acquired in the third quarter this year.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Bob Napoli with William Blair. Your line is now open.","Bob Napoli","The actives, want to dig in that a little bit more. Dan, when you - John, Bill, when you guys spun off you were targeting 3 to 5 million net new ads per quarter and obviously you haven't updated that guidance and that guidance is old. The 8 million the new substantial ramp up, how much of that is from customer choice. I think John you had said at one point there were a million customers a month that were signing up and not activating because - you thought because they didn't - you didn't have customer choice. How much of that is coming from customer choice and what is - going into next year, where there some low hanging fruit this year that we should see a big [indiscernible] in active account growth going into next year.","Dan Schulman","I\u2019ll start off and then it over to either John or Bill as we go into this. So obviously we hit a different level in terms of acquisition and that 3 to 5 million is outdated. We did talk about this year that we expect to acquire close to 30 million net new actives. A part of that is driven by choice and a part of it is driven by new experiences, our P2P flows, reduction in churn that\u2019s going on. So there is really not one thing that I would point to, you are right, we were losing out on a million or so activations a month that had put in a funding instrument but did not do a transaction with us because we also asked for additional information post that and that's not occurring right now. So I think we are at a different level in terms of the net new actives going forward. We\u2019ll update that as we look at updating our overall 2018 guidance for you. So stay tuned on that but obviously 3 to 5 million is an old number now.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Your line is now.","Tien-tsin Huang","Just one last, Bill, just on Braintree performance and maybe give us an update on when share there anything new on PayPal share, a checkout or on the merchant ads side is that still primarily be driven by Braintree or core PayPal, has that mix changed? Thanks.","Dan Schulman","We continue to see great performance across our merchant segments. Braintree continues to perform really well in line with what we discussed previously. And share of checkout driven by One Touch and industry leading conversion rate in addition to us having strong consumer growth, our share of checkout continues to increase. When you look at our merchant services volume growth that is significantly beyond the growth of the e-commerce industry which means that we continue to take share. And that taking of share is both in new merchant sign-ups that are really across small businesses, mid-market as well as a large enterprise, so across every segment we continue to add merchant. And then within each of those merchants we continue to see expansion of our share of checkout as consumers more and more gravitate towards PayPal given that we have conversion rate that is nearly twice that of entering a card and online. So it's broad-based across those but we see each of those segments performing well inclusive of the Braintree segment.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller with Barclays. Your line is now.","Darrin Peller","Just if we could follow up quickly on the outlook for \u201818. Maybe John if you could touch on pricing and how that's going highs. Some of the updates you're doing now and then what\u2019s included in that and your outlook. And then really just on top of that your guidance on margins, I just want to make sure we're clear on it. Now you\u2019re talking about it being in line with GAAP operating income growth which it sounded like was also 20% I think among revenue growth. I mean is that - what is the margin expectation, your expansion or anything impacting next year versus this year. Thanks.","Dan Schulman","First on pricing, as you are aware we've made a few different price changes this year positive and negative, try to optimize for certain corridors where we operate. But the main thing to take away from pricing is that we want to price in areas to where we can clearly attribute that price to value that\u2019s being added to the customers experience. And so to your question about whether that assumes anything in 2018, yes it does. This is a pricing in any business is an ongoing driver of value that you need to be responsive to the broader market and competitive set in which you operate. So we've seen some benefit from that in 2017 and we would expect that to continue not only in 2018, but into further years. On the second part of your question, with respect to margin expectations in 2018.","We do still expect to have sort of the same guidance that we said before as stable to growing operating margins and that\u2019s whether you're talking about 2018 or the next few years after that. As I noted in my prepared remarks we are integrating to acquisitions next year. And so there's always integration and investment around that. If you were to normalize for that, you would certainly see that organically there is margin expansion in the business. And importantly as I noted in my remarks and has been quite a focus this year that the GAAP operating margin is also expanding in line with non-GAAP operating margin next year. Again some of the changes that we made with respect to share-based compensation this year we said were specific to this year, we do not expect that to continue at that level in the future.","Gabrielle Rabinovitch","Okay. Our last question please operator.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of George Mihalos with Cowen. Your line is now open.","George Mihalos","If I could just ask a question around Pay with Venmo from a margin perspective. If we think about the funding sources there and I know you guys are encouraging people linking credit cards to the Venmo wallet. But a substantial portion of that is still going to be funded through sort of cash on hand. Is there any reason why we shouldn't think that Pay with Venmo won't be accretive to your overall transaction margin and not sure if you're willing to provide any color as to how much of an uplift that might provide for \u201918. Thank you.","Bill Ready","I\u2019ll describe Pay with Venmo with a little more detail. One of the beautiful things about what we have done with the Pay with Venmo deployment is that we're making that automatically available to PayPal merchants over the same distribution rail that we used to have such a rapid deployment of PayPal One Touch. And so while that makes it really easy for the merchant to adopt and really easy for the consumer to have more places to use it, it means that those merchants are accepting Venmo on the exact same terms that they would accept PayPal. So our revenue on those transactions when somebody uses Venmo to pay at one of those PayPal merchants, our revenue on that transaction would be exactly the same as if that user had paid with PayPal. As you rightly noted Venmo tends toward predominantly lower cost funding instruments so the cost of those transactions it would be reasonable to assume is going to less than the average across the PayPal base. And so I think your assumptions there are directionally correct. We are not providing guidance on how much of that or any of those types of things. But at a unit level you're exactly right that is the same revenue per transaction for us but with a wallet that is loaded with on average lower cost funding instruments for us.","Dan Schulman","Thank you, George, for that question, and thank you everyone for joining us today. We really appreciate your time and we look forward to speaking to all of you soon. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. And you may all disconnect. Everyone, enjoy the rest of your afternoon."],"16905":["PayPal Holdings, Inc.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Gabrielle Rabinovitch","Thank you, Sheri. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal Holdings' earnings call for the third quarter 2018. Joining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO; John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer and EVP, Global Customer Operations; and Bill Ready, our EVP, Chief Operating Officer.","We are providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being webcast and both the presentation and call are available through the Investor Relations section of our website. We will discuss some non-GAAP measures in talking about our company's performance. You can find the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call.","In addition, management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties. These statements include our guidance for fourth quarter and full year 2018, our initial outlook for 2019, our medium-term guidance and the impact and timing of our acquisitions. Our actual results may differ materially from these statements. You can find more information about risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect our results in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC and available on the Investor Relations section of our website.","You should not rely on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today's date, October 18, 2018. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update the information.","With that, let me turn the call over to Dan.","Dan Schulman","Thank you, Gabrielle, and thanks everyone for joining us. PayPal had another excellent quarter with $3.68 billion of revenue growing at 14% on both, the spot and currency neutral basis. Normalizing through the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables to Synchrony revenues grew at 21%. Our non-GAAP operating margin of 21.4% grew 142 basis points from last year, and we delivered $0.58 of non-GAAP EPS, up 26% year-over-year. In short, we continue to drive strong financial performance.","As pleased as I am with our financials, the highlight of the quarter was our growth in net new actives and engagement. We drove a record 9.1 million net new active accounts surpassing 254 million customer accounts by the end of the quarter. We added 34 million net new actives to our platform in the past 12 months, averaging almost 3 million net new customers per month. During the quarter we drove 2.5 billion transactions growing 27%. Our engagement per active user increased 9.5% to 36.5x per year. A major driver of engagement is the use of mobile devices across our platform. Predominantly driven by our market leading checkout conversion rates with One Touch. One Touch continues to expand with 112 million consumers and 10.4 million merchants using One Touch. In Q3, we saw mobile growth of 45% with approximately 57 billion of mobile volume processed in the quarter. Mobile checkout now represents 40% of our total payment volume.","Customer choice also continues to yield a meaningful lift in our engagement metrics. Today, nearly all of our customers have choice available to them, and more than 55 million PayPal customers have actively used choice in some 200 markets. Another very important outcome of choice was that it enabled PayPal to develop deep partnerships throughout our ecosystem. In just over two years we've signed over 35 partnerships with some of the world's largest and most influential brands in finance, in technology and commerce. Today, I'm very pleased to announce that we've signed a multi-faceted partnership agreement with American Express. As one of the leading brands in the world it always made sense that PayPal and American Express would become strategic partners. Steve Squeri and his team have been great to work with, and I'm very pleased with the comprehensive nature of our partnership going forward.","Over the next several quarters PayPal will have enhanced access to American Express as a payment option in our wallet. The agreement will allow PayPal to access American Express tokens and enables a deep integration of our Venmo and PayPal P2P capabilities within the Amex platform.","Additionally, PayPal and American Express consumers will be able to use their American Express reward points to pay for their purchases at millions of PayPal merchants around the world. Over the next year we will rollout these capabilities to our mutual customers and we are pleased to begin what will be an important relationship for both companies. With this agreement we now have strategic relationships in place with all of the major card networks, not only have these partnerships redefined our competitive landscape, they have also created new and unique commerce experiences for our mutual customers around the world.","Most of you on the call know that we also recently announced a significant and growing partnership with Walmart. Working together, Walmart and PayPal have developed innovative new product experiences to create a more affordable and convenient way for the unbanked segment of customers to more efficiently manage and move their money; and as a result, empowering more people to gain access to the digital economy. As part of this deep collaboration, PayPal money services will be available at all Walmart locations in the U.S. beginning in November. Using the PayPal mobile app customers can easily load cash into their PayPal balance, and for the first time customers can withdraw money from their PayPal balance at Walmart retail stores and Walmart money centers across the country. Additionally, customers can use the PayPal cash master card to shop in store on mobile and online at Walmart, as well as withdraw cash at the register or from Walmart's ATM locations nationwide. And this is just the beginning, we are currently working hand-in-hand with the Walmart team to introduce even more capabilities in the future.","Walmart and PayPal share the belief that managing and moving money should be affordable, accessible, efficient and secure for all segments of our population. And while digital and mobile commerce continues to grow at remarkable rates, there are tens of millions of people that still do not have access to the benefits of the digital economy. This partnership which leverages and combines the unique strengths of both our companies is aimed at addressing that issue.","We also continue to grow our partnerships around the globe. For instance, we are pleased to announce that we have finalized a strategic partnership with Ita\u00fa Unibanco, one of the largest banks in Brazil. With this agreement we add another major issuing partner in Latin America to help drive digital spend and improve convenience for our joint customers.","We continue to work closely with our large merchant partners. We recently struck a comprehensive strategic agreement with Chevron to improve the payment experience at it's gas stations in the U.S. Together we plan to launch a new mobile payment app in early 2019 that will reduce the amount of time that a customer spends at the pump. This is yet another example of how we are using PayPal's extensive platform capabilities to help our partners create differentiated customer experiences. Chevron joins the list of our existing partnerships in this industry including Shell, B.P. and Exxon Mobil.","In addition to all the progress we've made in forging new partnerships, this was an extremely busy period for our product development teams as we brought several new products to market and we saw significant advances across a wide array of Venmo monetization efforts. I'm especially pleased with the strong overall momentum surrounding Venmo. For the third quarter in a row Venmo posted yet again another record for net new actives. This is driving accelerating network effects as volume groups 78% to $16.7 billion with an annualized run rate now approaching $70 billion. And while it is still early, our monetization efforts appear to be reaching a tipping point. 24% of Venmo users have now participated in a monetizable action; this is up from 17% one quarter ago and 13% in May of this year. Pay with Venmo monthly active users increased approximately 185% month-over-month in September versus August. And across the Uber and Uber Eats apps, we saw more than 300% month-over-month volume growth in September versus August.","Our Venmo cart is also off to a strong start with approximately 320% month-over-month growth in monthly active users from August to September. Notably, the two top purchase category since launch for our card are supermarkets and restaurants. These daily used cases demonstrate that we are rapidly gaining omnichannel ubiquity and becoming a part of our Venmo customers every day spend. Finally, last month alone we processed over $1 billion in instant transfer volume on the Venmo platform alone.","In summary, I couldn't be more pleased with the customer adoption across our Venmo initiatives. This quarter we addressed one of the biggest issues facing small businesses; the amount of time it takes for them to access cash from their sales. The launch of Funds Now gives PayPal merchants, who are in good standing, access to their sales within minutes at no extra cost by eliminating holds, delays and reserves; we are providing our merchants immediate access to the funds they need to invest back into their business, pay their bills, and service their customers. We aspire to set a new standard in payments that immediate access to fund should be the norm rather than the exception for small businesses in good standing. We are pleased to say that over 1 million merchants across the globe are already taking advantage of Funds Now.","Another way we are helping merchants to expand their sales opportunities is through the rollout of PayPal checkout with smart payment buttons. The new PayPal checkout improves the purchase experience by dynamically presenting the most relevant payment methods to each shopper, including PayPal, PayPal credit, Venmo in a wide range of alternative payment methods around the world. This means businesses don't need to clutter their checkout pages, and shoppers see the options they would be most likely to use which is proven to increase conversion for our merchant customers; and we're currently deploying this innovative checkout experience globally.","A little more than a year ago we acquired Swift Financial to bolster the financing options for small and mid-sized businesses. Our PayPal business financing solutions which includes PayPal working capital and PayPal business loans provided our customers more than $1 billion in funding last quarter. This more than doubles the $480 million in funding in the same period last year. We believe we are now one of the Top 5 providers of working capital to small businesses in the U.S. We will continue to leverage acquisitions to strengthen our two-sided platform and maintain our position as the leading global open platform for digital payments.","Last month we closed our acquisition of iZettle, strengthening our global platform capabilities and in-store presence. We believe this acquisition provides significant value for our small business merchants as we expand our point-of-sale capabilities globally. We expect to close the acquisition of Hyperwallet this quarter and we're excited to extend it's enhanced global payout capabilities to our marketplace customers.","Before I turn the call over to John for more details on our financial results, I want to say how proud I am of the PayPal team and their efforts to provide ever increasing value for our customers. As proof of that, Interbrand recently announced that PayPal had increased it's brand value by 22% in the last year, making us one of the Top 6 fastest growing brands in the world. These kinds of results are what create sustainable and long-term value for our shareholders.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to John.","John Rainey","Thanks, Dan. PayPal had another solid quarter in Q3, both, financially and operationally. Our targeted growth strategies and investments to strengthen both, the merchant and consumer sides of our platform continue to drive strong financial results. Our consistent growth in active accounts, payment volume, engagement in revenue demonstrates the power and resiliency of our business. In addition, our growth in operating income while at the same time delivering operating margin expansion highlights the scalability of our model. In the third quarter, we not only expanded our operating margin but also reinvested to grow users, volume and revenue.","Before I go into our financial results, I'd like to provide a few highlights from the quarter. As a reminder, the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables to Synchrony closed in early July. Where relevant, I will provide normalized results for comparability. In addition, our acquisition of iZettle closed in late September. Our Q3 operating metrics and financial results include no impact from this transaction. Revenue grew approximately 21% in Q3 adjusting for the sale of our U.S. consumer credit portfolio. Operating income grew 22% with 142 basis points of operating margin expansion. Non-GAAP earnings per share grew 26%. And on a normalized basis, we generated $0.21 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue.","Turning to our financial performance for the quarter; total payment volume was $143 billion, an increase of 24% at spot, and 25% on a currency neutral basis. In comparison to the third quarter of 2017, on a spot basis we experienced more than five points of pressure from the lapping of TIO Networks and as a result of a stronger dollar. U.S. payment volume growth was 27% and international payment volume growth was 22% on a currency neutral basis. Merchant services volume was $127 billion, growing 28% on a currency neutral basis, and volume associated with eBay grew 3%. For the quarter, eBay related volume represented 11% of volume on our platform, down from 20% three years ago. This is a continuation of a multi-year trend and this quarter our merchant services volume grew more than 8x faster than our eBay marketplaces volume.","P2P volume which is part of merchant services grew 50% to $36 billion and represented approximately 25% of total payment volume versus 21% last year. We ended the quarter with 254 million active customer accounts adding 9.1 million net new customer accounts. Q3 represents the fourth consecutive quarter with 15% growth in total active accounts demonstrating the success of our customer-centric model and the continued demand for our industry-leading payment solutions. Account growth in the third quarter was driven by core PayPal followed by Venmo.","In the third quarter we continue to see strong momentum in engagement on our platform. Payment transactions per active account increased 9.5% to 36.5% versus 33.3% in the third quarter last year. And transactions grew 27% to 2.5 billion. Over the last 12 months we have processed more than 9.2 billion transactions. Revenue in the third quarter increased 14% on both the spot and currency neutral basis to $3.7 billion. However this growth was affected by the sale of our U.S. consumer credit receivables to Synchrony which had about a 7-point impact. Adjusting for the sale, revenue growth would have been approximately 21% inline with the third quarter last year.","On a spot basis, transaction revenue grew 17% in the quarter and revenue from other value-added services declined 11%. I'd like to give additional color on the trends in transaction revenue growth. In comparison to Q3 '17 the stronger U.S. dollar, softness in our eBay business, and the lapping of TIO Networks affected our year-over-year revenue comparisons. While the stronger dollar and ongoing pressure on our eBay marketplaces business had an impact on our quarterly results, our diversified portfolio, both from a geographic and a product perspective allowed us to continue to deliver solid revenue growth. The 11% year-over-year decline in revenue from other value-added services was a result of the sale of the U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio to Synchrony. This overall decline was partially offset by solid growth in both our merchant working capital and international consumer credit businesses.","For the third quarter, our transaction take rate was 2.34%, a decline of 14 basis points from last year. Approximately two-thirds of the change in transaction take rate was related to growth in P2P, the remainder was related to slower growth in eBay and lower cross-border volume. In Q3 total take rate was 2.58% versus 2.81% in Q3 '17. The sale of the U.S. consumer credit portfolio resulted in a 16 basis point reduction in total take rate; this was the largest single driver of the overall decline and reduces comparability to prior periods. We expect this impact to continue for the next three quarters.","Volume based expenses increased 13% in Q3 to $1.7 billion. Transaction expense was $1.4 billion and represented 96 basis points as a rate of TPV which was flat to last year and a 2 basis point improvement sequentially. Transaction loss was $259 million or 18 basis points as a rate of TPV versus 19 basis points in Q3 '17 and Q2 '18. Improvements from both core and Venmo helped to drive these results. Loan loss was $36 million or 3 basis points as a rate of TPV, down 75% year-over-year, again due to the sale of the U.S. consumer credit portfolio. Transaction margin dollars grew 14% to $2 billion with a transaction margin rate of 55%. Non-transaction related expenses grew 9% in the third quarter to $1.2 billion. As a percentage of total revenue, these expenses leveraged 130 basis points versus the third quarter last year.","Normalizing for acquisitions and cost directly related to the sell for Synchrony, non-transaction related expenses grew approximately 6% year-over-year. Again, this demonstrates our sustainability to scale our platform at a low marginal cost. This performance drove 22% growth in operating income and 142 basis points of operating margin expansion. We continue to balance delivering operating margin expansion with reinvesting back into the business to further strengthen our platform and competitive positioning. Solid topline growth in conjunction with OpEx discipline resulted in 26% growth in non-GAAP EPS to $0.58.","We ended the quarter with cash, cash equivalents and investments of $10.5 billion in short-term borrowings of $2 billion. On a reported basis, our free cash flow was $4.4 billion, adjusting for the Synchrony proceeds our free cash flow in the third quarter was $772 million; this equates to $0.21 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue. Our business delivered strong growth, robust profitability and consistent free cash flow; this enables us to make significant organic and inorganic investments for our future growth while at the same time returning cash to our shareholders. In May, we announced our plans to return approximately 40% to 50% of free cash flow to shareholders over the next five years. In Q3 we returned $600 million, and year-to-date we have returned nearly $3 billion.","I would now like to discuss or updated guidance for the fourth quarter of 2018 and the full year, as well as our initial thoughts of 2019. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $4.195 billion to $4.275 billion or 13% to 15% growth on a currency neutral basis. Normalizing for the U.S. credit receivable sale, the implied revenue growth rate would be 20% to 22% for the fourth quarter. This guidance incorporates approximately $30 million of impact from changes in foreign currency and a later close in Q4 than we previously expected for the Hyperwallet acquisition, as well as anticipated softness in our eBay marketplaces business.","We are raising our non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $0.65 to $0.67. Our EPS expectations include a higher than normal below the line benefit. We are electing to opportunistically reinvest some of this benefit back into the business which will offset some of the natural leverage we realized from efficiencies of scale. We believe this is the right decision to drive long-term value for PayPal. For full year revenue guidance, we are raising the low-end and maintaining the high-end of our previous range which absorbs the $30 million headwind from U.S. dollar strength and the Hyperwallet timing. We now expect 2018 revenue to be in the range of $15.42 billion to $15.5 billion or 17% to 18% growth on a currency neutral basis. Normalizing for the sale to Synchrony, the implied revenue growth rate would be approximately 21% for the full year.","We are raising our non-GAAP earnings per share guidance to $2.38 to $2.40. In addition, given the strong free cash flow we have generated all year, as well as the Synchrony proceeds; we now expect free cash flow for the full year to exceed $4.5 billion. We are still in our planning process for 2019 but I'd like to provide you with an initial framework for how we're thinking about our business next year.","We expect revenue to grow approximately 17% on a currency neutral basis. This growth rate reflects the reduction in other value-added services revenue in the first half of 2019 as a result of the sale of the U.S. consumer credit portfolio. Normalizing for this, our expectation is that revenue would be growing in the range of 20% to 21%. In addition, we expect non-GAAP EPS to grow approximately 20%. This outlook incorporates our integration plans for the four acquisitions we have announced this year. Normalizing for this, we would expect our EPS to grow approximately 23%. Next year we expect our 2018 acquisitions to contribute approximately 1.5 points of growth to revenue and $0.08 to $0.10 of dilution to earnings per share. And in 2020, we expect these acquisitions to be accretive to our earnings.","As we reflect on the first three quarters of 2018, we're very encouraged by our performance and the opportunities ahead. Already this year we have announced approximately $2.7 billion in acquisitions, returned approximately $3 billion in cash to shareholders, delivered operating margin expansion and significantly improve the overall growth profile of our business. We are innovating this scale and introducing great payment experiences for our consumers and merchants. The sustained momentum we see in the business gives us confidence to invest in high potential areas such as Venmo, global expansion, in-store strategies, and PayPal business loans. We're extremely pleased with our progress.","I want to close by thanking all of PayPal's customers and our colleagues worldwide for making this another strong quarter. With that, let me turn it back over to the operator for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane","I wanted to ask about eBay; I know they announced the managed payments initiatives and it doesn't look like PayPal is featured as a payment option. So trying to figure out what's the impact to PayPal's model? I mean, I guess what we're trying to get at is figure out how much the weakness in eBay is due to the run rate of core eBay volumes? Were those volumes coming off of PayPal in payments to other providers?","Dan Schulman","Thanks Brian, it's Dan. I'll take a crack at that and then turn it over to John and Bill, if they've got anything else to add to it. So first of all, eBay's performance on our platform had nothing to do with intermediated payments. They announced publicly -- I think they had 20 million of TPV that moved to intermediated payments, we don't even see that as a rounding [ph] on our results. So intermediate payments has just started off for them, no impact on their performance on our platform. So let me take a step back and talk to you a little bit about what I see going forward. So I think that PayPal and eBay are going to continue to be close strategic partners for the foreseeable future. And, so why do I say that? I say that because it's not just that we have signed a 5-year term with them to display PayPal branded services on their intermediated payments or that we just signed a while ago a comprehensive 7-year deal to provide eBay shopper's with PayPal credit offers. Those things are just deals that we've done with eBay.","The most important thing is that our mutual sellers and merchants demanded the consumers that we have, the sellers that eBay and PayPal share demand to have PayPal; their sales actually depend on it. And we just put out -- Bill, I think just published a market research that was done with IPSOs [ph] that was a comprehensive study, and that study showed what we've been talking about for quite some time. And in the study it said that consumers on average are 54% more willing to buy when a merchant accepts PayPal; and by the way, that's at the low-end of that. If that goes up when it's a cross-border transaction, when it's mobile, when it's unfamiliar brands and if you think about the long tail of eBay merchants; so that 54% is a low number for those. And so you also have 59% of PayPal users who have abandoned [ph] a transaction because PayPal wasn't the checkout option. And so we've got 254 million customers on our platform right now, imagine it's almost 60% of them would abandon a sale because PayPal checkout wasn't available.","And so -- and by the way, we've been talking about this for quite some time and if you look at the seller feedback on the eBay seller form and look at what those sellers are saying, those that have moved over to intermediated payments; you'll see comments from them that their sales have dropped 40% to 60% and they're clamoring to come back to PayPal. So both eBay and PayPal want to serve our mutual customers extremely well, it's a major integration for eBay to put PayPal on, we're committed to both of us to having PayPal on intermediated payments beginning next year but we feel really great about the growing value proposition that we have, and we feel great about the partnership that we'll have with eBay going forward as well.","Anything you would add, Bill?","Bill Ready","I would just add to that that eBay has responded to those comments saying that sellers have issues with the drop in sale, they can revert back to PayPal in the near-term and in the long-term they are working hard to make PayPal available as a payment option, and we're working hand-in-hand with eBay to try and make sure that's available to those customers given the strong demand from customers as Dan was describing.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul [ph] with Credit Suisse.","Unidentified Analyst","I just wanted to follow-up on Venmo, could [ph] you give us some good updates there. Just could you help us think through the contribution -- you mentioned $1 billion instant transfer volume in September; should we think of that as $1 billion monthly run rate? And then, would you say there are any other monetization activities that are starting to scale, just -- just, kind of -- I want to make sure I'm thinking about the contribution correctly.","Bill Ready","Sure. The $1 billion in instant transfer volume was for the month of September, and that's been growing nicely, we don't see anything to disturb that trend. And instant transfer is one of the monetization initiatives that we see scaling well, as Dan mentioned in his remarks, pay with Venmo is growing very nicely. Uber, Uber Eats, Grubhub, Eat24, Seamless have all integrated pay with Venmo, that's been growing quite remarkably. I mentioned 185% month-over-month growth on pay with Venmo, and the card is seeing 320% month-over-month growth, those are early but those are the kinds of rapid growth results that we're seeing with other initiatives on Venmo, and so across all three of our major monetization initiatives instant transfer, pay with Venmo and other apps like Uber and Grubhub, and the card, we see all of those starting to really scale in a meaningful way.","Dan Schulman","And you also saw the number of Venmo customers who have now been in a monetizable act go to 24% up from 17% just one quarter ago. So as I mentioned in my remarks, it's still or late [ph] obviously but it looks like we've achieved some kind of tipping point right now, and I think both Bill and I are extremely pleased with the results of Venmo. One other thing that I would just point out is, as I mentioned, it seems repetitive but we don't take it for granted; for three quarters in a row right now we've each quarter seen record net new active signing up to Venmo. So not only are you seeing Venmo expand quite rapidly but the percent of people using the monetizable event is going up quite rapidly as well. So you combine all of those things together, you can see why we're quite pleased with the momentum as of now.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Mihalos with Cowen.","George Mihalos","Just wanted to ask John, as we look at the initial guide for '19, how are you thinking about pricing broadly across the company from '18 and '19? I know you're anniversarying [ph] some pricing on the cross-border side, and then maybe related to that, you know, the shift in Venmo going from operating in the red to going into the black; how should we think about or ballparking that kind of contribution in the guide? Thank you.","John Rainey","Starting with pricing; pricing is something that -- as we've said before George, it's not a one-time thing for us where I've described it in the past as a sugar-high [ph] where you're trying to monetize something for the next quarter. We take a very long-term perspective to that and there are opportunities every year to look at pricing, and pricing sometimes can mean going out and taking advantage of where you provide significant value in the market and pricing higher. In other cases given the enormous addressable market that we have, it can be about capturing market share and be more aggressive on pricing; so that goes both ways. And certainly we have assumptions built into our plans about optimizing pricing in various areas going into 2019. One example of that is the recent announcement that we made about increasing our pricing to be more inline with where the market is on instant transfer, and so that's just one example that we're -- that we have there related to pricing.","On Venmo, as we've said, this is -- it's hard not to be excited about some of the growth numbers that we're talking about today and the fact that each of the last three quarters we've seen a record number of net new customers come to the platform; but this is a long game and we're not going to -- we're going to be measured in terms of our approach to this, make sure that we optimize for the experience and profitability will certainly come, we've got a good history here in terms of what happened with PayPal as that moved from P2P to being able to monetize that in ways where one can shop at a merchant. And so that is a transition that will take place in a couple years not a couple of quarters, and so we expect to see improvement in our Venmo economics next year and each year, thereafter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang with JP Morgan.","Tien-tsin Huang","Thank you, and thanks for the 2019 framework, it's encouraging. Just maybe on that, just a fairly -- a steady EPS growth for '19 adjusting for the acquisitions despite some eBay degradation that you talked about and perhaps in cross border too; I'm not sure if maybe you want to comment on your outlook for cross-border specifically but I'm curious just in the aggregate; what may be getting better? What are some of the key offsets [ph] that have given you the confidence to achieve that; that steady EPS growth in '19?","John Rainey","Sure, I'll start and Dan and Bill can jump in as well. 2019, there is a lot of things in store as we sort of enter this next chapter post our previous relationship with eBay. And so excited about the partnership opportunities that are out there, we're excited about integrating some of the acquisitions that we've had and potential ones in the future and what that can mean to make our platform even better than it is today. As we look at parts of the P&L and the effect on sort of achieving that guidance into next year, we certainly expect to continue to realize operating leverage in our business. Tien-tsin, I didn't talk about this in my prepared remarks but you know, we often talk about the marginal economics of our business. In this most recent quarter, for every dollar -- incremental dollar of revenue that we brought in our non-volume related cost only went up $0.10; that is a model for scaling a platform. And as we've said before, we think that we can continue to do that.","With respect to cross-border, that's an area that -- if you look at it in terms of the percentage of total volume for PayPal, it's down slightly from where it was in the previous quarter, that's in part because of mix in our business as we see things like Venmo growing more, Braintree growing more. But I think that the takeaway from this is that, if you were to go back three or four years ago when we were more of just a button on a marketplace, we were very dependent or I should our profitability was very concentrated in certain areas, and what you're seeing us evolve into as a platform is we have a much more diversified portfolio, both regionally, as well as product-wise, we're monetizing a lot of other aspects of our business that we haven't before. And so despite the fact that cross-border which is a lucrative part of our business, is a smaller overall piece of our portfolio; and eBay you can say the same thing about, you're seeing us expand our operating margin and continuing to grow earnings at a mid-20% growth rate. So we're very excited about that and it gives us confidence going into 2019.","Dan Schulman","Just one or two things on top of that. You saw this quarter us adding for the first time ever over 9 million net new active accounts. And interesting at the same time, engagement growing by 9.5%; for those of you who look carefully at our engagement numbers which I know many of you do, that's the highest percentage game we've had in probably two years or so. And three years ago, we guided like 3 million to 5 million net new actives per quarter, we took that up last year to 6 million to 8 million, we're clearly at the very high-end of that; and we see that continuing as we look forward as well. And when you have your net new actives growing by 30 million to 35 million a year and your engagement growing by 8% to 10%; that bodes well as we look forward.","And I would say some of the new products and services that Bill and the team are introducing or have introduced into the market, some of the new partnerships that are just coming underway right now; we feel pretty good about our position in the digital payments ecosystem right now.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Fossett with Morgan Stanley.","James Fossett","I wanted to circle back to the Venmo commentary, particularly Dan, your comments that you're feeling like you're at a tipping point there. I'm just wondering if you can give us a little color on how we should think about efforts to drive increased acceptance of Venmo and where we may see some evidence of that? And I guess, dovetailing with that is that -- with kind of the new instant transfer fee structure; how should we -- like what should we be anticipating in terms of contribution to moving the monetization of Venmo forward from that particular initiative? Thank you.","Dan Schulman","I'd just say first of all, again, it's early but substantial progress and the numbers we gave are month-over-month numbers, not year-over-year but month-over-month growth numbers. So you can see the acceleration that's happening. We have a very strong pipeline of large merchants, the merchants you might expect who are lining up to integrate pay with Venmo buttons. We also obviously are rolling out these smart payment button capabilities into a PayPal checkout where if it is a Venmo customer we will dynamically present they pay with Venmo button and so you'll start to see that also accelerating quite a bit. And then if you look across the monetizable services that we're offering, all of those services are benefits to the Venmo consumer and I think that's a really important point.","A Venmo consumer doesn't think about engaging in a monetizable act, they think about how can I use my Venmo card to spend offline, have that come right back into my Venmo feed, share\/split those purchases, and it's a value-add for them being able to take your Venmo balance and be able to spend on online merchants or on Uber; that's a value-add for them just as it is to be able to instantly gain access to their balances is a value-add to them as well. And so the more services we've put out there, and we've been careful to be sure that the services we've put out are real value-added services but the more we put out the more Venmo customers use and start to engage with that. I mentioned that you're seeing the Venmo customers engage in groceries and restaurants, these are everyday types of activities and we're really just becoming an embedded part of our Venmo customer's digital financial services life.","There are other things that we're looking at going forward but we're really pleased with the efforts we have so far, and very pleased with the momentum. Bill, anything you would add on that?","Bill Ready","I would just add to that that in addition to Dan's points there around how simple we're making it for merchants to add a dedicated pay with the most recent things like smart payment buttons, the integrations we've done like with Uber for example, we're seeing tremendous growth that we're quite pleased with but they're quite pleased with it as well, they're seeing this really driving engagement on the platform and the usage of Venmo is outpacing their own expectations which are certainly quite high given how rapidly they grow. And so as we continue to make merchants happy with the engagement we're driving to them; as Dan said, we're seeing a lot of merchants really line-up for that but we're providing multiple ways for users to get great new experiences and to make money by providing them great new experience whether those pay with Venmo, the card or things like instant cash out; so all of those together are really bringing great value to the user and great growth of the monetization for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from [indiscernible].","Unidentified Analyst","Dan, this one is for you on the topic of partnerships which is one of the topics of the day. You have a history of converting would be enemies into friends or at least frenemies; and I'm wondering if you can comment on two groups out there that are sort of in that category, the large global merchant acquirers, and then also the Chinese digital wallets. As you think about partnerships, is there a path to converting those players? Do you see a partnership path with PayPal?","Dan Schulman","Lisa, I also consider you to be one of those partners that also turns into a friend as well. So obviously, as we've moved towards customer choice and as we've moved to being an open platform our ability to now partner, it's just night and day difference from where we were two years ago. I talked about 35 -- I think we've done 37 major partnerships in the last two years, and as you know, we've started to work with and partner with some of the leading Chinese players today whether that be [indiscernible] with their international merchants, I think where PayPal is now on over 50,000 of their merchants being accepted allowing PayPal consumers outside of China to purchase from Chinese merchants.","We support some 300,000 Chinese merchants who have the PayPal mark on them today, enabling consumers outside of China to purchase from those merchants.","And we're looking at doing the opposite with people like Baidu and others where Chinese consumers can seamlessly pay and buy at PayPal merchants outside of China. So we think that we can facilitate cross-border for all of those players in China and in other countries. In terms of merchant acquirers, we've had a long history actually of partnering with merchant acquirers, we're very close partners with First Data. Again, a number of years ago, there is First Data against PayPal, that is not the case anymore, we work hand-in-hand together. And so, you know -- Bill, do you want to add to that?","Bill Ready","Wells Fargo, Chase, I mean there is a number of major merchant acquirers that we work with, we bring in tremendous amounts of volume. And it's another example as Dan was describing of how we're able to partner with others in the ecosystem as we've made our platform more open and have really gotten focused on how we can provide value to customers in partnership with others, and acquirers are certainly one of those constituents that we were closer with.","Operator","Our next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research.","Darrin Peller","Let me just start off; I mean first, you have 9.1 million active accounts net new this quarter annualizing 36 million I guess per year. First of all, is there any reason why this quarter was unusual in terms of seasonality or is that now obviously better than 30 million run rate you had, call it a year ago? And then, there is the follow-up was just on the OVAS line, it was much higher than I know we in the street were -- if you can give us a little more color if that's either -- whether it's Synchrony revenue share or it's all the great stuff in Venmo we're seeing? That would be great.","Dan Schulman","So first on the net new actives, nothing unusual in the quarter. As John mentioned in his remarks, nothing from the iZettle acquisition that came in there, that was 9.1 million accounts that came in naturally. We also have over 20 million merchants now on the platform too and that's growing quite nicely. So, we projected being about 30 million, we thought this year it will clearly be over that, and we see no reason for these types of numbers to be our new run rate going forward.","Bill Ready","And I would just add to that, we started seeing increased consumer adoption going back a couple of years when we started getting these reductions; is that sustainable. And for the last two years you've seen us continue to drive significant improvements in net new actives, and part of that is that there has not been anyone silver bullet to -- what's bringing those new users to the platform, it's a combination of great checkout experience with things like PayPal One Touch, P2P, Choice; all these things together are bringing more and more users onto the platform, deepening engagement with them through being a great digital engagement channel with card issuers and others, it's the composite effect of all these things together. And so as Dan said, there is nothing that we see slowing that down, it's something that we think is a new normal for us in terms of the way that we're driving increased engagement and increased new users to the platform.","John Rainey","And Darrin on other value-added services; there is three things probably that are influencing that and rough order of significance -- first, would be we're seeing great growth in our merchant working capital business. Recall, we've got the acquisition of Swift and we're just really pleased with how that's performing, really good growth there. Second thing that I would call out is while we sold the U.S. consumer credit portfolio we still have an international consumer credit portfolio, and that is performing very well in the entities where we've launched that. And then lastly, I would say that the profit sharing arrangement we have with Synchrony -- we still receive economic benefit depending upon the performance of that U.S. consumer credit portfolio. And we're very pleased with that, and I would venture to say Synchrony is very pleased with how it's performing as well.","Dan Schulman","Thanks. Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Final question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs.","Heath Terry","Dan, as it has been pointed out earlier, you guys have had a lot of success over the last couple of years in signing partnerships and bringing a lot of partners onto the platform. I guess it's probably too much to ask to try and kind of quantify the impact that those -- of those partnerships or how much of an impact we've seen on TPV or revenue as it relates to those? But curious if just qualitatively you can try and give us a sense of the impact that you've seen there?","And then, as it relates to the Walmart and Amex deals that have been signed, how you would sort of scale those deals relative to what we've seen from partnerships thus far? What kind of potential do you think those two deals have?","Dan Schulman","So I would say just in general, we've announced quite a number of partnerships over the past couple of years. These partnerships take multiple quarters before they start to come up to speed, some of them a year plus; and so I would say we are still quite early in the impact that we are seeing from all of those partnerships. And so just from a qualitative perspective, we're beginning to see some nice momentum but I would say it's very, very early days. One example of that would be rewards points, we've got maybe four or so issuers now, major issuers who are going to be putting their reward points onto the PayPal platform.","We're going to be a platform that aggregates all of those that users of our mutual customers can take those reward points, turn them into fiat currency, use the rewards points and a combination of any other financial instrument they have on board to make purchases at basically 20 million merchants across the world; it's the first time that we're giving that kind of utility, and the American Express announcement -- they are one of the -- if not the leader in rewards points and having their rewards points come onto the platform and their customers being able to use them at PayPal merchants, and the only place where they can use them at all of those different merchants, right. Amex is only integrated into a couple of merchants right now to be able to use reward points.","Those are all things that are coming in the future. And I would say Walmart has a tremendous amount of potential for us, it's the largest retailer, one of the largest marketplaces, and with a lot of aspirations, and we have quite good relationship with them and a growing relationship with them. And as you see, almost every quarter we announce new partnerships and some of them can be quite large, and -- my anticipation as we look out over the next several quarters that you'll see more of those come onto play as well. This is an ongoing -- part of our strategy is to be a great partner and to be the underlying platform and the largest digital distribution channel for a lot of our partners.","So we're seeing a good deal of success right now but still I would say very early innings for us in terms of the -- of what they could be and will become for us.","Operator, thank you. Everybody thank you for joining us. We look forward to talking to you over the hours and months ahead. So thank you very much everyone for joining.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference call. This concludes the program, you may now disconnect.

And welcome to PayPal\u2019s Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Ms. Gabrielle Rabinovitch, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Gabrielle Rabinovitch","Thank you, Sherry. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Welcome to PayPal Holdings\u2019 earnings conference call for the second quarter of 2017. Joining me today on the call are Dan Schulman, our President and CEO; John Rainey, our Chief Financial Officer; and Bill Ready, our Chief Operating Officer.","We\u2019re providing a slide presentation to accompany our commentary. This conference call is also being broadcast on the Internet and both the presentation and call are available through the Investor Relations section of our website.","We will discuss some non-GAAP measures and talking about our company\u2019s performance. In discussing certain historical year-over-year comparisons, we have chosen to present non-GAAP pro forma measures because we believe that these measures provide investors a consistent basis for reviewing the Company\u2019s performance across different periods. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the presentation accompanying this conference call.","Please note that as reflected in the reconciliation our GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income in the press release is included in our 8-K filed earlier this afternoon, GAAP diluted net income per share for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $0.56.","In addition, management will make forward-looking statements that are based on our current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve risks and uncertainties.

You should not rely on any forward-looking statements. All information in this presentation is as of today\u2019s date, July 26, 2017. We disclaim any obligation to update the information.","With that, let me turn the call over to Dan.","Dan Schulman","Thank you, Gabrielle. And thanks everyone for joining us today. I\u2019m pleased to say that PayPal delivered another strong quarter of financial results, achieving new milestones for the Company on multiple fronts. PayPal generated 3.136 billion in revenue, the first time we've exceeded 3 billion in a single quarter and representing 20% of FX-neutral growth, nearly a 110 basis point acceleration from the first quarter and 70 basis points from a year ago.","We've exceeded our guidance and delivered $0.46 of non-GAAP earnings per diluted share, up 27% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP operating margin grew by a 110 basis point year-over-year to 21%. We generated 747 million in free cash flow, up 51% from a year ago. Perhaps more importantly we had strong performance across our customer metrics. We gained 6.5 million net new active accounts, the largest organic quarterly gain in the past three years and up over 80% from a year ago.","We ended the quarter with 210 million active accounts including 17 million merchant accounts, growing our base at 12% year-over-year. Given our first half results, we now anticipate our net new active additions will exceed 25 million for 2017. Engagement once again increased growing 10% year-over-year, our customers now transact 32.3 times per year, up from 29.4 times a year ago, and 31.7 last quarter.","Our growing base and increasing customer engagement enabled us to pass another milestone, as we processed a 106 billion in payment volume exceeding 100 billion in quarterly TPV for the first time. TPV grew at a currency neutral rate of 26% year-over-year, accelerating 75 basis points from last quarter. Our volume growth was driven by our leadership in mobile. In the quarter, 34% of the payments on our platform were made on a mobile device.","PayPal processed approximately 36 billion in mobile payment volume in Q2, up 50% year-over-year. This growth is largely driven by the exceptional and differentiated consumer experiences we enabled on mobile devices. One Touch adoption continued to expand in the quarter with over 60 million consumer accounts opted in. Merchant accounts accepting One Touch now numbered just over 5.5 million growing by 500,000 in the quarter.","Venmo users sent and received 8 billion in the second quarter representing a 103% increase from this time last year, as we continue to achieve increasing network effects in the millennial markets. Based on the strong trends we're seeing across the business, we're once again raising guidance for revenue and EPS for the full year. John will share more details about our results and guidance in his remarks.","Our performance is driven by the cumulative effect of multiple incidents. We have fundamentally retooled our technology and infrastructure, leading to significant improvements and availability and develop our productivity. We have meaningfully improved our core experiences and expanded our suite of products. Our overall scale is accelerating due to the network effects of our two sided platform. It is clearly a macro secular shift toward digital payments and our customer choice results continue to exceed our expectations.","We have completed a rollout of choice across our on-boarding, servicing and checkout experiences in the United States and over 13 million customers have opted into choice. We have the data from millions of customers over multiple quarters. We are beginning to see clear trends resulting from our choice initiative. Choice is both simplify and clarify our customer experiences, which has meaningfully reduced the volume of calls into our customer service centers.","Despite our transaction volumes increasing by more than 20%, our net call volume into our global operations are down year-over-year. The results of choice on the numerous other product improvements, we delivered significant OpEx savings over the course of our three-year finding horizon. More importantly, customers who have opted into choice have meaningful increases in overall satisfaction.","As a result, choice is driving a significant reduction in churn and a meaningful lift in overall engagement. And consistent with last quarter, the impact on our funding cost continues to remain well within our expectations. Based on the success of choice in the U.S., we are pleased to be expanding this rollout into Australia, Canada, The UK and Japan later this year. Choice will also help to expand PayPal's presence in our customers' lives. These opportunities are driven by the land mark partnership agreements we have announced with technology companies, financial networks, wireless carriers and financial institutions around the world.","In the second quarter, we continue to make excellent progress with our partnerships. We continue to expand our relationship with Visa, expanding our partnership in the Europe. As most of you will recall, last quarter, we announced an agreement with Visa that covered the Asia-Pacific region. Consequently, we now work around the globe with Visa. And as part of our network agreement announced last year with Visa and Mastercard, we recently announced the new service as it designed to allow PayPal and Venmo users in the U.S. to instantly transfer money to their bank account via eligible debit card, linked to their PayPal account.","Findings faster and more convenient ways for our customers to fund into and out of their PayPal accounts is a key part of our overall value proposition. Throughout the quarter, we saw a relationship with issuers grow increasingly collaborative and productive. For example, we are pleased to see leading issuers including Wells Fargo and HSBC actively marketing PayPal to their customer base, encouraging their clients to link their cards into PayPal accounts.","We also announced new strategic relationships with JPMorgan Chase and as of today Bank of America to utilize their token services and enable their customers to easily integrate their cards into PayPal and seamlessly create a new PayPal account from their properties. Furthermore, as part of our expanded relationship with Citi and Chase, we will make Citi ThankYou Rewards Points and Chase Ultimate Reward Points available in our PayPal wallet to be used as a funding source for consumers shopping at our 17 million merchants.","As I've said on last quarter's call, it's hard to overstate the difference in the relationships we now have with companies across multiple sectors to many once view as potential competitors. We are confident these partnerships will drive enhanced value to our mutual customers. The accelerating and extensive scale of our two sided global platform, which will allow consumers and merchants to transact instantly in new context, across operating system, technologies and platforms, create a strong foundation and is very attractive to multiple partners.","Our open technology platform has enabled expanded partnerships with Google, Apple, Facebook and Samsung over the past few months. These agreements benefit both PayPal and our partners by creating innovative consumer-focused experiences that connect their combined billions of consumers to new buying experiences enabled by PayPal's powerful platform. In April, Google announced an expansion of our partnership to make it easy for consumers to use PayPal as a payment method in Android Pay wherever it is accepted, in-store, in app and online.","In addition, Android Pay users on Google's Chrome mobile-web will be able to seamlessly pay at the millions of online merchants that accept PayPal, simply by using their PayPal account and fingerprint authentication. Just like the deployment of One Touch, this great new checkout experience will be available to millions of PayPal merchants without requiring any integration work from the merchant, further extending the value we bring to our merchant customers.","Also in the quarter, Facebook announced additional commerce experiences with PayPal that will be available within its Messenger platform. At F8 Facebook shared that over 1 million joint PayPal and Facebook customers have already enabled our payments experience within Facebook Messenger.","Earlier this month, PayPal and Apple announced an expansion of our iTunes integration, which mean customers can now buy games, music, movies and in-app purchases with PayPal, on their iPhones and iPads in the Apple App Store, iBooks, Apple Music and iTunes stores in 12 countries including the U.S., Australia and parts of Europe. We anticipate that this integration will expand to more countries around the world in the coming months. This complements our existing integration into Siri and Apple iMessage and marks a growing relationship with Apple.","Finally, we announced a strategic partnership with Samsung. Users of Samsung Pay in the U.S. will be able to use PayPal to pay for purchases in-stores using Samsung Pay's mag-stripe emulation technology, which is used at the vast majority of merchants that accept cards. The totality of these partnerships reinforces the fact that we're becoming an underlying open payments platform and wallet for many of the leading technology platform, OEMs and wireless carriers around the world.","We continue to make good progress in rolling out Venmo as a payment option for PayPal merchants. As we shared last quarter, we're not introducing the ability for U.S. PayPal merchants to accept Venmo as a mobile payment option. Venmo users are now able to use Venmo at an expanded number of PayPal merchants such as lululemon and Forever 21 and I'm quite encouraged by the early results. We expect that the ability to pay with Venmo will be widely deployed across millions of our PayPal merchants by the end of this year and I look forward to sharing more details in the coming quarters.","The ability to deliver new consumers and enhanced sales growth to merchants of all sizes is a key benefit of PayPal, especially as the world becomes more global and increasingly digital. As of today, this includes bringing the power and reach of the PayPal platform to the expansive and rapidly growing Chinese consumer market. We're very pleased to announce that PayPal has signed a strategic partnership agreement with Baidu, the leading Chinese language internet search provider with approximately 700 million users.","This partnership allows Chinese consumers to pay with their Baidu Wallet and PayPal at our merchants outside of China. Beginning later this year, this partnership will provide Chinese consumers more ways to discover and buy from PayPal merchants in the U.S. and will eventually expand the PayPal's entire global merchant base outside of China. We expect this partnership to drive significant demand and additional cross-border trade over the PayPal platform.","In addition in helping our merchant customers maximize their opportunities in the age of digital commerce, another key part of our strategy is helping underserved consumers, join and thrive in the digital economy. This vision drove our recent acquisition of TIO Networks, which adds bill pay functionality to our two sided platform, offering consumers the ability to access a digital network and benefit from the convenience and speed of digital bill payments.","Last week, we announced that we have closed our acquisition of TIO Network and I would like to take this opportunity to welcome Hamed and the TIO team to the PayPal family. Three years ago, we set off to transform PayPal. Our goal is to create an open platform for digital commerce to deliver innovative mobile checkout experiences that blur the lines between physical, online and mobile shopping.","We set off to create an integrated suite of services, experiences and APIs that could extend the power of our two sided ecosystem, to our merchants with a little and I'd say no integration work required. That vision has grown increasingly important to our merchants in today's rapidly evolving retail landscape. Our execution in support of that vision is yielding strong results and expanding our leadership position. Our efforts to place our customers' frontend centered everything we do is driving the scale and engagement on our platform.","It has opened the door to strategic and reductive partnerships that have extended the PayPal experience across multiple contexts in existing and new geographies. But we know we are still in the early stages of our transformation and we are just scratching the surface of the opportunities in front of us. We are fully committed to delivering a true core experiences and additional innovative and comprehensive solutions for our customers, helping our consumers and merchants to navigate the rapidly evolving and expanding digital payments landscape.","And with that, I would like to now turn the call over to John.","John Rainey","Thanks Dan. I also want to thank all of PayPal\u2019s customers and our employees worldwide for making this another great year. As Dan discussed, we achieved several notable milestones in the second quarter, including for the first time processing more with $100 billion of TPV and generating more than $3 billion of revenue in a quarter. In addition, we saw accelerating growth in customer accounts, revenue, operating income, earnings per share, and free cash flow.","Our second quarter financial and operating results demonstrate a momentum in our business and build on the strength of our recent performance. Relative to our expectations go into the quarter, our revenue and operating income outperformed. On the top line, we attributed acceleration in our core to strong account engagement growth, enhanced user experiences that make setting preferences and choosing funding instruments intuitive, cross border initiatives as well as increased functionality that allows our customers to use our products and additional contacts.","In addition, the foreign exchange rates continue to be a headwind in comparison to last year. It provided a benefit relative to our plans going into the quarter. On the expense side, non-volume related expenses grew 4.5%, approximately 25% of the rate of revenue growth. Our team did an outstanding job managing cost, resulting in cost performance slightly better than our expectations. At the same time, we continue to fully fund our key growth initiatives. This level of expense growth demonstrates our ability to scale with minimal incremental cost.","Before I discuss the financial results in details here are some highlights for the quarter. Revenue was $3.14 billion, growing 18% on spot basis and 20% on a currency neutral basis. Non-GAAP operating income grew 25% to $659 million and non-GAAP EPS grew 27% to $0.46. We generated $921 million operating cash flow and free cash flow grew 51% to $747 million. For the second quarter, our total payment volume was $106 billion up 26% on a currency neutral basis consisting of U.S. payment volume growth of 27% and international volume growth of 25%.","Our merchant services volume grew 30% on a currency neutral basis to $91 billion. Merchant services represented approximately 86% of our total volume in the quarter. Volume associated with eBay represented approximately 14% of the total compared to 15% in the first quarter of 2017 and 17% in the second quarter of 2016. P2P continues to be a meaningful contributor TPV, representing approximately 21% of total payment volume.","In the quarter, active accounts grew 12% and we ended the second quarter with 210 million active accounts. Active account growth was driven by strength in our core PayPal business as well as growth in Venmo. The number of payment transactions per active account on a trailing 12 month basis reached 32.3 with 6.8 billion transactions occurring on our payment platform over that period. In the second quarter, transactions grew 23% to 1.8 billion.","Revenue grew 18% on a spot basis in Q2 and was the result of an 18% increase in both transaction revenue and revenue from other value-added services. The revenue growth in the second quarter represents an acceleration of more than 100 basis points versus the first quarter. Transaction revenue growth was primarily driven by our core PayPal and Braintree businesses and revenue from other value-added services was predominantly driven by credit.","For Q2, our transaction take rate was 2.58%, a decline of 11 basis points from the second quarter of 2016. And our total take rate was 2.95% down 13 basis points year over year. 75% of the decrease in both transaction and total take rate was related to the increase in our P2P volume. Increased stability in our transaction take rate in the second quarter is indicative of the balanced growth and the strength we are seeing across our platform as well as our ability to monetize experiences where we demonstrate a compelling value proposition for our customers.","Volume based expenses were up 29% year over year. Transaction expense was $1.06 billion, up 31% year over year driven primarily by increased funding cost across our core PayPal platform. As Dan mentioned in his remarks, the increased transaction expenses we have seen from choice have been well within our expectations. Further, we continue to see benefit on both the top line as well as cost improvements from lower customer call volumes in servicing costs, validating our initial expectations.","We're pleased to roll out these experiences to additional geographies in Europe and Asia. Transaction loss in the quarter was $185 million or 17 basis points of TPV compared to 18 basis points of TPV in Q2 '16. Low losses across our consumer and merchant credit products were a $123 million, representing 26% growth in line with the growth of our receivables portfolio.","Our consumer credit portfolio continues to perform in line with our expectations. The net charge off rate was 6.9% in second quarter. We ended the quarter with an aggregate gross receivable balance including both principle and interest of $6.1 billion in our consumer and merchant loan portfolio and our total reserve of $380 million.","Other operating expenses increased 4.5% to $1.1 billion representing 35% of total revenue, an improvement of 465 basis points of operating leverage versus the same quarter last year. Both general and administrative and product development costs were flat year-over-year and experienced the lowest rates of growth since separation. Sales and marketing expenses grew 10 as we invested to support our brand strategies and choice experiences.","For the second quarter in a row, other operating expenses increased only $0.10 for every incremental dollar of revenue, demonstrating the scalability of our platform. Strong revenue and cost performance resulted in 25% growth in non-GAAP operating income to $659 million. Non-GAAP operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 21% compared to Q2 '16. GAAP operating income grew 16% in the second quarter to $430 million and resulted in a GAAP operating margin of 13.7%. Both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS grew 27% in the second quarter to $0.34 and $0.46 respectively.","We ended Q2 with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $6.4 billion. We generated $921 million of operating cash flow in the quarter and capital expenditures were $174 million or 6% of revenue. This resulted in $747 million of free cash flow in the quarter as we generated $0.24 of free cash flow for every dollar of revenue. Capital return is a fundamental component of our overall capital allocation strategy. Year-to-date, we've returned more than $600 million to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases. We now have approximately $400 million remaining on our original $2 billion authorization.","As announced on our last earnings call, our Board has also approved an additional $5 billion buyback authorization. In addition to focusing on enhanced capital allocation strategies, we're also committed to optimizing our capital structure. As we've shared over the past few quarters, we're exploring alternatives to run our consumer credit business in a less capital intensive manner. We're encouraged by the discussions with potential partners and based on the progress we're making the timing and structure of these alternatives are in line with our expectations.","While we continue to assess more efficiently to manage balance sheet exposure and consumer credit, we are also assessing strategies that will support the growth of merchants and credit products. We continue to introduce and expand financial services and tools, have small and mid size business customers, start and grow the businesses.","Since 2013, PayPal working capital has provided in excess of $3 billion in funding to more than 115,000 merchants. PayPal working capital is a strategic offering for PayPal which drives merchants' sales growth, increases processing volume and reduces merchant churn rate. We will continue to invest in our working capital business to provide innovative financial products to small-and medium-sized businesses.","I would now like to discuss our updated guidance for the full year 2017 as well as the guidance for the third quarter. For the full year, we are raising our revenue guidance and now expect revenue between $12.775 billion and $12.875 billion, representing currency neutral growth of 19% to 20%. At current exchange rates for the full year, we expect currency translation to impact revenue by approximately 100 basis points, resulting in spot growth of 18% to 19%.","For the first half of 2017, non-volume related expenses have grown only 4.5%. We are pleased with this performance and it's indicative of the type of cost discipline with which we can operate going forward. This level of growth for our non-volume related expense is sustainable given the manner in which we are scaling our business and the changes we have made to our organization structure. At the same time, this vary measured approach to experience growth gives us the flexibility to be opportunistic and make investments to drive our business going forward.","Given our year-to-date performance and our operating plans for the remainder of the year, we expect with our full year non-GAAP operating margins will expand relative to 2016. We are also raising our full year EPS outlook by $0.05 at the high end and now expect non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $1.80 to a $1.84. Further, we are increasing our free cash flow outlook and now expect to generate in excess of $2.9 billion in 2017. As Dan mentioned, we recently closed our acquisition of TIO Network and have included and expected impact of $25 million in revenue for the remainder of the year and our full year outlook with a negligible impact to our earnings.","At the high end of the ranges we are providing today, our current full year guidance represents an increase of $225 million in revenue, and a $0.10 increase in non-GAAP EPS relative to the initial full year 2017 guidance that we have provided in the January. For the third quarter, we expect revenue to be between $3.14 billion and $3.19 billion and we expect non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.42 and $0.44.","I want to close with the few observations on the quarter and our full year outlook. We saw accelerating growth across net new actives, TPV and revenue in the quarter. Net new active accounts grew by 80% and our currency neutral basis TPV grew 26% and revenue increased 20%. Our merchant services growth has been consistently in the 30% and demonstrates we are continuing to grow on market share.","And while growing our top-line, we expect to maintain disciplined expense growth which allowed us to deliver with 100 basis points of non-GAAP operating margin expansion in the quarter. This performance gives us great conviction and our ability to deliver on our commitments for the year.","With that, let me turn it back over to the operator for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets.","Daniel Perlin","I had a question around the payment transactions for active account. I know they were up 10% and that\u2019s still a very strong number. It was down a little bit relative to last quarter. I think it was up 12 and then over the last six quarters prior to that, it was up on average 13%. So I would have thought given choice in all of the kind of reduced friction that you guys have had that you might actually see that number accelerating as opposed to decelerating in its growth. Is there any callouts in the quarter we should know about?","Dan Schulman","Dan, it\u2019s Dan on. Nice to hear you and thanks for the question. So I am quite pleased with our progress on engagement. It is up 10% despite really what is an accelerating day right now which is kind of the high-class to have. We are seeing tremendous adoptions across merchants and consumers into the PayPal franchise. As I mentioned, we think we\u2019ll exceed 25 million net new actives for the year. In past couple of years, we\u2019ve taken our active user engagement up almost seven transactions per user across the whole days.","And if you look under the covers what we\u2019ve done here quite a bit, the news is even better because the majority of our user engagement right now is coming from the core PayPal Wallet and in many prices before it was coming from growth of Braintree and core PayPal. But now it is being driven the majority from our PayPal core wallet and that is a great story for us. And if you look at our product growth and our core PayPal franchise over the last several quarters, we\u2019ve taken multi-year trend that have been drifting slightly down in terms of their real growth year-over-year and we have bent these curves across pretty much every single one of our core products and they're now up and accelerating.","So, that is a piece of really good news that you probably wouldn\u2019t see from a number in and up itself. And it kind of feels like, we\u2019re just at the beginning of this. We've got One Touch that is driving engagement, that\u2019s driving increased engagement and it\u2019s accelerating across the base. Choice still new, but choice engagement and summing up into choice that engagement is up quite substantially, and I am really pleased with what we are seeing from choice. As I mentioned, we're about 13 million plus customers that are in choice now, that will grow and that will impact engagement.","We\u2019re obviously just beginning of the journey the movements in your context. Now, we now at basically major agreements, we're pretty much every major issuer, we\u2019ve got agreement from the financial networks to utilize their tokens and those start to move us, move more an in-store environment as we go into next year, that'll also drive engagement. You got pay with Venmo. Right now, there's no engagement with Venmo, it's P2P, but we don't count that in our engagement. So also you'll see that drive up. TIO just came on.","Our new partnerships with Facebook and Google are going to start to kick in, that's really not in our guidance right now, as they -- those things are going to start to accelerate and drive our future growth as we look into '18, '19, '20. So, we still have a goal that would consumer use PyaPal two times a week. That is our goal, not to drive once a week, but to drive two times a week. And I feel with all the initiatives we've right now and the trending that we're seeing that over -- our medium to long term that\u2019s within our reach too. So feeling pretty good about where we're on the engagement side.","Dan Perlin","Yes, that's fantastic. I'm going to ask one more quick one is you've mentioned all these strategic partnerships and they are plentiful. I'm wondering how you're viewing that from a trend perspective to bring down your customer acquisition costs as we think about the future?","Dan Schulman","You've violated first quarter rule, one question, but otherwise okay. Correlate with it and I admire that.","Dan Perlin","I'm increasing my engagement.","Dan Schulman","So, listen one of the things I mentioned in my opening remarks is we're beginning to see a tremendously collaborative relationship with issuers right now. We're seeing I mentioned two that are marketing to their pace to actively encourage them to link their cards into our PayPal account. And that's happening because we're going to drive growth for them, as John mentioned in his remarks, our MS TPV -- our TPV growth outside of eBay is growing at 30% and we're the perfect digital distribution channel for financial institutions especially now that we've implemented choice. And consumer will opt on how they want to pay and where they want to pay on that. And so I think this acceleration of our net new actives is coming at a lower cost to it, so it's really found sort of one-two punch that\u2019s positive for us now, but especially as we look forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis with Bernstein.","Lisa Ellis","I had a question about in-store and your in-store strategy in light of the partnerships that you've signed. Can you kind of give an overall view of in which of these instances like in Android Pay versus Samsung Pay versus using the network tokens in your own wallet you're able to generate revenues for PayPal or envision that over time versus where it's just a strategy of driving more user engagement at the POS even though it's not revenue generating?","John Rainey","This is a great question. And you're exactly right that as you parse of the part, there are places where we earn revenue, there're places where you think about an engagement opportunity. And so the places where somebody paying in-store and are using our PayPal balance, those are places where we would make revenue on those transactions. And places where we're enabling the use of an issuer's card directly and we're providing a pass or token, we would earn revenue on those, but we also don't have cost on those, and so we did great consumer engagement, but without cost on those transactions per se.","Also importantly in addition to what we are doing with partners like Samsung Pay and Android Pay to drive into the store, we are working with those same partners, particularly Android Pay for example where it's not just in-store but that blends into in app purchasing and online purchasing. And there is a lot of blurring in the lines of online and store things like buy online, pick-up in the store where these cross channel experiences are really getting to consumers using a mobile device, but really engaging with the retailer and the store. You see us really, really delivering on those types of experience as well.","So we have a broad strategy that can both help the retailer engage across the multiple front, drive engagement with the consumer and we have several those that\u2019s we monetized directly. And some of those that are going to be a path-through which would be -- we are not driving revenue across for us, but we would also not generate cost for us. We have many of those like [indiscernible] to different store, paying with your balance to reduce generate revenue on those things. And by the way, this is consistent with PayPal history where we historically have products such as P2P that were free then we've been monetizing other form. So, this is a strategy that we have employed previously and we feel very good about where we are in that.","Dan Schulman","Just to add to that, we saw first [indiscernible] well and we spent a lot of time as we started the transition of the Company from being really single product type of company to being a platform company that offers a suite of services to both merchants and the consumers. And where we found and with a ton of detailed research and analytics on this is when we add an incremental service to a consumer or even to our merchants, we see the lifetime value basically double. And so a consumer adds to P2P, we see them they engaged more, their use of PayPal goes up, their churn goes way down, and it is a gigantic benefit for our flywheel and for our economics.","And so, the more products and services and experiences and more engagement we could have with the consumer and a merchant, the better the LTV is for us. And that comes through us, as Bill said, historically as we have seen with P2P and others. We also start in-store with Vodafone as we go down, we have seen these. People have used Vodafone and PayPal in-store. They use PayPal more in app and online because the distinctions between those things are blurring especially with mobile. And so, our ability to engage with consumers and drive that engagement is a good thing both for consumers, for merchants and for the economics of PayPal.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","My question is with regards to the rise in active accounts and the V acceleration of that that has gone from 10% to 11% to 12%. Is that a straightforward relationship with consumer choice? Is it possible to potentially estimate? Is there sort of untapped number of inactive accounts people who've downloaded PayPal, but didn't use it that can give us some idea of the potential to continue increasing their accounts?","Dan Schulman","I'll start then maybe Bill can supplement. So, I would say and as I mentioned in my remarks, there's no one single thing driving the growth of those net new active. And as I mentioned, you know, I said I think we'll do an excess of 25 million net new active that would imply so that we're going to do another on average 6 million or so in the third and fourth quarter. So we see a continued strength in net new active. That's coming as a result and Bill won't say this, but I will from the great work that Bill and his product and engineering teams have done, great work that have done. The risk teams have done around improving our core experiences. And as I mentioned, we're bending multiyear curves now and we\u2019re seeing now really nice year-over-year growth in our core experiences. Availability just thing like availability is up, that matters a lot, we'll wait and see. It's down. That matters a lot. We got a new mobile app there. We got One Touch. We got choice coming in.","Choice is driving both reduction in churn which helps to net new actives obviously, but it\u2019s also driving additional new adds because the on-boarding process is so much more streamlined, and then you also have partners that are now actively marketing PayPal because together we're sort of allies in advancing digital payments and tapping into that growth. So I think there is a number of things and we also obviously with 210 million people now on the platform, we\u2019ve got maybe at a tipping point of these network effects right now where there's so many merchants on the platforms, so many consumers on the platform, that it's a must have for people especially if they move into mobile check out experiences. I think what Bill and the risk teams have done and things like One Touch have really been an unparalleled kind of a mobile checkout experience, almost two times the conversion of the industry average. And so, I'll look at a number of things that we've done over the course of the last several years, and they're beginning to take hold in the market, and really driving our results and Bill would you answer that.","Bill Ready","I think you captured really well just being the points there. We have multiple new places that customers are coming in, but as Dan described, we have across nearly every major product area, revamped those products over the last few years that we're were seeing, not only do each of those products tend to get more net new actives for us coming in. We're driving increasing engagement across each of those as people come in through those, they become more engaged on those products in those additional product that they can engage with and also even our relationship with those customers really, we have some more there -- their daily life. So, just as Dan said, it is across multiple fronts and quite noteworthy that it's across our core experiences as well as we\u2019re deepening our engagement.","Dan Schulman","I'll just add one last thing and then we'll be done with your question, Ashwin. We didn't underestimate what can happen with Baidu, I mean we're now tapping into that Chinese consumer marketplace, and that is going to open up a whole new market for consumers to come on to the PayPal platform, interact with our PayPal merchants outside of China and drive what we think could be substantial cross-border traffic. And I talked about this, it's not just Baidu, it's Baidu and PayPal. So almost a little like we've done with Android Pay that it's a cobranded experience and sign up to our PayPal account from there. So, there're a lot of things that we're working on, a lot of things we still want to implement but feel good about the current trend right now.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang from JP Morgan.","Tien-tsin Huang","In momentum, I want to ask about maybe the partner pipeline just maybe big partnerships out there, still designing in 2017 and need to ask about the acquisition pipeline as well and your appetite to do deals?","Dan Schulman","Yes, so, we've done I think 24 major partnerships in the last 18 months and you've seen it last quarter starting to accelerate actually. And it's accelerated that people are beginning to understand the assets that we bring to our partners. We obviously bring our scale to partners and when you talk to different platforms whether it'd be Baidu or Google or Samsung, the ability to tap into 17 million merchants we have that long tail of merchants, that's a very difficult asset for others to replicate and it's accelerating in its growth. If you look at other partnerships, we can add potential for pretty significant additional growth for them, whether that's driven by mobile and we can do a One Touch or TPV that's accelerating.","And as you know, we also control value prop end-to-end, there're very few players who do that, there're some players that can take a piece of it, but very few players own it including risk, custom service, brand reputation. And we own all of that parts of that proposition and we've also changed our model, quite a bit, we're an open platform and a suite of service both branded and unbranded that's operating system and device and technology agnostic. And so, we're -- and very importantly, we're a neutral third party platform. So we don't compete with any of our merchants or partners who are allies in advancing digital payments.","So, I think our positioning is really good within the entire ecosystem to continue to partner. There're a number of other partnerships that are on the horizon and I think the more we partner the more people see that the benefit of doing that could be quite substantial, so I think we announced enough partnerships right now, so we'll save some for the next -- for the next announcement. But I think we're really well positioned on that front.","On the M&A front because you got two questions in there in a very subtle way. But on the M&A front, look we've a very strong balance sheet. John mentioned, we've $6.4 billion of cash equivalents on our balance sheet. We're generating -- now with our guidance is over $2.9 billion of free cash flow for the year. So that\u2019s the competitive advantage for us. There is no question about it and we are very active and looking at range of opportunities around the world, both big and small. But look those opportunities needs the time to our vision in our mission. They got to accelerate our progress either against the key vertical or geographic expansion.","We do tuck-in acquisitions from a tech or functional capability like a TIO type of things, but we look at this in the through the lens of do we build, do we partner or do we buy. And the amount of work that John and Bill done on there, respective platforms with risk capabilities or full infrastructure -- I mentioned the increased developer productivity, we can put out a ton of releases, now we put out some like 30,000 releases in the quarter. I mean it's amazing in velocity of new functionality and innovation that Bill and his team are putting out into the market place. And so, well, we used to have to buy at onetime because it would take us month to make a change on our website because we have such a monolithic infrastructure. Now, there is a rapid velocity, a very innovative services coming in.","Second thing is we can partner now in ways that we never partnered before. Choice has enabled that. We have new velocity about cooperating with people. It's created in environment that gotten very competitive one to one that\u2019s much more cooperative. We have a ton of complimentary resources that we can use with partners. And now many times where we used to think that we will have to buy something, we can that partner on a commercial relationship to go and do that. And then obviously, if we can't do any of that we look at buy and we do that in a very disciplined manner. We have got certain amount of skill and capabilities and so you can expect us to continue to be acquisitive, but in a disciplined fashion and within the context that what I just mentioned.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Condra with Credit Suisse.","Paul Condra","I guess Bill I just wondered if you could give a little more detail on Venmo. What you are seeing as you rolled that out in terms of the way consumers are using it? Are they potentially using a credit card? And then any merchant feedback and just anything, any surprises or anything unexpected just kind of help us understand where your focus is, as you are scaling that product out?","Bill Ready","As we talked about in prior calls, we -- since quite a long time, really making sure that we had dialed the customers' experience, so that Venmo would not just be another payment button, but that\u2019s the uniqueness of Venmo really gets to great mobile payments as well as the social engagement. Then we have had that dialed in, we took that from person to person payments and to merchant payment. We have been working through that for a year plus. And so, we are really on the place of taking those prior learning's as what we got to put feeling really great about and we are hoping that up to the PayPal merchant base.","And so the really interesting thing is happening right now is that we are saying for our Venmo users, we are lining up PayPal merchant allowing, Venmo users to pay PayPal merchants, notably without PayPal merchants having to do anymore just like we rolled out PayPal One Touch, just like we rolled out Android Pay and so you\u2019re seeing us leverage that their unique distribution capability to PayPal merchant again to go deliver Venmo consumers to those PayPal merchant. And so we\u2019re in the midst of ramp of that. But we\u2019re feeling really good about that. We not only had previously proven out the consumers on Venmo, really want to use Venmo for more things beyond P2P and we have a number of merchant where we see really, really part of results in terms of how Venmo stacks up next to other payment alternatives and those merchants we feel great of those things.","For now, we really focus on how we take that from where we are now with a handful of merchant to go take that to millions of PayPal merchants. And we started that journey already, as Dan mentioned previously, we\u2019ve started to introduce that, we have merchants like lululemon and Forever 21 that are now there. We have thousands of PayPal merchants now where you can Venmo to pay and we expect, we\u2019ll progress that towards the millions of PayPal merchants over the coming quarters. We\u2019re feeling really about those things, but what consumers want to do this, what was the interaction model with what -- those are things that we really speed that prior year testing out. So now we\u2019re in the mode just thoughtfully scaling out, we\u2019re feeling really good about how that\u2019s going so far.","Operator","Our next question comes from Darrin Pellar with Barclays.","Darrin Pellar","Just following up on this acceleration and partnerships, Dan, especially around the mega-tech companies such as Apple and Google this past quarter. Can you touch on these partnerships a little more detail, but more -- does this underscore any type of deeper meaning around the positioning in the payments to ecosystem like any of these companies? Just given -- there has always been a lot of questions over the competitive threat from some of these names versus PayPal. Are they now more partnerships? And then John, to sneak one quick financial one in, pricing opportunity, I know there was a key driver potentially in the quarter. Is it still driver or suppose to be or could be a driver in the year? How much more of that to go? Is there or how much of an impact in the quarter and just maybe comment on a little further? Again, thanks again guys.","John Rainey","Sure. Darrin, I\u2019ll start and then kick it over to Dan. As we talk a little bit about this year, pricing is an opportunity for us. We did announce a couple of corridors where we made price increases. And in part of that is reflected both in our financial results for the quarter as well as are improved guidance for the year. I will say that we\u2019re very focused on really identifying where customers drive value enhancement as part of that experience. And then pricing to that versus just arbitrarily going out and raising prices for something where there is no incremental value, that\u2019s perceived by the customers. So, we've had some targeted initiatives that we\u2019ve done and that\u2019s reflecting in our results as well as our guidance for the year.","Dan Schulman","So, I\u2019ll start off and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Bill. But I think there is a real difference now with the partnerships that you mentioned that are major tech platform companies. I think none of that really wanted to go into payments as an end to itself. It was a means to an end that they have. And so, it might be more engagement on their platform and that engagement lead to key metrics that they want to try to keep the advertising, it could be other thing. And when we made the shift to being an open payments platform as opposed to just seeing a button as I check-out experience, and really open our platform up to pretty sophisticated technological upgrades through open APIs with the partnership we had with tokenization and that kind of thing. We were then able to become really in many ways an underlying payment OS or those tech platforms that enable them to create the experiences, that they wanted to drive for their end user. And so that partnership is fundamentally different right now and it has evolved greatly over the last several years. I'll ask Bill to add a color to that, but it's a very different conversation that we have now then we used to have.","Bill Ready","Yes, I'll just add to that, that absolutely payments was a mean to end, as Dan described, and what we've demonstrated is that, through unique two sided platform that we've and our ability to connect consumers and merchants around the world do so in a single touch, makes us very unique being able to light up those experiences for those partners. And so, not only did we make the strategic shifts that they wanted to be more open platform to enable those thing, and improve our experiences so that we could do things like One Touch to drive industry-leading conversion levels to connect to those experiences. I think as mobile as matured and players have been able to see different alternatives in the ecosystem, and see what consumers have affinity issue, what drives better conversion rates.","I think we're demonstrating consistently that uniqueness of our two sided platform and our ability to connect consumers and merchants, let's us drive connection between consumers and merchants of all types of consumers and tech ecosystems in ways that other can't, whatever their aspirations are whether that's selling more app or selling more devices, or driving engagement with their experiences. We're generally able to connect users to them in those experiences are in a lower friction way than anybody else out there. And that's why you're seeing us really start to play a central role there. And I think as more and more of these interesting new experiences proliferate every time that happen, I think PayPal is now positioned as a place where of course people would want to look given what we've demonstrated we can do on those things.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane","Just wanted to ask lots of new partnerships, the Chase deal in particular caught my eye, thinking about the ability for PayPal to process through Chase Net. Doesn't that materially lower your funding costs with Chase cards going forward? And then just as a bigger strategic picture maybe Dan with all these partnership. Are we about to launch a big in-store campaign or opportunity? Or is it going to be a more of trial in your process? Thanks so much.","Dan Schulman","I'll start off with that. Obviously, we've worked closely with JP Morgan Chase over the last couple of years actually, as we've talked about the potential for how we might work together. And I'm really pleased with where we came out in this partnership. We both see a lot of value in it, if two very strong companies lending what are really impressive assets to create consumer experiences, including as you mentioned processing through Chase Net which obviously does give the potential. We are not talking about any deal terms one way or another, but potential for lower cost from that. So I'm really pleased with the comprehensive nature of the partnership that we have with Chase because time to work through all the details of it. But I think both of us are really good about and really good about what we can drive coming out of that.","John Rainey","And I would just add to that, again we're not coming on the deal terms, anyone specific deal. The closer working relationship that we now have with the broader financial ecosystem, as you look through a broad lens of how you think about cost whether that\u2019s customer acquisition or risk in fraud losses, all these types of things, we as one of the largest drivers of middle transaction for banks and issuers. And then that being place that is when the larger structure growth for banks and issuers, the opportunity for us to collaborate across the number of frauds across the ecosystem is quite meaningful we believe.","We see that across these partnerships, it's not just about what the cost processing a transaction, but how can we think about delivering better digital experiences to customers that has impact, positive impact on customer engagement, on customer acquisition cost, and how we think about the lifetime value of the customer risk, all these things. The opportunity collaborate with the ecosystem has many, many potential positives across the number of those things. And that\u2019s something we feel very encouraged by in the conversations that we have and relationships we build in.","Dan Schulman","I think you just think about things like reward points, Discover, Chase, Citi have all decided that utilizing the reward points within the PayPal platform to utilize those for purchases that are 17 million merchants. That\u2019s a real significant differentiation for those particular financial institutions and their customers who are using their instruments, but also for PayPal because you now can utilize those reward points in a split transaction. You have X number of reward points, but maybe couldn\u2019t do that full transaction. You can now split that, you can use this reward points to purchase 40% of which we are going to do and then the other 60% can be done to whatever funding instrument you select as a consumer.","That\u2019s a little over a cost funding mechanism as well for us so. There are all sorts of things within these relationships that we have, they try to enhance value for our mutual customers that, if you parse through them, it's really quite significant and differentiated from where we were certainly a year or so ago. Now the in-store stuff, we obviously now have the ability to use industry tokens from these Mastercard and others. And now, we are working with each of the FIs to use their tokens for their particular instruments. And so, you will start to see that\u2019s just a naturally begins our rollout.","There really is much of a trial and error per se on this. We will have the ability for our PayPal customer, if they are opted into one of the bank services that\u2019s provided token, we will use network tokens with that. And you will simply be able to use that instrument seamlessly across where actually it is accepted now on android phone for instance across in-app experience, online experience, or an in-store experience without us having to do bespoke customization of software at the point of sale terminal. So that would just be a natural rollout utilizing existing POS technology.","Okay, so thank you for that last question, Bryan. And thanks everybody for joining us. We really appreciate your time and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon.
