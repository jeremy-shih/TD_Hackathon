My name is Juana and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bank\u2019s Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Jim Eglseder, you may begin your conference.","Jim Eglseder","Thanks, Juana and good morning. Today, we will be talking with you about our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results. This discussion may contain certain forward-looking statements about Fifth Third pertaining to our financial condition, results of operations, plans and objectives. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from historical performances and these statements. We have identified some of these factors in our forward-looking cautionary statement at the end of our earnings release and in other materials and we encourage you to review them. Fifth Third undertakes no obligation and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call.","I am joined on the call by several people today. Our President and CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Chief Operating Officer, Lars Anderson; Chief Risk Officer, Frank Forrest; and our Treasurer, Jamie Leonard. During the question-and-answer period, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator.","With that, I will turn the call over to Greg.","Greg Carmichael","Thanks, Jim and thank all of you for joining us this morning. For 2015, we reported full year net income available to common shareholders of $1.6 billion. Our full year earnings growth of 60% reflected significant returns from the sale of a portion of our Vantiv ownership and thoughtful management of our balance sheet given the uncertain pace of interest rate increases. 2015 was an important year of accomplishments and results were highlighted by return on assets of 1.22% and return on common equity of 11.3%. Despite the $94 million impact of the deposit advance product, our net interest income was relatively flat. We invest in our businesses and the talent across the organization strengthens our balance sheet and further enhanced our risk and compliance infrastructure.","Full year net interest income declined only 1% as growth otherwise offset the lost revenue from the reduction in income related to the deposit advance product. Year-over-year core fee income growth was 3%. As we grow fee income, we will seek to add capital efficient and growth-oriented products and services in order to deepen client relationships. Our intention is to reduce our dependency on more volatile spread income or complementing an already rich menu of products that we offer our clients. Along those lines, you may have seen our recent announcement regarding the hiring of a long-tenured insurance executive who have successfully grown and run and integrated bank-owned insurance program. We are excited about this business and we will explore other areas of opportunity for expansion of products and services we offer today.","As we are maintaining our focus on revenue growth, we are keeping operating leverage on the top of our priority list. While expenses were up this year, we are confident in our ability to return to positive operating leverage once the increases in our risk and compliance areas begin to flatten, which we believe will happen later this year. As we said on many occasions, we will continue to invest in our businesses while we look to partially fund those investments through savings in our core operations and investments in our future capabilities. Tayfun will cover some additional details of our investments so you can get a better idea of the impact and trajectory we are looking at. We are committed to achieving positive operating leverage and we believe we have the right plans in place to make that happen.","For 2015, average core deposits were up 6% for the year, while average loan balances were up 2%, resulting in a core deposit-to-loan ratio of 106%. Balance sheet strength is a core focus for me and my team as our goal is to be a top performer across the business cycle with lower volatility of earnings. We continue to reposition the loan portfolio for consistent performance through the cycle as we focus on higher quality relationships. This is the path we have been pursuing for the last several years as you can see in the average PDs of our commercial book that we have discussed in our some of our presentations over the last year. More recently, we have taken actions to reduce exposure to certain sectors in order to reduce the sources of some of our early earnings volatility. Tayfun will discuss some of our efforts in this commentary.","Looking beyond some of the discreet items in 2015, underlying credit performance and metrics continued to improve as NPAs and delinquencies remains at levels that we have not seen since before the crisis. Our intention is to operate a business model with better credit performance predictability. With our focus on operating metrics, we also made significant progress on our strategic plans throughout the year. We announced plans to rationalize parts of our branch network, which will save $60 million annually. We closed or sold 41 branches last year and we have two transactions that are scheduled to close near the end of the first quarter that included additional 34 branches. In total, we are about two-thirds of the way through the project and we expect the remaining 32 branches to be closed by June 30.","Also during the year, we concluded three significant legal settlements and reduced the size of our Vantiv position. I know I have covered many of these items before, but I think it\u2019s important for us to highlight the pattern of active, disciplined decision-making we have demonstrated as we continue to reposition the company for future success. Vantiv continue to be a source of significant returns for our shareholders and the year was capped by a number of transactions related to our ownership. We have taken important steps towards reducing our direct ownership stake in Vantiv in the best interest of our stakeholders, while reducing a significant amount of volatility associated with our warrant position. During the fourth quarter, we sold approximately 8 million shares, sold or settled two-thirds of the warrant and sold a portion of future TRA payments, which unlock nearly $0.5 billion of value. Vantiv continues to perform well and we are happy to participate in their success.","To maximize returns to our shareholders, we executed in a well-planned manner on all three pieces of our financial interest namely: the TRA, warrants and direct ownership. We still hold a significant ownership stake in the company, which we believe will result in healthy returns for our shareholders. For the third consecutive year, we returned more than 75% of our earnings back to shareholders. We expect that would rank us near the top of our peers. In 2015, we returned 42% of earnings via share buybacks, which reduced our share count by 39 million shares. Dividends represent 30% of earnings and combined, we achieved a core payout ratio of 72%. In addition to our core payout ratio, the Vantiv proceeds were used to repurchase an additional 9.25 million shares of our common stock. In aggregate, we have returned 78% of our earnings back to shareholders.","So, now a few comments about the fourth quarter. We reported net income to common shareholders of $634 million in earnings per diluted share of $0.79, including $0.38 of volumes that Tayfun will go over in more detail. The largest impact on the quarter was the monetization of a portion of our ownership in Vantiv that I just mentioned.","Core fourth quarter results were in line with our expectations. We view the Fed December rate move as a positive first step towards a normalized environment, but there is uncertainty around the extent and timing of the future rate decisions. Our loan growth was impacted by larger than normal pay-downs and payoffs. However, we are starting the year with a strong origination activity and our outlook for 2016 remains in line with the nominal GDP outlook. Fourth quarter reflects the efforts to position ourselves for growth. We are refocusing our resources on businesses with higher growth return potential that will enable us to achieve our objective of outperformance through the cycle. In addition to that, we are making investments in infrastructure designed to improve our service delivery and efficiency.","Our fee business has produced stable results despite lower levels of capital markets activity. We are pleased with the low level charge-offs of 34 basis points. We are closely managing our expenses with a sharp focus on extracting efficiencies from our day-to-day operations. Our non-interest expense in the fourth quarter was up 2% driven by risk management technology investments and a substantial contribution to our charitable foundation. Current results reflect the ongoing benign environment. We are cognizant of global volatilities that are creating anxiety in the markets, but we believe that our exposures are conservatively underwritten and we have limited aggregate exposures in the more volatile sectors. We view 2016 as an important transition year as we position our company to achieve operating leverage in a sustainable manner regardless of the rate environment.","In 2015, we have taken important steps in that direction and we will continue our efforts in 2016. We are working on long-term revenue growth as well as expense efficiencies to achieve our goal. We have taken actions to reduce run rate expenses in order to partially fund strategic investments and we expect expenses related to our risk and compliance infrastructure to peak in 2016. We will continue to reallocate resources to improve profitability with reduced volatility. We are committed to achieving the industry leading level of operational results that you have historically seen from us. Our 18,000 employees are our most important asset and I am extremely proud of what they accomplished in 2015. They did a great job of taking care of our customers and driving shareholder value. I want to thank all of our employees for their hard work and dedication in 2015 and I look forward to their contributions to our success in 2016.","Thank you. With that, I will turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our fourth quarter operating results and our outlook for the remainder of the year.","Tayfun Tuzun","Thanks Greg. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Let\u2019s start with the financial summary on Page 3 of the presentation. For the fourth quarter, we reported net income to common shareholders of $634 million or $0.79 per diluted share. There were a number of items that affected earnings in the quarter as Greg mentioned. These items can be found on Page 2 of our release and the net impact was a benefit of $0.38 per share. We have been patient and deliberate in our actions related to our Vantiv ownership and we have delivered significant value to our shareholders. The benefits of the transactions are sufficiently self evident.","With that, let\u2019s move to the average balance sheet on Page 4 of the presentation. Average portfolio balances were $221 million higher than the third quarter and the period end balances were down about $1 billion as payoffs and pay downs, especially in December impacted our net growth. The payoffs were higher than expected, especially in commercial real estate, which reached almost $1 billion this quarter as construction projects refinanced into permanent financing. During the quarter, we maintained our strategy of keeping a shorter duration in our commercial real estate portfolio. Some of these payoffs were slated for the first quarter and as such, it was a timing issue as they exited the portfolio earlier than expected. In addition, we have actively reduced exposures in certain segments of the portfolio such as commodity trading, in line with our goal to reduce volatility, especially in the current environment. I would like to point out that although the market sensitivity to the economic environment increased over the last few weeks, we discussed our rather cautious perspective on the economic environment with you in October and indicated that our actions reflected our views on the overall economic conditions and the age of the current credit cycle.","As some of the production also shifted from the fourth quarter into the first, we are starting the year with a healthy amount of activity. New production coupons have remained stable, but the credit spread widening seen in the high yield market has not yet reached bank loan credit spreads. Consumer loans were flat with last quarter and continue to display similar trends to recent quarters. Average investment securities increased by $700 million in the fourth quarter or 2% sequentially. Average core deposits increased $1 billion from the third quarter, driven by higher demand deposit and money market account balances. Our LCR ratio was 115% at the end of the quarter.","Moving to NII on Page 5 of the presentation, taxable equivalent net interest income decreased $2 million sequentially to $904 million, primarily driven by the full quarter impact of the $2.4 billion of wholesale debt issuances in the third quarter and our auto loan securitization completed in November. The net interest margin was 285 basis points, down 4 basis points from the third quarter, driven by the impact of those debt issuances, slower prepayments reducing net discount accretion on the investment portfolio and an increased short-term cash position during the quarter. Our margin for the second half of the year was 2.87%. The results related to NII and NIM were very much in line with our expectations and guidance.","Shifting to fees on Page 6 of the presentation, fourth quarter non-interest income was $1.1 billion compared with $713 million in the third quarter. Results included a net $490 million of pretax Vantiv items we have already discussed. We show fee income, adjusted for primarily Vantiv related items on Slide 6 of $623 million, an increase of $32 million or 5% sequentially. This growth included the annual payment under our tax receivable agreement with Vantiv, which was $31 million this quarter. Corporate banking fees of $104 million were flat sequentially. The volatility towards the end of the year clearly impacted our client activity in capital markets. It is no surprise that the gap was more pronounced in loan syndications as the slowdown in those markets has been widely publicized. Mortgage banking net revenue of $74 million was up $3 million sequentially. Originations were $1.8 billion in the fourth quarter, with 49% purchase volume. 80% of the origination came from the retail and direct channels and 20% from the correspondent channel. Gain on sale margins were up 6 basis points sequentially.","Net servicing asset valuation adjustments, which include amortization and valuation adjustments, were negative $16 million this quarter versus negative $29 million last quarter. Deposit service charges decreased 1% from the third quarter and increased 1% relative to the fourth quarter of 2014. Deposit service charges this quarter were impacted by a 3% reduction in consumer service charges, primarily due to a roll out in the fourth quarter of a more simplified checking product line up. Total investment advisory revenue of $102 million decreased 1% sequentially, primarily due to lower retail brokerage revenues, partially offset by personal asset management and specialty services revenue growth.","We show non-interest expense on Page 7 of the presentation. Expenses were $963 million compared with $943 million in the third quarter. The sequential increase was primarily due to a $10 million contribution to Fifth Third Foundation, technology expenses and higher net occupancy expense, which was partially impacted by the real estate decisions in one of the consumer markets that we are exiting this year. Our total employee expenses were up approximately $65 million in 2015. That number included the impact of inflationary adjustments, severance, as well as the change in the composition of our total employee base. Although our year-over-year headcount is down, the reduction is mainly in our retail branch network and the adds are in risk and compliance. By nature of those job functions, the average compensation related to our new employees is higher than those that left the bank.","During the year, we added 373 people in our risk and compliance functions for an incremental compensation cost of approximately $21 million and that number will continue to grow in 2016. I will share those details with you shortly. As expected, our technology expenses increased this quarter, although somewhat less than we anticipated. Project calendars typically impact our technology expenditures, but in general, the direction is in line with our expectations and guidance. Card and processing expenses were also up, primarily on costs associated with our EMV project. We are spending a lot of time on controllable expenses with all of our business lines and will continue to enforce a tight level of control on our operations.","Turning to credit results on Page 8, net charge-offs were $80 million or 34 basis points in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, in the third quarter, excluding the student loan backed commercial credit, net charge-offs were $86 million or 37 basis points. As expected, we returned to more normalized charge-off levels this quarter. Non-performing assets, excluding loans held for sale, increased $41 million from the previous quarter to $647 million, bringing the NPL ratio to 55 basis points and the NPA ratio to 70 basis points. Within commercial, NPAs increased $49 million from the third quarter, primarily due to an $89 million increase in C&I partially offset by a $38 million decline in commercial real estate NPAs. Consumer NPAs decreased $8 million from the third quarter to 62 basis points, primarily driven by a $5 million decline in Residential Mortgage and a $5 million decline in home equity NPAs.","Our consumer loan portfolio has continued to show steady improvement throughout the year reflective of the high credit quality standards that we are maintaining in our underwriting. The allowance for loan and lease losses increased $11 million. The resulting reserve coverage is at 1.37% of loans and leases compared with 1.35% last quarter and 252% of NPLs.","As we discussed last quarter, we are cognizant of where we are in the credit cycle. The global concerns associated with a diverse set of factors reaching from geopolitical to fundamental economic performance are well-known. Although we are a predominantly domestic bank, it is difficult to take comfort purely around the health of the U.S. economy relative to the rest of the world. In this environment and in light of the absolute low levels of our credit metrics, we need to point out that these levels maybe subject to potential volatility from time to time. As an added element of credit discussion, given the global economic weakness and volatility, certain segments in commercial lending are appropriately getting more attention and we would like to review our portfolio more closely with you with respect to these industries on Slide 9.","In isolation and in aggregate, our exposures in these three sectors are small both relative to our total capital as well as relative to our total loans. Our energy portfolio outstanding at the end of the quarter was $1.7 billion relatively small at 2% of the portfolio. Of this amount, just under half are in senior secured reserve based loans. Outstandings in the energy portfolio increased $107 million from the third quarter with growth in the midstream sector. At current forward strip oil prices, we continued to remain appropriately secured preserving our previous statements about our loss given default exposures on the RBL secured portfolio. So far, we had no exposures to any of the E&P companies that have filed for bankruptcy. The outstanding balances of roughly $300 million in oilfield services have a higher propensity for loss given default.","In the fourth quarter, $22 million of the increase in NPLs came from the oilfield services sector within the energy portfolio. We are monitoring our energy portfolio very closely, including stress testing in the portfolio for lower oil price scenarios. Should low oil prices persist through 2017, we will see continued reserve build and increased credit costs over that same period.","We discussed our commodity trading exposure with you last quarter and during that conversation, we indicated our intent to effectively exit a large majority of our relationships. We are now reporting to you that our outstandings have declined to approximately $300 million, down by 34% since the second quarter. Furthermore, the credit distribution of the remaining outstandings is indicative of the quality of the portfolio as we will continue to wind it down. To repeat what we said before, this is a short-term portfolio and we will execute the planned exits with no expected losses. Our proactive efforts here demonstrate our willingness to act decisively.","In commercial real estate, while our growth in the last two years has been strong, it should be viewed in the context of a low starting point after being less active for a few years. Fifth Third\u2019s portfolio is one of the smallest percentages of total loans among our peers. Our current expectations for credit performance are based upon disciplined client selection, underwriting with an established conservative policies, guidelines and concentration limits that include product and geographic concentrations. Disciplined client selection relies on targeting-proven experienced developers, investors and sponsors with strong balance sheets, diversified sources of cash flow and access to capital with demonstrated resilience through the cycle. Furthermore, our underwriting standards emphasize conservative cash flows and we focus on upfront cash equity contributions relative to cost versus loan to values that can be inflated by historically low cap rates.","For each market, we conduct our own dilution analysis and focus on markets with multiple demand drivers and lower volatility. Specific to multifamily, we are sensitive not only to market demand and household generation, but also affordability as in some markets rents are rising faster than wages as the housing market returns. This has caused us to back off in certain markets. In short, we feel very comfortable with our commercial real estate exposure albeit a small percentage of loans.","Looking at capital on Slide 10, capital levels continue to be strong. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 9.8% from 9.4%, a very strong quarterly move, especially given the impact of buybacks associated with Vantiv gains. In addition to the level of income, the reduction in the size of the warrant position, which reduced our risk-weighted assets contributed to the increase in the ratio.","At the end of the fourth quarter, common shares outstanding were down approximately $10 million. During the quarter, we announced the common stock repurchase of $215 million from Vantiv proceeds, which settled on the January 14 and reduced the fourth quarter share count by 9.25 million shares. As Greg mentioned, our payout ratio was very healthy at above 75% this year. In light of our discussions about the ongoing investments in our risk and compliance infrastructure as well as other strategic investments, we have provided more details on the nature of some of these investments as well as our financial expectations. These details are provided on Slide 11 and 12.","We are going through a period of higher investments and added expenses related to the enhancements in our risk and compliance infrastructure. These expenses are mostly related to headcount in compliance in other areas in risk management, including operational risk. But in addition to higher compensation expense, we are also investing in technology.","As you can see on Slide 11, the incremental expenses have had a significant impact on our run-rate in 2015 and will impact the run-rate in 2016 as well. While we added 373 employees in risk and compliance, we reduced the total employee count in other areas by 464 in 2015 resulting in a net decrease of 91. As we have shared with you in the past, we expect the rate of increase in our compensation expense in risk and compliance to peak this year. As such, we don\u2019t expect to see a repeat of this picture in 2017. We also don\u2019t expect to see a similar increase in technology expenses associated with our risk and compliance infrastructure beyond 2016.","On Slide 12, we wanted to give you a perspective on the nature of some of these investments in our retail and consumer businesses and also provide you with our expectations on the level and timing of the financial returns. As you know, we have already taken significant steps by focusing on optimizing branch staffing through both job family redesign and headcount reductions, while at the same time reengineering our branch operating model and network. By reinvesting a portion of these savings in the business, we believe that we have a significant opportunity to accelerate our digital capabilities to reap the benefits of increased customer satisfaction, revenue growth and continued operational efficiency.","Specifically, the investment in our integrated customer experience and branch digitization infrastructure is a critical component of our consumer bank strategy. Our omni-channel approach, one that truly integrates all of our customer\u2019s touch points across our physical, virtual and digital channels reflects the changes in customer demographics as well as the broader shift in customer behavior. These investments will enable our customers to connect with the banks seamlessly from activities that range from how they obtain advice, to open accounts, to complete simple transactions. In addition to improved revenue prospects of all products, we expect significant cost savings, especially when combined with our investments in branch digitization and back office automation.","Although we are in the middle of executing our branch optimization strategy, our investments here could potentially provide other opportunities, which will depend on our future success in execution and the timing and extent of our change in our customer\u2019s behavior. The financial returns associated with these investments are very attractive and not based on aggressive assumptions about the overall economic conditions. As such, we are not delaying the timing even in the current low growth environment. The payback periods are short and are meaningfully contributive to income going forward. The financial returns are expected to be even higher as a result of improved customer service quality. We believe that our shareholders will be rewarded well with these investments.","In combination, we will incur higher expenses in both risk and compliance and strategic investments in 2016, which will elevate the expense growth this year. As our outlook for the year will show you, we are funding a portion of these investments with savings in our operations. For example, we expect our total compensation expenses this year to increase by roughly the same amount as the increase in the risk and compliance related compensation, which means that we are expecting no additional increase in total compensation in other areas, excluding one-time expenses, despite merit increases and other inflationary factors. The positive year-over-year impact on revenues associated with our strategic investments beyond 2016 and the beneficial impact of flattening expenses combined for a positive \u2013 for a very positive impact on operating leverage in earnings.","Turning to the outlook, our basic economic outlook is based on recent consensus market expectations of 2% to 3% real U.S. GDP growth with low inflation. On average, we should expect our industry to achieve overall loan growth approximating GDP growth. In commercial lending, we expect our loan growth to exceed 3%, supported partially by our strategic investments. We expect to see a decline in consumer loan portfolio, including the impact of the loan sales associated with our exit from St. Louis and Pittsburgh markets in the first half of this year, which is approximately $270 million. Outside the asset sales, the largest impact will come from our auto loan portfolio where we expect no improvement in market conditions to increase the shareholder returns. With the LCR-related investments largely behind us, our portfolio investments will be opportunistic in this environment. We expect to increase the size of the portfolio, but the timing will be dependent on rates and other balance sheet dynamics. In our outlook, we have two rate increases in 2016, one in June and one in September. In that scenario, based upon our outlook for loan growth, we expect a roughly 2% to 3% increase in NII on a year-over-year basis.","NIM should also expand 3 basis points to 4 basis points from the fourth quarter 2015 level as the benefit of future rate hikes is partially offset by loan yield compression and potential funding actions. If there are no further rate increases in 2016 and including the impact of the dividend reduction on the Fed stockholdings, we would expect a slightly higher NII and a stable NIM compared with full year 2015 levels, given a more conservative outlook on loan growth based on the economic environment that would lead to Feds in action. While recognizing the challenges in the current environment, especially in the oil and gas sector, at this point in our base case outlook, we still expect our credit performance to remain relatively stable. We expect our provision to exceed charge-offs in 2016. We currently expect our non-interest income to increase between 4% and 5%, excluding the impact of 2015 Vantiv-related gains.","Moving to expenses, as we just discussed 2016 is an important transition year in our company. It is a year in which we will start executing a number of strategic investments, which will lead to accelerated revenue growth, expense savings as well as operational excellence company wide with a reasonably short payback period. As we also just discussed, we expect to see the slope of our risk and compliance related expenses to flatten this year. When combined with our run rate earnings growth, this picture bodes very well for our outlook beyond 2016, with an improved earnings project trajectory. More importantly, we are going through this transition as we continue to grow our revenues and achieve solid return on our shareholders\u2019 capital in 2016.","Except for the increases in compensation related to risk and compliance that I just covered, excluding any one-time items we expect to keep our total compensation expenses flat this year including ongoing inflationary adjustments, merit increases and performance-based compensation. We expect roughly a $60 million increase in our technology expenses. As we just discussed, these investments have either very attractive return profile and\/or are related to improvements in our infrastructure. Our year-over-year total expense growth is expected to be approximately 4.5% to 5% over our reported expenses in 2015, including an estimate for the impact of the proposed change in the FDIC assessment fee and the estimated one-time impact of an early retirement offer that is currently available to eligible employees, which will reduce our run rate expenses going forward.","The growth is exaggerated partly due to an increase in the amortization of our low-income housing investments in 2016 and other one-time benefits that we experienced in 2015. Together, these two items make-up approximately 2% of the increase in total expenses. In addition, as we just shared with you that we expect an increase approximately $75 million in total expenses related to our risk and compliance infrastructure, which is another 2% of our total expense base in 2015. Our intent is to show that we are funding all other expense growth including non-risk related strategic investments, with savings elsewhere as these two items add up in dollar terms to a large portion of our entire year-over-year increase. For the first quarter, we expect net interest margin to be up 2 basis points to 3 basis points as the impact of the rate increase and day count is offset by the loan yield compression and the Fed dividend cut. Within NII, the reduction of the Fed dividend rate, loan yield compression and one less day in the quarter were slightly more than offset the benefit of the December rate increase and will result in a decline of about $5 million.","Total fee income should be similar to last year\u2019s first quarter as most fee revenue lines, including deposit fees, card and processing revenue and corporate banking fees tend to be seasonably low. And we will not have the benefit of the Vantiv TRA payment in the first quarter. We will see higher expenses in the quarter, primarily due to seasonally higher FICA and unemployment expense, much like we saw last year, continued investment in risk management and compliance and the impact from the early retirement offer. We currently expect net charge-offs to be approximately in line with the first quarter 2015 levels. We also would like to remind you that the revenue expectations that we shared with you today do not include potential but currently un-forecasted items such as Vantiv warrant marks or gains or losses on share sales. Our goal is to solidify our earnings growth trajectory and improve shareholder returns and we have a plan to achieve that.","With that, I will turn it over to Greg for closing comments.","Greg Carmichael","Thanks Tayfun. In closing, 2016 is an important transition year for our company. We are investing in our businesses and infrastructure to improve the returns to our shareholders beyond the near-term and to grow our company profitably through this cycle with lower volatility. We will continue to manage and grow our exposures prudently, especially in recognition of the current volatility. And we look forward to sharing our progress with you throughout the year.","With that, Juana, please open the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brian Foran with Autonomous. Your line is open.","Brian Foran","Hi, good morning.","Greg Carmichael","Good morning.","Brian Foran","Maybe on the credit, appreciate the comments on the 1Q \u201816 charge-off expectations in the broader message that things are stable, so I don\u2019t want to miss the forest for the trees, but zeroing in just on C&I and some of the deterioration in NPAs there, that you and others have seen, I mean I guess in your experience, what are the best leading indicators you watch for commercial credit and what are they telling you right now, both overall and maybe specifically, if you exclude energy, is everything else stable, improving or getting worse, are there any the industries that are starting to pop-up on your watch list beyond energy?","Frank Forrest","Hi, this is Frank. Good question. Our \u2013 first off, our non-performing assets were up 5 basis points to 70 basis points. That\u2019s still at a low point for us over the past 7 years to 8 years and it compares very favorably to our peers. We are down 12 basis points year-over-year or $97 million overall. The increases that we saw were a couple of energy credits that are quite frankly are just making their way through the restructuring process, which is to be expected. And then it was really just spread over a number of smaller middle market credits on a couple of leveraged credits, so there was nothing there that jumped out as far as sectors. We do look at high yield spreads, there is clearly a correlation between high yield spreads and future loan losses on the commercial sector and we follow that and they are going up both on the energy side and outside of the energy side. So, we will continue to monitor and watch that over time. But our performance overall, the core of our middle market book, the mid cap book and the large cap book is still performing very, very well outside of energy, to answer your question, with no really discernible trends either in geography or products that are cause for concern at this time. So, our intent is up like everybody else. We are looking at a lot of leading indicators. We are managing credit very closely. But at this point, we still feel good overall about our portfolio for the year. As you recall, we had one outlier in the third quarter, which was a large student loan that was made back in 2007 that we restructured and rode off. But if you exclude that one large problem loan, our charge-offs for the year for the entire company were very tightly ranged between 34 basis points and 41 basis points, so very predicable. And at this point, we have only $22 million in NPAs and the energy sector that could change, but at this point, it\u2019s 1.3% of the energy book. So, I hope that\u2019s responsive to your question.","Brian Foran","That\u2019s very responsive. It\u2019s a little depressing that you first got service back to the front of the conference calls, but I appreciate the help and that\u2019s all I had.","Frank Forrest","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Erika Najarian with BofA Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Erika Najarian","Hi, good morning.","Greg Carmichael","Good morning.","Erika Najarian","Could you remind us in terms of how the Fed treats some of the outsized gains from Vantiv relative to your ability to buyback stock? We understand that beyond your \u2013 the core PPNR you generate, you are allowed to use some of the gains to buyback stock. I am wondering if I am calculating gains of $490 million related to Vantiv this quarter, how much of that is free for buybacks according to your 2015 approved plan?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes. This is Tayfun, Erika. So, we have \u2013 as we have done over the past, I think 3 years, we have asked and obtained approval to convert after-tax net gains on share sales into buybacks. So, the portion of the gains from direct after-tax gains, are eligible for buybacks and that\u2019s indicative of the size of the buyback that we executed this year. The warrant gains whether they are through sales of the warrants or whether they are through mark-to-market or not, they are not part of it, because they are just a mark-to-market. And then the TRA transaction which generated $49 million in gains also is not part of our CCAR application. We clearly will be reviewing our perspectives on these types of transactions in the upcoming CCAR process and we will update you as to our thoughts when we are ready to do that for you.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And just a second follow-up question I think. We really appreciate the fact that 2016 is a transition year for expenses and thank you for the detail on expenses. I am wondering as we look beyond the transition year, Greg, what do you think is natural range in terms of the efficiency ratio for this company as you think about the puts and takes in terms of the benefits of these investments? And I guess a range is appreciated given that everybody has different assumptions for the rate outlook?","Greg Carmichael","Thanks, Erika. First off, when you look at these investments, as Tayfun mentioned, they are very short-term returns. So, we are very committed to these investments and executing well against these investments both from an efficiency perspective and from a revenue opportunity. That\u2019s why we are making those investments. At the end of the day, when you look at our long-term view and efficiency ratio in the mid-50, sub-60 is extremely important to us and we are never going to lose sight of that to get back to that level. We believe these investments being made now and early executed well will allow us to move in that direction sooner than later.","Erika Najarian","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Miller with FBR. Your line is open.","Greg Carmichael","Good morning, Paul.","Tayfun Tuzun","Good morning, Paul.","Greg Carmichael","Okay. Well, let\u2019s move to the next one and then we will take Paul\u2019s question later when he comes back.","Operator","Okay. Your next question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Greg Carmichael","Hey, Matt.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Good morning.","Greg Carmichael","Good morning, Matt.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Circling back on the expense outlook, can you give us some of the pieces in terms of the FDIC cost increase that you expect I know it\u2019s hitting everyone and then also the early retirement hit?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes. Let me make a comment on the early retirement and then I will turn it over to Jamie for the FDIC comment. The early retirement, we are just still in the process. We don\u2019t know exactly what the exact numbers are, Matt. So, we will give you an update at the end of the quarter on that as we still need to go through the process.","Jamie Leonard","Yes. Matt, on the FDIC, the way we have embedded it in the outlook is that this would be a quarterly run-rate item, not a one-time charge. And for us, the gross impact annually is about $50 million. But then within the proposed rules, you would get a rebate or a credit against that. So, the net impact to us is about $25 million a year.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay. And then what I am trying to get at is as we think about the kind of exit expense base coming out of the 2016 into 2017 and the early retirement hit, we obviously would back out. I don\u2019t know about the amortization and tax benefits going up, but I am just trying to get a sense of ballpark, how many of the things that you provided for 2016 may drop off as we get to 2017, including the ramp up in some of the risk compliance technology, I don\u2019t know if those just flatten out or they actually go down?","Tayfun Tuzun","Let me take it and then I will turn it over to Greg for broader comments on the directions. In terms of the individual items, we shared with you the risk and compliance-related increase. As we discussed, we expect that increase to flatten and it is clearly our goal to closely look at all of our expense adds there, look at all the processes and look for opportunities to reengineer some of these processes and include some technological solutions which we believe are possible. It\u2019s typical to yet estimate what that impact would be. In terms of the low income housing piece, I can tell you that our estimated year-over-year increase in that line item is about $30 million from \u201815 into \u201816. So, that we will update you and we will see if the activity level and the economics in that portfolio would continue in that direction. It\u2019s difficult to estimate that at this point. So, as we are exiting 2016, as we look ahead assuming the two rate increases that we built into our forecast on the revenue side assuming that we hit the non-interest income growth that we shared with you, we would be exiting this year at a lower efficiency ratio compared to the first half of the year. I mean, we will be moving towards low 60s, there is no question based on this outlook.","Greg Carmichael","The only thing I would add, Matt, is when you look at these investments, especially around risk and compliance and associated investments in technology and supporting those initiatives, we also expect to continue to see improvement in our operational losses. For our losses, legal reserves and so forth would naturally be an outcome we expect to get and are going to work hard to make sure we realize those benefits also as we go into 2017.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay, thanks for all the color.","Greg Carmichael","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Matt Burnell","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just maybe a question for you, Tayfun, in terms of the demand for loans, I know you mentioned that you are expecting loan growth in 2016 will be roughly the same rate as real GDP. That\u2019s a little bit lower than you would normally expect. So, I guess I am curious where you are seeing lower levels of demand and I presume that the market challenges have only been a couple of weeks, so that has really not weighed on borrower sentiment, but how long would that have to continue before borrowers might get more, might get even more cautious in terms of borrowing?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes. I am going to give you a brief response and will turn it over to Lars Anderson to give his perspectives on loan growth, especially on the commercial side. Overall, as you know, our total loan portfolio has done pretty well especially with strength in commercial. On the consumer side with deliberate actions on auto loan portfolio, we have clearly experienced the lower growth rate in the past year or two and we are projecting that into 2016 as we are not seeing changes in economic conditions. But in return, we are spending \u2013 our retail and consumer loan teams are spending quite a bit of time in moving the direction in home equity loans and credit cards up. And we are confident that some of these strategic and tactical moves will improve growth rates in those two portfolios. Now, we have always been cautious in terms of guiding the market for loan growth, as we do believe that in general our sector over a long period of time should match GDP growth. But clearly, in interim periods, we will have strategic actions to go over that. And so with that I am going to turn it over to Lars because I think he has good feedback and color on those actions what we are thinking about the commercial loan portfolio.","Lars Anderson","Yes. Thank you, Tayfun. And frankly as recently as just the last few days I have had interaction with a number of clients in the marketplace. So I think this is pretty contemporary feedback. We are seeing a growing sense of caution from our client base. And frankly, that is really across almost all of our businesses, maybe an exception could be in the healthcare sector where they continue to have a level of confidence is some of the uncertainty was taken out in the end of last year there. And frankly, we are benefiting from that as we have invested in that and we continue to see nice growth there. Our goal is going to be obviously to outperform the nominal GDP as we look at 2016 through executing our business model that I think is very well received. And that business model is really one centered on having industry expertise with some of the best bankers in the marketplace, with very well thought through developed business lines. Now those business lines like I mentioned in healthcare, in retail and a number of other verticals have clearly outperformed. But we haven\u2019t stopped there, we are continuing to look for other opportunities to move market share. We have added our gaming and leisure. We are looking at our telecom media, telecommunications group, our food and ag group, a number of other opportunities there, where we are able to attract some very high quality talent, both on the line and in credit, in order for us to I think outperform the marketplace. I would also remind you that we have very attractive geographic markets throughout our footprint. If you look at the performance of just core commercial kind of middle market businesses in North Carolina, in Chicago, in Florida and other markets on a common quarter basis, we are up over 6% over the past year. We are going to continue to execute in those markets. We have a very well received value proposition in the marketplace. We are very focused on blocking and tackling and developing deeper relationships. One last thing I would add onto that, this is not just about credit and loans, this is about relationships and relationship returns and building them for the long haul, not just for the next quarter, but for years to come and we are seeing that play out even as we speak. So I have a lot of confidence as we look at \u201916, however it us against an uncertain economic backdrop.","Matt Burnell","Thanks for that color, that\u2019s very helpful. And just finally for me, you did see quite a large percentage decline in the commodity portfolio balance, I realize it\u2019s only about $300 million now, but given the relatively short-term nature of that portfolio, you have mentioned in the past, when do you expect that will go down to zero?","Greg Carmichael","Matt, this is Greg. First off, it probably won\u2019t go to zero. We got a few key clients that are U.S. centric that we have a strong relationship with, ancillary business that we are going to continue to manage and do business with. So but you are going to expect, it will be down significantly from the \u2013 even the 300 mark on a relatively short period of time, but it will never go to zero right now.","Matt Burnell","Alright. Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from David Eads with UBS. Your line is open.","Greg Carmichael","Good morning David.","David Eads","Hi, good morning. Maybe if you guys could dig in under the service a little bit on the outlook for fee revenues, the 4% to 5% growth is pretty encouraging, but curious, kind of where \u2013 I would expect kind of maybe stronger growth in capital markets and cards, parts of that businesses and then kind of curious where you are shaking out on the mortgage and service charge side of things?","Greg Carmichael","So, just to clarify the 4% to 5% growth is based on the 2015 base adjusting for roughly $700 million in Vantiv-related gains, which includes the warrant mark to market throughout the year. So you are looking at basically about a $2.3 billion base in 2015, so the growth is off of that number.","David Eads","Sure, exactly.","Greg Carmichael","So what we are looking at is growth in capital markets, which I think Lars will provide some color on with all of our investments in added talent, we are expecting good amount of growth. I think we are expecting growth in our payments business, our payments processing should continue to give us added revenues based on our outlook. Mortgage, excluding the unpredictable MSR performance and at this point, based upon our interest rate outlook, we have to realize the tenures under 2% right now which may change some of these expectations. But under more normalized credit outlook, we would be about at the same place we were in 2015. We are expecting growth in our private banking and investment advisory business. We have done very well, that\u2019s been based on fairly stable sources of income. But the larger growth is expected to come from capital markets and I will turn it over to Lars for comments on that.","Lars Anderson","Yes. So that\u2019s frankly I think one of the most exciting opportunities that we have got on a go forward basis. Now, clearly as you know capital markets is largely influenced by the overall activity in the overall macroeconomic environment and how that leaches into the U.S. markets. Something to keep in mind today, our capital markets business is certainly heavily centered around the debt capital markets, risk management and what I am talking about that, it\u2019s interest rate risk management, commodities and FX and with the uncertainties in the market, that obviously impacted the fourth quarter. But in a more normalized environment, we have got some really talented bankers with some deep relationships. We are very well positioned. And I would tell you, in our capital markets pipeline, we are actually are setup with clients for some nice activity once there is more certainty with our clients as we move into 2016. In addition to that, we are trying to diversify our capital markets platform, build out our M&A advisory platform. And I think that we have some very nice opportunities throughout \u201816 and \u201817 on a go forward basis. And lastly, again going back to the blocking and tackling, I think we have done a really nice job of building out a really high quality wealth management family practice kind of business as a company. But where we have an opportunity is to further integrate that across our platform, to open up our commercial and corporate bank and really deepen these relationships. And I see some revenue opportunity as well a strengthening long-term relationships consistent with our long-term strategy and that\u2019s not just in our wealth management IA business that includes our treasury management products where we have a number of specific actions and initiatives that we have underway for 2016 to drive those results.","David Eads","Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And as a follow-up, just kind of curious how you think about the Vantiv stake from here, you obviously given \u2013 presumably you guys would have some desire to increase buybacks at current valuations and would you consider moving faster on Vantiv to kind of give some more dry powder there?","Greg Carmichael","Dave, we will continue looking at that opportunity. As we have demonstrated over the past, we have been very prudent on how and the timing of when we execute those opportunities, as you saw us execute in the fourth quarter very succinctly. So, there are opportunities there. We are evaluating it. And once again, we will continue to look at that through the eyes of what\u2019s best for our shareholders.","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes. I just want to remind you that when we sold our shares, the stock price was at $52. They are down to $42, despite the fact that our share price has moved down, theirs been as well. So it\u2019s always a relative perspective on just particularly the relationship between the two stock prices.","Greg Carmichael","But put to that end, we have communicated that our intention is to continue to sell down our position at Vantiv and we are going to do that in a very thoughtful methodical manner.","David Eads","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Pancari. Your line is open with Evercore.","Greg Carmichael","Hey, John.","John Pancari","Good morning. I just want to go back to the non-performers and sorry if I missed anything on that front. The increase in the commercial NPAs, again, how much of that was energy?","Frank Forrest","It was about 25% of the ultimate increase in the NPAs, almost everything else was spread out amongst middle market loans.","John Pancari","Okay. And what is the total energy non-performers as of now?","Frank Forrest","22 million.","John Pancari","Okay. And also on energy, do you have the percentage of the portfolio that\u2019s criticized? And then separately, do you have the percentage of the portfolio that\u2019s investment grade?","Frank Forrest","The percentage of the portfolio, I will give it to you in two numbers. The percentage of the portfolio that will be classified, which I think is the more meaningful number, which is the definition of a problem loan from our regulatory teams is 22%. Our criticized assets on top of that would be a total of 36%. The criticize includes loans that have potential credit weaknesses that are not well defined and they are considered a problem loan. So, 22% of our books is the way we look at it is problematic in some form of another. It doesn\u2019t mean we are going to lose money. But by definition, the problematic 70% is not. I don\u2019t have the exact percentage of what\u2019s investment grade in our portfolio. However, when you look at the distribution of the energy books, as Tayfun said it\u2019s $1.7 billion in outstandings, it\u2019s 2% of total loans, 44% of it is reserve-based and 18% is oilfield services. Those two categories make up 97% of our criticized assets. So, that\u2019s where the focus is. You take the other 36% is basically an upstream and midstream, which didn\u2019t perform very, very well and there is a fairly high percentage of those that are investment grade, but I don\u2019t have the exact percentage of those.","Greg Carmichael","And Frank, one additional thing I would add is 100% of those NPLs are in the oilfield services. They are not in midstream. They are not in our reserve-based lending portfolio.","Frank Forrest","Yes, they are. Again, we feel very good as a senior secured lender with the exposure we have in the reserve-based portfolio. And that is the bulk actually is criticized assets. When you look at where there is potential loss, it would be on the oilfield services, it\u2019s only a $300 million portfolio at the end of the day. There is about 25% of that, that\u2019s distressed at this point in time, which is a very small number relative to the size of our book and the size of our capital.","John Pancari","Okay. And then if you could remind me the updated size of the shared national credit portfolio as of December 31?","Frank Forrest","It\u2019s 46% of our total commercials.","John Pancari","46% of total commercial loans?","Frank Forrest","Yes.","John Pancari","Okay. What\u2019s the dollar amount?","Frank Forrest","Hold on, we will get it for you.","John Pancari","Okay. And then I guess also, what was the change in that portfolio linked quarter?","Frank Forrest","Yes. I see. On a linked quarter basis, that was down about $800 million.","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes. It\u2019s just under $26 billion.","Greg Carmichael","Yes. And I would also note that the number of age-ended SNC credits increased on a linked quarter basis also.","Frank Forrest","The other point on the \u2013 this comes up I think each quarter, I think the other point that percentage is a fairly high percentage. However, that portfolio has a better asset quality composition than our overall portfolio. It\u2019s predominantly investment grade, near investment grade has performed very, very well overall for us for a long period of time. We underwrite every loan for an account. We don\u2019t buy blind from anybody. We have senior bankers, most of which have come from the major money setter banks in the last two to three years both in credit and on the line and we underwrite every one of those credits that\u2019s on an account and therefore it\u2019s performing very, very well.","John Pancari","Okay. And then lastly again apologies if I missed this and if I did, you can just give me a short answer. But can you just give us your updated comments around the manufacturing environment in your markets I know you had flagged some developing concerns in that area?","Frank Forrest","Well, I will start with the second part of your question. And frankly, I do not see developing concerns at this point. In fact, the manufacturing sector continues to be very strong. The credit metrics of that profile continue to look like what we have seen over the past couple of years. They are generating high profits on a relative basis, historic basis, generating excess liquidity. I think that did lead to some of the decline in the utilization rates that we saw at the end of the quarter. I would tell you that in the southern part of our franchise, the Georgia\u2019s, Florida\u2019s and even into Florida to some extent, those markets look good as well as Michigan we began to see some recovery as well as North Carolina.","John Pancari","Okay, great. Alright, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Mayo with CLSA. Your line is open.","Greg Carmichael","Hey, Mike.","Mike Mayo","Hi. Okay, just with the expense guidance, but before we go there, what are your reserves for the energy loans?","Frank Forrest","Hi, Mike, 4.75% currently and we continue to evaluate this on a quarterly basis.","Mike Mayo","Okay. And you said, if oil stays low, you will have to increase those reserves, I guess what\u2019s the dollar amount if that\u2019s $1.7 billion times the 4.75%?","Frank Forrest","Yes.","Mike Mayo","So, how much might those reserves have to go up if oil stays at 30 or you are fine at 30 you are just talking lower?","Frank Forrest","Yes. The reserves that we have in place today are based on the current condition of the portfolio. If it goes down to $25 for a sustained period of time, then those reserves will go up. I can\u2019t tell you at this point what number that will go up, because they are not correlated directly. But certainly, they would go up if we have a continued sustained decrease in oil, but that\u2019s based on where we are today, which is what we have to use for GAAP accounting.","Mike Mayo","Okay. So, you are at least good today at $30.","Frank Forrest","Yes, we are.","Mike Mayo","Okay, good. Just how they feel better about the expense guidance? And maybe I want to make sure I have the numbers correct. So, 4.5% to 5% expense growth for 2016. So that would be about $180 million?","Frank Forrest","Yes, I mean, you are in the ballpark.","Mike Mayo","Okay. And then of that, you have $75 million for risk and compliance, $60 million for technologies, that\u2019s up to $135 million, FDIC, another $25 million, now we are up to $160 million, so most of it is for those factors?","Greg Carmichael","And Mike that\u2019s $75 million, this is Greg, included the technology associated with the risk and compliance investments.","Tayfun Tuzun","So, there is some overlap there.","Greg Carmichael","Some overlap there.","Tayfun Tuzun","But when you add up those numbers, those are very big numbers that you can see in most of that growth guidance, Mike. So, I mean, I guess what we are telling you is that we clearly are looking for efficiencies elsewhere in order to be able to fund some of these investments.","Mike Mayo","Okay. So, $75 million for risk, compliance and technology?","Tayfun Tuzun","$75 million includes the technology portion of risk and compliance. On top of that, we have additional non-risk and compliance strategic investments. So, $75 million is just -- the total \u2013 the $75 million is the increase related to total expenses in risk and compliance, compensation plus technology.","Mike Mayo","And the non-risk strategic investment expense delta is what again?","Tayfun Tuzun","We expect our IT expenses to go up by 25%, which is roughly $60 million, so the difference would be everything else that we do.","Mike Mayo","Okay. So, if we still get to most of that, so non-risk strategic investments are $60 million, tech for risk and compliance, $75 million and FDIC assessment, net $25 million?","Greg Carmichael","No, I just want to clarify this. Total expenses related to risk and compliance, which includes compensation and IT, is about $75 million. Total increase in IT is roughly, let\u2019s say, $60 million, $65 million. Of that, there is a portion of those already in risk and compliance, which is roughly I think if I am not mistaken, $20 million type. So, there is another $40 million in IT in addition to the $20 million that goes to risk, which adds up to the $60 million type increase in IT expenses in the year.","Mike Mayo","Okay, so $75 million plus $40 million plus $25 million?","Greg Carmichael","And then the $25 million is the FDIC related. And then also there is some expected numbers around the early retirement that we have included in our guidance. So, when you add them all up and that\u2019s why we are optimistic about the beyond 2016 growth because some of \u2013 a number of those will not show up as a year-over-year increase once we get to the end of 2016.","Mike Mayo","Okay. So, then your revenue guidance, I guess you are guiding for negative operating leverage here just I guess 4% to 5% higher core fees, but only slightly higher NII if rates don\u2019t go up, so...?","Greg Carmichael","We are not guiding to operating leverage if rates don\u2019t go up.","Mike Mayo","So I guess \u2013 I have just moved the lens back a little bit, so Greg you are new CEO and you have a chance to put your imprint on the organization and you are coming in there and you are spending a lot of money and this isn\u2019t unique just to Fifth Third, I mean you have other banks that absorb these higher expenses and still at least try to get positive operating leverage, I know maybe you see a great opportunity for 2 or 3 years out and you say, hey it\u2019s worth having this negative operating leverage upfront to have even better positive operating leverage down the road, but how do you reconcile the idea that other banks have similar expenses, but aren\u2019t guiding for this degree of negative operating leverage if rates don\u2019t go up with the idea of hey you are a new CEO, you see some unique opportunities down the road, it\u2019s worth it?","Greg Carmichael","Mike, I would really as we said before this is a transition. We do see those unique opportunities and we know how to implement technology. Every investment we are making in technology and when you just heard the numbers, we are really focused on either driving efficiencies that we are going to get paid for in short order, a whole branch digitalization or new mortgage loan platform, mobile enhancements fraud detection, those type of things we are going to get paid for in 2017. In addition to that, the focus on driving revenue, revenue in the near-term that will materialize as we go through into 2016 and into 2017, a very meaningful to the health of our business. And then on the compliance side of the house, we have to make those investments and that really gets focused on the quality of everything we do and we should see the benefit of that as I mentioned earlier, we expect to lower legal reserves, lower operational losses that we absolutely are expecting a little model wind to 2017 as we move into those years. But they are extremely important investments. We are going to make those investments, it is transformational and we will get paid well for those. And as we move into 2017, you will see those outcomes.","Tayfun Tuzun","And Mike, I also want to remind you I have mentioned this during my script, about $30 million of that expense increase is related to the increased amortization in our low income housing investments, so you need to add that as well.","Mike Mayo","That\u2019s helpful. Last follow-up, so for looking to 2017 for like the really nice payback, what metric can you hold out there saying, hey this is really what we are looking for either in 2017, by the end of 2017?","Greg Carmichael","So look, I mean I think again if the world plays out the way we laid it out, we would expect to exit 2016 in the low-60s type efficiency ratio. So assuming that we are correct, that we can actually hit the peaks in a number of these large expense items throughout 2017, we have a good chance to take the efficiency ratio down even further from that.","Mike Mayo","Alright. Thank you.","Greg Carmichael","Thank you, Mike.","Operator","The final question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Ken Usdin","Hey guys. Just one quick one on the NIM outlook, you mentioned you get a couple of \u2013 you get more help from the initial fee hike than from the offsetting factors and I am just wondering the offsetting factors, what are you just continuing to see from either book rollover or spread compression and at what point do you just expect that to kind of normalize out where if we got future hikes, we would see the incremental benefits for the NIM? Thanks.","Jamie Leonard","Ken, it\u2019s Jamie. I would tell you as Tayfun laid out in his prepared remarks, we would certainly have assets into the balance sheet that is benefited by the rate hike in December as well as the future moves we are forecasting. There are a couple of macro factors as well as several idiosyncratic factors that create headwinds for us in that environment. The macro factors is you touched on, the pricing pressures in this low rate environment with new productions coming in on the sheet, less than on yields on the pay-down and payoffs and then you have the impact of the Fed stock dividend reduction. And I think those factors are impacting everybody. For Fifth Third specifically, as Lars touched on, you have C&I loan yield compression from this remixing as we are focused on disciplined growth and a better credit profile of client and that compression should dissipate in the back half of \u201916. And then you have for us also early access, continued attrition as we are not enrolling new customers. And then as Tayfun touched on, our outlook and the auto book production declined. We did about $5 billion this year. We expect that number to be around $3 billion in 2016. And then finally on the funding side, what we baked into our NII outlook is to have a pretty dynamic year on the funding side and with about $2.5 billion in maturities with 3-year issuances that are currently around 1% interest rate, our outlook assumes that we go out a little bit longer term and better position the company from a funding profile for 2017 and beyond. So all of those items are baked into that NII outlook and with all that said we still expect NII to grow 2% to 3% in 2016.","Ken Usdin","Got it. Alright. Thanks for that.","Greg Carmichael","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Good morning and thank you all for joining us. Today we will be discussing our financial results for the third quarter of 2018. ","Please review the forward-looking cautionary statement in our materials, which can be found in our earnings release presentation and other materials. Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call.","Part of our discussion includes commentary surrounding the proposed merger of MB Financial Inc. and Fifth Third Bancorp. Please also review the cautionary language contained in our earnings release and related presentations concerning important additional information regarding this merger and where to find it.","Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures we reference during today\u2019s conference call are included in our earnings release and related presentation, along with other information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures. ","This morning, I\u2019m joined on our call by our President and CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO Tayfun Tuzun; Chief Operating Officer Lars Anderson; Chief Risk Officer Frank Forrest, and Treasurer Jamie Leonard. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Tayfun, we will open the call up for questions.","Let me turn the call over now to Greg for his comments.","Greg Carmichael","Thanks Sameer, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. Earlier today, we reported third quarter 2018 net income available to common shareholders of $418 million and earnings of $0.61 per share. Included in these results are two items which had a negative impact of $0.03 on reported EPS. Excluding these items, core earnings were $0.64 per share in the third quarter.","Our financial results for the quarter were strong and reflected our focus on generating profitable growth, strengthening our balance sheet, and maintaining our expense discipline. I am pleased that we are continuing to realize the benefits of several initiatives we implemented under Project North Star. Before I revisit our key strategic priorities and highlights for the quarter, I\u2019d like to make a few observations about the macroeconomic environment. ","The economic backdrop remains generally strong. Consumers are benefiting from a strong labor market with the lowest unemployment rate in almost 50 years and healthy wage growth. These factors have helped drive increased consumer spending and positive consumer sentiment; in fact, consumer confidence among lower income Americans is at the highest level since 2000.","In our core commercial business, our clients continue to see the benefits of lower taxes and deregulation, but the imposition of tariffs and escalating rhetoric with China has created uncertainty for our commercial customers. We are optimistic that the new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada will help alleviate some of this geopolitical uncertainty. ","In addition to the developments in international trade, we are closely monitoring corporate debt levels. Higher leverage borrowers outside the traditional banking sector may experience difficulties as the Fed continues to raise interest rates. These issues could have a spillover effect that may negatively impact economic growth. While the overall economic backdrop remains supportive of future growth, we believe it is prudent to remain cautious. We will continue to maintain our disciplined focus on credit quality and profitability.","Moving on to our strategic priorities, at Fifth Third we are focused on three key priorities. They are designed to enhance revenue growth as well as achieve expense efficiencies. Executing on these initiatives will enable us to achieve our financial and strategic objectives as we have previously communicated.","First, we are focused on completing the implementation of our remaining North Star initiatives. We announced North Star in late 2016 along with the financial targets that we expect to achieve after completing the program. As we have said previously, the vast majority of the projects will be completed by the end of this year with results fully realized by year-end 2019. There are a few areas of work remaining to be completed this year but we are very pleased with our overall progress. We believe that our strong results again this quarter indicate that we are on track to achieve our objectives under Project North Star.","Our next party is to successfully complete the MB Financial transaction. With the North Star implementation work behind us in 2018, we can focus on ensuring that the integration of MB proceeds smoothly. We remain confident in our ability to realize the expected expense and revenue synergies which we have previously communicated.","We were pleased that the MB common shareholders recently voted to approve the transaction. We continue to expect to be able to close in the first quarter of 2019. Additionally, we recently re-submitted our CCAR plan to our regulators with the pro forma impact of the acquisition. We expect to receive feedback by the end of the year. In the meantime, our capital distribution activities should remain consistent with the plan originally submitted in April of 2018. ","The completion of the MB transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. As Tayfun will mention in his remarks, everything is progressing as expected.","Our third party is to pursue profitable organic growth opportunities in our key businesses. In addition to our branch network optimization initiative to drive improved household deposit and revenue growth across our retail footprint, we are also prioritizing organic growth opportunities across all areas of the franchise. For instance, we continue to assess opportunities in high growth markets where we can combine strong talent with local market knowledge and our enhanced product capabilities to successfully grow the portfolio. Additionally, we are continuing to add to our sales force in wealth and asset management, treasury management, and the capital markets business.","Moving on to the key highlights for the third quarter, I would like to review some key aspects of the results and then Tayfun will discuss the quarter in greater detail. First, we continue to strengthen our balance sheet. As you may recall, one of our key objectives in Project North Star was to appropriately balance risk and return in order to outperform through the credit cycle. We are very pleased with the progress we have made. Our key forward looking credit metrics continue to improve as criticized loans were at the lowest level in nearly 20 years and non-performing assets are at the lowest level since before the crisis. We have also focused on originating loans more selectively, again enhancing resiliency of our balance sheet. While we have maintained strong underwriting standards, our loan yield and net interest margin have continued to expand. We believe our strong credit profile will allow us to outperform our peers through cycles and return more capital to shareholders over time.","Also, we continue to successfully generate profitable relationship growth. Despite challenging market conditions, we generated solid loan, deposit and household growth during the quarter. Compared to the third quarter of last year, we grew C&I loans by 4%, deposits by 3%, and households by 4%. Additionally, our wealth and asset management group has successfully generated positive inflows every quarter this year, on track for a record year both in terms of AUM and total revenue. ","Furthermore, we continue to diligently manage our expenses. Our expenses declined 3% from the prior quarter with headcount down 4%. I want to reiterate our expectations for core expense growth of only 1% in 2019 as we continue to drive positive operating leverage. Our focus on growing profitable relationships and diligently managing our expenses has led to a 9% increase in our forward PPNR compared to the third quarter of last year. ","Our results show we remain on track to achieve our enhanced North Star financial targets. In the third quarter, we generated a core return on tangible common equity of 14%, a core return on assets of 1.26%, and a core efficiency ratio excluding the impact of low income housing expense of 59%. I would like to once again thank our employees for their hard work and dedication and for always keeping the customer at the center, which is evident in our financial results. ","I would also like to thank our employees, the Cincinnati Police Department, first responders and many others for their efforts during and after the tragic event at our headquarters in early September. It has been remarkably humbling to witness how our company has come together over the past month and a half to deal with this tragedy. ","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our third quarter results and our current outlook.","Tayfun Tuzun","Thanks Greg. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Let\u2019s move to the financial highlights on Slide 4 of the presentation. As Greg mentioned, our third quarter results were strong. Market dynamics were constructive overall, although there were certain pockets where the environment was more challenging. We strengthened our balance sheet, focused on profitable relationship growth, and maintained expense discipline. ","Reported results were negatively impacted by the items noted on Page 2 of our release, including a $17 million pre-tax charge related to the Visa total return swap and an $8 million pre-tax charge reflecting the mark-to-market on our Green Sky equity stake. Excluding these items, pre-provision net revenue increased 7% sequentially and 9% year-over-year. Strong revenue growth and well contained expenses are starting to lower our efficiency ratio, which improved substantially compared to the prior and the year-ago quarter. Excluding low income housing expense, our core efficiency ratio of 59% reached its lowest level since 2015. ","Our credit performance continued to be solid. While we reported the strongest forward-looking credit metrics in nearly 20 years, we added to our loan loss reserves as a result of strong loan growth. ","In his opening comments, Greg reiterated our top three priorities for long term success. These priorities are the guiding principles that we are using as a baseline for our 2019 plan expectations. Our goal is to carry the revenue momentum forward while maintaining tight expense control. We will continue to manage balance sheet risk by remaining mindful of the environment factors impacting our business. We expect to continue to benefit from rising rates, which gives us room to start managing for the maturing credit interest rate cycle. We also expect good credit performance as the economy continues to expand but believe that our strong credit profile positions us well for the eventual turn in the cycle. Lastly, we continue to manage our capital prudently with the ultimate goal of rewarding our shareholders today and in the future.","Moving to Slide 6, as we have been indicating over the past few months, the combined impact of the commercial exits and reduced auto originations is mostly behind us. The benefits of North Star are also coming to fruition. As a result, we expect to achieve higher overall loan growth going forward compared to the past couple of years. The amount of quarterly growth of course will vary depending on environmental factors.","This quarter, average total portfolio loans were up 1% compared to the prior quarter, mostly reflecting growth in C&I loans. We achieved the same growth rate in total loans on a year-over-year basis. End of period commercial loan growth was 2.5% compared to the prior quarter and was consistent with our previous guidance. Our success in generating profitable growth in both corporate and middle market lending reflects the emerging results of our North Star initiatives. ","End of period commercial real estate balances increased 2% compared to last quarter. Although CRE growth was strong sequentially, balances increased less than 1% compared to the year ago quarter. We believe our CRE balances are likely to remain well below our peers\u2019 as a percentage of capital. CRE balances as a percentage of total risk-based capital were approximately 60%. This was the lowest in our peer group and significantly below the next lowest peer. We will continue to maintain a cautious approach to commercial real estate lending at this point in the cycle. We currently expect our end of period total commercial portfolio to grow modestly on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter. ","Average consumer loans were up 1% both sequentially and compared to the year ago quarter. End of period consumer loans were flat compared to the prior quarter, in line with our previous guidance. It is worth noting that we are at an inflection point in our indirect auto loan portfolio as balances were essentially flat in the third quarter. This is happening somewhat earlier than we anticipated as originations have started to outpace runoff, albeit at a more modest pace. The decline in home equity loans continues to reflect runoff in our legacy book and is consistent with industry trends. Similar to the first two quarters, our credit card and other unsecured consumer loans continue to grow this quarter. Growth rates in these portfolios are in line with industry trends and are above our historical growth rates, reflecting the North Star initiatives. ","In the fourth quarter, we expect total end of period consumer loan balances to be relatively flat compared to the third quarter. This will mostly reflect a seasonal decline in the mortgage portfolio and continued runoff in home equity loans. Our auto and credit card portfolio growth rates should be similar to the third quarter. ","Total core deposits were up 3% on a year-over-year basis and stable compared to the prior quarter. Our goal is to fund incremental loan growth with core deposits. To help achieve that, we will continue to focus on generating above peer average household growth. We also plan to grow commercial deposits with the support of corporate treasury management engagements, again reflecting a number of North Star initiatives. ","Moving on to Slide 7, net interest income was up $70 million or 7% from the year ago quarter. The NIM increased 16 basis points from the third quarter of 2017. Compared to the prior quarter, NII increased 2% or $23 million and the NIM expanded two basis points, both of which exceeded our previous guidance. The average rates on interest bearing core deposits increased 9 basis points during the quarter, well below the 13 basis point increase in the second quarter. ","The most impactful factor on our NIM continues to be deposit betas. Our cumulative beta leading up to the September 2018 Fed hike was approximately 30% with consumer in the low 20s and commercial in the low 50s. The June rate hike resulted in a consumer beta of approximately 30% and commercial beta of about 70%, resulting in an overall beta of 45%, and we expect the September rate increase to result in a combined beta of approximately 50%. We expect incremental increases in deposit betas with additional future rate hikes. ","We expect fourth quarter NIM to increase two to three basis points from the third quarter, which assumes a December Fed funds rate increase. Accordingly, we expect our fourth quarter NII to be up approximately 2% sequentially, which is largely a function of the expected balance sheet growth and the benefit from the September and December rate hikes. This translates to 8% NII growth for the full year 2018.","Moving on to Slide 8, excluding the impact of the non-core items, non-interest income increased 3% compared both to the year ago and prior quarter. The overall trends in fee income reflect strength in wealth and asset management and corporate banking, and steady increases in payments processing and consumer deposit revenues. We expect these trends to continue with some quarterly fluctuations.","The outlier in fee performance is clearly mortgage banking, which is very much reflective of the industry trends. The weakness is mortgage is clearly impacting our total fee income growth year over year. Our year-to-date fee income is up approximately 2% on a core basis, but excluding mortgage core fees are up about 4%. This quarter, origination volume was $1.9 billion and the gain on sale margin remained low at 163 basis points. We added $3 billion to our servicing portfolio to be on-boarded in the fourth quarter, bringing the total acquired servicing portfolio to approximately $17 billion since the beginning of last year.","Our corporate banking fees remain solid and we are optimistic that we will finish the year strong. Our strong pipeline should help us generate corporate banking fees between $120 million and $130 million in the fourth quarter, subject to market conditions.","Deposit service charges increased 1% compared to both the year ago quarter and the prior quarter. Growth in consumer deposit fees has been encouraging and is tied to our strong household growth numbers. In treasury management, we have been able to grow our top line fees at a mid single digit rate this year, which helped us neutralize the impact of higher earnings credit rates.","Card and processing revenue increased 4% compared to the year ago quarter due to higher credit and debit transaction volume, partially offset by higher rewards. Sequential performance reflected increased rewards. For the fourth quarter, we expect non-interest income to increase approximately 2% from adjusted third quarter non-interest income of $586 million.","The 3% decline in reported non-interest expenses this quarter was better than our prior guidance. As we discussed last quarter, we continue to invest in high priority areas such as IT and marketing, but we are finding efficiencies elsewhere to limit the impact on overall expense growth. Our adjusted efficiency ratio for the third quarter was 61.7% or 59.3% excluding the low income housing amortization expense, which all peers reflect in their tax line. We have achieved positive operating leverage this quarter both on a quarter over quarter and year over year basis, and expect to continue to improve in the foreseeable future. ","Fourth quarter expenses, excluding any MB acquisition related expenses and assuming the FDIC surcharge remains in effect, are expected to be up only about 1% from the third quarter. If the FDIC premium is lowered, our expenses should remain flat from the third quarter. Although we are not prepared to review the details of our 2019 plan today, as we shared with you in September, we expect our core expenses to be up approximately 1% year over year in 2019. ","Turning to credit results on Slide 10, third quarter credit results continued to follow a positive trend in line with our expectations and reflecting the impact of actions that we executed over the last three years. The criticized assets ratio continued to improve, decreasing to 3.45%, near a 20-year low, from 3.87% last quarter and 5.5% last year. Net charge-offs were $72 million or 30 basis points, down 11 basis points from the prior quarter. The commercial charge-off rate of 19 basis points was the lowest since before the crisis. The consumer net charge-off ratio of 50 basis points improved 2 basis points sequentially.","Total non-accrual portfolio loans and leases were $403 million, down 20% from last year and down 8% from the previous quarter. The provision for loan and lease losses totaled $86 million in the current quarter compared to $67 million in the year ago quarter and $33 million in the prior quarter. The coverage ratio remained at 1.17%. As we remind you every quarter, the current economic backdrop continues to support a relatively stable credit outlook with potential quarterly fluctuations, given current low absolute levels of charge-offs. ","Turning to Slide 11, capital levels remained very strong during the quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.7% and our tangible common equity ratio excluding unrealized gains and losses was 9.12%. During the quarter, we initiated and settled $500 million in share repurchases. As Greg mentioned, we recently re-submitted our CCAR 2018 results revised for the pro forma impact of the combined Fifth Third and MB Financial Company. Our near term and long term capital targets remain the same as before and we will resume our capital management actions this quarter in line with our 2018 CCAR plan. ","At the end of the third quarter, common shares outstanding were down almost 17 million shares or 2% compared to the second quarter of 2018, and down 44 million shares or 6% compared to last year\u2019s third quarter.","Moving to Slide 12, we expect our tax rate for the fourth quarter to be in the range of 16.75% to 17.25%. Excluding the items that are specific to 2018, we would expect our long term tax rate to be in the 15.25% to 15.75% range.","Now to Slide 13 with an update on the MB Financial integration. We remain on track to close the MB transaction in the first quarter of 2019 subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. All regulatory applications have been filed. We continue to be encouraged by the highly successful talent and client retention results since the announcement. We also remain very confident in our ability to generate the expense and revenue synergies we have discussed previously.","In summary, I would like to reiterate a few points. We reported strong financial results for the third quarter and remain focused on our three strategic priorities. We are nearing the completion of the Project North Star work and expect the financial results of these initiatives to become more apparent throughout 2019. We also remain focused on seamlessly integrating the MB acquisition and successfully generating the financial benefits as discussed previously. Lastly, we continue to position the company to enhance our financial returns through organic growth opportunities. To that end, we are optimizing our branch network to improve households, deposits and revenue growth.","We also continue to add to our sales force in other businesses where we expect these resources to enhance our return metrics and where we believe we can achieve higher revenue growth, including middle market lending and capital markets. We are focused on successfully executing against our strategic priorities and remain confident in our ability to achieve our enhanced financial targets.","With that, let me turn it over to Sameer to open the call up for Q&A.","Sameer Gokhale","Thanks Tayfun. Before we start Q&A, as a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up, and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. We will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have this morning. During the question and answer period, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator. ","Kyle, please open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Your first question comes from the line of Peter Winter from Wedbush. Your line is open.","Peter Winter","Good morning. ","Tayfun Tuzun","Good morning, Peter. ","Peter Winter","I wanted to follow up on that expense guidance for next year. Can you just talk about what some of the drivers are to keep expenses low and does it assume that the FDIC surcharge goes away, and how much is that? ","Tayfun Tuzun","It does assume that the FDIC surcharge goes away basically beginning in 2019, and it\u2019s about $45 million to $50 million a year. We assume that we will have a normalized merit increase for our base employees somewhere around 2.5 to 3%, that we will continue to maintain our information technology investments and maintain the growth in our sales force, both in retail as well as in our commercial groups. There is no change really in the business portions, but we clearly will benefit from the second quarter efficiency actions that we executed this year, and we will continue with increased savings in our real estate management area and also have a few procurement related expense savings. We are pretty confident that we will be able to achieve that in 2019.","Peter Winter","Then just a follow-up, corporate banking this quarter was a little bit lower than that guidance that you gave coming out of 2Q earnings, and then you are looking for a nice increase in the fourth quarter. Were there just some deals that got delayed and pushed into the fourth quarter? ","Lars Anderson","Peter, this is Lars. I think consistent with what you\u2019ve seen in the regional banks, debt capital markets activity was obviously muted. We are expecting, and I would say that we see early signs as we look at the fourth quarter, of a really nice pipeline in M&A and debt capital markets. It was lower than we had expected for the third quarter.","I would tell you that we did have some benefit from that clearly in lower pay-downs. It wasn\u2019t the key driver, clearly, of our--you know, if you look at our C&I loan growth, which was up on a quarter over quarter basis end of period 3%, it clearly benefited us in terms of our loan outstandings, but we would expect that the fourth quarter would be a good, solid one subject to market conditions. We\u2019ve made a lot of investments there in investment banking, as you know, and have expanded our capabilities, aligned those with our industry verticals and well positioned. ","Peter Winter","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Elliott","Hello, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. First, just a little clarification. The slides talk about expecting to resume capital distribution activities consistent with the originally submitted plan. Is that just referring to resumption after a blackout period going into the quarter, or is there some sort of pause in the buyback while the Fed is reviewing the CCAR re-submission?","Tayfun Tuzun","There is no pause, Geoffrey. We will just resume the quarterly activity with the release of this earnings. It opens up our ability to execute the previously disclosed 2018 results.","Geoffrey Elliott","Got it, understood. On the expense side, it feels like the outlook has been kind of bouncing around a bit - you had the $4.0 billion to $4.1 billion range and then you said the low end of that, and then you dropped the guide to coming in at the low end, and then taking what you\u2019ve said this quarter, it kind of points back to the low end of the $4.0 billion to $4.1 billion. Can you talk through what\u2019s been changing over the course of the year there, and specifically what\u2019s changed since the second quarter call that seems to make you a little bit more optimistic on potential to squeeze out some expense saves?","Tayfun Tuzun","Clearly expenses continue to be a very good story for us. In terms of the third quarter, we did a little bit better than we expected relative to how we discussed our expectations in July, so the third quarter number came in below our expectations. The only change for the full year is really the FDIC surcharge assumption. In July, our outlook actually assumed that that surcharge would go away in the fourth quarter of this year, so that adds another, let\u2019s say, $11 million, $12 million number into our fourth quarter expectations. Back in July, we would have expected relative to where we ended up Q3 at flat expense growth into Q4, but we just took it up 1% because of that. ","But look - I mean, in the second quarter we discussed some of our marketing activities with you, obviously continued spend on IT. None of that has changed. We are seeing good results from our marketing investments, but we are finding more efficiencies elsewhere in our organization to be able to afford those investments without necessarily taking total expenses up, and that story continues into 2019 with our 1% guidance.","Geoffrey Elliott","Can you elaborate a bit more on the efficiencies? I guess you\u2019ve told us where you\u2019re still investing in technology and the sales force and merit increases, but could you give a bit more detail on where the biggest saves are going to be coming from?","Tayfun Tuzun","I think the second quarter action that we took in streamlining some of our middle office and back office functions alters the base comp direction, so on a full year basis that\u2019s about $72 million, $80 million. On a year over year basis, it\u2019s a little bit less than that because we\u2019ve benefited this year for about a quarter, quarter and a half. We are seeing good efficiency actions coming from our continued focus on third party vendor management. Real estate clearly continues to be a source of saving for us. We have lowered a number of our third party spending, including consulting spend, so I think when we set out to achieve our efficiency ratio target of below 57% on a standalone basis by the end of 2019, we knew that these actions were slowly going to come online, and they are now coming online. With also good revenue growth, that tight expense management is enabling us to achieve the return targets.","Geoffrey Elliott","Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Erika Najarian","Hi, good morning. Thank you. I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the competitive dynamics for commercial lending. There\u2019s been a lot of conversation about the non-banks this quarter, and I\u2019m wondering if from your seat, if you could give us a sense of how that\u2019s impacting growth prospects for you guys and what the competition is looking like in terms of structure and\/or rate.","Frank Forrest","This is Frank. Let me start from a credit perspective and then I\u2019ll flip it over to Lars to talk about outlook from a competitive vantage point.","From where we sit, and we\u2019ve talked about it before, we have reduced our highest risk exposure in our company by $5 million over the last three years, and a large part of that has been on the leveraged lending side. The recipients of a lot of our take-outs, a lot of these were credits that we didn\u2019t have an appetite for came from the non-bank banks. From where I sit, we\u2019ve actually seen a benefit in being able to strategically reduce some of the higher risks we had in the leveraged portfolio by those that have a different appetite level than we do.","Where we do see them, and you\u2019ve heard this on other earnings calls, clearly we see their influence from a structure perspective and a pricing perspective today. That\u2019s something we have to evaluate. We see them in the real estate markets, we see them in the leveraged markets, and we\u2019re seeing increasing exposure from them in middle market because a lot of PE firms now have ownership interest in middle market companies and they have--they tend to have broader relationships outside of traditional banks, and so we see it there as well. I expect as we go forward we\u2019ll see it more in the syndicated loan market. We are seeing more syndicated loan participants today that are non-bank banks, and as a result of that, that could get interesting if we end up with an economy that slips a bit and you have people that have a different appetite for risk than what we have.","Anyway, that\u2019s from a credit perspective of where we\u2019ve been influenced.","Lars Anderson","Yes Erika, I think Frank hit it nicely. That\u2019s the environment. I would just tell you very quickly we\u2019re seeing continued success, now two quarters, in middle markets, which was a core part of our North Star investments. Our capabilities, our ability to deliver, I\u2019d say a more flexible, empathetic, relationship-based approach to the market, there is a part of the market out there that\u2019s looking for that versus institutional type lending and debt. We\u2019re harvesting those opportunities - that\u2019s consistent with our strategy. We\u2019re doing the same thing even into corporate banking, that lower end of corporate banking. We\u2019re really coming in with some expertise that\u2019s unique.","So there is opportunities, but I will tell you that structure and pricing is getting stretched, but we\u2019re going to stay very focused on our credit discipline, on our pricing returns, relationship pricing returns, but there is clearly a shifting in the macroeconomic environment.","Erika Najarian","Got it. As my follow-up question to that, Frank, thank you for reminding us how much you have reduced risk. I\u2019m wondering if you could share with us what your current exposure stands today in terms of residual leveraged lending exposure and term facilities for sponsor-backed transactions. ","Frank Forrest","Erika, overall we do not have a significant exposure today within our commercial book. Again, that\u2019s because of the fact that we\u2019ve taken over a 50% reduction in that exposure over the past 36 months. I can tell you we operate within board-approved risk appetite limits of that book. We\u2019re still actively involved in the leverage business, and Lars has an outstanding team that focuses on that. We treat leverage as a specialized credit product at Fifth Third, we don\u2019t treat it as a separate line of business, so it\u2019s there to support existing clients primarily that we know well and have operated for a number of years in an leveraged environment and performed very well. ","Our credit underwriting standards, we believe are prudent. We\u2019re not changing those standards. I\u2019ll also add that even though there\u2019s been a lot of articles recently about higher risk leveraged books being highly concentrated in cov-lite structures, virtually no covenants, it\u2019s only 10% of our leveraged book, so we continue to structure and underwrite I think in a prudent fashion, again with clients that we feel very good about. ","I\u2019ll see if Lars has any additional comments.","Lars Anderson","No, I think you hit it well, Frank - very disciplined approach to that market and a very small part of our overall strategy and book.","Erika Najarian","Clear, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Mike Mayo","Hi. Can you give a little more color on MB Financial? Does that close the first day of the new year, or the last day of this year? Versus your original expectations, we can see your targets on the page, but just qualitatively, what looks a little bit better than what you expected and where do you think it will be a little bit more of a challenge, and specifically if you could address expense growth and loan growth and some other areas.","Greg Carmichael","Mike, this is Greg. I\u2019ll start and then I\u2019ll throw it over to Jamie, who\u2019s leading that integration effort for us that we discussed before. First off, our intent right now hopefully is to receive regulatory approval this year and close the transaction first quarter of next year. Once we close the transaction, we\u2019ll work had to get that integrated as quickly as possible, but right now that\u2019s been our original plan and that has not changed. As Tayfun alluded to, we\u2019ve filed all appropriate regulatory filings and so forth and applications, so we\u2019re just waiting to get that response back and then we\u2019ll move forward with closing that first of the year. We will not close that transaction this year. ","With respect to our focus on achieving the expense expectations of $255 million, we\u2019re very confident, Mike, in our ability to accomplish that task, even more so than we were when we first put that target out there. With all the due diligence that has been done since then and the efforts of the team, we feel really comfortable we can deliver on that commitment that we made there.","In addition to that, we think there\u2019s really opportunities on the revenue side. We put a number out there of $60 million to $75 million. We feel very comfortable based on where we\u2019re bringing the business together and what we see as those opportunities in our partnership with MB Financial. It\u2019s a very talented group, and we feel very comfortable we can achieve those objectives over the years after we complete that transaction. ","Jamie, do you have anything you want to add?","Jamie Leonard","Yes, I\u2019d say thanks for the question, Mike. As Greg mentioned, we\u2019re definitely confident in the modeling we did and our ability to hit our targets; but back to your question on maybe one of the most surprising or impressive things, it\u2019s just really been the quality of the people at MB, the business that they operate, the very high touch, white glove treatment that their customers get that we\u2019re very focused on ensuring that that continues post-integration.","Mike Mayo","As far as the expense growth target for the firm next year, up 1%, how does that reflect MB Financial?","Jamie Leonard","That\u2019s on a standalone basis, Mike. Obviously we\u2019re pretty public about our expense expectations regarding MB.","Mike Mayo","Then the last follow-up, with the increased competition from the non-banks and the impact of higher interest rates, the impact on loan growth at MB Financial specifically, do you feel that that could be a little bit more of a challenge in this environment? Do you feel fine, or how do you think about that?","Jamie Leonard","Mike, good point. I\u2019d really point out three things that are really important as I look at our revenue synergies and our ability to get attractive returns. One, they are outstanding in that lower middle market space that is so important to us. They get attractive returns, build deeper client relationships, clients have very, very high client satisfaction scores, so that\u2019s really positive. They also bring to us a piece of asset-based lending that we have significantly increased over the last couple of years. We hit number 18 on the lead tables this past year as a standalone company. Having MB join us, it only complements our national asset-based lending capabilities again with their lower middle market strategy. ","Same thing with equipment finance - they have a lot of expertise in that area. We\u2019re excited about what that\u2019s going to do for us. I\u2019d just say on those three key fronts, and there is more, there\u2019s lots of opportunities for us to, I think, drive attractive returns and relationships. ","Greg Carmichael","Mike, the only other thing I would add - this is Greg - is we talked about the quality of the people, and once again we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the talent and the interactions that we\u2019ve had with that business. We\u2019ve also done a really nice job, and I credit Mitch Feiger, the CEO and that team, of retaining the talent that we have in place and retaining the customer base. We haven\u2019t seen any real material change in talent o the customer base we have seen, which is what we thought we would execute against, but we\u2019re seeing that come to fruition as we continue to move towards integration. ","Mike Mayo","All right, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez from UBS. Your line is open.","Saul Martinez","Hey, good morning. I just wanted to follow up on MB Financial. I\u2019m not sure how much you can talk to their third quarter results specifically, but they did have a sizeable uptick in loan loss provisions and NCOs - I think it\u2019s related to one specific credit. But you have seen some of the smaller banks have some credit hiccups this quarter, you guys yourselves have raised some concerns about corporate leverage more broadly, but is there anything that\u2019s changed on the margin in terms of how you see the risk profile of their credit book, or is this just an idiosyncratic dynamic that just happens from time to time?","Frank Forrest","This is Frank. They operate as a separate company from us. What you see is what we know. We can\u2019t comment on their specific performance. What I can tell you is that we did extensive due diligence in credit on MB, and we remain confident of the work that we did.","Jamie Leonard","Just by the nature of the announcement, Saul, just one credit appears to more of an isolated idiosyncratic event, which does not taint the rest of the portfolio.","Saul Martinez","Okay, fair enough. If I could change over to the fee outlook, 2% growth sequentially, is that a conservative estimate, because the corporate banking alone, 120 to 130 from 100, that\u2019s over 4% sequentially. You do have the TRA, I believe, with $20 million - correct me if I\u2019m wrong. You\u2019ll lose maybe not so much in terms of private equity gains next quarter, but just kind of sifting through a lot of the moving parts, can you just help us understand what\u2019s sort of underlying that guidance more on a line-by-line basis, because on the surface it seems like perhaps it\u2019s a little bit conservative, but I may be missing something.","Tayfun Tuzun","No, I think in general we would hope to do better in corporate banking. Fourth quarter tends to be a strong quarter, but I think we\u2019re also guiding to a fairly strong growth in corporate banking. There were some private equity gains this quarter that fell to our bottom line and those are periodic. It\u2019s difficult to forecast those gains, so that has some impact. Continued weakness in mortgage banking, clearly both obviously on a quarter over quarter as well as year over year basis, that\u2019s been really our Achilles heel here this year, just based on the market dynamics; but in general in other areas, including deposit fees we should do well, there is some seasonality associated with it, but overall I think we feel good about 2%. We would hope to achieve better, but also we\u2019re cognizant of some of the challenges in the market with respect to fee growth.","Saul Martinez","Just one quick follow-up - is the TRA cash flow of $20 million embedded in the guidance as well?","Tayfun Tuzun","It is, yes. Correct.","Saul Martinez","All right, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk about just how you\u2019re approaching share buybacks through the CCAR cycle. Obviously you use a lot of your submission in the third quarter. You talked about submitting your plan or re-submitting your plan to include the acquisition from the Fed. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a possibility of going back again since you still have strong capital levels and SOX obviously off quite a bit from the high part of the market, maybe part a surprise from the deal. I guess the question is thoughts on maybe going back to top off the ask from the Fed, and then of course you\u2019ve got a big stake in Worldpay, which stock has done quite well this year, and are you incrementally incented to try and monetize that, given where your stock is? Thank you.","Tayfun Tuzun","Thanks Matt, good question. In the near term, we clearly have to wait for the Fed\u2019s response to our resubmission. Until that, we will continue to execute our CCAR 2018 plan, which is by itself a fairly strong plan in terms of both buybacks as well as dividend raises. Beyond the resubmission decision, we\u2019re going to have to take a look at the combined company as we execute to integrate two companies, look at the underlying revenue growth, etc. I agree with you that the current market presents some interesting opportunities for us both in terms of our own capital growth as well as how we use Worldpay. We obviously are watching the same dynamics. We\u2019ve been pretty successful in the past in executing the exit from Worldpay and buying back our own stock. That continues to be on our plate, we have a little over 2%, so we are looking at considering the same factors, we just need to get over this near term decision point with the Fed and then re-evaluate what\u2019s left for us in the remainder of this 2018 plan period. ","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Just remind us what the dollar amount of your ownership stake in Worldpay is, what\u2019s the cost basis, and I think you\u2019ve said in the past that it\u2019s important but something that might be exited over time, so just update us on going from slightly above 3 to potentially zero.","Jamie Leonard","Matt, it\u2019s Jamie. We own about 10.3 million shares of Worldpay with roughly a $400 million cost base, so the unrealized gain--I haven\u2019t checked lately, but it\u2019s roughly $600 million. Given the value, should be around $950 million or so. ","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay, sorry. I think you guys have talked about while it\u2019s important, that you\u2019d be open to selling that all down over time. Just if we could revisit the strategic importance versus the financial opportunity to sell that down in its entirety over time, and that\u2019s it for me. Thanks.","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes, there is no strategic value in owning a small percent of a public company. We will liquidate that stock, we just need to find the right time to do that.","Greg Carmichael","Matt, we\u2019ve been very, very thoughtful about how we\u2019ve monetized our shares, as you\u2019ve seen over the years. Our equity position [indiscernible], as Tayfun said, we\u2019ve been very public that our intent is not to hold this. You could expect where we\u2019re at right now, that we\u2019ll act on that appropriately, and obviously given where our equity is trading today, there\u2019s some opportunities there that I think might make sense for us as we assess our options. ","Matt O\u2019Connor","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ken Zerbe","Thank you, good morning. Just had a question on the non-interest bearing deposits, they\u2019ve obviously been running off over the last couple quarters, which is consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in a number of other banks of course. Could you just talk about some of the strategies you\u2019re putting in place to try to minimize or mitigate some of that DDA runoff? Thanks. ","Jamie Leonard","Ken, it\u2019s Jamie. The third quarter performance in non-interest bearing deposits was a little different than what we saw in the second quarter. If you recall in the second quarter, commercial DDAs were soft - that was driven by the increase in the earnings credit rate, and that was roughly a 45% beta as we adjusted our rates up in the second quarter. Then in the third quarter, commercial DDAs were actually relatively stable - they were down 1%, and so during the third quarter we increased the earnings credit rate by about a 15% beta, and that\u2019s what we expect as well heading into the fourth quarter. I do believe the second quarter will be the highest amount of commercial DDA runoff just as we\u2019ve been adjusting those earning credit rates. ","On the consumer side, the DDAs were down 4% sequentially, and that\u2019s really just driven by a seasonally soft quarter, so we would expect both DDAs and deposits to be up in the fourth quarter driven by a lot of our initiatives on the consumer side. We spent a lot of time talking about our household growth - we\u2019ve grown households 4%. We\u2019ve increased branch staffing on the mass affluent, outbound calling and client management, along with the marketing efforts and the promotional and cash offers, and then building for 2019 and beyond, the southeast branch expansion that Tayfun mentioned. I feel like the drivers on the consumer side are there and the results are there, it\u2019s just the third quarter was seasonally soft from a consumer perspective, and on the commercial side the DDA mitigant to the interest rate headwind is really going to be driven by our ability to drive new client acquisition and further improve treasury management sales. To the extent that we\u2019re able to do that, you will continue to see a rebound in deposits beyond just the seasonal benefit we\u2019ll see in the fourth quarter. ","Ken Zerbe","All right, great. Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Vivek Juneja","Hi. A couple of questions. Firstly just on the non-interest expense side, how has your headcount done this quarter - was it down versus second quarter, any color on that?","Greg Carmichael","It was approximately down 4% from third quarter over second quarter, [indiscernible].","Vivek Juneja","Okay, and how much was the incentive comp reduction? Was there any reversal in this quarter or just accrual, what was it?","Tayfun Tuzun","Incentive comp plans, clearly one of them is just directly tied to activity levels and revenue levels, and there\u2019s been no change to that. In terms of variable comp, we continue to look at it on a quarterly basis. For the year relative to last year, we are going to be up in our total variable comp payout, and then the accrual of that changes from one quarter to another, both based on headcount as well as based on just the overall performance activity. I would say for the first three quarters of this year, we are up compared to the first three quarters of last year, and for the full year I expect us to be up as well.","Vivek Juneja","Okay, great. Thanks on that. Going back to the MBFI, the charge-off that was incurred on one commercial relationship, their charge-off rate was 82 basis points. You had assumed a mark when you had--or at least you talked about a mark that you planned to take when you closed the transaction, this was upfront when you announced the deal. Was this loan part of that or was this a surprise, because obviously commercial is one of those where you don\u2019t have 25 or 50 loans going bad, it is only a couple of episodic loans that cause the losses. When you look at the charge-off rate for C&I, if this came from C&I, that implies a 2% charge-off rate on C&I but CRE is 2.6%, so those are fairly high loss rates given where they were.","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes, agreed. I mean, I think again--I\u2019ll just go back to Frank\u2019s statement, that they still are a separate company and we don\u2019t necessarily have access to the information that they have yet. In terms of the mark that we discussed when we announced the transaction, at this point we\u2019re not updating that mark and thus a one loan charge is not going to necessarily move our number. At this point, what they charge off this quarter is not expected to impact the mark that we will take when we close the transaction.","Vivek Juneja","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Marinac from FIG Partners. Your line is open.","Christopher Marinac","Thanks, good morning. I may have missed it on the earlier remarks. The loss on Green Sky, is that the final piece of the investment or are there additional minor things that can occur in the future?","Tayfun Tuzun","No, as you remember Chris, we invested $50 million when we started working with Green Sky, and then obviously they went public in the second quarter. We own about 2.5 million shares there and this is the impact of their share price during the quarter.","Christopher Marinac","Got you. Your relationship with them continues to grow. What\u2019s the approximate balance that you have with them?","Tayfun Tuzun","It\u2019s a little over a billion dollars as of quarter end. ","Christopher Marinac","Okay, very well. Thank you, Tayfun.","Tayfun Tuzun","You\u2019re welcome.","Sameer Gokhale","Okay, I think if you don\u2019t have any further questions, thank you all for your interest in Fifth Third Bank.

At this time I'd like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bank's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","Head of Investor Relations, Mr. Jim Eglseder, you may begin your conference.","James P. Eglseder - Manager-Investor Relations","Thanks, Sean, and good morning. Today we'll be talking with you about our third quarter 2015 results. This discussion may contain certain forward-looking statements about Fifth Third, pertaining to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, and objectives. These statements involve certain risks and uncertainties, and we encourage you to review them.","There are a number of factors that could cause results to differ materially from historical performance and these statements. We've identified some of these factors in our forward-looking cautionary statement at the end of our earnings release and in other materials. Fifth Third undertakes no obligation and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call.","I'm joined on the call today by several people, our President, Greg Carmichael; and CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Frank Forrest, Chief Risk Officer; and Treasurer, Jamie Leonard. During the question-and-answer period please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator.","With that I'll turn the call over to Greg.","Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Thanks, Jim, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. On November 1 I will officially start my tenure as the Chief Executive Officer of our company. Today we thank Kevin Kabat for his 33 years of service to this institution, the last nine years as CEO. We are grateful for his leadership during a difficult period in our company's history. His contributions will continue to build value for our shareholders.","I am looking forward to building upon Kevin's accomplishments and leading our company to become a top through-the-cycle performer in our industry. In September I had the opportunity to meet some of you. And I look forward to having frequent dialogue in the coming quarters to share my team's priorities.","We have a number of new faces who joined our senior leadership team over the last 60 days. Lars Anderson, Heather Koenig, and Tim Spence are great additions to an already strong team and have hit the ground running. By all accounts we have had a very active quarter.","During the last 30 days we've resolved three significant regulatory and compliance items. Importantly, these items were already reserved for. We are pleased to have solved these matters as we continue to focus on improving our operations, efficiency, and customer experience, which in turn will generate better returns for our shareholders.","Driving better efficiency through technology and improving our ability to serve has been a priority for Fifth Third. Over the last few years we've done just that, focused on improving customer service and driving operational improvements. These changes over the past couple of years have resulted in approximately $60 million of annual savings.","In June we announced plans to sell or consolidate 105 branches across our footprint, and we expect to generate another $65 million in annual savings once complete. We are well on our way to executing our branch plans with the two announcements regarding the sale of our branches in St. Louis and Pittsburgh. As disclosed we will maintain our commercial activity in both markets. The first phase of our remaining retail branch consolidations is underway. And we are on track to have this project completed by the middle of 2016 as originally planned.","So now a few comments about the quarter. We reported third quarter net income to common shareholders of $366 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.45, including $0.06 of volumes that Tayfun will go over shortly. The operating environment continues to be challenging, but our focused strategies have resulted in continued loan and net interest income growth. The structure and composition of our balance sheet continues to produce current period earnings with balanced exposures to alternative rate environments.","Our strategic partnership and ownership stake in Vantiv continues to produce substantial earnings. As you can see we recognized $130 million on the Vantiv warrant in the quarter, bringing our earnings year-to-date on the mark to $214 million. We have benefited greatly from this relationship. And our ownership stake leaves us with significant future revenue potential.","Our core business performance is strong. For the third quarter positive balance sheet trends continued with average loan growth led by C&I, which was up 1% sequentially and 4% from a year ago. Core deposits were up $5.6 billion from a year ago, but down $1.8 billion sequentially, the majority of which was due to intentionally reducing deposits that are unfavorable from an LCR perspective.","The income results continue to show momentum, highlighted by corporate banking revenue that was up 4% from the prior year on continued strength in capital markets. And mortgage banking that was up 16% from a year ago.","We continue to closely manage our expenses with a sharp focus on extracting efficiencies from our day-to-day operations. Our non-interest expense in the third quarter was flat with the prior period. We will remain focused on cost containment, while continuing to invest in our company for the long term. Continuous fundamental improvement is the key here. Our expense management philosophy supports our goal of continuing to invest in the growth of our business.","Credit results reflect the impact of a legacy commercial credit that Tayfun will discuss in further detail. But it is important to note that this is not the type of credit we would underwrite today, nor is it reflective of our credit risk appetite going forward. Student loan portfolios are being assessed more conservatively in the market, and we reflected the valuation of the underlying loans in this commercial credit exposure.","Excluding this legacy credit our net-charge-off ratio would have been 37 basis points, consistent with the previous quarter. Non-performing assets were down 24% from a year ago. And our NPA ratio continues to decline, ending the quarter at 65 basis points. As we discussed all year we are at a threshold in our provisioning, as we are starting to cover our quarterly charge-offs. In addition our provision this quarter reflects the acknowledgement of the stresses that are building in the domestic and global economic environment.","The third quarter set us up well for a strong finish in 2015. I mentioned before that driving better efficiencies through technology and improving our ability to serve has been a priority. Both customer and regulatory expectations continue to change. And I am focused on technology investments as a core part of our strategic agenda to drive revenue growth, improve how we operate, enhance the customer experience, and achieve regulatory excellence.","We are very focused on taking this company forward with an increased pace of play and establishing ourselves as a top through-the-cycle performer in our sector.","With that I'll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our third quarter operating results and our outlook for the remainder of the year.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Greg. Good morning and thank you for joining us. As Greg said this quarter was an active quarter for us. In addition to the legal settlement and other business activities, with Greg's transition and the approaching year end, our teams are heavily engaged in our strategic and financial plan reviews. And we look forward to sharing our perspectives with you in January.","All business leaders and support functions are working with a clear direction to focus on growth, supported with efficient operations and client service excellence. Our established risk appetite and risk return targets are positioned for long-term shareholder value creation.","Speaking of shareholder value, the $130 million improvement in our Vantiv warrant position this quarter is a great example of shareholder value creation as a result of focused strategic decisioning. We will continue to execute our frequently stated objective to manage our financial stakes in Vantiv in the optimal way for our shareholders, as we have demonstrated since the IPO. Our direct ownership, the warrant, and tax receivable agreement in aggregate are of significant strategic value.","Let's start with the financial summary on page 3 of the presentation. We reported net income to common shareholders of $366 million or $0.45 per diluted share. There were several items that affected earnings in the quarter as Greg mentioned. The improvement in the value of our warrant position more than made up for the negative impact of a few one-time items this quarter.","As I mentioned the positive warrant valuation was $130 million. We also had a $9 million charge associated with executive retirement and severance, and an $8 million charge related to the valuation of the Visa total return swap. There were also charges to provision expense of $35 million related to the restructuring of a 2007 student loan backed commercial credit in the quarter. The net impact was a benefit of $0.06 per share.","The third quarter charge-offs were higher due to the restructuring of a large 2007 vintage student loan backed commercial credit. In connection with the restructuring we recognized net charge-offs of $102 million, $80 million of which had been specifically provided for in prior quarters. This is a legacy credit dating back to the financial crisis.","In late 2013 we had restructured a note and determined that we had appropriate cash flow and collateral coverage. And the note had performed well since then on a cash flow basis. And as evidenced by the existing reserves of $80 million, we've been diligently focused on maintaining appropriate coverage. However this credit is backed by private student loans. And as you know during the quarter volatility in the student loan markets caused significant stress on the valuation of underlying student loans. The reserve on this loan is based on the value of the underlying collateral.","Based on updated valuations and cash flow projections associated with the collateral, we determined that another restructuring was needed, which triggered the $102 million charge-off under TDR accounting guidance. The remaining note balance after charge-offs is $205 million. The collateral coverage is 107% of remaining performing underlying student loans, which have an outstanding principle balance of $225 million and an average attached FICO score of 756 with 75 months' seasoning.","In addition to the collateral coverage we added $13 million to our specific reserves for this note, which resulted in a net release of $67 million in specific reserves. We have no student loan exposure in our loan portfolio other than this indirect commercial exposure.","I'll cover the remaining asset quality details later in the presentation, so let's move to the average balance sheet and page 4 of the presentation. The strong loan production activity in the first half of the year carried throughout the third quarter and generated average portfolio loan balances that were $1.2 billion higher than the second quarter.","Loan growth metrics continue to reflect the results of our consistent efforts to select new clients that meet our return targets within our risk appetite. Our C&I balances were up 1% on an average basis with particular strength in middle market, mid-corp, and healthcare. Average commercial mortgage balances were down 2%. Commercial construction lending remains strong with balances up 16% sequentially, mainly in multifamily and industrial commercial construction.","Commercial production was seasonally lower compared to the second quarter, but was 14% higher year-over-year. The largest contribution came from the middle market portfolio. Payoffs and pay downs were flat sequentially and down 5% from last year. Year-to-date most of the payoffs in our commercial portfolio resulted from clients' M&A activity and the permanent financing of commercial construction lines. Utilization rates were flat compared to the second quarter. We have seen some stabilization in new production coupons, but it's too early to call an end to the credit spread contraction.","In the third quarter average investment securities increased by $900 million or 3% sequentially, partially reflecting the impact of securities purchased during the second quarter. Average core deposits decreased $1.8 billion from the second quarter, driven by lower interest rate checking account balances. The decrease largely \u2013 the decrease was largely due to targeted pricing changes in LCR punitive commercial accounts. The early compliance that we have achieved with the final LCR targets is enabling us now to position our deposit composition in a more efficient manner to establish a very comfortable operating liquidity position. Our LCR ratio was at 107% at the end of the quarter.","Moving to NII on page five of the presentation. Taxable equivalent net interest income increased $14 million sequentially to $906 million, primarily driven by loan growth, partially offset by higher interest expense associated with the $1.1 billion of holding company and $1.3 billion of bank level debt we issued this quarter. These issuances are partially replacing upcoming maturities in 2016. Our funding actions ahead of the maturities once again display our focus on long-term shareholder value creation instead of current quarter earnings focus.","The net interest margin was 289 basis points, down one basis point from the second quarter, driven by the impact of those debt issuances, day count, and loan yield compression, partially offset by the benefit of the slightly lower short-term cash position during the quarter.","Shifting to fees on page six of the presentation. Third quarter non-interest income was $713 million, compared with $556 million in the second quarter. Results included the $130 million positive mark on the Vantiv warrant that I mentioned earlier. As a reminder second quarter results included a $97 million impairment charge related to the changes in the branch network and a $14 million positive mark on the Vantiv warrant. Quarterly results also included charges on the Visa total return swap of $8 million in the current quarter and $2 million last quarter.","Excluding these items in both quarters fee income of $591 million decreased $50 million or 8% (sic) [$46 million or 7%] (14:39) sequentially, led by mainly MSR related decreases in mortgage banking and seasonal decreases in corporate banking revenue.","Corporate banking fees decreased $9 million sequentially as expected due to seasonally lower institutional sales and business lending fees. These seasonal declines were partially offset by higher interest rate derivative fees that benefited from higher rate and currency volatility, lease remarketing fees, and syndications revenue.","Mortgage banking net revenue of $71 million was down $46 million sequentially, primarily due to lower net hedging gains this quarter. Originations were $2.3 billion in the third quarter with 58% purchase volume. 80% of the originations came from the retail and direct channels, and 20% from the correspondent channel. Gain on sale margins were up 10 basis points sequentially.","Net servicing asset valuation adjustments, which include amortization and valuation adjustments, were negative $29 million this quarter, versus positive $18 million last quarter. Deposit service charges increased 4% from the second quarter and were flat relative to the third quarter of 2014. Total investment advisory revenue of $103 million decreased 2% sequentially, primarily due to the market decline during the quarter.","We show non-interest expense on page seven of the presentation. Expenses were $943 million, compared with $947 million in the second quarter. The sequential comparison reflected $9 million in higher compensation expense primarily associated with executive retirements and severance, partially offset by reversal of litigation reserves.","Turning to credit results on page eight. Excluding the student loan backed commercial credit, net charge-offs were $86 million or 37 basis points in the third quarter, flat with net charge-offs in the prior quarter. Total net charge-offs were $188 million or 80 basis points as a percentage of average loans, including the restructured commercial credit charge-off of $102 million, $80 million of which had been specifically reserved for in prior quarters.","Non-performing assets excluding loans held for sale declined $20 million from the previous quarter to $606 million, bringing the NPL ratio to 49 basis points and the NPA ratio to 65 basis points. A year ago commercial NPAs were at 90 basis points. The sequential decline of $6 million was primarily due to a $10 million decline in C&I. NPAs in the C&I bucket was 43 basis points, down from 45 basis points last quarter and 68 basis points in the third quarter of 2014. Consumer NPAs decreased $14 million from the second quarter, driven by a $10 million decline in residential mortgage and a $3 million decline in home equity NPAs. Our criticized asset levels this quarter remained flat with last quarter's levels.","Our energy portfolio declined by $45 million to $1.6 billion from the second quarter. And the composition remained stable with approximately 50% related to reserve-based lending, where we are senior secured lender within many cases significant levels of subordinated risk ahead of the bank's position. As expected, we have seen negative ratings migration in the portfolio, but especially in the reserve-based portfolio strong collateral coverage levels should limit the future migrations.","Our team will have continued updates to the analysis this quarter. But overall expectations have not changed. And we don't anticipate any material impact from a loss given default perspective. We have no NPLs in this portfolio.","Wrapping up on credit, due to the net $67 million specific reserve release related to the student loan backed commercial credit, the allowance for loan and lease losses declined $33 million, compared with a $7 million decline last quarter. The change in the allowance includes a $35 million addition to our overall reserves. We have been publicly discussing our expectations that there would likely be a quarter in which the provision would equal if not exceed charge-offs on a quarterly basis.","This credit cycle is diverting from the average length of expansion cycles with every passing quarter. In light of further slowdown in global manufacturing activity, volatility in capital markets, and the projected prolonged downturn in the energy sector, addition to the ALLL was warranted. The resulting reserve coverage remains at 1.35% of loans and leases and 275% of NPLs.","Looking at capital on slide nine. Capital levels continue to be strong and well above regulatory requirements. The common equity Tier 1 ratio was 9.4%. At the end of the third quarter, end of period common shares outstanding were down approximately $15 million. During the quarter we announced two common stock repurchases of $150 million each. The first started on July 29 and settled on August 31 and reduced third quarter share count by 7.4 million shares. The second ASR is expected to settle on or before December 4 and reduce the third quarter share count by 6.5 million shares.","Turning to the outlook for the remainder of the year. In terms of core business activity our expectations remain the same as the last few quarters. We see good loan activity in our commercial business. We should see that trend continue into the fourth quarter supported by diverse origination activity. Our annual guidance in January called for growth in commercial lending to exceed 3%, supported by our strategic investments. Based on where we are today and our expectation for the fourth quarter, full year commercial loan growth should be approximately 4% for the full year.","On the consumer side we expect to see similar trends in the fourth quarter compared to previous periods. We are currently selling all of our conforming mortgage production other than the ARMs. We are not seeing meaningful changes in market conditions and loan demand across the categories that will have an impact on recent growth trends.","Our NII outlook remains roughly the same as our last guidance. Excluding the impact of the deposit advance product, we actually have grown NII this year so far compared to last year's first three quarters. We are maintaining the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year for full year 2015 NII growth compared to last year, excluding the roughly $100 million negative impact of the deposit advance product.","We do expect a slight downtick in our fourth quarter NIM and NII resulting from the removal of the December Fed move assumption, as well as the full quarter impact of our two debt issuances from the third quarter. In July our NIM guidance was 2.88% for the second half of the year. And we will be within a basis point or 2 [basis points] of that guidance, despite the removal of the rate increase assumption and the carrying costs associated with prefunding a portion of our 2016 debt maturities.","Fourth quarter corporate banking fees tend to be seasonally stronger with higher business lending and syndication fees relative to the third quarter. As expected mortgage banking production net revenue should be seasonably below third quarter levels but in line with fourth quarter of last year. The ongoing annual income from the tax receivable agreement payment we expect to receive from Vantiv is approximately $30 million.","Our core non-interest expense guidance in July was a 2.5% increase in total core expenses during the second half of the year over the first half totals. Good news is that we expect to come slightly inside that guidance. The seasonal uptick in expenses during the fourth quarter will include higher EMV-related expenditures, which we discussed earlier in the year, as well as higher performance-related compensation and the continuing uptick in base comp related to the buildup in compliance and risk infrastructure.","As we also discussed before, we expect our technology expenses during the fourth quarter to be about 10% higher than the third quarter. These costs are designed to support our long-term strategic actions and investments in our franchise, including IT projects that are targeted for risk and compliance infrastructure and those that are targeted for direct business-related purposes, such as digital technology.","We are spending a significant amount of time on expense management in all of our core businesses and staff functions. As the Fed's anticipated rate actions continue to be pushed back, we are ratcheting up our focus on improving operating leverage in our businesses. Greg's direction to the entire organization is to operate under the assumption that we will extract efficiencies from our processes year in and year out.","We expect to continue to invest in our businesses to build shareholder value. And the savings from our existing processes will provide part of the funding for the new investments. The upward slope in our risk and compliance infrastructure-related expenses is not permanent. The combination of the renewed commitment to tighter expense management in our existing platforms in this environment, and the end to the upward slope in risk and compliance expenses in 2016 will be important to achieve our goal to outperform through the cycle.","Turning to credit. As expected we have probably seen the end of reserve releases. And going forward provision will be impacted by loan growth and the impact of broader economic trends on the portfolio. Net charge-offs are expected to be more in line with our core losses last quarter and the levels we have seen in the first two quarters of this year.","We also would like to remind you that the revenue expectations that we shared with you today do not include potential, but currently unforecasted items, such as Vantiv warrant marks and gains on share sales.","In summary we continue to be focused on making the right decisions for the long term, strategically positioning us to be a trusted partner to our client, and building a strong balance sheet with prudent liquidity, interest rate, and credit risk exposures for through-the-cycle performance. With that let's open the line for questions. Sean?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. Your first question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Erika.","Erika P. Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning.","Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Good morning.","Erika P. Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yes. My first question is for you, Greg. On an adjusted basis over the past two quarters the core efficiency ratio of this company has been around 62%. Given that the revenue backdrop may be challenging for longer, and Tayfun's remarks about a renewed focus on expense management, can you improve that 62% over the next 12 months without really any help from the revenue environment? In other words is there savings that you can extract from today's cost base that could be above and beyond what's required to invest back into the company?","Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Erika, we've been focused, as we announced earlier in my comments on expense management, as we announced the reduction of 105 branches and some of the talent re-engineering that we've accomplished. We'll continue to stay focused on our core efficiencies, making sure every investment dollar we put forth, we get return on that investment.","But it's a very difficult environment right now with low interest rates, high regulatory cost. We'll give more guidance in January for 2016 on efficiencies. But right now I would tell you job one is to make sure we're taking care of our customer. And wherever possible we're extracting efficiencies on our current core operating environment.","Erika P. Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And my second follow-up \u2013 sorry. My follow-up to Tayfun is on the LCR, given that you're at 107%. Are the wholesale changes on the balance sheet behind you with regards to either the repricing of non-operational deposits on the liability side? And should we think about the size of the securities portfolio relative to loan and deposit growth from here?","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Yes, Erika. I think the broader increase in the size of the investment portfolio is behind us. From now on we probably will see investment portfolio growth more in line with the rest of the balance sheet growth.","In terms of larger moves on the deposit side I think we've taken care of most of the large deposits that tend to be LCR punitive. But we will always be focused to manage the deposit side efficiently in light of this continued low rate environment. And as I mentioned in my script, our early move on the LCR last year is giving us room to be able to do those efficiency moves on the rest of the deposit base.","Erika P. Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First of all in terms of the rate sensitivity, Tayfun, it looks like that has not materially changed quarter over quarter. And how would you think about that going forward, assuming we get a very minimal level of rate increase in the first half of 2016?","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Matt, as I mentioned we removed our rate increase assumption from our outlook for this year. And it looks like next year right now, there are a couple of moves in the forward curve.","In terms of our rate sensitivity we've always said that we are not taking the extreme rate sensitivity position and expectation for aggressive rate moves. And we want to be balanced, because we see the risks balanced going forward. Even if the Fed starts moving rates, I think it's going to be less steep and [audio skip] (30:13) than people thought a year ago or so.","So therefore we're not anticipating significant changes to our asset sensitivity from here. We will be mindful obviously if and when rates start to rise to extract most of that benefit and let it fall to our balance sheet. But we've been very transparent in terms of the assumptions that we are using in our outlook. Jamie, any comment?","James C. Leonard - Treasurer & Senior Vice President","No. I think that \u2013 good summary.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you for that. And then in terms of my follow-up, based on what appears to be a less bullish outlook for rates certainly this year and it seems into 2016, how are you thinking about deposit pricing? Several other banks this earnings reporting season have discussed their view that there could be relatively high degrees of competition for core deposits as rates rise. But that seems to imply a relatively stair-step increase in rates, which my sense is the market is not in line with. So how are you thinking about potential deposit pricing competition in a lower for longer rate environment?","James C. Leonard - Treasurer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. This is Jamie. One thing you can see from our activities this year and even from the deposit changes this quarter is we've been very focused on trimming deposit costs for what would appear to be a lower for longer environment. You've seen that in our core deposit levels down \u2013 rate costs down a bp or so each quarter this year. And frankly with our LCR at a pretty strong position at 107%, it gives us a little bit of flexibility to wait and see how competition responds.","But the reason why we have pretty high betas in our interest-rate risk modeling is we believe your comments are on point, which is there could very well be higher price competition on retail deposits, should the Fed decide to raise rates for those banks that are below or barely compliant with the LCR. So we model a 70% beta for every rate move linearly.","However as Tayfun said, we would hope that given our strong balance sheet position, we'd be able to take advantage of maybe the first couple moves and operate at a beta lower than that. But again we'll have to wait and see how the competition plays out for those retail deposits.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Morning, Scott.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Scott.","Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Morning, guys. Hey, just want to get my arms around the credit outlook. So the net charge-off outlook, that seems very stable. All the NPA indicators basically seem fine. But sort of the written commentary and then, Tayfun, your comments, maybe a little more cautious. And then the ongoing reserve build this quarter, when you net away all the noise from the student loan backed issue was perhaps more than I would've thought.","So, Tayfun, maybe if you could just sort of expand on your comments on credit broadly? And then I think the crux is if you could maybe discuss the need to add to reserves at a level consistent with this quarter's level going forward?","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So I look at \u2013 we actually in the analysis that leads to the ultimate reserve levels, we look at the broad macro indicators. This expansion now is approaching I think the 76th month of from the start date, and it's now the fourth longest expansion since the Second World War. And the next one up is the 1980-1981 expansion.","And we have to respect where we are. I look \u2013 we look at all the credit spreads indicators. And you just have to respect what the market is telling us. It doesn't \u2013 the spread expansion doesn't necessary mean that a recession is right around the corner. But sometimes it can sort of potentially feed the sort of next moves in the credit cycle.","We're just basically cognizant of where we are in this expansion cycle. And want to make sure that our reserve levels appropriately reflect that positioning. Beyond that you've seen all of our credit metrics. Our guidance is for core charge-off performance to resemble more the first half rather than the actual levels this quarter. I think we're just basically reflecting what we see in the broader macro sense.","In terms of provision levels going forward we're not necessarily forecasting provision into the next quarter. We had a $35 million add this quarter. But all we're saying is it should \u2013 obviously this is all based on the analytics that supports our reserve levels. But it should more resemble the actual credit performance. And we're obviously going to look at how the balance sheet is moving forward as well.","Frank, I don't know if you have any other comments on that?","Frank Forrest - Executive VP, Chief Risk & Credit Officer","No, I think you covered it well, Tayfun. Again the thing \u2013 one thing to keep in mind is when you look at the size of our energy book and you look at the size of our commercial real estate book, they're relatively small compared to our peers. They're stable. They're performing very well. And we feel very good about the outlook. So I have nothing else to add.","Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. That sounds great. Thanks a lot for the color.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thanks, guys. Just to follow up a little bit more on credit. So can you just talk through the \u2013 were the NPA inflows, $194 million, how much of that was related if at all to the student loan? And then \u2013 or was it related to the other pieces that you're kind of walking through, some of the other just global commodity\/stuff?","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Now $102 million of that number was related to that single student loan backed commercial line. So a big majority of that is based on that. In terms of the rest I mean you'll see quarter-over-quarter fluctuations in that number, but nothing beyond that that would indicate any sort of broader issues.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And just to follow up on the commodities\/energy side, can you just help us out, because it's obviously a concern? Any color on your reserve against your energy and commodities portfolio? And even specifically do you have exposure to some of the bigger names that have been mentioned in the press, like Glencore and others, where you guys have shown up on the loan docs at all?","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Just a broader comment on the reserve level, then I'll turn it over to Frank. We don't comment on specific reserves. But all I can say is, given the description of our energy exposure and given how we feel that I discussed during the script, we feel we are appropriately reserved for that exposure.","And I'll turn it over to Frank for the rest of the commentary.","Frank Forrest - Executive VP, Chief Risk & Credit Officer","Yeah. On the \u2013 again, on the energy book if you think about it, we had $1.6 billion in outstandings in our energy book. It's less than 3% of our total commercial loans, 2% of our total portfolio, so it's relatively small. The place where we've seen the most stress has been in the oilfield services sector, and that sector is $330 million of outstandings or only 20% of the total.","We will continue to see some stress, as Tayfun talked about. But we have no loans in the energy sector that are in NPL. And losses have been minimal over the last four quarters to six quarters, so that book continues to be well managed. It's well managed predominantly by our vertical with people that have a deep experience in the industry. We're highly focused on client selection. It continues to decline versus going up. And we believe it's \u2013 again it's being effectively managed today relative to the risk. And the size and scale of it is again I think fairly small.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC","All right. And my just last one is just on the size of the student loan credit is just $300-ish million is quite, quite large. And I'm just wondering how do we understand granularity? I know it's not a credit that you would underwrite today. But how much of kind of other really huge outsize credits do you have in the rest of the portfolio? And how you get comfortable with that type of concentration?","Frank Forrest - Executive VP, Chief Risk & Credit Officer","The thing to remember is this credit was underwritten at a different time, in 2007. It's an outsized exposure relative to our risk appetite today. We would \u2013 the loan originated at a larger size than the $307 million. It was approximately $0.5 billion when it was originated. The original purpose was to securitize it, to move it. The markets were unstable at the time, and the securitization did not take place.","Subsequent to that in the last 18 months we have added a number of elements into our overall risk management of the book to ensure that we are managing overall large credit exposure in a very prudent way. Our appetite has clearly changed and developed.","Subsequent to that we have guideline limits in place now tied to PD, tied to industries that we hold very strict. And we have a very small bucket and appetite for any exceptions to that. The same goes with concentration risk across the company, whether it be commercial real estate or energy or leveraged finance. We have built in significant safeguards in place to ensure that that's the case.","We have a handful of loans above $300 million. They are investment grade. Those would be the exceptions. Our appetite is more in the sweet spot of middle mark in the mid-cap lending, which is more in the $100 million to $250 million range for the majority of what we do and we hold.","And we are also intently focused on originating to distribute. And so we built our syndication capabilities to be able to distribute more into the market, rather than holding it on our balance sheet.","So the company has a completely different perspective and view in today's environment relative to appetite. And we've built many controls in place that we think were appropriate and prudent for good portfolio management relative to this exception again that was made eight years ago.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","Hi there. Thank you for taking the question. Coming back to some of those lender lists you've been showing up on again, names like Glencore and Trafigura. I know you can't comment on the individual exposures, but could you give us a bit more background on what you're doing, showing up on that sort of lender list? What your value add is in participating in those deals to big commodities firms that are based outside of the U.S.?","Frank Forrest - Executive VP, Chief Risk & Credit Officer","Hey, this is Frank again. Our exposure \u2013 overall exposure and commitments in the commodity sector is roughly $600 million. And we really have three to five key relationships that we've had longstanding relationships with, that we know the management teams exceptionally well. Very small number overall that we are very comfortable with. And we have a strategy with them that's consistent with our overall strategy in how we would go to market with different clients.","We don't have a broad appetite for this sector. And we don't have a broad appetite as we go forward to do things outside of our normal footprint. But again we do have a very small number of select relationships, none of which we will talk about individually, that we are very comfortable with the management teams, with our strategy, and with our relationship.","I'll also add that when you look at that book, it is a very short-term book in terms of maturity. Most of it self-liquidates within 12 months. So it's liquid in that regard. And we feel comfortable with our exposure at this point.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And some of these relationships go back 7 years, 8 years, 10 years. They're very long term. And these are not relationships that were added in the latest part of the commodity cycle. So that was not the purpose.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","Thanks. And then shifting tack a little bit, the 10-Q in August talked about some (43:22) risk around the CRA rating dropping to needs to improve. I wondered if you could explain what happened there? And why you think that's a risk?","Frank Forrest - Executive VP, Chief Risk & Credit Officer","Well, first off our CRA rating is very important to us. And it is certainly our intent to serve all of our customers fairly and to represent credit availability in all the markets that we do business. Our publicly stated goal has been to achieve regulatory excellence in all facets of our business, and that certainly includes full compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act.","I really can't speculate on the question that you have at hand. All I can tell you is that we expect to be fully compliant institution as we go forward. And we've developed strategies in place to ensure that that will be the case as we advance forward.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","Okay. Thank you very much.","Frank Forrest - Executive VP, Chief Risk & Credit Officer","Thank you.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore. Your line is open.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, John.","Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Hey, John.","John Pancari - Evercore ISI","Morning. Back on credit; sorry. On the \u2013 I wanted to ask a little bit around the Shared National Credit book. I know it stands at 27%-ish of your total loans. And I know you've grown that at a pretty solid pace over the past year. Can you update us on the credit standing of that book? And what the average size of the credits in that portfolio? And how many of them are above that $300 million number that you just put out there?","Frank Forrest - Executive VP, Chief Risk & Credit Officer","So, yeah. We can be clear about it. We actually have 47% of our total commercial book would be Shared National Credits. That's not really that unusual when you think about it from a regional bank perspective.","We underwrite all those credits to our own account. We don't buy a credit blindly. We underwrite every credit as if we were the lead on that credit. That portfolio has performed very well. It is predominantly an investment grade credit. We have approximately 2% of that broad portfolio that is criticized. 2%. So it has performed much better than the broader portfolio that we have in the company.","It's a very diversified credit overall. I don't have the specific average number that we have. But again as it relates to large exposures, I said before we have a very small number of exposure that would exceed $250 million to $300 million, very small handful of exposures. And those are to investment grade companies that have a very high PD. Companies that we've been very selective in doing business with, where we have a high degree of confidence in the management team, who have a long track record of success operating through the cycle.","So the bottom line with this SNC credit is that we get a lot of questions around it, and I understand why. But it's a portfolio that is high grade, well managed, underwritten to our own book, and it has continued to have exceptionally strong asset quality. And we do not see any differences in that book as we go forward. It's a small book relative to leverage, and it's a small book to relative to energy. It's a very diversified book of high-grade credits predominantly in our footprint within the U.S.","John Pancari - Evercore ISI","Okay. And just a follow-up to that. So there's not much of that portfolio that is outside of your footprint or outside of the U.S.?","Frank Forrest - Executive VP, Chief Risk & Credit Officer","No. 99% of that portfolio is in the continental U.S.","John Pancari - Evercore ISI","Okay. All right. And then separately wanted to ask around the Vantiv stake. Can you just give us your updated thoughts around that stake? Do you still intend to sell it down and possibly fund buybacks with the proceeds? I mean if you can give us just your updated thoughts there?","Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah. This is Greg. Vantiv continues to be a very valuable partner of ours. And we know that business extremely well. We know that management team extremely well. And as we've said consistently we expect to continue to reduce our position in a manner that is in the best interest of our shareholders. So timing is important. We want to be able to return much of that value to our shareholders as possible. You can expect us to continue along that strategy as we move forward.","John Pancari - Evercore ISI","Okay. All right. Can I \u2013 if I could just ask one more? On the IT spend, sorry if I misheard this, but did you say that the tech expenses would be up 10% in fourth quarter versus third quarter, Tayfun?","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's what we are expecting right now. That's correct. And I think that's in line with the guidance that we gave back in January.","John Pancari - Evercore ISI","Right. Okay. And the abatement of that level of spend would occur sometime during 2016? Or how do we think about that?","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Let's talk about that in January when we give you the full-year guidance for 2016.","John Pancari - Evercore ISI","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sameer Gokhale from Janney Montgomery. Your line is open.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Sameer.","Sameer S. Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning.","Sameer S. Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","I just wanted to go back. Maybe I didn't \u2013 I missed this in your commentary, but on the loan related to the private student loan portfolio. Effectively where were those private \u2013 the underlying private student loans marked on a market-value basis? Could you give me a sense for that? I must have missed it in your comments.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We did not provide where they were marked, Sameer. All we said was that we had an $80 million reserve against this pool at the end of June. And then the charge-offs basically came in at $102 million. And that included the impact of the spread widening during the quarter. But beyond that we did not provide any more details on the market valuations.","But right now we feel pretty good at where we are with 107% collateral coverage. Should the additional $13 million of reserves against the pool of loans that \u2013 with attached FICO score of 750 plus and the 75 months' seasoning.","Sameer S. Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And there again it's not on our books in the form of \u2013 this is a commercial line. So it's still in the commercial book.","Sameer S. Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Yeah. Okay. And then I just wanted to switch gears to the auto loan business. I think you had a settlement with the CFPB and had agreed to some changes in your pricing structure. It seems like a few other lenders have also agreed to similar changes, but perhaps not all of them. So I was wondering to what extent do you think that those changes to your pricing caps could have an impact going forward on auto loan origination volumes if any?","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Obviously it's tough to comment on the outlook for what other lenders may or may not choose to do. But in terms of the impact of the current structure, we're working with our dealers right now. And clearly our strong preference is to ensure the ongoing business relationships that we have and to be good partners. And at this point we're not necessarily anticipating significant changes of the business that we do with our dealers. And as we look forward into 2016 after going through the dialogue that we have in place with our dealers, we'll give you a better perspective.","Sameer S. Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then just my last question was, Greg, you talked about this also. And, Tayfun, you had discussed this at a recent conference. But you talked about replacing your head count heavy design with technology. And I think you said we'd get more guidance of course in January as far as expenses goes specifically.","But is it fair to say that it's going to maybe take some time for you to identify specific areas where you expect to realize those technology benefits? So it's not really a \u2013 by 2016 you'll have all of this mapped out. That might be \u2013 take 2 years or 3 years before you identify and target specific areas where you want to become better with technology. Or are we looking at early 2016, we get a full-fledged plan as far as what you envision over the next 2 years or 3 years? I'm just trying to get a better sense of that.","Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, Sameer, this is Greg. First off we're in the midst right now of really solidifying our 2016, 2017 strategic plan. Now a lot of those technology initiatives once again focused on either driving revenue, extracting efficiencies, regulatory compliance are in our sights right now. And what we're really doing is just finalizing a plan. And I think in January we'll be able to give you more guidance of what we expect to see from an expense perspective and where those investments are going to take place.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Sameer, the comment that we made during the script if you missed that part, is we believe that the upward slope in the risk in compliance-related expenses will stop in 2016. Clearly some of these technology applications would be expected to replace some of the human heavy processes. And that will come in after \u2013 obviously after that. So but we will discuss this with all of you guys in a little bit more detail in the upcoming quarters.","Sameer S. Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay. That's great. Thank you.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller from FBR & Company. Your line is open.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Yeah. Thank you very much. I was just wondering, because a couple banks have mentioned on their calls that they might have to back off on capital management on the CCAR, because I guess in the CCAR exam, a lot of people are assuming rates are going up. And now where a lot of people like yourself are pulling those forecasts out. Does that impact at all future capital management?","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. I mean we've seen the same comments. But in terms of the way we have our capital management actions planned, we're comfortable with the CCAR plan that was approved last year.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","And then as a follow-up you mentioned \u2013 correct me if I'm wrong. You mentioned that you might have to \u2013 that you might want to \u2013 you're going to try to increase operating leverage if rates don't go up over the next year. If I got these comments incorrect, please correct me. But so are you going to try to have a more efficient expense plan if rates continue to stay where they are?","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I did not make any comments about our expectations for operating leverage over the next year. All I said was that the directive to the organization is very clear. We will extract efficiencies in our existing businesses and in recognition of the rate environment. It's very important for us to make sure that we create an efficient-to-deliver infrastructure. That's really the comment that I made.","Now we've talked about the $65 million for example of reduction related to the closing of the branches, which will start in the second half of next year. We're clearly looking for more opportunities not necessarily in that area, but in all the parts of the company. And then going into the New Year we will share with you some of our strategic investment plans, and how they may impact at our expense base.","But the comment that I made was that we clearly look to extract efficiencies from the rest of our expense base to be able to make some of those investments.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay. Hey, guys, thank you very much.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Hey, Matt.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Question for Greg. Obviously a lot of talk on expense management. But maybe just more broadly speaking with you officially taking over in a couple of weeks and some new people on the team, should we think about any kind of broader strategic outlook \u2013 sorry, strategic update as we think about the next few months?","Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","First off I feel really good about the businesses we're in and the strategies that we put forth over the last couple years. I've been the President since 2013, I've been instrumental in those strategies. So I think strategically the direction that we're taking and that we have taken is the right direction.","Obviously we're looking for opportunities to increase the pace of play, accelerate some of those investment opportunities for returns. So I think strategically we're in the right path. The talent that we brought in recently, I couldn't be more pleased with the additions to our management team. And I think going into 2016 we're very well positioned.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And then just separately a little bit more of a detailed question. The commercial construction loan growth versus a year ago is very strong, almost doubling, obviously off of a very small number. But can you just remind us what that is, what kind of loans that is? And what's driving it up so much?","Frank Forrest - Executive VP, Chief Risk & Credit Officer","Hey, this is Frank. It's predominantly multi-family and industrial. They are strong credit names, predominantly high-grade. I can stress we're doing no speculative lending in that book. So these are credits that we feel very good about.","We are not a long-term lender. We are predominantly a construction lender. The majority of the long-term financing is being taken care of by other financial institutions.","Client selection for us is imperative. We're dealing with large regional and national developers that we know very well. Again as you said the overall size of our exposure in our book is still very small relative to where the company has been before. But we're comfortable in that space.","So high grade, it's predominantly multifamily and industrial. It's in good growth markets. And again we're very focused on client selection and very strong, sound, prudent underwriting, non-speculative.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And, Matt, just by the mechanics as you mentioned that the base was very small where it started from, which tends to elevate the percentage increases. And by nature of the shorter duration of those exposures, you will see a leveling off the growth rate. It just \u2013 it's very difficult to continue to grow that portfolio once it reaches a certain level of maturity.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And there has been some talk about obviously frothiness in the broader multifamily lending area. So I guess how do you think about that? And maybe it's just you were so underexposed that you're catching up a little bit. But how do you think about maybe that segment being a little overheated right now?","Frank Forrest - Executive VP, Chief Risk & Credit Officer","Well it is becoming more frothy as you say, but we are not catching up. We're being very prudent and selective in who we want to do business with.","And again it's credit tenants in these projects are \u2013 they're developers that have strong balance sheets. Client selection in commercial real estate is the first imperative. And beyond that it's ensuring that we're not making exceptions in our underwriting practices. And it's making sure that we're doing things that fit our risk appetite. And doing speculative lending is not in our risk appetite now or going forward, and we're not doing that.","So we're being very prudent in what we do and what we put on, very selective. And we're very cognizant on how much exposure we have in the individual market, especially those that are showing more growth. So overall again we feel very, very good that we're \u2013 what we're doing is exactly consistent with what our appetite is, multifamily, industrial, high grade, strong client selection, non-speculative.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Last week one of your Ohio neighbors, KeyCorp, reported results and just knocked the cover off the ball with their C&I loan growth. And when we asked why that was, they talked about hiring lenders, they talked about just having a really deep product expertise that kind of gave them an advantage over the other Ohio-based companies. Do you guys feel that that's a fair statement? That that's a fair advantage that they have? Or because I'm trying to just understand why they're growing so strongly in C&I specifically versus you guys, which are clearly seeing slower growth.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. We'll not make any comments about our friendly neighbors here in Ohio.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Well maybe...","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So I think we feel very good about the talent that we have and the product menu that we have to offer to our clients. We're happy with what we have.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Is there any way that you could do something, whether it's new initiatives or hiring more talent or something that might actually help narrow the gap? Or just \u2013 let's just call it improve your own C&I loan growth from here?","Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Ken, this is Greg. We've been very focused on talent in every single one of our markets. We have been growing our talent base in our markets. But once again we're really focused on the quality of our relationships, the right type of relationships, and being good through the cycle. So we're very comfortable with our performance right now and at the pace we're on. And we feel really great about the relationships we're bringing to the bank and the profitability of those relationships.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Eads from UBS. Your line is open.","David Eads - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning.","Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Morning.","David Eads - UBS Securities LLC","You guys talked earlier about the impact of some widening credit spread from the credit perspective. And I'm just curious, there's (1:01:31) obviously seen high yield spreads go out quite a bit. And I'm curious if you guys have seen any indications of that impacting the more \u2013 on the lending side, whether it comes to risk appetite or competition or pricing? Just any signs of that risk aversion filtering into the bank lending arena.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Some stabilization in production spreads is visible, but it's difficult to necessarily comment about whether it's going to last or not, because we've seen from quarter to quarter those types of moves, which did not last very long. But the difficulty is with respect to being able to project portfolio yields. Clearly portfolio yields are a function both of production spreads as well as payoffs and pay-downs.","So at this point we are choosing not to forecast. But we are somewhat optimistic that we may see the impact of that spread widening in capital markets in loan markets, but it takes a while for that to happen.","David Eads - UBS Securities LLC","All right. That's helpful. And then I know it's kind of early days, but have you seen anything surprising from the EMV switchover that would suggest there are opportunities or risks from either the revenue or expense side?","Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","No. This is Greg. As of right now our implementation's gone fairly smooth, obviously focusing on the customers with the highest usage. We're in full stride of getting those cards rolled out. As of right now it's to plan. So we're not seeing anything that's surprising to us.","David Eads - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy from Stephens. Your line is open.","Terry J. McEvoy - Stephens, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good morning.","Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Morning.","Terry J. McEvoy - Stephens, Inc.","Within the release you highlight the global economic slowdown as one reason behind the higher provision. And then on the call I think you specifically called out the manufacturing sector. Could you just talk about what you're seeing within your manufacturing customers? How they're adapting to market volatility? It seems like it's a pretty big part of the C&I portfolio at over 20%.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It is, Terry. We're not seeing necessarily an impact of the slowdown yet in our manufacturing base. All we're doing is we're just recognizing that globally, manufacturing is slowing down. Consumer tends to be stronger.","But we're seeing slowdowns. And just recognizing again where we are in the expansion cycle. Recognizing that the global slowdown may impact U.S. manufacturing activity. But this is nothing specific relative to our specific clients or borrowers. It's more a recognition of the global macro environment.","Terry J. McEvoy - Stephens, Inc.","And then as a follow-up the middle market was mentioned a couple times on the call as being a source of growth in terms of loan growth in Q3. Could you just talk about the pipelines heading into year-end here?","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Fourth quarter tends to be a strong quarter in terms of pipelines. We've seen good production in Q3. And we are looking into Q4 with similar levels of activity.","Terry J.

Your line is open.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just want to try and get a little more color on the global commodities exposure. Tayfun, you mentioned those have been long-term relationships. Can you give a little more color on where \u2013 given that these are global commodities players with a lot of business outside the U.S., what exactly is their relationship? And what's the strategic fit for you? And are there other global companies like that outside the U.S. that you're \u2013 that you have sizable exposures to?","Frank Forrest - Executive VP, Chief Risk & Credit Officer","This is Frank. We have a very small international book overall. And again as we've said before, we have a small number of commodity clients that we value. We've had a longstanding relationship with that have ties back into the U.S., back into our company.","But our overall international exposure is very small. It's a very small piece of our company. And our overall commodity exposure, as we indicated before, is very small as well. We're managing the book appropriately. And we're comfortable with the relationships that we have in place.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And given the volatility that we've seen, Frank, and Greg, and Tayfun, especially around Glencore and stuff in the markets, is there any plans to dial that back down?","Frank Forrest - Executive VP, Chief Risk & Credit Officer","We do not have an appetite to increase our exposure broadly in that sector.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And Frank mentioned it's a pretty short duration portfolio.","Frank Forrest - Executive VP, Chief Risk & Credit Officer","Yeah.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Vivek, this is not our long-term commitment that we're talking about.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right. Right. No, that's why I heard you say that and I thought, okay, does that mean that once these mature you sort of walk away from that and dial that back down.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We're clearly cognizant of the global environment, and we will make those decisions appropriately.","Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Correct.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. One small one for you, Tayfun, litigation reserve reversal.

Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby from Vining Sparks. Your line is open.","Marty Lacey Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","Thanks. Want to change the questioning a little bit, Greg. I wanted to ask you as you now assume your new role, one of the biggest challenges for the industry and in particular for Fifth Third is growing revenues. What opportunities are you going to be focused on? Where do you think you can really make some difference in a sense on the revenue side? Financial engineering can only take you so far. Eventually you got to create some revenue growth.","Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","I think obviously our commercial business is a source of opportunity for us, as is our wealth business, which is growing nicely traditionally over the years.","But in addition to that we've launched a payments division. And you look at our currency processing solutions, and our technology play in that sector supporting our retail and our healthcare sector. So I think payments is a source of opportunity for us. And we're looking hard at that technology stack, how it can be more additive in that respect through some potential M&A opportunities.","We'll also continue to expand our footprint where appropriate in mid-corporate. And also our talent on the middle market side of the house, there's opportunities there I think that continue to grow. So it's really once again continuing to focus on quality relationships in our commercial business, partnerships, and extracting value in our payments business and being additive to our technology stack. And then obviously wealth management I think is a key integral part of our One Bank strategy.","So I think those are the three areas where we can see some uplift in revenue. And if you look at our strategies, they're really focused in those key areas from a revenue perspective.","Marty Lacey Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","And then Fifth Third has traditionally done really well with acquisitions back in the day when you had your premium stock price and a lot of excess capital. What do you think and how does that play strategically into the growth of Fifth Third over the next five years to seven years?","Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Marty, that's tough to say. But I would tell you this. Any time there's an opportunity to create long-term shareholder value, we're going to take a look at that opportunity, and that's important.","But there's really no change to our core strategy around M&A. If it's bank M&A, we really want to be more relevant in our core markets today, where we can better serve our customers and extract more efficiency. So if we do a bank M&A opportunity, it's really going to be in our current markets.","But we're also looking at opportunities as I mentioned earlier that'd be additive to our payments business. And that technology stack there once again is supporting our commercial business in retail and healthcare. We think there's some opportunities there from an M&A perspective.","Marty Lacey Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","Thanks. And then, Tayfun, I wanted to challenge you a little bit on your 70% deposit beta. In the initial phase we're assuming 40%, and you go the first 100 basis points. Once you get to post that it moves up to your 70% kind of number that you're estimating for all moves. Is the difference in our analysis just the gamma? Or what we also showed in our analysis is that Firth Third has been pre-disposed to have higher deposit beta. So is there something in your culture or your regions or your customers that just makes you have a higher deposit beta relative to the peers?","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Let me give you my side, and then Jamie will comment on it as well. Marty, the difficulty is that it's extremely difficult to look back and compare what happened pre-crisis with rate moves, because we are operating under a significantly different liquidity structure and market structure. Our cautiousness is due to the unknowns. We want to make sure that we discuss with you what the outcomes may be.","I don't think we \u2013 there is anything specific to Fifth Third that would drive these betas higher compared to our peers. It's just the fact that under the current liquidity rules, which have never been in place before, it's difficult to extract our future experience based upon past experience.","James C. Leonard - Treasurer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. And we do use a 70% beta on every move, so it's not a gamma issue. But as Tayfun said we'll work very hard to potentially outperform that. And frankly our concern on the \u2013 and why we use a 70% beta is the combination of the LCR impact on retail deposits and frankly on banks that aren't LCR-compliant, whereas we already are. So if anything you may say we should be able to outperform better than a 70% beta.","But you also have technology is definitely at a different state in the banking industry today than it was 10 years ago in the last Fed tightening cycle. In the last tightening cycle we were right on the peer average of a 50% beta. And now we just started conservatively modeling a 70% beta as Tayfun said, due to the unknowns. If we're able to operate at a 70% beta, a 25 basis point move in the Fed funds rate is about a $70 million NII benefit annually. And if we're able to execute at a 30% beta, the number's about $120 million.","So we just want to size up the impacts and just make sure that everyone understands the importance of the underlying assumptions that go into both your deposit betas and then ultimately your asset sensitivity.","Marty Lacey Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","It'll be interesting when we ever do get that first 25 basis point, when the comments, we're going to stop and wait and see what everybody else is doing. If everybody's looking at everybody else, nobody's moving, which just in my mind kind of pre-disposes to a little bit better beta early on versus later on in the cycle. So it will be interestingly for \u2013 get that first move, see what happens.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You're right.","Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Absolutely.","Marty Lacey Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo from CLSA. Your line is open.","Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Hey, Mike.","Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi, Greg. Hey. I just want to confirm, you said you're closing 105 branches, and you'll be done by mid-2016?","Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Correct.","Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","So you start as CEO in 12 days. So in your first 8 months, you'll be closing 8% of the branches?","Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","That'd be correct.","Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","And so is it fair to characterize your approach as bricks to clicks? I'm using that term from the Internet era. But bricks to clicks, I mean you're reducing the bricks with the branch closures. And on the click side you said you're increasing technology investment. It sounds like more than just a 10% boost in the fourth quarter. So would you subscribe to that? Or characterize it differently?","Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","Well what I would tell you is first off we live in a technology era. And you're seeing that with respect to our user preferences and how they want to bank, anytime, anywhere. You look at our mobile deposit applications, right now 50% of all of our deposits are coming through remote Web, 38% through our digital channels.","Mike, we've been very mindful of the impact that has on our branches and branch traffic and so forth. So we're really measuring for a couple things. One is how do we touch and sell to our customers differently going forward? And also how do we drive back office efficiencies and improvement? And then what does that mean to our distribution channels, i.e., our branches? What do they look like? And how many do we need?","So we looked at over 50 variables. And we assessed the \u2013 and we came down to the 105 branches that we wanted to reduce. We think we're at the right level right now. But as we continue to move forward in this environment, as we continue to roll out additional technologies, as users continue to change and preferences changes, there will be more opportunities in the future. I can't quantify that at this point.","Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","Can you describe the end game? In January I guess you'll give us your plans for 2016. But 3 years, 5 years, 10 years out, are you looking to be the low-cost producer? Are you looking to be the digital king? I mean what's the end game?","Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","I think at the end of the game we want to be very efficient in how we serve our channels. And I think retail and a lot of the stress on the retail revenue side of the house drives you really to focusing on efficiencies and how you serve that channel. That's a benefit for the customer and the bank. So it's really after efficiency, better service. At the end of the day net-net, that's the model we want to be in. And we absolutely are focused on efficiencies here, Mike.","Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","And lastly you said increased pace of play I think a couple times. What metric would that be? What metric would best represent increased pace of play? Will that be the efficiency? Will that be ROE? Will that be some other \u2013 customer happiness with their experience?","Gregory D. Carmichael - President, Chief Operating Officer & Director","I think it's all of the above. It's hard to quantify. What I can tell you is when we look at our strategies in 2016, 2017, what we're rolling out, we're focused on how do we roll that out faster? How do we drive those efficiency quicker? And how do we serve the customer better?","So we're really looking at how we sharpen our pencil on the execution side of the house and get a better return quicker on our investments.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And, Mike, it's also the increase in the average hours work for Greg's team is also another metric that we're switching.","Gregory D.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bank Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you.","Mr. Jim Eglseder, you may begin your conference.","Jim Eglseder","Good morning. Today, we will be talking with you about our third quarter 2014 results.","This discussion may contain certain forward-looking statements about Fifth Third pertaining to our financial condition, results of operations, plans and objectives. These statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. There are a number of factors that could cause results to differ materially from historical performance and these statements. We have identified some of those factors in our forward-looking cautionary statement at the end of our earnings release and in other materials and we encourage you to review them. Fifth Third undertakes no obligation and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call.","I am joined today by several people; our CEO, Kevin Kabat and CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Frank Forrest, Chief Risk and Credit Officer; and our Treasurer, Jamie Leonard. During the question-and-answer session, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator.","With that, I will turn the call over to Kevin Kabat. Kevin?","Kevin Kabat","Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. Today we reported third quarter net income to common shareholders of $328 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.39. Results included the impact of a $53 million negative valuation on the Vantiv warrant which was approximately $0.04.","During the quarter, we continue to execute on our strategies that we shared with you in recent months and maintained our focus on disciplined deployment of our capital \u2013 of our shareholders\u2019 capital.","In today\u2019s environment, I am even more convinced that our focus on growing businesses that consume less capital capture a wider array of revenues in every relationship and that are closely aligned with our customers\u2019 changing preferences is the right way to build sustainable, long-term value for our shareholders.","Our intense focus on expense management was once again evident this quarter and represents another cornerstone of our strategy to achieve our return targets. Expenses were down 7% both sequentially and year-over-year.","If we exclude the negative mark on the Vantiv warrant, we ran at an efficiency ratio just under 60% in the third quarter as we continue to find ways to right size our expenses in line with revenue trends.","Certainly, there are and will be continued investments in the risk management compliance area as we take a balanced approach to expense management while continuing to invest in our infrastructure and our revenue generating capabilities.","Our financials reflects some of the deliberate actions we\u2019ve taken that we believe are the right decisions to make for the long-term and will position us well as the economy and interest rate environment change. Part of this is taking a prudent approach to lending standards and scaling back in areas that we don\u2019t believe have a compelling risk return profile.","Loan growth was more muted compared to other quarters especially in C&I as we maintain our cautious approach with respect to the industry\u2019s aggressive pricing and structure from both banks and non-banks that we are seeing in certain segments of commercial lending today.","In addition during the quarter, we\u2019ve maintained our disciplined pricing methodology in indirect auto lending in line with our return targets. Average loans were up $250 million sequentially and up 4% compared with last year.","Growth from the prior year was driven by 9% growth in C&I and 7% growth in bank card loans. Despite the elevated industry competition, our loan production remains healthy and within our risk parameters.","We are managing the company for the long-term and we are committed to maintaining our discipline even in this challenging environment. NII was stable sequentially and up 1% from the prior year despite the continued pressure on margins from tighter credit spreads.","Similar to our disciplined lending actions, we maintained our focus on building balance sheet strength as we took advantage of low rates and tight spreads and issued $850 million in fixed rate long-term debt.","On the asset side, we reduced the reinvestment of cash flows in the investment portfolio as we are willing to wait for better entry points to grow our earning assets. We continue to generate solid core deposit growth which was up 7% compared with last year. We are confident that the strength of our deposit franchise will be very significant in the coming rate cycle.","The investments that we are making in our retail business are increasingly building a comparative advantage for us relative to competition. Strength in our deposit franchise was reflected in the FDIC\u2019s annual market share data in which we grew deposits in each of our 15 affiliates and gained market share in 13 of the 15 affiliates.","We also had the third largest increase in total deposits among peers across our footprint. Our deposit market share position is testament to the investments we\u2019ve made since 2012 including our deposit simplification strategy.","These offerings were designed with a focus on building full and profitable customer relationships and to align value provided and value received given changes in the profitability of retail products.","As of the third quarter, 33% of our consumer deposit transactions were through digital channels, up from 31% in the second quarter. As we continue to build our digital capabilities on the transaction side, we are also investing in growing the revenue generation strength in these channels.","Fee income results in the quarter were led by areas that typically exhibit less volatility. Deposit service charges increased 4% sequentially as we continue to see the benefits of our focus on building complete customer relationships that we\u2019ve undertaken over the past couple of years.","Additionally, we\u2019ve reported a record quarter for investment advisory fees of $103 million. We believe we have many opportunities in our wealth management business and expect to see continued growth as we execute on our business strategies.","The credit environment in general remains positive. Net charge-offs ticked up slightly, but non-performing asset levels continue to trend down and were 21% lower than the prior year and our non-performing asset ratio declined below 90 basis points.","Our capital generation and our overall capital position give us the ability to support balance sheet growth while continuing to return capital to shareholders in a prudent manner. Our tangible book value grew 7% year-over-year and the average share count declined 6% driven by $1.1 billion of share repurchases announced in the past 12 months.","I am excited about all that we\u2019re working on at Fifth Third. As you saw last month, we announced the launch of our payments in commerce solutions division which combines existing businesses such as treasury management, commercial and consumer card and currency processing solutions with the resources specialized in developing innovative commerce-enabled solutions.","Our goal is to provide solutions for complex, high transaction industries and segments, such as those businesses in our retail and healthcare verticals and to provide a deeper, more holistic experience to our customers.","We remain focused on the things we can control, leveraging the strength of our core business and positioning Fifth Third for future success.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our operating results for the quarter and give some comments about our outlook for the remainder of the year. Tayfun?","Tayfun Tuzun","Thank you, Kevin. Good morning and thank you for joining us. I\u2019ll start with the financial summary on Page 3 of the presentation and some highlights from the third quarter.","We reported net income to common shareholders of $328 million or $0.39 per diluted share, which included the negative valuation adjustment on the warrant we hold in Vantiv of $53 million pretax or $0.04 per share. On an adjusted basis, earnings per share were $0.43, in line with our adjusted first and second quarter EPS.","Operating results have been stable from quarter-to-quarter this year consistent with what you would expect in the current environment. Return on assets was 1.02% and return on average TCE was 11.1%. Adjusted for the Vantiv warrants, these ratios increased to 1.13%, and 12.3% respectively.","Although these are below our long-term targets in the more normal environment, for the most part, we\u2019ve been pleased with our core business trends and our ability to continue to execute on our strategic plans.","With that, let\u2019s turn to the average balance sheet in Page 4 of the presentation. Average earning assets increased 1% sequentially reflecting modestly higher investments and loan balances.","We continue to expect total non-interest earning assets to grow in line with average loan growth over the next couple of quarters. In the third quarter, average investment securities increased by $886 million or 4% from the second quarter driven by the full quarter impact of our second quarter purchases rather than an increase in investment activity during the quarter.","The size and composition of our investment activities so far this year has been related to the anticipated finalization of the LCR rules. As of September 30, our liquidity coverage ratio of 92% would be compliant with the 90% requirement for 2016.","However, we intend to improve our LCR buffer prior to the implementation date. The lack of directional certainty and the current global economic environment, despite the widespread anticipation for higher short-term rate sometime next year gives us a pause in deploying additional cash into investment securities over the next few quarters.","We have always been opportunistic in managing our investment portfolio and timed our investments well in these challenging times. But at this time, we are exercising good caution in managing our risk exposures appropriately. We are content to wait on the sidelines for the moment.","Shifting to loans, similar to our cautious approach within our investment portfolio, we are being prudent on pricing and terms and we continue to originate loans to customers where their relationship profitability meets our return hurdles.","We believe that the current market environment and pricing levels leave little room for error in extending loans on the riskier structures. As a result, combined with typically soft third quarter commercial volumes, we saw relatively stable average portfolio loan balances, up $215 million from the second quarter, driven by a $182 million or a 1% increase in consumer loan balances.","Modest growth, primarily in residential mortgage and bank card offset run-off in home equity balances. A positive aspect of our lending discipline is that we are seeing a slowdown in yield compression within our loan portfolios especially C&I. Yield on the C&I portfolio was 3.25%, down two basis points from last quarter as new yields approach portfolio yields, while we can\u2019t predict the bottom, the rate of change seems to be slowing down.","Residential mortgage originations increased to $2.1 billion with 70% purchase volume. Periodically, when it makes sense, we retained certain conforming loan products with strong coupons and good credit to mitigate the risk to earnings in a static or declining rate environment.","As such, following our decision to portfolio an additional $310 million of loans this quarter, our saleable volume declined from about 77% to 64% reducing gain on sale revenue, which I\u2019ll touch on in a moment.","Commercial balances increased $68 million with growth in commercial construction and C&I, but run-offs, pay downs and stable line utilization offset third quarter production. About one-fourth of this quarter\u2019s new loan volume was through our middle-market segment and nearly 20% related to commercial real estate.","As Kevin mentioned, we are seeing less compelling risk return trade-offs in loan markets and as a result, we continue to be very disciplined about the relationships we are targeting.","Our loan growth numbers reflect that and may continue to do so as we are making prudent credit decisions in the current market environment which continues to feel the impact of non-bank competition.","On the deposit side, average core deposits increased $319 million in the third quarter primarily driven by growth in money market account balances. As Kevin noted, recent deposit market share data indicated market share gains across our footprints and reflected the benefits of our strategies during the past 18 months.","We are very focused on reinforcing our strong retail deposit base as we firmly believe that our retail deposit franchise will be the foundation for profitable balance sheet growth recognizing clearly that loan profitability is as much a function of funding costs as loan pricing.","Moving to NII on Page 5 of the presentation, taxable equivalent net interest income increased $3 million sequentially to $908 million, largely driven by the balance sheet changes I already discussed as well as the benefits from an additional day in the third quarter.","Overall, the interest income from higher interest earning asset balances was offset by the negative effects of loan re-pricing and higher interest expense associated with opportunistic debt issuances in the past two quarters.","We are making the right long-term decisions in mangling our liabilities and taking advantage of opportunities both in building retail deposits as well as in growing our wholesale funding efficiently.","As we have been sharing with you for the past couple of years, our interest rate management approach has kept our rate sensitivity in a tight range without taking outsize positions on either side. Once again, the current environment proves that anticipating rate increases in this weak global environment and building positions based on that is risky and we intend to maintain our discipline accordingly.","The net interest margin was 310 basis points, down five basis points from the second quarter, primarily driven by re-pricing in the loan portfolio, higher funding and deposit costs and a one basis point reduction from the effect of day count.","As a side note, with respect to our deposit advance product where earlier this year we made a decision to limit the availability of that product to existing customers. We continue to make progress on designing our next generation banking products and services to address the needs of the other bank population.","These products and services are mostly retail cash banking services. As we mentioned in July, we are working with all interested parties to explore the design of an extension plan for the credit product. We believe that the time and effort spent on this is worthwhile to ensure that we arrive at a long-term solution that meets our clients\u2019 needs and our goals in the current regulatory environment.","We will provide detail on this and what it means for our 2015 results when we give our annual guidance in January. Shifting to fees on Page 6 of the presentation, third quarter non-interest income was $520 million compared with $736 million last quarter. Excluding the significant items noted on this slide for both quarters largely Vantiv, fee income of $573 million decreased $12 million sequentially.","Looking at other drivers within fee income, mortgage banking net revenue declined 21% sequentially, which was below our July expectations. Our decision to retain certain conforming production, specifically arms and shorter term fixed rate originations impacted the sequential results and drove lower gain on sale revenue by approximately $7 million, while at the same time gain on sale margins were down 14 basis points to 224 basis points, which caused a $2 million decrease in sale revenues.","In addition, we had a positive $5 million MSR hedge results in the second quarter relative to a $1 million loss this quarter.","Corporate banking revenue declined 7% sequentially on lower syndication and business lending fees primarily reflecting the impact of lower loan production in the quarter. As I discussed earlier, this is an area where our prudent decisions have impacted activity and short-term growth, but we believe that we will be able to deploy this capacity at better terms for our shareholders by being disciplined.","Markets are fluid and we will be focused on taking advantage of those opportunities when we see them. Long-term success of customer relationships depends on win-win solutions for our customers and for us and we remain committed to our strategies including our focus on cultivating lead left relationships and targeting key industry verticals.","Card and processing revenues declined $1 million from a seasonally strong second quarter results and was up $6 million from the third quarter last year as we continue to drive deeper into our existing customer base through greater card utilization and higher consumer purchase volume.","We had solid results in our deposit service charges and investment advisory revenue captions, up 4% and 1% respectively from the second quarter. Retail deposit service charges increased 9% sequentially, reflecting the additional day in the quarter as well as higher overdraft occurrences.","Within investment advisors, our shift to recurring revenue streams and an increase in market value led to a record quarter of fee income of $103 million, up 6% over last year with increases in personal asset management fees and securities and brokerage fees.","We also continue to manage expenses tightly to maintain our status as one of the more efficiency focused banks while still investing in our company. We show non-interest expense on Page 7 of the presentation.","Expenses came in at $888 million this quarter, compared with $954 million in the second quarter. This was our lowest level of reported expenses in five years. Adjusted for the items listed on the slide, which include elevated litigation reserve charges in prior quarters, non-interest expense of $882 million was down $10 million sequentially, driven by lower compensation expense reflecting the second quarter payout of long-term incentives as well as another 1% reduction in headcount in the third quarter.","This was primarily due to additional reductions in retail staffing, as branch transactions declined another 4% in the quarter and were down 10% from the prior year. In addition, although there were a few million dollars of seasonal benefits in our total expenses, our core performance still help us achieve operating leverage during the quarter including a sub-60% efficiency ratio.","PPNR on Page 8 of the presentation was $535 million. When adjusted for the items noted on the slide, PPNR was $594 million, up $1 million from the second quarter adjusted PPNR, primarily the result of our core expense discipline. The efficiency ratio adjusted on the same basis was 59.5% for the quarter.","Turning to credit results on Page 9. Total net charge-offs of $115 million increased $14 million sequentially with the increase was evenly between commercial and consumer net charge-offs. Net charge-offs were 50 basis points of average loans.","The increase in consumer net charge-offs was spread across the portfolio, while on the commercial side, a $19 million increase in C&I net charge-offs was partially offset by a $12 million decline in commercial real estate net charge-offs.","Although there is some variability in the results at these low levels, we do believe there is further room for improvement here, primarily in consumer. Non-performing assets, excluding loans held for sale of $796 million at quarter end were down $36 million from the second quarter bringing the NPA ratio to 88 basis points, its lowest level in seven years.","Commercial NPAs and consumer NPAs decreased $25 million and $11 million respectively from the second quarter. Commercial delinquencies and consumer delinquencies over 90 days past due continue to trend lower.","Wrapping up on credit, the allowance for loan lease losses declined $44 million sequentially and reserve coverage remains solid at 1.56% of loans and leases.","Looking at capital on Slide 10. Capital levels continue to be strong and well above regulatory requirements. The Tier-1 common equity ratio on a Basel-1 basis was 9.6%, up three basis points from last quarter.","Pro forma for Basel 3, our common equity Tier-1 ratio was 9.4% and increased 12 basis points from last quarter. At the end of the third quarter, the average diluted share count was down another 1% sequentially and it\u2019s the lowest we have seen since the end of 2010.","During the quarter, we announced common stock repurchases of 225 million. That ASR was settled last week and we received an additional 1.9 million shares which makes the total for the entire transaction approximately to 11.2 million shares.","Now turning to the outlook on Page 11. We have updated parts of this slide to reflect any changes to our full year expectations, but the remainder of my comments will focus more on our current outlook for the fourth quarter.","As in the past, comparisons exclude the impact of any gains on Vantiv share sales and changes in the warrant value in 2014 and 2013 as indicated in the footnote of this slide. I\u2019ll start with net interest income.","We expect full year 2014 NII to increase about 1% from full year 2013 NII of$ 3.6 billion. The slight change in our full year outlook reflects the decisions we made in the third quarter to issue debt ahead of our planned schedule and temporarily delay additional investment portfolio leverage. These actions cost us about $12 million.","Additionally, our revised guidance reflects a lower level of fourth quarter commercial loan outstanding as we are starting the quarter at a lower level than we had anticipated due to the reasons we\u2019ve already discussed. So for the fourth quarter, we expect NII to be down a few million dollars compared with the third quarter.","We anticipate a full year NIM slightly less than 315 basis points, given our expectation for further margin compression in the fourth quarter. We expect NIM to be down about six basis points from the third quarter which includes two basis points due to higher cash balances we expect to carry in the fourth quarter, as well as one basis point from the full quarter impact of our $850 million debt issuance.","Otherwise, we generally expect loan growth in the fourth quarter to offset continued re-pricing in the portfolio as we continue to take a disciplined approach.","Turning to loan growth, we still expect mid-single-digit growth for the full year, although towards the lower end of that range than we had anticipated coming into the year, as a result of my earlier discussion on the environment.","We expect sequential growth in the fourth quarter of 1% driven by growth in C&I and commercial construction loans. We now expect a mid to high-single-digit increase in deposits as we further prioritize the value of deposits on the balance sheet.","Moving on to overall fee income and expense expectations for the fourth quarter. We currently expect fee income to increase in the mid to high-single-digits from $573 million excluding the impact of Vantiv warrant reported in the third quarter, otherwise, the increase is expected to be driven by growth in corporate banking revenue in the 15% range due to seasonally stronger business lending and syndication fees relative to the third quarter.","In addition, excluding any hedge related variability, we expect flat mortgage-banking revenue in the fourth quarter. And last, fourth quarter fee income should include the $23 million benefit from the annual tax receivable agreement payment that we expect to receive from Vantiv which is an ongoing long-term benefit that we received from them as part of the overall relationship including a direct ownership and warrant position.","Turning to expenses. We currently expect fourth quarter expenses to be up in the low to mid-single-digit range due primarily to seasonally higher compensation-related expense based on our expectations for business activity levels during the quarter and continued investments in risk management and compliance including an uptick in fee card related expenses.","The sequential increase is also somewhat higher given some of the seasonal benefits in the third quarter as I mentioned earlier. We remain committed to managing our expenses in line with revenue trends, while maintaining appropriate investments in the company to build future revenue streams.","We don\u2019t typically highlight expense savings initiatives publicly as they are included in our ongoing numbers. As such, the efficiency ratio is part of the internal benchmarks that are used to evaluate management\u2019s performance.","Having said that, we also acknowledge that there is a focus in the industry on improving risk and compliance infrastructure in light of the changing business and regulatory environment and we will increase our investments in that area as well.","We don\u2019t necessarily view these as pure carrying costs rather we believe that such investments ultimately will build the competitive advantage for us going forward.","Overall, excluding the impact of the warrants, we expect PPNR to be up in the fourth quarter and we still expect to achieve positive core operating leverage in 2014, excluding Vantiv with the efficiency ratio improving about 80 basis points relative to 2013 and the impact of our expenses has been offsetting declines in revenue. As for taxes, we expect the full year 2014 effective tax rate to be about 27%.","Turning to credit, our outlook for the full year net charge-off ratio is now in the mid-50 basis points range, given that we are at 57 basis points year-to-date. Fourth quarter net charge-offs are expected to decline by about 10% from the third quarter level. We still expect a significant decline in NPAs compared with 2013, down about 20%, further reducing the NPA ratio.","With respect to loan loss reserves, we continue to expect the benefit of improvement in credit results to be partially offset by new reserves related to loan growth.","Overall, our outlook is reflective of what we see in the current environment, how we are reacting to that environment and our focus on building long-term shareholder value by maintaining discipline in all areas that we control. The decisions that we are making are less reliant on the anticipation of a better environment, but more on maintaining stability in our results.","One housekeeping note, we added a slide in the appendix on Page 15 that provides some more detail around the assumptions that drive our asset sensitivity. I wanted to make sure that you are aware of that and mention a few items.","First, our balance sheet is well positioned for rising rates while being mindful of the downside rate risks. Second, our sensitivity assumptions are more conservative than what we experienced in 2004 through 2006 with deposit data of 70% and no lag in raising rates.","Finally, we show our asset sensitivity for our current balance sheet as well as our forecasted balance sheet with the measures being fairly comparable.","To wrap up my remarks, I just add that the fourth quarter is underway; we look to continue with positive momentum in our results through the year end and beyond. We believe our strategies position the company for success now and in the future and we will continue to appropriately invest to strengthen our competitive edge and optimize shareholder value.","With that, let\u2019s open the lines for questions. Susan?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Scott Siefers \u2013 Sandler O'Neill","Hey, Tayfun and Eglseder, well, something you could expand upon some of the comments you made about maybe a more conservative posture towards kind of the securities portfolio and I guess, or gather maybe seeing a little shorter, can you take a little bit about ramification of that in other words, even though the yields aren\u2019t necessarily attractive, I guess they may be lower, they are shorter you face though, the shortage around the yield curve.","So can you talk about sort of the costs versus longer-term earnings pick up dynamic that you had thought about? And then, would that imply that there might be renewed margin pressure, kind of, just kind of beyond the fourth quarter if the tactics on managing the securities portfolio a little different?","Tayfun Tuzun","Sure. Good question. Obviously, this environment makes us think five times before we build strategies and tactics. I just have to point out that over the past three years; we\u2019ve dealt very well with the volatility in interest rates.","Now when markets were anticipating rate increases, we were cautious, we maintained our rate sensitivity within a very tight range and a lot of that actually has to do with the way we invested in the portfolio. We kept the size very small for that reason. And so the experience that actually we\u2019ve gained throughout the last two three years in this environment is helping us now.","In terms of activity in this environment, we are just not adding the leverage to the portfolio. We just don\u2019t believe that the risk return profile of those investments at this point are attractive enough and we are willing to sustain a little bit short-term pain for that because I think in the long-term, being able to invest, although I have to say that we don\u2019t know yet when that environment will realize.","But, at 2% 10 year and even the short end of the curve being where it is, I think we will remain on the sidelines which obviously from a NIM perspective actually, it\u2019s not that hurtful, but from an NII perspective, we will have some short-term pain as we actually discussed in this script. I\u2019ll turn it over to Jamie for further comments as he and his team have been watching these markets very closely.","Jamie Leonard","Yes, thanks, Tayfun and Scott, as Tayfun was mentioning, we\u2019ve pushed out additional investments while also still achieving a 92% LCR and we\u2019ve done that by taking the pain on the funding side with the debt issuances. We pulled forward the $850 million fixed rate.","So we\u2019ve had the NIM compression on the funding side while not able to enjoy all the benefits on the asset side by holding the elevated cash levels looking at we would expect by at least mid-2015 to be able to put that money to work, but that our forecast is based on several quarter delay and additional timing.","And then the other part of your question related to just the rate environment and the outlook, really if you go through each of our quarters, the last three quarters, the loan yields have compressed five basis points of NIM impact in the first quarter, four in the second, two in the third, so you are really seeing that dissipating and stabilizing here.","So I wouldn\u2019t expect the whole lot more in terms of loan yields compression. But what you will see and what Tayfun mentioned in terms of the fourth quarter, just remaining carryover effect of the funding actions in the fourth from the third quarter will cost us two to three basis points and then holding those cash levels, cost us another two basis points in the fourth.","So we are looking at a NIM in the three or four range and then, maybe a little bit of a BIP or two maybe in the first quarter. But really, we\u2019ve really taken the pain from the LCR in terms of the NIM compression and really we\u2019ll just \u2013 NII and NIM expansion beyond this will be reliant upon this market selling off here.","Scott Siefers \u2013 Sandler O'Neill","Okay, perfect. I appreciate that. And then maybe, either Jamie or Tayfun just as a follow-on on rates, I guess who knows what\u2019s going to happen with either the short end or they occur more broadly, but if the FED does indeed act next year but the long end of the curve kind of stays low, what\u2019s your attitude kind of qualitatively for that kind of environment, to the, I guess, you get relief on the capital side and then there may be some relief on the short-term and \u2013 but how would you think about that sort of situation?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes, I think you are right. Clearly, 30 days ago, the likelihood of us being in this environment was as high as the rest making the play-off, such as time the rest didn\u2019t make the play-off, but here we are in this environment. And at the same time, this morning\u2019s economic data indicated the job, those claims at the lowest levels since April of 2000.","So, it\u2019s difficult to predict exactly how this is going to play out in the global context and what the FED will do. But, part of the discussion that we had today, not only with respect to interest rate risk, but with respect to the market and other risks that are being priced, is very related to the environment and we are very cognizant of that.","There is a lot of liquidity chasing a lot of unattractive yields and if this market environment continues to be exactly the way it is today, we will maintain our discipline. But at the same time, we are looking at our financials a little bit more broadly than just net interest income and we\u2019ve been able to manage our performance in line with the environment, whether it\u2019s related to your investments in fee income-producing businesses or managing expenses, we will react accordingly.","I think, our tactics and strategies are dependent on the background and how that background shapes, but we\u2019ve been able to show that we are nimble and we make the right decisions and we will do so without necessarily stretching for additional risks.","Scott Siefers \u2013 Sandler O'Neill","All right, perfect. Thanks a lot.","Tayfun Tuzun","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin. Your line is open.","Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies","Thanks, good morning. Tayfun, I was wondering if you could just help us just get some true up the pre-pri comments about third to fourth. So, we are talking about off of a base of 590 for the third quarter when you talked about pre-pri still being up in the fourth quarter?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes.","Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies","Okay, so, and then as you guys think about looking out to next year, just in general terms again talking all your points about how challenging it is, do you believe you\u2019ll still be able to build upon this base of pre-tax pre-provision from here, given the dynamics that we are hearing you guys talk through about some of the revenue challenges but the better expense performance. How do you think that\u2019s all going to have to \u2013 how do you think that as you start to think about next year\u2019s planning, what would be the key drivers there?","Tayfun Tuzun","Sure, Ken, as you can imagine, we are working on our 2015 numbers as we speak and events like this week and changes in volatility obviously changes our plans as we move forward. 2014 was not necessarily a breezy year for us either, but in this environment, we\u2019ve done pretty well and as we look forward to 2015, we still believe that along with additional investments in areas that we mentioned during our introduction, we still have room to continue to manage this business efficiently.","We are very keen on managing sales force effectiveness in this environment as production fluctuates; we need to make sure that we are getting the highest efficiency from our sales force. We are working on significant efforts to control third-party large vendor expenses. We are looking at outsourcing opportunities.","So there is still tools in the clause but, that we have available to us in 2015. And we also clearly are investing in the business to drive revenues, whether it\u2019s in commercial capital markets, in the payments business, in retail, we are not \u2013 I mean, as Kevin mentioned, I mentioned during the introduction, we are spending money to increase revenues in the retail channel through digital channel.","So they still will help us to maintain a stable and healthy revenues going forward and we still have tools. But we will share more of this with you in January when we update our 2015 numbers.","Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies","Okay and then just last clarification, just going back to the pre-pri. So the growth after the third quarter includes the $23 million Vantiv?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes, it does.","Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies","It includes it. Okay, got it. All right, thank you.","Tayfun Tuzun","I mean, that\u2019s now \u2013 I mean, I have to say that number is now built into our income because as we\u2019ve discussed with many of you over the past year or so, we are looking at 15 plus years of cash flows coming from the ETRA agreements. It is part of how we plan the spin-off and it\u2019s part of how we retain the value from Vantiv. So, it is very much part of our core earnings.","Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies","Understood, okay, thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian Bank of America. Your line is open.","Erika Najarian \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Yes, thank you. My first question, we appreciate the guidance on mortgage revenues for next year, but we heard another bank earlier this morning say that just over the past few days they\u2019ve gotten quite a significant bump up in refi and I was wondering given the fluidity of the rate situation, if we could see a better than expected volume, refi volume quarter for you guys?","Jamie Leonard","Yes, Erika, it\u2019s Jamie. I\u2019d say the same is true here. Our volume has picked up from about a $20 million a day up to $38 million application day, yesterday. So, yes, refi volumes are picking up, but, we\u2019ll see how long that holds if I were truly prophetic and had put in the interest rate sensitivity slide on Page 15 that had a flat and fall scenario which you would see for us is about 1% NII decline but more than made up for by that mortgage banking revenue and refi.","So we think we are well positioned and have a nice diversified balance sheet and business to really battle through this type of environment if it were to stay this way for a while.","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes, Erika it\u2019s a little difficult to give you a different picture this morning after an inter-day volatility that we saw yesterday between 187 and wherever that today started 220. So as we sort of continue to observe the markets and see wherever this ends, we will clearly update our internal discussions and then if we have a chance, we\u2019ll update that as well.","Erika Najarian \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Great, and in terms of your comments about scaling back in certain lending products. Could you tell us specifically where in commercial you feel like that the industry risk tolerance above yours and is it the credit structures that give you pause or is it pricing or both?","Kevin Kabat","It is both and when you look at our production levels for this quarter, the largest portion of our commercial production came through our middle-market segment. That segment clearly is a little bit more isolated and it\u2019s healthier. We have good existing relationships that drive better outcomes.","But broadly, what we are seeing is, both from some larger banks, larger than us, and non-banks, there is a stretch in structures. For example, we have \u2013 I was looking at specific deals. We have certain amortization targets and typically our amortization targets are no less than 50%, no less than 40% for certain structures. We are seeing now lenders extending credits with no amortization. We are seeing multiples of leverage above us and offers.","We are seeing on a combined basis with structural elements, leverage elements, significantly lower coupons. And we don\u2019t view that as healthy. There are reasons why I guess banks and non-banks are doing this. But we are seeing that in different industries in different segments and that\u2019s what gave us a pause. So it\u2019s a combination of both rates and risk parameters.","In some instances, even with higher rates, we would not compromise from structural elements or covenant requirements. In others though, we are willing to look at risk offers, priced appropriately but even there, we are seeing stretched parameters and Frank, I don\u2019t know if you add additional comments on that.","Frank Forrest","No, the only \u2013 you asked about where we are pulling back. We\u2019ve certainly like most banks taken a hard look at our leverage books. We did that proactively at the end of the first quarter prior to the shared national credit exam and as a result of that made some adjustments in our underwriting criteria and also our caps on overall risk appetite that we b believe were prudent. We shared those proactively with our examiners.","They agreed with our assessment. So we feel very good that we are positioning that book appropriately given the overall concerns that the regulators had. Back to Tayfun\u2019s point though, however on the leverage book, one of the major concerns that has been expressed has been on the covenant light deals and that\u2019s not an issue with Fifth Third less than 1% of our leverage books is covenant light.","So we are sticking with good structure ensuring we are getting paid for the risk and doing credits today with companies that we know very well that we underwrite very carefully and prudently and do good due diligence. So, that\u2019s one area I think we\u2019ve acted prudently to pull back although we are still bullish on doing good business, good leverage business with the right customers.","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes, the good thing is that, on the leverage side, that portfolio for us has stayed at the same dollar number for the last two years. We\u2019ve been fairly focused on making sure that we are doing the right deal. So, again, we are happy with where we are, where our portfolio is, but we are not willing to fairly stretch to add growth.","Erika Najarian \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Got it and then like to just sneak one more in here. With your loan to deposit ratio on a core basis over a 100%, do you have targets in terms of where you like to lower that to in potential anticipation of a rising short end and if there is something that you are seeing that would cause deposit betas to be 20 percentage point higher or is that model conservatism?","Kevin Kabat","Erika, this is Kevin. Here is what I would tell you. We still believe very strongly in core deposit growth as one of the fundamental pieces of relationship in the business. So our focus there has never veined. We continue to be strong in terms of that as I\u2019ve indicated in my scripting in some of the FDIC data.","So we still see very strong growth opportunity from that perspective and we think that will help position us well on a go forward basis in terms of the franchise as well. So, I think the one thing that we as a bank and the industry as a whole are in debate in terms of how conservative the betas are in anticipation of a change in rates and what both companies and individuals do with all the liquidity.","At that point, I think our point would be that we are conservatively looking at it and trying not to be in a position where we had surprised if and when that situation occurs. So, that\u2019s really kind of the way we are positioned and why Tayfun detailed that additional page we put in the appendix.","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes, and as Kevin mentioned, we truly view our retail deposit franchise as the cornerstone of this franchise for balance sheet growth going forward. We spend a lot of time because, whether it\u2019s related to the LCR rules or just the state of the regulatory \u2013 other regulatory rules, retail deposits in any environment \u2013 in any rate environments are going to be extremely important across the board for all of our businesses. So, we are spending quite a bit of time and maintaining that perspective.","Erika Najarian \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great, thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Two questions for you. The first, in terms of the deposit to advance product it sounds like you are still working on that, but, from a conceptual standpoint, when you do eventually figure out what new products you want to introduce, is there a ramp up period such that you started in 2015, it takes a long time to really get customer adoption or is it a product potentially that gets a very fast ramp that you get more of them that sooner.","Jamie Leonard","Yes, Ken, you do have to look at that question in terms of kind of strategically how we are viewing it. We think for the most part, the core banking bundles that we\u2019ve been talking about which really exclude our orientation around what credit offerings we include there.","We think we\u2019ll build over time and we think there is a real need and we think there is something from our product offering that makes a lot of sense for us to do that. So we are moving forward with that. Whether or not, as we\u2019ve discussed in the past, it includes a small dollar credit, we are still strategically in discussions about still evaluating and we are watching what both the marketplace needs would be as well as the regulatory environment.","So we\u2019ll balance that that could be a much faster adoption rate simply because of what we see as the need in terms of the environment in that customer base. So, we\u2019ll have more for you as Tayfun mentioned as we look at 2015, but we really see those as kind of two pieces.","Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Got it, okay. And then the other question I had, just in terms of mortgage banking if I heard right, it sounds like your gain on sale margin was lower because of your decision to retain, I guess more adjustable rate mortgages.","Is that decision something that you anticipate to hold steady, because it\u2019s kind of like you expect the revenues for mortgage banking is a constant which implies that no change to what you are doing or is there other drivers there?","","Jamie Leonard","So, Ken, actually margin was not necessarily, a shrinking margin during the quarter was not necessarily related to the retention decision, but, I mean, as days like yesterday would require, we will take a look at our thoughts on that retention. For now we are still \u2013 and our guidance basically assumes that we will continue that through the end of the year. I think it was a good decision and \u2013 but over the next days and weeks, we are going to re-evaluate it. Again, once we see a level of stability in rates.","Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Got it. So the drop in margin was mostly just due to \u2013 I guess industry factors, not your portfolio.","Jamie Leonard","Yes, exactly, it was not related to retention.","Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Understood, all right, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache of Nomura. Your line is open.","Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities","Thanks, good morning. To-date, there hasn't really been much of an earnings drag from the sale of your interest in Vantiv given that it\u2019s continued to grow its earnings base even as your ownership stake has decreased.","Can you talk about how going forward you guys are thinking about the eventual pressure from the lost earnings stream as you continue to sell down your stake, I know that that is still a ways off, but perhaps just conceptually if you could speak to that?","Tayfun Tuzun","Sure, with respect to Vantiv, our strategy has not changed; our long stated strategy of reducing our ownership in the company has not changed. We are very well aware obviously, just purely with respect to the earnings stream, but at the same time, we\u2019ve been obviously buying back our shares when we do see Vantiv, that sort of has been mildly accretive so far.","So we have to take that into account and our assumption is that unless a better opportunity comes along, we will continue to execute or exit in a similar fashion. But in terms of just to focus on dollar earnings, the reason why we\u2019ve been investing in fee income producing businesses obviously is going to contribute to a capture of that line item. But we are not specifically focusing on that line item as again we\u2019ve been able to reduce our share count.","Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities","Okay, so, the reduction in the share count, and you get the benefit at the time that it\u2019s done, but then going forward as that earnings stream \u2013 as you lose that earnings stream, you have to replace that with some other fee income and so the investments that you\u2019ve been making in other fee income businesses is where you expect you will be able to kind of make up the lost Vantiv earnings stream over time? Is that the right way to think about it?","Tayfun Tuzun","That\u2019s correct.","Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities","Okay, and then separately, I had a couple of questions on auto, first can you update us on your outlook for the auto lending environment from where you stand? And then separately, the average FICO scores of the auto loans of the auto loans that you guys have originated over the last decade plus have been north of 750.","So, very high credit quality, can you discuss whether you\u2019ve ever considered going a bit further down the credit spectrum particularly since \u2013 this is an area where I guess you\u2019d be able to limit any losses by repossessing and selling the collateral at auctions along as vehicle prices are okay? Can you just maybe share what the thought process has been there?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes, clearly, some banks are viewing the sub-prime auto sector as an attractive sector. We have not viewed it at the same way. We\u2019ve maintained our discipline in a very long period of time we will continue to maintain that discipline. As you said, our FICO scores, our advance rates has remained very stable.","We are not interested in the sub-prime auto business, because we don\u2019t view our indirect lending business as a collateral based capture of higher than anticipated collateral. It\u2019s a credit decision that we made and so therefore, we\u2019ve stepped back from chasing yields through credit and we are not participating there and we also obviously are conservative in terms of using our existing capacity.","We are originating $400 million to $450 million a month, whereas our capacity there is significantly north of that. But again, as the broad picture that we described earlier, whether it\u2019s in auto lending and C&I lending, and the way we manage investments, it\u2019s part of our risk management strategy and hitting the right risk return trade-offs for our shareholders that we will not compromise there.","Bill Carcache \u2013 Nomura Securities","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller from FBR. Your line is open.","Paul Miller \u2013 FBR","Most of my questions have already been asked and answered, but I do have one follow-up. On slide nine, on the credit slide, there obviously was a modest uptick in 30 to 89 past due that you \u2013 it looks like you attribute to seasonality. Can you just expand a little bit on what causes that?","","Jamie Leonard","","Our 30 and 90 are still very low relative to expectation standards. So we feel very comfortable with where we are. We do experience some seasonality in the quarter, but we are very comfortable with the level of past dues that of 30 and 90 margin. No concerns going forward.","","Tayfun Tuzun","","Paul, I mean, in terms of credit, obviously, we\u2019ve not spent a lot of time because we think that the trend is positive when you look at non-accruals going down, non-performing assets going down, 90 days past due going down quarter-over-quarter. Non-performing loans hitting 68 basis points, these are all good trends.","","Paul Miller \u2013 FBR","No, I understand the trends are good. I just saw \u2013 I was wondering what the seasonality was, I\u2019m not too familiar with third quarter to second quarter seasonality. But that cleared it up. Thank you very much.","","Tayfun Tuzun","","You are welcome.","","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Elliott. Your line is open.","Jeffrey Elliott \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Hello guys. You touched on the increased regulatory scrutiny on the leveraged loan market. Clearly there has been quite a few headlines in the press around that over the last few weeks.","Are you detecting any further changes there? Do you think your competitors are getting the same messages maybe you picked up on earlier and how does that affect the competitive dynamic as you go into the fourth quarter?","Jamie Leonard","","Some have gotten the message it appears, some have not, so, I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s been uniformly received, but we should not diminish the role of non-bank competitors in this space who are clearly not subject to same type of regulations.","","Jeffrey Elliott \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sameer Gokhale of Janney Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Sameer Gokhale \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","Thank you. I just had a few questions. If I heard you correctly, Tayfun, you said that middle-market loan originations comprised about one-fourth of your total commercial loan production. So firstly, I just wanted to check if that\u2019s right.","And, then related to that, what I was curious about is, what that share has been in the past, say, 12 months ago. And should we attribute, if the shares increase, say if it is in fact a quarter of your commercial production, is that increased share a function of the launch of your middle-market advisory business in April of this year tying that in with more lending? So if you could just talk about that that be helpful?","Tayfun Tuzun","","So, Sameer, the middle-market lending percentage, when I look at sort of the last four, five quarters, it\u2019s been high, but this quarter it ticked up. But just to clarify one issue, we have a mid-corporate group and then we have a middle-market group.","So, the middle-market group is the more traditional C&I bread and butter business that\u2019s what you have for a long period of time. What you are referring to in terms of the efforts that we\u2019ve discussed earlier in the year is the mid-corporate space that\u2019s a separate space.","That sort of has been growing as well, but just on a quarter-to-quarter change, the increase in true middle-market has been a bit more pronounced and what we are seeing in the rest.","","Kevin Kabat","","We also are seeing the benefit of some of the additional verticals that we\u2019ve put in place. Our energy vertical is picking up and gaining momentum as we had expected when we put that in place. So it\u2019s starting to mature across its development as we had hoped when we put the strategy together.","So I think that\u2019s contributing and we are seeing some nice pick up also in some of the equipment leasing activity which has been not something that we\u2019ve seen historically strong as we are seeing now.","","Sameer Gokhale \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","Okay, thank you for that. And then, Kevin, you talked about the payments and commerce solutions, I guess, business that you\u2019ve launched and I was wondering what you could lay out for us in terms of specific targets or what your growth aspirations are I mean, clearly, when you look at the results, currently card and processing revenue is not that big a line item relative to some of the others in your non-interest income line and then if you look at the size of the card portfolio, it\u2019s also relatively small.","So how big do you anticipate that business is getting? It seems like you and maybe many of your peers are increasingly focused on cards as \u2013 and credit card products as a way of offering another product putting that in the hands of their customers. So, can you share with us how much you expect both of those businesses kind of the fee income part and the loan portfolio to grow over the next, say, two or three years?","Kevin Kabat","","Yes, I think the way that we are viewing is a little bit differently than what you stated. I don \u2013 well, we do believe card is an opportunity for us, comes on a very small piece of the whole. Predominantly, that whole payment to commerce division is really predominated with our treasury management business, that\u2019s large.","And if you look at our treasury management performance over the last three four years, RTM growth in total has been significantly higher than the industry, largely because some of the product offerings that we\u2019ve done, the enabling of technology to enhance a solutioning for our customers.","I talked to you about our RevLink product which was specifically designed around our healthcare vertical. Those are the types of strategies that we think, we have more room to kind of explore our CPS solution with our retail vertical we think is an opportunity for us to really help accelerate the growth from that standpoint.","So, while we haven\u2019t shared yet kind of specifics byproduct offering or by area as a whole, we do expect to continue to grow our entire payment and commerce solutions area at a multiple of what the industry is not performing yet. But we expect that momentum to continue.","Again, it\u2019s through these innovative areas of solutioning that apply our knowledge of what their needs are along with technology to get them better insight into what they are doing. So that\u2019s really kind of the approach is, not really \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t define it as a card-based overly based solutioning that we are looking at in that space.","","Sameer Gokhale \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","And is there a reason for not wanting to be more traditional credit card-oriented in that space?","","Kevin Kabat","No.","","Sameer Gokhale \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","It seems like that is another product offering that that you could add and emphasize more. So is there a specific reason to not want to emphasize as much?","","Kevin Kabat","No, we agree with you. We think that the card offering within our customers and utilization within their wallet is an important opportunity for us, but it isn\u2019t something from our standpoint that we look to really drive the growth out of the payment space. So we will contribute, but may not be the key driver of growth in that area for us.","","Sameer Gokhale \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","Okay, and then just my last question really more one out of curiosity, because I know you started up a UK office recently to service a UK client that have operations in the US and I was curious from a timing standpoint, why now, there is some talk of weakness in Europe, the UK. Was there anything driving that in terms of timing specifically or you just felt that this is something that just made sense?","Kevin Kabat","Yes, there is nothing from the timing we\u2019ve been in Brussels for 22 years. So we moved that office really to London which is quite frankly a much heavier concentration of the clients that we serve from that standpoint. So it made a lot of sense to us and that really wasn\u2019t driven by timing, it\u2019s more driven by where our customer aggregation and business relationships are today.","","Sameer Gokhale \u2013 Janney Capital Markets","I see, okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","There are no further questions in the queue. And with that, we\u2019ll conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect."],"9043":["Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ:FITB) Q2 2019 Earnings Conference Call July 23, 2019  9:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Chris Doll - Director, Investor Relations","Greg Carmichael - President and Chief Executive Officer","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer","Jamie Leonard - Treasurer","Conference Call Participants","Scott Siefers - Sandler O\u2019Neill","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Mike Mayo - Wells Fargo Securities","Gerard Cassidy - RBC ","Saul Martinez - UBS","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks","Kevin St. Pierre - KSP Research","Operator","Good day.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","It is now my pleasure to turn today\u2019s program over to Mr. Chris Doll, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.","Chris Doll","Thank you, Jay. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. Today, we\u2019ll be discussing our financial results for the second quarter of 2019. Please review the cautionary statements in our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain reconciliations to non-GAAP measures along with information pertaining to the use of non-GAAP measures, as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third\u2019s performance. We undertake no obligation to and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call.","This morning, I\u2019m joined by our President and CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Chief Operating Officer, Lars Anderson; Chief Risk Officer, Frank Forrest; and Treasurer, Jamie Leonard. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Tayfun, we will open the call up for questions.","Let me turn the call over now to Greg for his comments.","Greg Carmichael","Thanks, Chris, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. Earlier today, we reported second quarter 2019 net income available to common shareholders of $427 million or $0.57 per share. Our reported EPS included a negative $0.14 impact from the items shown on Page 2 of our release. [Technical Difficulty] mostly due to merger-related expenses associated with MB Financial. Excluding these items, our adjusted second quarter earnings were $0.71 per share.","Our financial results were very strong, exceeded our previous guidance, and reflect the progress we are making on our four strategic priorities: leverage technology to accelerate digital transformation, invest to drive organic growth and profitability, expand market share in key geographies, and maintain credit, expense, and capital discipline. The strong performance also reflects our continued focus on driving profitable revenue growth, prudently managing our expenses, and the improved profitability resulting from MB Financial.","During the quarter, we completed the MB Financial customer conversion [ph], which represents a significant milestone. We remain very optimistic about our post acquisition growth prospects both in our retail and commercial franchises. Additionally, net interest income, fee income, and expenses all performed better than our April expectations. As a result, our adjusted efficiency ratio improved more than 250 basis points from a year-ago quarter to 58.5%.","Our net interest margin, which include the expected positive impact from MB Financial, expanded 9 basis points and was in line with our previous guidance despite the challenging interest rate environment. Net charge offs of 29 basis points improved sequentially and year-over-year reflecting the ongoing benign credit environment in previous balance sheet actions. Our adjusted ROTCE, excluding the impact of AOCI, due to the significant unrealized investment portfolio in cash flow hedge gains was 15.8% in the second quarter. ","Before providing an update on the progress related to MB Financial and our key strategic priorities, I\u2019d like to make a few observations about the macroeconomic environment. As I mentioned at a recent investor conference, we continue to see a generally healthy economic backdrop. Consumers continue to benefit from a combination of a strong labor market and limited inflationary pressures resulting in a strong wage growth.","In commercial, banks are being more cautious and have expressed concerns about both current and potentially more punitive future tariffs affecting their growth plans. Due to the higher end-of-quarter paydowns, our loan origination volume was somewhat tempered relative to our previous expectations. However, we continue to have a robust pipeline, particularly in middle market lending, which position us well for the second half of the year.","However, we will not chase loan growth for the sake of growing. We will be remaining disciplined in our approach to client selection by focusing on the balance between credit quality and profitability. For instance, we continue to reduce our exposure to non-relationship commercial leases and are maintaining a cautious approach to commercial real estate lending at this point in cycle. ","Our balance sheet management philosophy of focusing on improved performance through the full economic cycle positions us well for the future. For the rest of 2019, we continue to expect generally stable credit quality with potentially poor fluctuations given the current low absolute levels of charge-offs.","Now, an update on MB Financial acquisition. In early May, we completed the MB customer conversion. We successfully converted the majority of systems less than two months after closing the merger. As with any conversion, we continue to follow-up with customers and employees to ensure a smooth transition. We have already completed 46 of the Chicago area branch closures, which consisted of a mix of Fifth Third and MB locations. We will close the last branch related to the transaction by the end of this month.","Our best-of-breed approach throughout the acquisition has been the key for the successful outcomes we have achieved so far. As a result, we have experienced no material employee attrition. 91% of the legacy MB employees who were offered position with Fifth Third are still here today. We have also not experienced any material customer or client attrition. In fact, the commercial client attrition rate since the conversion has been lower than the MB legacy attrition rate during the past 24 months leading up to the acquisition and has continued to improve over the past two months.","During the second quarter, we have generated end-of-period loan growth in the Chicago region of more than $100 million, and deposit growth of more than $200 million, both increasing approximately 1% from the prior quarter. We continue to receive positive overall feedback from our new MB retail customers. They now have access to nearly 200 branches, the third largest network in the Chicago area in addition to advanced digital capabilities, sophisticated wealth, client solutions, and access towards expanded network of over 50,000 fee-free ATMs.","We are focused on maintaining the positive momentum in the Chicago market. We recently unveiled a new Chicago marketing campaign that pays homage to both MB\u2019s legacy and our dedication to serving our commercial clients and has been very well received. In addition, we have begun utilizing our next generation branch design in select Chicago locations. We believe we can offer greater convenience and even better customer experience that\u2019s more efficient and more automated. We remain very pleased with our progress we have made and are confident in our ability to deliver the financial synergies as previously communicated.","We continue to expect to realize the $255 million in annual expense synergies by the end of the first quarter of 2020 and have already completed many of the key expense actions. We will achieve approximately 80% of the run-rate savings by year-end. We also continue to expect to generate meaningful revenue synergies from the acquisition. We have been pleased with the initial success turning additional revenue opportunities since the customer conversion. ","In our national asset-based lending business, we have already generated a robust pipeline of new client relationships to accelerate future growth. Furthermore, we have seen early signs of success leveraging MB\u2019s leasing capabilities, provide value-added client solutions across our markets. We continue to expect revenue synergies to generate approximately $60 million to $75 million in annual pretax income net of expenses by 2022.","In addition to the combined power of our enhanced ABL leasing capabilities, we also expect synergies to come from the complementary focus on middle-market lending and from deploying Fifth Third\u2019s capital markets, digital banking, and treasury management solutions capabilities. We believe that Fifth Third Chicago is now in a significant position of strength that will allow us to generate stronger deposits, household, and revenue growth going forward. While we have devoted a significant amount of energy on the MB acquisition to deliver for our clients, employees, and shareholders, we have also remained focused on executing on our key strategic priorities to produce strong financial results.","First, we continue to leverage technology such as our data analytics capabilities to accelerate our digital transformation while continuing to modernize our systems and infrastructure. We are prioritizing investments then improve the customer experience, grow households, and drive further operational efficiencies. We\u2019ve also made considerable investments over the past several years to modernize, simplify, and rationalize our infrastructure. This allows for faster and more data driven insights.","We\u2019re also investing in advanced fraud and cybersecurity technologies. As a top area of concern, our investments include providing alerts and real time monitoring to detect and respond to threats quickly. These investments have resulted in a year-over-year decline in fraud losses. Second, we continue to invest in our business to drive profitable organic growth. We have made several recent investments in technology and talent to support our growth plans, including key additions to our sales teams and strategic areas for the company. For instance, in middle market banking, we have added key talent in our new geographies, including California and Texas.","Also, in our corporate [Technical Difficulty] outcomes from our ongoing investments in both our sales force and technology and we expect significant growth in our commercial fee-based businesses going forward. In wealth and management, we are focused on leveraging partnerships across other lines of business, as well as in market RIA and town acquisitions to maximize revenue opportunities. We have been very successful generating new business and have experienced positive AUM inflows for six consecutive quarters.","In retail, we are successfully leveraging our target of marketing campaigns and our preferred banking program to grow households in the mass affluent segment. As a result of our strategic investments across our retail franchise, we have generated total customer deposit growth of more than 6% over the past year, excluding the benefits from MB, which is significantly greater than almost all our peers. We leverage our one-bank operating model to collaborate across all of our businesses in order to provide holistic client solutions. We will continue to invest in our businesses diversified revenue and accelerate growth.","Our third priority is to expand our market share in key existing markets. I know we have the necessary skill in the Chicago market, we will continue to optimize our branch network in our legacy footprint in order to support our faster growing South East markets. By the end of this year, we will have completed approximately two-thirds of the plan 100 legacy branch consolidations and open 25% of the 100 planned openings in the South East markets.","Lastly, we are focused on maintaining our disciplined approach to credit, expense, and capital management throughout the company. As I mentioned earlier, credit discipline remains as important now as ever. We are focused on maximizing through-the-cycle returns rather than generating lower quality loan growth. We have demonstrated our ability to diligently manage our expenses, while investing in areas of strategic importance. We remain focused on continuing to generate positive operating leverage.","We also continue to allocate and manage our capital prudently. We deploy capital based on what we believe would generate the highest long-term return for our shareholders. Tayfun will share more details regarding our current capital return expectations. Our clearly defined setup strategic priorities were designed to enhance revenue growth, as well as general expense efficiencies in order to meet our financial and strategic objectives. ","I like to once thank all of our employers for their hard work, dedication, and for always keeping the customer at the center. It\u2019s because of our employees that we were honored to be named Best Regional Bank by Kiplinger for the second year in a row. They also recognized our next generation branch design knowing that it creates a more modern and friendly atmosphere. I was pleased that we were again able to deliver strong financial results. We remained very confident in our ability to outperform to the cycle and create significant value for our shareholders.","With that, I\u2019ll turn over to Tayfun to discuss our second quarter results in more detail and our current outlook.","Tayfun Tuzun","Thank you, Greg. Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Let\u2019s move to the financial highlights on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation. Reported results for the quarter were negatively impacted by two notable items, an $84 million after-tax impact from MB merger-related charges and a $17 million after-tax negative mark related to the Visa total returns swap.","Excluding these items and other items from prior periods as shown in our reconciliation tables, including MB-related merger charges and prior period Worldpay gains, pre-provision net revenue increased 29% on a year-over-year basis, and increased 24% from the prior quarter. Our financial performance also reflected the full quarter benefits associated with the acquisition of MB. Our adjusted results for the second quarter were very strong with net interest income, non-interest income, and expenses all performing better than our April guidance. ","The area where we are significantly outpacing the peer group is our NII and NIM performance. We have been very deliberate and comprehensive in our actions over the past 12 months and longer in managing our interest rate risk, including our strategies in managing the investment portfolio, our preference not to grow our residential mortgage portfolio, and a timing of the hedge transactions that we have executed ahead of the rate downturn. These were well thought out and well executed decisions with a longer horizon view that put our performance ahead of others.","Looking at the disclosed information prior to today, our net interest margin, excluding purchase accounting accretion is above the median of the peer group facts. Our adjusted return metrics were also strong during the second quarter with an adjusted ROA of 1.33%, an increase of 12 basis points from last quarter. Also, we achieved a return on tangible common equity of 15.1%. It is important to note that given the current rate environment and our prior actions to shield the portfolio from higher prepayment speeds, the unrealized investment portfolio gain, as well as the hedge portfolio being have increased significantly.","Consequently, our ROTCE was impacted by elevated AOCI levels. Given the interest rate outlook, we expect these items to continue to affect our reported return on tangible capital. In the second quarter, our AOCI as a percent of total shareholders\u2019 equity was 5.7%. By comparison, the median for the peer banks that announced prior to today was a negative 1.5%, which makes a very meaningful difference when comparing return metrics. Therefore, we are providing you with our ROTCE, excluding AOCI of 15.8% in the second quarter.","During the quarter, we successfully completed the MB customer conversion. Therefore, our future reported growth rate should provide a clearer depiction of our firm wide core growth performance. Our second quarter results also indicate that we are tracking slightly ahead of our expense savings pace associated with MB Financial. In line with our previous guidance, we expect to achieve approximately 80% of the run rate expense savings by year-end and realize our annual expense goal of $255 million beginning the second quarter of 2020.","Our second quarter credit performance continues to reflect the benign macroeconomic environment. The net charge-off ratio of 29 basis points decreased 12 basis points from last year and decreased 3 basis points from last quarter. Commercial losses remained near historically low levels and the consumer loss rate improved 9 basis points sequentially. We remain focused on maintaining credit discipline at this point in the economic cycle.","Moving to Slide 5. All of our balance sheet captions were impacted by the MB Financial acquisition on a year-over-year and sequential basis. In our commercial business, the growth patterns and portfolios we are prioritizing look very encouraging. In the second quarter, we have seen good growth in our middle market banking business. National large corporate loans and our verticals also grew albeit it at a slower pace and we have seen declining balances in commercial real estate reflective of the cycle and risk environment, as well as in large ticket indirect leasing where we halted new originations in early 2018.","End of period commercial real estate loans were flat from last quarter. Our balances, as a percentage of total risk-based capital, remain very low at less than 80%, which keeps our commercial real estate exposure relative to capital near the bottom of our peer group. Average commercial loans and leases increased 25% from the year ago quarter and 16% from the prior quarter. Commercial loan production increased 3% sequentially, driven by strong middle market lending originations.","Second quarter middle market loan production outpaced the previous quarter in 8 of our 13 markets. In our Chicago region, total end of period loans increased more than 1% sequentially. Payoffs and paydowns at the very end of the quarter had a larger impact on our national corporate banking portfolio. Total commercial line utilization decreased 1% sequentially, but increased 2% year-over-year. Our pipelines throughout the business remain solid. With a good start to the quarter, we expect to generate strong C&I loan growth in the second quarter, partially offset by declines in CRE and commercial lease businesses.","Average total commercial loans should be stable on a sequential basis in the third quarter, compared to the second quarter. We are mindful of the risks associated with the current environment and believe that we need to continue our prudent client selection and underwriting process as loans with aggressive pricing [instructors] at this point in the cycle may not necessarily be in the best interest of our shareholders. Having said that, we are confident that we will continue to prudently grow our portfolio within our current risk and profitability profile.","Excluding the positive impact of MP, on a year-over-year basis, we have grown our C&I loans at 7.1% above the peer median. For the full-year, we continue to expect average total commercial loans to increase approximately 20%, compared to 2018, again impacted by the MB acquisition. Average consumer loans grew 9% from the same quarter last year. Apart from MB, our core growth rate was strong driven by auto loan production of $1.4 billion during the quarter.","We are seeing continued decline in home equities, growth in line with the industry and credit card, growth in indirect auto, and a flat residential mortgage portfolio in-line with our view of the current rate cycle. In the third quarter, we expect total average consumer loan balances to increase approximately 2% sequentially. For the full-year, we expect average total consumer loans to increase approximately 8%, compared to 2018. Combining the commercial and consumer portfolios, we currently expect full-year 2019 average total loans to increase approximately 15% to 16%, compared to 2018, which is unchanged, compared to our previous guidance.","Moving on to Slide 6. Compared to the prior quarter, NII increased $164 million or 15%. Adjusting for purchase accounting accretion from the non-PCI MB loan portfolio, NII increased $149 million sequentially or 14%. Our second quarter NII benefited from a $16 million of PAA or 5 basis points of NIM. The adjusted second quarter NIM of 3.32% increased 4 basis points from the first quarter, consistent with our April guidance.","As I mentioned before, we are very pleased with the outcomes from the actions that we have taken with respect to our prudent and long-term oriented interest rate risk management. With these actions, we have been able to protect our rate exposure to lower short-term rates and particularly with our investment portfolio positioning to a flatter long end of the curve. We have not executed any new hedges in the second quarter and a portion of the swaps that we executed last year have effective dates this quarter and the first quarter of 2020 with five-year terms at an average fixed rate of 3.14%.","In addition, the 2.25% one-month LIBOR floors that we executed in late 2018 become effective December of this year, again with a five-year term. We have included additional information related to our interest rate risk profile and investment portfolio positioning in the presentation appendix.","Interest-bearing core deposit costs increased 4 basis points sequentially, which was below the peer average and was consistent with our previous guidance. Our performance reflects our success in generating stable consumer deposit growth. Our overall interest-bearing liability costs continue to be very well maintained up only 1 basis points during the quarter.","Our outlook assumes [three 25 basis point] rate cuts throughout the remainder of 2019; in July, September, and December. In that environment, we assume that deposit betas will be in the high 30s to 40 range. As a result of these assumptions, we currently expect our third quarter NII, excluding PAA to be up approximately 1% sequentially, reflecting the benefits of our larger earning asset base and day count, partially offset by continued market pressures from lower rate.","Our third quarter NIM, also excluding PAA, should be down approximately 3 basis points, compared to the adjusted second quarter NIM of 3.32%, due to the impact of lower short-term rates. We expect the third quarter benefit from PAA to decline to 4 basis points. As a result of the expected 3 basis points decline in core NIM and a 1 basis point drag from lower accretion reported NIM should decline approximately 4 basis points, compared to the reported second quarter NIM of 3.37%.","We have provided more detailed information in our presentation appendix related to our expectations for purchase accounting accretion, excluding the potential impact from prepayments, as well as expected core deposit intangible amortization expense. We expect full-year 2019 NII growth of approximately 15% to 16%, compared to 2018, excluding PAA and including the impacts from lower rates. Should the Fed cut rates 75 basis points in the second half of 2019, we expect the NIM, excluding PAA on a full-year basis to expand approximately 7 basis points in 2019, compared to our prior guidance of 10 basis points, which assumed static interest rates.","Moving on to Slide 7, corporate banking fees were up 14%, compared to the year ago quarter and up 22% from the prior quarter reflecting the impact of leasing revenue from MB financial, as well as solid core performance. In capital markets, we experience a less favorable environment during the quarter, which pressured revenues in debt capital markets and loan syndications. For the third quarter, we currently expect our corporate banking revenue to increase approximately 7%, compared to the second quarter, reflecting both the larger client base post MB and improved performance from the initiatives we have previously discussed.","Card and processing revenue was up 10%, compared to the year ago quarter and increased 16%, compared to the prior quarter, primarily reflecting increases in credit and debit transaction volumes, partially offset by higher rewards. Wealth and asset management revenue was up 13% from the year ago quarter, and 9% from the prior quarter due to higher personal asset management revenue and institutional trust fees. The sequential increase was partially offset by seasonally strong tax-related private client service revenue in the prior quarter. We are very optimistic about the AUM growth in the second half of the year, which also bodes well for growth in 2020.","Mortgage banking revenue was up 19% year-over-year and 13% sequentially. Origination volume of $2.9 billion was up 76% from the last quarter and 36% from the same quarter last year. The gain on sale margin from our retail channel increased from 235 basis points in the first quarter to 244 basis points in the second quarter. Our total gain on sale margin of 166 basis points was down 10 basis points sequentially due to channel mix and was flat from the year ago quarter. Deposit service charges increased 4%, compared to the year ago quarter and increased 9%, compared to the prior quarter.","Performance from both the year ago quarter and prior quarter reflected higher commercial deposit fees, driven by the benefit of the MB client base along with continued client acquisition in the core Fifth Third franchise. The growth in commercial deposit fees was partially offset by lower consumer deposit fees as we continue to focus on improving our product and service offerings. For the third quarter, we expect total noninterest income to increase approximately 2% from the adjusted second quarter of 2019. And for the full year, we expect total noninterest income to increase 15% to 16% from the adjusted 2018 noninterest income.","Moving on to Slide 8. Second quarter reported expenses included merger-related items from the MB transaction of $109 million, as well as intangible amortization expense of $14 million. Non-interest expense adjusted for these items and prior period items shown in our materials increased $102 million or 10% from the year ago quarter. The expense growth for the quarter came in below the low end of previous guidance demonstrating our continued commitment to maintaining expense discipline and achieving positive operating leverage; excluding the previously mentioned merger related items, the year-over-year increase in expenses reflected higher compensation expenses and continued investments in technology. ","The growth in expenses was partially offset by lower incentive-based payment and the elimination of FDIC surcharge. We currently expect third quarter expenses to be flat sequentially from the adjusted second quarter 2019. Also, we expect full-year 2019 expense growth of approximately of 13% from an adjusted 2018 expense base of $3.865 billion. All expense projections exclude merger-related expenses and the impact of intangible amortization.","Our NII fee and expense outlook for the third quarter should continue to lower efficiency ratio by another 50 basis points or so. We are cognizant of potential challenges to the overall revenue growth expectations in-light of the rate environment and recognize expense management as a tool to counter the impact of a weaker growth outlook. We remain on track to deliver on the previously provided outlook for MB-related expense savings. We continue to expect to achieve $255 million in savings by the end of the first quarter 2020.","Our second quarter results reflect approximately 40% of the total run-rate expense savings target. Based on our current expectations, at the end of the year, we are on target to capture 80% of the savings on a run-rate basis. Additionally, we continue to expect our total after-tax merger charges inclusive of the merger-related charges recognized in current and past periods as well as future projected charges to be approximately $250 million after tax.","Turing to credit results on Slide 9, second quarter credit results continue to reflect the generally benign environment. Our key credit methods have remained stable and remain at or near historical lows. The second quarter net charge-off ratio of 29 basis points decreased 12 basis points from the year ago quarter, and 3 basis points from last quarter. The commercial charge off ratio of 13 basis points increased slightly compared to last quarter and decreased 21 basis points from last year, while the consumer net charge off ratio of 59 basis points decreased 9 basis points compared to last quarter.","The NPA ratio of 51 basis points declined 1 basis point compared to last year. The ALLL ratio was flat sequentially at 1.02% with provision expense offsetting net charge-offs due to slightly lower end of period loan balance. Again, I would like to remind you that the current economic backdrop continues to support a relatively stable credit outlook with potential quarterly fluctuations given the current low absolute levels of charge-offs.","Turning to Slide 10, capital levels remain very strong during the second quarter, our common equity Tier I ratio was estimated at 9.6%, and our tangible common equity ratio, excluding unrealized gains and losses was 8.27%. Our tangible book value per share was $20.03 this quarter, up 11% year-over-year and 7% from the first quarter. During the quarter, we initiated and settled $200 million in buybacks, which reduced common shares outstanding by approximately 7.2 million shares.","Additionally, at the end of the quarter, we settled the $913 million share repurchase initiated in the first quarter of 2019, which lowered share count another 2 million shares. We also raised our common dividend $0.02 in June to $0.24 per share. Through the first half of the year, we\u2019ve returned nearly 120% of earnings to shareholders through buybacks and common dividends. At the end of June, we announced our capital distribution capacity of approximately $2 billion for the period of July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020. This includes the ability to execute share repurchases, as well as increased common stock dividends and exclude potential repurchases related to the remaining after-tax gains from the previous sale of Worldpay stock.","As always, our capital actions are subject to board approval and market conditions. We continue to remain focused on disciplined capital management. We will continue to calibrate our capital ratios to the risk profile of our balance sheet and business composition, which points to a lower level of capital than we currently have. As always, we will continue to take into account the prevailing macro-economic conditions and peer group of capital levels in our overall capital management approach. Our medium-term CET1 target is 9% to 9.5%.","Slide 11 provides a summary of our current outlook. Based on our third quarter and full-year 2019 outlook, you can see we currently expect a strong finish to 2019. The combination of our strong performance in the second quarter and a stable outlook in this challenging rate environment is encouraging even under probably the most conservative rate outlook one can apply. Reflecting the market expectation that the Fed will most likely lower rates by 75 basis points by the end of 2019, we expect to generate a core ROTCE of approximately 16.5% in the fourth quarter of 2019, excluding the impact of AOCI.","Furthermore, we expect our fourth quarter ROI to be in the 1.35% range with an efficiency ratio below 57%. This is consistent with our previous guidance for the fourth quarter of 2019 with the exception of the impact of lower rates than what we previously expected. We plan to provide more information regarding our revised 2020 return targets as late \u2013 later this year as the future path interest rates hopefully becomes clear.","In summary, I would like to irritate a few items. Our second quarter results were strong and continues to demonstrate the progress we've made over the past few years towards achieving our goal of outperformance through the cycle. Our execution on the MB acquisition is on track to meet our target and guidance on both expense and revenue synergies. Also, we are on track to reposition our branch network to improve our market share in the Southeast. As always, we remain intensely focused on successfully executing against our strategic priorities and remain confident in our ability to achieve our financial targets.","With that, let me turn over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A.","Chris Doll","Thanks, Tayfun. Before we start Q&A, as a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. We will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have allotted this morning. During the question-and-answer period, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator.","Jay, please open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Chris. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers of Sandler O\u2019Neill. Sir, your line is open.","Scott Siefers ","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question.","Greg Carmichael","Good morning, Scott.","Tayfun Tuzun","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Siefers","Hi. Tayfun, I just want to make sure I understand the guidance correctly, and I appreciate all the granularity. Just as I look specifically at the fee guidance for the full year, just given that we have half a year in the bag, and then, we\u2019ve got the third-quarter guide, it looks like the fourth quarter ramp would be just very, very strong. I want to make sure I understand what all the puts and takes are as you see them, and I guess, both for the third quarter you know it sounds like corporate banking is going to be, you know, pretty strong, but then into the fourth quarter what would drive that really big ramp?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes. So, Scott, the underlying third quarter to fourth quarter growth is truly in corporate banking and a combination of overall capital markets as well as treasury management. As we look at our corporate treasury management pipelines and the expected on-boarding of some of those client revenues, as well as in general our expectations with respect to just corporate banking fee activity, you know, that builds the basis for our outlook.","Scott Siefers","Okay. So, it should indeed be, you know, well above the $700 million I guess in fees in the fourth quarter if I\u2019m reading it correctly.","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes. Mathematically that should be over $700 million. That\u2019s correct.","Scott Siefers","Yes. So, okay, good. Alright, thank you. I appreciate that.","Tayfun Tuzun","Sure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ken Zerbe","Great, thanks. Just a question in terms of the margin, I know the MB does, say, helps you guys out a fair amount, is there any way to separate out the benefit that you got on a core NIM basis? So ex-the PAA from MB versus what Fifth Third would have done this quarter ex-MB?","Jamie Leonard","Yes. Ken, it\u2019s Jamie. I would look at it, you know, as we left the first quarter, our guide was we were going to grow from a 3.28 core NIM to a 3.32 core NIM, which is exactly what we posted. When you decompose the NIM benefits, I think we said on the last call, you know, we would expect the MB loan and deposit portfolios to be additive to NIM and the challenge with unmixing the paint this quarter on the benefit is that we made a lot of investment portfolio and funding actions in advance of the MB acquisition. But in total, I would decompose the NIM that a combination of the balance sheet positioning, funding actions, investment portfolio, plus MB\u2019s loan and deposit portfolio benefit was 8 basis points, and then our core deposit growth on a core basis at Fifth Third was up 2% and that added a basis point.","So, we had 9 basis points of benefit, and then that benefit was partially offset by a basis point headwind from day count, a basis point impact from the $1.3 billion on balance sheet auto securitization we did in April, and then 3 basis point erosion from market rates, which as we\u2019ve talked about in the past, is primarily related to the one-month LIBOR to Fed funds spread, which cost us a little over $1 million per quarter per basis point, and that contracted to 6 basis points during the quarter. So, when you take all of that together, that posted the core NIM of 4 bps, but it is getting harder and harder to break out, you know, what MB did exclusive of the other actions we took on the balance sheet.","Tayfun Tuzun ","Yes, this may be one last time that we\u2019re doing this, but it\u2019s going to be very difficult going forward from here on.","Ken Zerbe","Got it, understood. Now that actually \u2013 the answer was actually very helpful. And then, just a really quick follow-up, are you guys \u2013 in terms of the hedging strategy, I know you\u2019d been adding more hedges this quarter, are you guys now fully done, comfortable where you\u2019re at with the hedging \u2013 your hedging portfolio?","Tayfun Tuzun","So, we\u2019re definitely pleased with what we were able to execute. I would tell you, in the fourth quarter of 2018, we did the $11 billion of total hedges, $3 billion in floors, $8 billion in receive-fixed swaps, as Tayfun mentioned. $3 billion of those received-fixed swaps were forward starting. $1 billion began in June, and another $1 billion will begin in the third quarter and the final $1 billion leg of that is in January. I would love to do more, but not at these entry points. So, what we did this quarter and actually over the last six months as opposed to adding more hedges because we didn't like the entry points, we effectively repositioned the investment portfolio to the equivalent interest rate protection of about $10 billion in notional swap.","So, we included an extra page in the slide deck, it\u2019s page 20. It\u2019s just to highlight the additional positioning we've done with the investment portfolio to highlight the protection that it will provide. And so, that obviously helped during the second quarter and helps protect the outlook as we go forward. So, a long answer to a simple question, but at the end of the day, there are a lot of tools we have at our disposal, and we've been I think very effective at utilizing them whether it\u2019s swaps, investment portfolio, the fact that our CD portfolio is -- 76% of it matures in under 12 months, so that should reprice fairly fast, the fact that we put on additional fixed rate auto, so the auto production was $1.4 billion for the quarter and should be about $5.8 billion for the year. So, we've done a lot behind the scenes to help protect to the low rates and that\u2019s starting to shine through in the results.","Ken Zerbe","Alright, perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Matt O'Connor","Good morning.","Greg Carmichael","Hi, Matt.","Tayfun Tuzun","Hi, Matt.","Matt O'Connor","You mentioned the 4Q19 targets assuming CET1 migrating down to about 9%, compared to the 9.6% that you are at right now. Is that implying some front ending of the buybacks of the $2 billion that you\u2019re targeting for the next four quarters?","Tayfun Tuzun","No, we should be \u2013 I mean we will be. We\u2019re not necessarily providing how we\u2019re going to execute those, but more or less, you know, I think it's going to be even \u2013 we also, as you know, have a portion of the Worldpay gains still waiting to be converted to buybacks potentially.","Matt O'Connor","Okay, alright. And then, just separately, on the early stage delinquencies, they were up both Q2, and then especially, year-over-year. Is that being distorted at all from MB deal?","Jamie Leonard","There\u2019s a little bit of noise there. Some of those are matured facilities that we\u2019re in the process of getting through the pipe. They\u2019re small facilities overall. We expect that to subside in the next quarter or so. There\u2019s nothing there that portends deterioration that in credit leading to losses or anything like that. It\u2019s just working through some of backlog we need with the adjustment, primarily on MB, and again, not delinquent, but also maturated facilities that we\u2019ve had a plan in place to work through and we\u2019ve made a lot of progress. So, you\u2019ll see that come down in the next couple of quarters.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Tayfun Tuzun","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies. ","Ken Usdin","Hi, thanks. Good morning. One question on just the loan growth commentary, Greg, you made in your intro. So, that caution I guess on the commercial side, is that just talking points or is that something that you're seeing? You mentioned still the strong pipelines in the back half, so can you talk about whether that's anecdotal or actually coming through in terms of a change in the amount of pipeline that you guys are seeing?","Greg Carmichael","You know, Ken, we haven\u2019t seen that show up in our pipelines yet, and actually we feel very confident about our ability to deliver on our commitments we just made on asset growth for the second half of the year. But the conversations are less optimistic, you know, obviously with the noise that\u2019s out there right now, you know, the slowing economy, the rate environment, what\u2019s happening with the tariffs and so forth. It\u2019s just a cautionary discussion. We\u2019re ticking that up, but once you get that kind of ebbs and flows, but right now, we have [nothing to show up] in our pipelines. Actually, production was held up very well in the second quarter, and as we talked about, and we expect that to materialize again and continue forward into the third and the fourth quarter this year.","Ken Usdin","Okay, got it. And my second question just on the deposit cost side, it\u2019s tough to see kind of the underlying core, Jamie you mentioned a little bit in terms of the MBFI effect. But you had 4 basis points interest-bearing costs increase below peers probably because in part of the averaging, just how do you think about the trajectory of that deposit \u2013 interest-bearing deposit costs from here in terms of ability to start, you know, controlling that if not showing a rate of decline at some point?","Jamie Leonard","So, the deposit cost in the quarter, MB\u2019s book at the end of the year and you can look at their fourth quarter release, their deposit costs were roughly in line with our deposit costs, not far off at all. So, our [up 4] was as we got it to the last quarter, we thought it would be [up 4] and we were [up 4] and that\u2019s like, you know, really the Fifth Third books. So, we think it's been \u2013 rate costs have been well maintained on the deposit side. ","For our forecast, if we were to not have a Fed cut at the end of July, I think a normal amount of deposit rate increase for us would be up 1 basis points or 2 basis points just given mix and promotional rates and new acquisitions because we continue to have good deposit growth. But given that we have a July cut and a September cut in the forecast, those numbers, I think, will be down a bip or 2 from the levels that you see in the second quarter.","Ken Usdin","Got it. Thanks, Jamie.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo Securities.","Mike Mayo","Hi, this question might go in the category of no good deed goes unpunished, right. Why not guide for lower expenses in the third quarter versus the second? I mean, it\u2019s not like you're done with the merger savings and also at what point would you increase the expected savings from the merger?","Greg Carmichael","Well, Mike, we still continue to invest in our company. We are very much interested in maintaining a healthy revenue growth. We are interested in making all the necessary technology investments that we need to make. So, as much as we like the way we manage expenses, we also want to make sure that we continue to support the franchise. In terms of, you know, the overall expense savings, I mean we will share those with you, but I think we\u2019ve proven over the past two, three years that we are, you know, good stewards of expense and we will continue to execute on those terms.","Mike Mayo","And just a separate question. In terms of the hedges that you put on last October and November, I mean, that was ahead of the industry, what are you doing now and what caused you to put on those hedges before so many others?","Tayfun Tuzun","Mike, Jamie gave a good discussion on the way we are managing the investment portfolio. I think lately, since sort of the end of last year into this year, we've executed a few actions to position the investment portfolio. We thought that it was a better choice between executing through the transactions and moving the portfolio. ","And, we look at the environment and market expectations every day, and as there are certain windows open, we may choose to add more direct hedge protection. But at this point, we have been favoring moves on the investment portfolio to protect the downside. But that may change, it's a very fluid process and we are very careful.","And I think over the years, we had we have a great team. They've provided a great perspective on economic growth, as well as central bank actions. And it's that same team will continue to monitor the situation as closely as they happen over the years.","Mike Mayo","Alright, thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy of RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Good morning, guys.","Greg Carmichael","Good morning, Gerard.","Tayfun Tuzun","Hi, Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","Can you share with us, maybe, Greg, the outlook when you look out over the next 12 months; certainly, the MB Financial transaction from the numbers that we're hearing today seems to have started out very well. I know at the time of the announcement, your stock suffered because of the deal, some of the metrics that were included in the deal, but what is your view going forward on consolidation and acquisitions?","Greg Carmichael","Yes, first all, we're extremely pleased with the MB acquisition and partnership, and I do want to thank all the MB employees for their great leadership for this transition. So, we're very pleased with that. We're very pleased also with the quality of that business and our forgoing expectations to achieve our expense synergies and our revenue synergies. We feel very, very confident and as Tayfun mentioned in his comments, we're slightly ahead of the expense side house and we're very bullish on the revenue side of the house as we start to look at some of those pipelines starting to come together.","It all starts with the people and we've got great people at MB and partnership with Fifth Third team in Chicago to serve that market. With that said, job one is to get this done right and deliver on the commitments that we made, whether it be the 400 basis points in improving our efficiency ratio, which we're on the way to do that, the 200-basis points improvement in ROTCE, the 12-basis points of ROA improvement. We want to deliver on those commitments as we said we would to our investors, and that's going to be job one. We want to get that done right and demonstrate that going forward.","So, our focus is on that. Our focus is on continuing to build and expand our businesses organically where we'd be growing in new markets like California, Texas or investments in the Southeast, products, services and people and we're going to continue to do that. And that's really the focus is, MB and then organic growth. There's nothing out there on horizon right now that we're focused on beyond that.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And then Tayfun, maybe can you give us an update on CECL, what you think the day one impact might be from first quarter of next year?","Tayfun Tuzun","Gerard, we're not quite ready yet to share. Obviously, there's a lot of work that's still going on. There's still a lot of work ahead of us between now and year end. We are in the middle of these parallel runs. My expectation is the earliest we will probably potentially give an update will be our third quarter earnings. But we're working very diligently to finish all the work.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay. Thank you.","Tayfun Tuzun","Sure.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez of UBS. Your line is open.","Saul Martinez","Hi, good morning, guys.","Greg Carmichael","Good morning, Saul.","Saul Martinez","So, I'm sorry, if this is a really simple question. I just want to make sure I understand the fourth quarter financial targets and how to read that. So, you know that the 75 basis points of cuts have a 70-basis point impact on ROTCE and 5 basis points ROA, yet you basically maintained your full-year guidance for all of the items, including net interest income. So, I mean, should we basically assume that your expected run rate for NII, maybe a little bit lower than what you had previously, but the full-year number doesn't really change in part because you basically outperformed in the second quarter. So, I just want to make sure I understand what the fourth quarter targets imply for run rate?","Jamie Leonard","Yes, I think, in general, Saul, if you remember the guidance that we provided back in April, these numbers do line up very well, including the impact of lower interest rates. Now, on ROTCE, the additional impact is coming through the AOCI and that's why we wanted to exclude that and gave you the 16.5% excluding the AOCI. Overall, if you take our NII guidance up about 1% from the adjusted Q2, you will see that we're not necessarily expecting a growth into the Q4 based on that third rate cut assumption. And, I mean, it's not like a big fall or anything like that, but you're not going to expect another 1% growth over that.","In terms of fee income, I answered one of the earlier questions, we are expecting a good amount of growth from the third quarter into the fourth quarter in terms of fee income. And in terms of the expense outlook, it's not different. These numbers are large percentages because of the MB comparisons and therefore you're not seeing the underlying movements. But our expectation is that we had great performance in the second quarter with respect to NII, we still expect very good performance in light of a lower rate environment. And we just kept our overall return targets pretty much intact despite the weaker rate environment and because we just outperformed quite a bit in the second quarter. I mean, that's really \u2013 that has also a lot to do with our ability to maintain our overall return targets.","Saul Martinez","Okay. Got it. That makes sense. Just a follow up then on the deposit cost and the deposit beta assumptions. I think you mentioned that we could expect with your rate assumptions a couple basis points decline in the third quarter. You also mentioned that deposit betas you're assuming are high-30s, I think high-30s or low-40s. If I recall, how does that high-30s, low-40s, over what time period does that play out? So, you're assuming 50 basis points of cuts, for example, in the third quarter, should we assume that deposit cost then in the fourth quarter will reflect that beta assumption or does that deposit beta play out over a multi-quarter type of time horizon?","Jamie Leonard","Yes, it's a very good question. And unfortunately, the answer is somewhat complicated because you have about 12% of our deposit book is indexed to Fed funds. So, when the Fed moves, 12% is going to reprice immediately at a 100% beta. But then we have various offers that are out there that those deposit rates will come down over time. So, it's really a blend that will deliver it and as Tayfun mentioned, over the three rate movements, we're modeling a 38% beta, which is exactly what our cycle to date beta was on the 225 basis points of Fed funds increases.","Saul Martinez","And if I could ask maybe one final one on that, those index deposits, where they baked in? Are those in the other time deposits?","Jamie Leonard","It's across the board. Yes, I'd say it's fairly evenly distributed.","Greg Carmichael","It's probably less in other deposits and actually...","Jamie Leonard","It's in more savings and IBT.","Saul Martinez","Sorry, what was that?","Jamie Leonard","It's more in savings and IBT, as opposed to other.","Saul Martinez","Got it. And are they mainly commercial deposits or\u2026?","Jamie Leonard","Yes.","Saul Martinez","Got it. Alright. Thank you so much.","Jamie Leonard","Yes.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby of Vining Sparks. Your line is open.","Marty Mosby","Thanks. First, let me \u2013 maybe give you a little more credence than you give yourself, because I listen to a lot of the different calls every quarter and your approach to net interest income of being neutral when everybody else was still enamored with being asset sensitive gives you the flexibility to take advantage of those events when you solve them, because your goal at the end is trying to be as neutral as you can what you see on the interest rate sensitivity numbers. So, I think that perspective gives you a lot of flexibility versus trying to play what's happening even if it seems like the momentum is going to continue in the right direction. So, always like listen to your calls, Tayfun and Jamie, you've done a great job of getting ahead by keeping that perspective.","In that vein, one of the things that you've done, I think is being able to keep these cash flow securities out in the sense of as you are kind of moving from mortgage back into these locked-out types of securities your premium amortization this quarter was pretty minimal. So, I just wanted to \u2013 when you mentioned your margin, you didn't mention any premium amortization or mortgage-backed securities. So, is it true that this quarter underneath all these numbers that would be a pretty minimum impact as you have been shifting the portfolio?","Jamie Leonard","Yes. And I didn't give that data point, but that's exactly what the repositioning accomplished. I think we ran last year net premium amortization of $6 million a quarter, I think this quarter we were around $2 million, so that benefit definitely showed up in the quarter.","Marty Mosby","And when you compare that to other banks that went from like 6 last year to probably 4 times that this this quarter with all the prepayment speeds, accelerating, that was a big kicker in the sense of how you outperformed so dramatically on your NII because it took that risk out of the equation. The other thing that I wanted, which is, Tayfun a very easy question [Technical Difficulty] in the income statement and expenses, can you give us a little feel for what it was this quarter and what it's been in prior quarters?","Jamie Leonard","So, the approximate \u2013 I'll give you the number on the revenue side, increase is probably about $20 million-ish quarter-over-quarter Q1 to Q2.","Marty Mosby","And what's the base this quarter, how much was it in total?","Jamie Leonard","About $40 million, $45 million, Marty.","Marty Mosby","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Kevin St. Pierre of KSP Research. Sir, your line is open.","Kevin St. Pierre","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Tayfun, you mentioned that, one thing that has benefited the NIM and your NII performance was the decision not to grow the first mortgage portfolio. You did guide to third quarter increase in consumer loans of about 2%. As you're thinking with the prospect of lower rates as you're thinking change there or are you expecting growth in other loan categories?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes, we're not \u2013 our outlook, at least for the second half of this year, sort of matches the production patterns with respect to the refi environment. I don't think that by the time we get to year-end, our residential portfolio outstandings will be much different from where we are today.","Kevin St. Pierre","Got you. And maybe one final, noticed pretty stable demand deposits period end quarter-to-quarter on the linked quarter. Can you speak to deposit attrition at MB and how things are going there?","Jamie Leonard","Yes. The deposit attrition at MB is going fine. It's slightly less than the attrition they experienced for the 28 months leading up to the acquisition. So, it's right in line to slightly better.","Kevin St. Pierre","Great. Thanks very much.","Greg Carmichael","Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. Chris, you may continue.","Chris Doll","Thank you, Jay, and thank you all for your interest in Fifth Third Bank. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the IR Department and we will be happy to assist you.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bancorp Q4 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Chris Doll, you may begin your conference.","Chris Doll","Thank you, Chelsea. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today, we will be discussing our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2018.","Please review the cautionary statement in our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain information related to the proposed merger with MB Financial, reconciliations to non-GAAP measures along with information pertaining to the use of non-GAAP measures and forward-looking statements about Fifth Third\u2019s performance. We undertake no obligation to and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statement after the date of this call.","This morning, I\u2019m joined on our call by our President and CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Chief Operating Officer, Lars Anderson; Chief Risk Officer, Frank Forrest; and Treasurer, Jamie Leonard. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Tayfun, we will open the call up for questions.","Let me turn the call over now to Greg for his comments.","Greg Carmichael","Thanks Chris and thank all of you for joining us this morning. Earlier today, we reported full year net income available to common shareholders of $2.1 billion or $3.06 per share. Full year adjusted net income of $1.8 billion was a record for the Bank as we continue making significant progress to improve profitability and better position Fifth Third for success. In addition to the record net income, we generated our best full year adjusted ROA, ROE, ROTCE and efficiency ratio in over a decade. We returned nearly 100% of earnings to shareholders through repurchases and two dividend increases as we raised the dividend nearly 40% in 2018. Additionally, we significantly improved our key credit quality metrics throughout the year.","Fourth quarter 2018 net income available to common shareholders was $432 million and earnings per share of $0.64. Included in these results are three notable items, which had a negative impact of $0.05 on reported EPS. Excluding these items, adjusted earnings were $0.69 per share in the fourth quarter.","Our financial results were very strong. During the quarter, we generated record loan originations and fee revenue in our commercial business, continued to properly grow the balance sheet and diligently manage our expense while continuing to invest for future growth.","Since the fourth quarter of 2017, we have significantly improved all of our key financial metrics on an adjusted basis with ROA increasing 30 basis points, ROTCE increasing 440 basis points and the efficiency ratio declining more than 300 basis points. As we approach the third and final year of our NorthStar project, the fourth quarter of 2018 results should provide a great deal of confidence in our ability to achieve our enhanced targets.","Before discussing our key strategic priorities and highlights for the quarter, I\u2019d like to share some observation on a macroeconomic environment. Year-over-year U.S. economic backdrop continues to be generally positive. While global growth pressures exit and geopolitical risks remain elevated, we expect this business cycle to expand in 2019, as underlying economical fundamentals remain solid. While we\u2019re cognizant of the rising probability of the downturn in next couple of years, we feel good about how we have positioned our balance sheet and our sales force to take advantage of growth opportunities while prudently managing our exposures. We will continue to maintain our disciplined focus on credit quality and profitability.","Moving on to our strategic priorities. At Fifth Third, we are positioned to drive improved profitability well-beyond Project NorthStar horizon, which concludes at the end of this year. First, we are committed shooting our targeted financial results by the end of 2019, as outlined in our previous discussions. The continued improvement throughout 2018 reinforces our confidence in our ability to achieve our goals. In fact, our fourth quarter adjusted ROTCE of 15.4% is the highest since before the financial crisis.","Second, we\u2019re focused on successfully integrating MB Financial. We\u2019re well-prepared for the integration of MB\u2019s operations into Fifth Third. We\u2019re working diligently to deliver the financial results associated with the acquisition and to make sure we get it right for our customers. We have completed all required fillings and are now simply waiting for the necessary approvals. We continue to expect to close the transaction by the end of this quarter.","We\u2019re also pleased that the regulators did not object to our resubmitted capital plan including the pro forma impact of MB Financial. Also, we remain very confident in our ability to achieve our post-merger financial targets. It is clear that we are acquiring a high-performing franchise. As shown in their fourth quarter earnings published this morning, MB generated strong returns with solid NIM expansion and solid credit results with improvements in both NPAs and credit losses. We\u2019re excited to combine the talent and complementary capabilities of our two organizations.","Third, we continue to invest in organic growth opportunities, including the previously communicated Branch network optimization. Our plans are staged over multiple years and include a rollout of the state-of-the-art branch redesign. Our next-generation branches will be 40% smaller than our legacy network and will be highly automated. In 2018, optimization efforts led to the opening of 12 branches and the closing of 45 branches. We expect to decrease our network in another 10 branches in 2019. Beginning 2020, we expect branch builds in our growth markets to exceed our closures.","In addition, we\u2019re expanding our middle market business in select high-growth markets where we can combine strong talent with local market knowledge and our enhanced product capabilities to successfully grow the portfolio. ","Following the very successful launch of our California middle market team, over the next 12 months we\u2019ll be expanding to the Denver, Dallas and Houston markets. We already have existing teams of commercial bankers in our national corporate banking business in these markets. Our track record of hiring strong talent and successfully growing our middle market franchise gives us a high degree of confidence, executing on our current expansion plans.","We also plan to continue add to our sales force in our existing footprint. We\u2019re particularly focused on strategic acquisitions that would generally higher fee revenue to drive additional ROE growth. In fact, we are already seeing the financial benefits of our investments in talent over the last two years, especially in our capital markets and the advisory and wealth and asset management businesses.","Fourth, we remain focused on accelerating our digital transformation and delivering innovative solutions for our customers. We\u2019ve invested heavily over the last several years, both through our in-house technology capabilities and with select fin-tech partnerships. These investments are focused on delivering a more personalized relationship banking experience. Our goal is to ensure interactions with the customers are simple, seamless and of course secure. Our efforts continue to be recognized. Bank [indiscernible] recently rated us as the number one bank for overall technology strategy, highlighting our ability to deliver innovative product as well as our organization-wide technology expertise. Our clearly-defined set of strategic priorities are designed to enhance revenue growth as well as generate expense efficiencies in order to meet our financial and strategic objectives. We have achieved significant expense efficiencies over the last two years as reflected in our improved efficiency ratio. As we have discussed previously, our goal is to consistently achieve positive operating leverage.","Moving on to our highlights for the quarter, I'll review some key aspects of results and then Tayfun will discuss the quarter in greater detail. First, we continue to benefit from our improved balance sheet resiliency. Our key forward-looking credit metrics continued to improve as criticized loans declined for the seventh quarter to a lowest level in nearly 20 years. Our non-performing assets have declined nearly 50% over the past two years and today stand at the lowest level since 2000.","We maintained the same disciplined approach to client selection, underwriting standards and credit risk appetite during the quarter while growing the loan portfolio. And in fact, we [technical difficulty] originations, both in middle market and corporate banking at the highest credit quality in several quarters. While we have maintained strong underwriting standards, our loan yields and net interest margin have continued to expand. We believe our strong credit profile should allow us to outperform through business cycles. We generated profitable relationship growth in both our commercial and retail businesses. We continue to focus on expanding our relationships with our clients on both sides of the balance sheet. Loan growth was fully funded by core deposits during the quarter and the year.","Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, we grew commercial loans by 4% including C&I growth of 6%. Even with very strong loan growth, our total household growth of over 3% and deposit growth of 4% resulted in the lowest loan to core deposit ratio in the past 15 years. Furthermore, we managed our expenses and outperformed relative to our guidance.","Excluding merger-related items, our expensed declined 2% from the prior quarter. As a result, we were able to continue to generate positive operating leverage for the quarter and the full year. I want to reiterate our expectations for standalone adjusted expense growth of only 1% in 2019.","Our results show that we remain on track to achieve our enhanced NorthStar financial targets. During the fourth quarter, we generated an adjusted return on tangible common equity of 15.4% and adjusted return on assets of 1.34%, and adjusted efficiency ratio of 56.8%, which is already better than our standalone fourth quarter of 2019 target. We remain very confident in our ability to achieve our long-term financial targets and outperform through this cycle. We remain committed to holding ourselves accountable for delivering strong financial results under prevailing macroeconomic, interest rate, regulatory and legislative environment. I'd like to once again thank all of our employees for their hard work, dedication and for always keeping the customer at the center. I was pleased that we were again able to deliver strong financial results in our NorthStar initiatives or delivering the outcomes as planned.","With that I'll it over to Tayfun to discuss our fourth quarter results and our current outlook.","Tayfun Tuzun","Thanks, Greg. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Let's move to the financial highlights on slide four of the presentation.","Our fourth quarter results were very strong. This momentum bodes well for our 2019 performance and should help us achieve our yearend goal. As Greg mentioned, the pre-closing integration work related to MB is progressing very well on both ends. We are very optimistic that the transaction will close this quarter. And as you can see from the earnings disclosures, some of the expenses related to the integration have started to impact our financials. These expenses are part of the total merger-related expenses that we discussed with you when we announced the transaction.","At this time, there is no change to the financial outlook we shared with you previously with respect to the combined company. We remain very confident that the acquisition will improve ROTCE by 2%, ROA by approximately 12 basis points, and the efficiency ratio by about 4% in year two.","Since we have not disclosed the transaction yet, our current 2019 guidance will only reflect the standalone Fifth Third performance expectations. Once we close the transaction, we will update you on the combined outlook in more detail, but hopefully our guidance on the performance metrics gives you a very good perspective on the outlook for the combined company.","Before discussing results for the quarter, I would like to highlight as we have noted throughout our earnings materials that our current and historical financial results presented today reflect the change in accounting policy related to investments in affordable housing. Adopting this new accounting policy allows our financials to be more comparable to peers. We have also provided a summary reconciliation of the change on page 30 of the release. This change had no meaningful impact on our fourth quarter EPS. Reported results were negatively impacted by the notable items on page two of our release, including $21 million after-tax in merger-related expenses incurred in advance of our pending acquisition of MB Financial and a $17 million after-tax charge, reflecting the mark to market on our GreenSky equity stake, partially offset by a $6 million after-tax benefit from the Visa total return swap. Excluding these items, pre-provision net revenue increased 9% sequentially and 14% year-over-year. All of our adjusted return metrics were higher while loan growth and deposit growth exceeded our guidance. Strong revenue growth and disciplined expense management have continued to lower our efficiency ratio and generated positive operating leverage on a sequential and year-over-year basis, which we expect will continue in 2019.","Our credit performance was solid. We reported the strongest forward-looking credit metrics in nearly 20 years. Our provision for loan losses exceeded charge-offs as a result of the strong loan growth.","In his opening comments, Greg reiterated our priorities for long-term success. Our goal is to carry the revenue momentum forward while maintaining tight expense control. We will continue to manage balance sheet risk by remaining cognizant of the environmental factors impacting our business and maintain a prudent approach to capital management with the ultimate goal of rewarding our shareholders today and in the future.","Moving to slide six. Our recent loan growth strength is beginning to provide a clear picture of our longer term growth potential. We remain very confident in our ability to achieve higher overall loan growth going forward compared to the past couple of years. This quarter, average total portfolio loans were up 2% compared to the prior quarter, mostly reflecting growth in C&I loans. We grew total loans 3% on a year-over-year basis, again reflecting strength in commercial.","End-of-period commercial loan growth was 3% sequentially, which significantly exceeded previous guidance of modest growth. Our success in generating profitable growth in both, national, corporate and regional middle market lending reflects both the impact of our investment in our sales force, as well as the increased efficiency in our mid office and back office functions.","Total commercial loan production was up 27% relative to last quarter and up 17% relative to last year's fourth quarter. Production levels in both regional middle market, as well as national corporate businesses were higher relative to both previous quarters. Total commercial line utilization was up a little less than 1%. Despite a very strong quarter for commercial loan growth, our leverage loan balances continue to decline in the fourth quarter. Total leverage loan exposure declined 5% sequentially. End-of-period commercial real estate balances including construction loans were flat compared to last quarter.","CRE balances as a percentage of total risk-based capital were at a peer group low of approximately 63%, significantly below the next lowest peer. We will continue to maintain a cautious approach to commercial real estate at this point in the cycle.","We currently expect average total commercial loans to grow by about a percent on a sequential basis in the first quarter with continued strength in C&I partially offset by declines in commercial construction and large ticket non-relationship commercial lease portfolios. For the full-year, we expect average total commercial loans to increase approximately 5% compared to 2018.","Average and end-of-period consumer loans were flat, both sequentially and compared to the year-ago quarter as growth in our credit card portfolio and unsecured personal loans was offset by declines in home equity lending and residential mortgages. As we discussed last quarter, our indirect auto loan balances are no longer declining as origination levels are now outpacing lower amortization in the portfolio. We are deliberately choosing not to portfolio fixed rate conforming mortgage loans in the current rate environment.","In the first quarter, similar to the fourth quarter, we expect total average consumer loan balances to be relatively flat with the same portfolio dynamics that I discussed for the fourth quarter. For the full-year, we expect average total consumer loans to increase approximately 1% compared to 2018. Combining the commercial and consumer portfolios, we currently expect full-year 2019 average total loans to grow 3% to 3.5% compared to 2018. Total core deposits were up 4% on a year-over-year basis and up 3% compared to the prior quarter. We are very pleased with these results. Our loan to core deposit ratio has declined to the best level in 15 plus years. Our ability to fund incremental loan growth with core deposits is and will continue to be a very powerful factor supporting our growing overall profitability.","In the current environment, there is a fine balance between growing core deposits and managing interest expense. We believe that our model strikes the right balance as we are not exposing the balance sheet to rates paid on hot money accounts as we emphasize relation debt when making pricing decisions, which tend to create more balance and price stability.","Moving on to slide seven. Compared to the prior quarter, NII increased 4% or $38 million and the NIM expanded 6 basis points, both of which exceeded our previous guidance. About 2 basis points of the NIM expansion reflected a few items that was seasonal in nature. Average yield on our loan portfolio expanded 20 basis points, which outpaced a 14 basis-point increase in interest-bearing core deposits during the quarter.","Compared to the year-ago quarter, net interest income increased $122 million or 13%. The results from the year-ago quarter included a $27 million negative impact related to the change in tax law. Adjusting for this item, NII increased $95 million or 10% with NIM expanding 19 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2017, a very strong performance relative to peers.","As you know, based on our previous disclosures, while achieving these results, we continued to hedge our downside risk, taking advantage of very attractive entry points last fall. Our long-term interest rate risk philosophy is not to tilt our exposure too far in either direction. We believe this is a prudent approach at this point in the cycle.","Our cumulative beta leading up to the December 2018 Fed hike was approximately 35%, with consumer in the low 20s and commercial in the high 50s. The September rate hike resulted in a beta of 58%. We expect deposit beta from the December rate hike to be consistent with the impact from the September hike over the next six months, which would result in a cumulative deposit beta below 40%.","Today\u2019s guidance does not assume any additional Fed rate increases in 2019. We expect the full-year 2019 NII to grow approximately 3% over 2018 without any rate hikes. We expect our first quarter NII to decline about 1.5% to 2% sequentially based on day counts and the impact of non-recurring fourth quarter seasonal items, partially offset by the benefit from the December rate hike and loan growth. Our estimate is about 6.5% above first quarter of last year\u2019s NII.","We expect the NIM on a full-year basis to expand 2 to 3 basis points in 2019 despite the assumption of no additional rate increases. If the Fed were to raise rates, given our balance sheet position, we would expect the NIIM to benefit 1 to 2 basis points in 2019 per rate hike.","Moving on to slide eight. Excluding the impact of the listed items, non-interest income increased 2% compared to both year-ago and the prior quarter. Record corporate banking revenue was driven by highest ever M&A advisory fees as well as increased syndication revenues. Our corporate banking fees were up 69% compared to the year-ago quarter and were up 30% compared to the prior quarter. We currently expect our corporate banking revenue to grow about 25% compared to last year\u2019s first quarter.","Our near-term performance and our 2019 expectations demonstrate our success in implementing our NorthStar initiatives over the past three years. Card and processing revenue increased 5% compared to the year ago quarter and increased 2% compared to the prior quarter, due to higher transaction volumes, partially offset by higher rewards. Year-over-year performance also reflected strength in wealth and asset management, although we had lower revenues in the fourth quarter due to lower asset valuations.","Mortgage banking revenue was up 10% in the fourth quarter, origination volume was $1.6 billion, gain on sale margin was 159 basis points, the lowest seen in the business. Deposit service charges decreased 2% compared to year ago quarter and decreased 3% compared to the prior quarter, predominantly due to higher earnings credit rates in corporate treasury management. For the first quarter, we expect total noninterest income to be stable relative to the adjusted first quarter of 2018 and for the full-year we expect total noninterest income to increase approximately 2% from the adjusted 2018 noninterest income.","Moving on to slide nine, the 1% increase in reported noninterest expenses this quarter reflected a $27 million pretax impact from merger-related expenses. Excluding the merger-item, expenses decreased $20 million or 2% sequentially. Results reflected the benefit of the elimination of the FDIC surcharge which was about $12 million and the actions we have taken to manage our expense base. We are very-pleased with these results and will maintain the same focus on expense management in 2019 while continuing to invest in our company.","Our adjusted efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter was 56.8%. We have achieved positive operating leverage this quarter, both on a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year basis, and expect to continue to improve in the foreseeable future. First quarter expenses, excluding any MB acquisition related expenses are expected to be up about 1.5% to 2% from the first quarter of 2018. The largest item driving the year-over-year growth is a $15 million change in our unfunded commitment provision expense, which reflects growth in commitments associated with strong loan growth. Included in this guidance is also the impact of our acquisitions in 2018 in wealth and asset management and capital market, which is about 0.5% of our total expense base. Excluding these items, year-over-year expenses in the first quarter are actually expected to be lower than last year's first quarter including the impact of the change in FDIC deposit insurance expenses.","It is also worth noting that our first quarter expenses are impacted by seasonality associated with the timing of compositional warrants and payroll taxes. We continue to expect our standalone expenses, excluding the notable items disclosed in our earnings materials to be up approximately 1% year-over-year in 2019.","Turning to credit results on slide 10. Fourth quarter credit results continued to be benign in line with our expectations and reflect the impact of actions that we executed over the last three years. The criticized assets ratio continued to improve, decreasing to 3.34%, near a 20-year low, from 3.45% last quarter. Net charge-offs were $83 million or 35 basis points, up 5 basis points from the prior quarter. The commercial charge-off rate of 19 basis points continues to be the lowest since before the crisis. The consumer net charge-off ratio of 61 basis points, increased slightly compared to last quarter and reflected larger than usual recoveries in the prior quarter.","NPLs of $348 million decreased 20% from last year and are down 14% from the previous quarter. As a result, our NPLs and NPA ratios continue to decline to levels not seen before the crisis. The provision for loan and lease losses totaled $95 million in the current quarter compared to $67 million in the year-ago quarter and $86 million in the prior quarter. The resulting coverage ratio was 1.16% with allowance in excess of NPLs of nearly 320%. As we remind you every quarter, the current economic backdrop continues to support a relatively stable credit outlook with potential quarterly fluctuations, given current low absolute levels of charge-offs.","Turning to slide 11. Capital levels remained very strong during the fourth quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.2% and our tangible common equity ratio excluding unrealized gains and losses was 8.71%. The cumulative impact of our accounting change resulted in an 11 basis-point reduction to our current CET1 ratio, which merely reflects the timing difference from accounting related to recognition of losses.","During the quarter, we completed $400 million in share repurchases. At the end of the fourth quarter, common shares outstanding were down almost 15 million shares or 2% compared to the third quarter of 2018 and down 47 million shares or 7% compared to last year's fourth quarter.","Following the Fed\u2019s non-objection to our CCAR resubmission, we will be able to repurchase another -- an additional $900 million in share buybacks through June 2019 and increase our dividend another $0.02 in the second quarter of 2019. This is in addition to the $0.04 increase we just declared in the fourth quarter. Our near-term and long-term capital targets remain the same as before as we continue to target CET1 ratio of between 9% and 9.5%.","Slide 12 provides a summary of our current outlook on a standalone basis, as well as our financial expectations from the MB Financial acquisition. We expect our standalone full-year 2019 tax rate to be in the 21% to 22% range. The higher than previously disclosed tax rate guidance simply reflects the change in accounting policy I mentioned earlier.","In summary, I would like to reiterate a few points. We reported very strong financial results for the fourth quarter and remain focused on our key strategic priorities to drive the Company forward and to outperform through various business cycles. We\u2019re focused on successfully executing against our strategic priorities and remain confident in our ability to achieve our enhanced financial targets. We remain focused on seamlessly integrating the MB acquisition and successfully generating the financial benefits, as discussed previously.","We continue to position the Company to enhance our financial returns through organic profit opportunities. And lastly, we are accelerating the digital transformation or future outperformance all within our stated goal of generating positive operating leverage.","With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A.","Chris Doll","Thanks Tayfun. Before we start Q&A, as a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up, and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. We will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have allotted this morning. During the question-and-answer period, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator.","Chelsea, please open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. First, just quickly to clarify. Did you say something on corporate banking fees and your expectation for 1Q?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes. I think we said it\u2019s going to be up 25% relative to last year's first quarter, Geoffrey.","Geoffrey Elliott","Thanks. So, I guess the question would be corporate banking is up 25% relative to last year, you\u2019ve got some benefit from the acquisitions coming in as well. What is it that kind of holds back the overall picture to keep it much closer to stable, given that strength in corporate banking?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes. Clearly, corporate banking continues to be very strong. It was very strong in \u201818; it will be again, we expect to be strong in \u201819. We\u2019re being cautious in the mortgage banking business as we are not expecting a significant improvement in the environment. Clearly, if the environment improves, then we would expect to exceed the contribution from mortgage banking. Similarly, although from a fundamental activity perspective we are seeing great success in our wealth and asset management business, we\u2019re are not necessarily forecasting a significant change in market levels. In addition to that, as you know, we last year -- early last year, announced that we were going to reduce our outstandings in the large ticket leasing business, which has an impact on operating lease income. So, that is driving some of the headwinds. And then also, last year in 2018, we had some private equity gains. Those are difficult to predict as we sit here today at the beginning of the year. So, those are some of the headwinds. But, relative to other fee line items, including corporate banking, clearly, we\u2019re not only benefiting from the acquired revenues but also from just organic growth opportunities.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Hey, Tayfun, can you help us understand some of the actions that you took in the quarter? You mentioned in the appendix a bunch of the changes in the swap portfolio. First of all, I guess, could you help us understand, if there was any benefits from that in the fourth quarter? And then, also, just how does that work through and impact the NIM and NII going forward? Thanks.","Jamie Leonard","Hey, Ken. It\u2019s Jamie. What we did in the quarter from a swap perspective was we added let\u2019s say $4 billion of spot starting swaps in October and early November; and then, mid-November we added a forward -- one-year forward starting swap for a total of $5 billion of swaps and then we added floors at a 225 strike that were also one-year forward starting. Net of all of that was about a $4 million benefit or 1-bp benefit to NIM in the fourth quarter. And then, given the rate outlook for more stable one-month LIBOR, we would expect that benefit to continue. The other action we took related to swaps was then later in the quarter after the bond market rally, we did terminate 3.1 billion of swaps that were set to mature in 2019, which that termination loss just becomes crystallized and locked in over the course of 2019. So, not a real impact to NIM, other than if rates were to sell off we would not be impacted by that related to those 3 billion in swaps.","Ken Usdin","So, I guess as a follow-up, I\u2019m just trying to understand, you are talking about 3% standalone NII growth with really good balance sheet growth, especially towards the end of the year. So, you can maybe kind of help us understand, is it the impact of that that would hold you back only 3% or just how does the NII traject I guess as you look past the first quarter?","Jamie Leonard","I think, Ken, I mean, we are obviously -- we've had great growth in the fourth quarter, and our guidance reflects a 1% type increase in commercial loans -- average commercial loans in the first quarter. We are maintaining a relatively cautious approach as we look into 2019. We are not trying to increase our expectations based on obviously our success in the fourth quarter. But, if we achieve better than our current cautious expectations, that will have an impact on NII on the positive side.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore.","John Pancari","I just wanted a little bit color on what drove the large increase in the commercial. It looks like commercial interest checking deposits in the quarter pretty substantial leg up, and just how sustainable that would be as you look out?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes. Thanks for the question. What we\u2019ve seen on the commercial front has been continued migration from a client preference standpoint from DDA to IBT. So, that certainly drives a little bit of that. But more importantly for us, we\u2019ve had a very successful fourth quarter in both new client acquisition on the commercial side as well as getting the better share of wallet of the deposit, both from our existing customers. So, we were really pleased with the deposit growth in our commercial book. And it was very widespread across our regions as well as in several of our verticals including the retail vertical, TMT and entertainment and lodging. So, overall, very good outcome, and we expect that to continue into 2019.","Greg Carmichael","Yes. In a changing, John, environment like we are going through with rising rates, one of the benefits of our model and the kind of the relationships we have with our clients is, we are able to get in deep relationships, bring them liquidity solutions, and some of those liquidity solutions have added to the migration over to -- from DDA to interest-bearing transaction accounts. These are still relationship based. But, we are really pleased with the execution of our strategy that we\u2019ve put out there. And frankly, we are able to fully fund the commercial bank\u2019s loan growth for the year. And we would expect that we would continue as we head into 2019 as we\u2019re going to stay very close to our clients in a changing environment.","John Pancari","Okay, all right. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And then, separately, on the expense side, I just want to confirm what your guidance implies in terms of full-year \u201819 total expenses, including MBFI. If you look at your guidance for standalone, it implies about $3.9 billion, assuming 1% organic growth. And then, if we add in consensus numbers for MB expenses and then adjust for 50% of the cost saves of 255, I come out to about $4.35 billion. I want to see if that's fair to assume.","Tayfun Tuzun","Well, at this point, I really don\u2019t want to comment on the MB acquisition. Obviously timing of the closing will play a role, but our assumptions have not changed in terms of our cost saving assumptions. By the end of year one, we assume that all 100% of cost savings will be realized such that we go into the year two with full benefit of those. In terms of ours, we\u2019re pretty clear on what we expect from the adjusted base. So, that approximately 1% type expense that we discussed last fall still holds in terms of what we expect from the standalone.","Operator","Your next question comes from Marty Mosby from Vining Sparks. ","Marty Mosby","I wanted to ask you about this middle market expansion into California and Denver and Dallas. I mean, these are all areas where there are already existing competitors and people providing these services. But, what are we adding into this process that gives us the competitive advantage as we expand our core markets into these areas?","Lars Anderson","So, Marty, first of all, I think we already have a competitive advantage within the markets in which we\u2019re operating and I think that we\u2019re proving that out. Number of the NorthStar investments that we've made, the acceleration that you\u2019ve seen in our middle-market business this year. We\u2019ve had three linked quarters of acceleration there of over a $1 billion of middle-market growth in 2018 and we continue to complement that with additional capital markets treasury management capabilities. Those capabilities along with our value proposition, we found that we've been very successful in California and expanding into those markets. We know those markets well already. However, one of the key parts to executing I think effectively here is to have very high quality, talented, experienced leadership and bankers in those markets. We\u2019re able to accumulate, I will tell you, a really first-class team in California and we\u2019re already seeing some very positive momentum there. We already have a leader for Texas that will be coming onboard here shortly. We expect to duplicate that same process and execute there. I do have a history in Taxes and know that market pretty well. We will be able to leverage that. And the Denver market, we also operate in today. Again, we have insights and we will replicate that in those markets. I don\u2019t have any reason to believe we can\u2019t deliver our middle-market value proposition, like we have in 2018 in these expansion markets.","Greg Carmichael","This is Greg. The only thing I would add also is we also expanded into Greenville, South Carolina which is out of footprint; in addition to that we have a St. Louis middle market operation. Both of those have done extremely well. And it\u2019s really -- of course some of that is finding the right talent that knows the market, couple that with our go-to-market strategy, our product capabilities and so forth, and it's worked extremely well for us. But, we're very selective on which market, what the opportunity looks like, and once again, it depends on finding the right leadership and talent in that market before you make that move. So, I think Lars and team have done a fantastic job. We've had a lot of success. We'll continue to be very prudent in how we approach those opportunities. But, I think to-date, we're very pleased with the outcomes.","Lars Anderson","One last thing I'd tag on, if you looked at our California middle market portfolio today, this is not about buying into participations. This is about true lead relationships where we have close relationships with management.","Marty Mosby","And I guess as a follow-up, there is a two-pronged thing. One, are we getting the talent from kind of bigger money centered banks in these areas or super regional banks that are having this process? And as you're kind of getting out of this mark -- out of your markets, I mean, that's where we've kind of stumbled in the past, how do we ensure that that's not the selection bias that the growth is -- creating incremental growth but we\u2019re getting the growth that's going to eventually be the one that falls once we get into the stress period?","Greg Carmichael","So, first of all, we're not taking our eye off the ball of our core franchise. We have a lot of focus; we put a very seasoned leader into a position leading middle market for our Company, he spends a lot of time on our core franchise. I couldn't feel better about our positioning there. And we're seeing the outcomes of these successes in our core franchise. You can see it in our credit metrics, you can see it in the growth, and you can see it in the talent. As I speak to California and beyond, the talent tends to come from your larger regional banks, but as we continue to expand into Texas, I would expect that we would continue to build out that same type profile, individuals that have experience in middle-market, individuals that understand not transactional but really core relationship banking and how to leverage the capabilities that we've invested in, in NorthStar and beyond.","Operator","Your next question comes from Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities.","Peter Winter","In the opening remarks you mentioned that the leverage loans were down 5%. I was wondering can you just give an update on the size of the lending -- leverage lending exposure and how you go about managing that risk?","Frank Forrest","Good morning. This is Frank. Our balances actually are down 55% over the last three years and our commitments are down 46%. And as we\u2019ve stated before, we took an early, I think a very appropriate look at reducing risk in that portfolio. I also will add that our criticized assets in the leverage book are down 25% over the last three years. Our credit exposure today is just over $3 billion. We control that with a number of metrics, and we feel pretty good about it. I also will caution you, when trying to compare leverage portfolios, it's very difficult to do that because there's no standard definition. So, everybody has their own definition. But, we believe ours is a conservative definition. It has a pretty small overall concentration relative to our total book. So, we\u2019ve been very assertive over a longer period of time in producing the exposure given what we anticipated with potential rising rates and where we\u2019re in the cycle, and we think that\u2019ll pay of us if we hit a downturn here over the next 12 to 24 months.","Tayfun Tuzun","And I think, Peter, the change compared to last quarter as well as last year also gives you some indication going forward as we would expect our origination elsewhere will exceed originations obviously in leverage lending.","Peter Winter","Great. And then just a follow-up, Greg you mentioned also in your opening remarks that you\u2019d be interested in some fee income acquisitions. I was just wondering if you could elaborate on that.","Greg Carmichael","We\u2019ve had a lot of success recently in our wealth and asset management business and obviously our capital markets capabilities of looking at strategically franchise opportunities that would benefit our client base that could -- that would feed into our book of business. And we\u2019ve got a lot of success there. So, we\u2019ll continue to evaluate those opportunities as they materialize. Once again, you just have to find the right opportunity that fits into our model in a geography that we\u2019re banking. If we find that combination and we think it\u2019s a good fit for Fifth, we\u2019ll consider those opportunities moving forward. But I\u2019ll also restate, job grows [ph] as MB Financial, getting that done. So, we won\u2019t do anything that distracts us from being able to accomplish that successfully. So, we\u2019re being very mindful of what\u2019s on our plate and how we move forward.","Lars Anderson","Yes. Peter, I think, the reference to MB is important, because MB Financial clearly expands our commercial reach. We\u2019re adding relationships significantly with MB to existing relationships. So, if there are any opportunities there with respect to certain products and services that would benefit that expanded commercial client base, we would take a look at it.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken Zerbe","Great. Thanks. Good morning. I guess, you guys seem very positive about the commercial growth in the expansion markets. When you think about the commercial growth specifically in 2019, how much of the -- I think it was 5% growth, comes from these expansion markets and the new lenders they\u2019re hiring, versus the existing maybe in footprint portfolio? ","Lars Anderson","Yes. So, Ken, without giving specifics about the contributions of each of these groups, I would tell you this. First of all, we\u2019re getting substantial growth out of our existing franchise. That\u2019s the key driver for our Company in 2018 and will be for 2019. If you look at the Midwest, Indiana continues to be a standout but the southeastern states continue to grow at a very attractive rate. We really feel good about our ability to continue that momentum into 2019 and for the expansion initiatives for us to be additive to that strength in 2019 and beyond.","Ken Zerbe","Got you, okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, just a clarification question. In terms of the net interest margin, I just want to make sure I got my numbers right here. So, for the full year, it was 3.22; guidance is up 2 to 3 basis points, but you ended at 3.29. Now, I understand there is 2 basis points of seasonal items in that NIM; it sounds like maybe little bit from the swap portfolio as well. But, it seems to imply that, there is still downward pressure on NIM, so that we could see NIM contraction over the course of 2019. Is that correct?","Jamie Leonard","It\u2019s Jamie. How I would think of it is, if you adjust the fourth quarter for the seasonally elevated items, we have a nice performance of 3.27 from a NIM perspective. Our outlook -- and just to be transparent on the underpinnings of the outlook, we have, I would say, perhaps a little conservative outlook on the NIM, given that we have no rate hikes. Obviously, as Tayfun said, the June hike would add a bp or 2 to NIM. We do assume one month LIBOR to Fed funds spread declines from the 7 basis points in the fourth quarter to 2 basis points in the first quarter. Again, if that were not to happen that would be added a bp or 2. And we use the yield curve as of January 2nd, so if rates and the curve were to steepen back out, that would add another bp or 2 to NIM. And then, perhaps one item that\u2019s overlooked because this forecast is a standalone forecast for Fifth Third but we are taking action in advance of the MB acquisition on our balance sheet that does have a NIM depressing impact on Fifth Third but not on the combined organization. So, the securities we've added to be LCR compliant, the debt issuances that we completed and have in the forecast to complete in 2019 on the Fifth Third side, what that translates to is that the MB NIM performance back at acquisition we have talked about that being 5 basis points to 7 basis points of NIM additive, now, given how this forecast lines up, it will be at the higher end of the range because the Fifth Third balance sheet is bearing the cost of those items. So, if that helps to explain our NIM outlook. But, our balance sheet in the absence of rate moves should be relatively stable.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","Thank you for the clarification on the margin outlook. And I'm wondering as we think about the expansion into new markets as well as MBFI being dilutive to the loans and deposit ratio, could you give us a little bit more color beyond what you\u2019ve told us in the prepared remarks about how the deposit strategy could look like with these expansion plans and the combined company, especially in light of Fed -- a prolonged Fed pause?","Tayfun Tuzun","Look, I think it is clear that with respect to the expansions, those initial years tend to be loan heavy, no question about that. But, at the same time, we are looking at the momentum that we currently have in place with expect to, both consumer as well as commercial deposits in our existing footprint, in our existing businesses. We are encouraged that we can continue to fund loan growth including the expansion markets with our existing ability to grow deposits. And then, after a year or two, those markets actually tend to catch up fairly quickly because as Lars mentioned, the approach in these expansion markets is not go through participations but establish direct customer relationships, so without necessarily creating imbalance between asset growth and deposit growth. And then obviously, in this market we are trying to be more selective in terms of relationships that carry higher deposit. In addition to that, we are also looking to expand our deposit gathering activity nationally with a more focused approach within the commercial business specific sales force dedicated to growing deposit. Deposits in either down environment or up environment with respect to rates will continue to be a priority for us because we do believe that as I said earlier that core profitability depends upon our ability to fund asset growth through core deposits. So, regardless of what the Fed environment may look like, our focus on deposit growth will not change.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And if Fifth Third is no longer subject to CCAR LCR, how does that change how you manage capital? And also Jamie, with the 120 LCR, if you would remind us if any meaningful impact from MB, how differently you would manage your liquidity if you no longer had to adhere to modified LCR?","Tayfun Tuzun","So, let me make the capital comment, and then I will turn it over to Jamie to comment on liquidity side. Our near to medium-term goal, obviously, is to get down to the 9% to 9.5% capital. At this point, Erika, we\u2019re not quite sure exactly what the regulatory environment will look like, but that goal is independent from what happened on the regulatory side. Clearly, there may be some process changes, et cetera, but we will continue to maintain a focus on managing our exposure to downturns in riskier environment. And at this point we believe that 9 to 9.5% is the right level, regardless of what they happen on the regulatory side. Jamie on the liquidity side?","Jamie Leonard","Erika, on year-end LCR for Fifth Third, you can see the strength in the 128% number, which is elevated beyond our targeted operating range of 110 to 115 is where we would like to operate the Company. But we have had to add level one HQLA in advance of the MB acquisition because their portfolio simply is not invested in level one, given that they are not subject to the LCR. So, post MB until the LCR were to go away, we will operate in that 110 to 115 range. But as a result of the build-up in our securities book, we\u2019re at roughly 23% securities of total assets; post acquisition that number will decline probably to the 21% of total asset range as a result of the build-up on our side, therefore freeing up some liquidity post combination.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Gerard Cassidy","Can you guys share with us -- obviously credit quality is spectacular for you guys and many of your peers; as you mentioned, you\u2019re going to go back 20 years to see similar numbers. And back then, Fifth Third was always considered a very strong underwriter. What\u2019s making it so good today? It\u2019s obviously I know your underwriting standards but what else is contributing that you guys see to make credit so good today for your folks that again you kind of go back 20 years to find comparable numbers?","Frank Forrest","This is Frank. Let me take that. Again, we\u2019ve been very deliberate over the last three to four years to reposition our portfolio. And as Greg took over as CEO, our objective is to make sure that we are very, very good through cycles. If you look from a historical perspective going back prior to the downturn, that wasn\u2019t necessarily the case. So, we know how important it is to be consistent and be very good. And so, a lot of it is repositioning and make sure that we\u2019ve got the proper balance between, both the consumer and the commercial side and also to make sure that those areas where they tend to spike up due to cyclicality from downturns and we are better positioned. Commercial real estate for example, as we have talked about before, we have less commercial real estate by any measurement than all of our peers; and leverage we\u2019ve been working that down to I think of the rate appropriate level over the last three years. And Lars is doing a really good job of growing the middle market book which provides more granularity against the corporate book that\u2019s performing exceptionally well, primarily investment grade. So, very intently focus by the entire management team here to make sure that we are delivering through consistent cycles with one probably coming up in the next couple of years and we have done that again by I think with the very-disciplined approach and managing the portfolio through concentration limits and KRIs [ph] and better distribution of risk.","Greg Carmichael","The only thing I would add is as we went into 2016, we made a conscious decision to be good through the cycle. Now, we had to take next important decision, so we pushed out over $5 billion commercial loan. A lot of that was leveraged loans, commodity lending and so forth that we exited that didn\u2019t meet our risk return profile. So, you start to see the outcomes of that not only just in our credit but also in our yields in the relations that we\u2019re banking today. So, it\u2019s very different than we were doing in the past. Higher quality -- higher sustainability more consistent performance through the cycle.","Frank Forrest","One other thing I would add on that, one of the benefits of that balance sheet optimization was freeing up resources so that we could become more productive. And we are seeing that in improved operating leverage. In fact, our relationship managers productivity is up about 15% in 2018 over \u201817; that's the third year in a row where we've been able to reallocate resources, as we continue to see asset quality strengthen and we can put more on the line with our clients while still staying very-disciplined on client selection, managing that portfolio.","Gerard Cassidy","And as a follow-up on credit, what kind of influence do you think the CCAR process has had on you, not so much your peers because you obviously can't comment on them, but going through the CCAR, has that contributed to the strength as well in your guys thinking?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes, absolutely. This is Tayfun. I'll answer that very, very confidently. It has been a positive influence because we\u2019ve been able to look at different portfolios and the contribution of those portfolios, the future losses and the impact on capital. We have made some good decisions to exit certain businesses because from what we've seen in terms of what it would mean to capital ratio. So, that all hangs together, and I have to tell you that that's the reason why we would not abandon our stress analysis even in the absence that if the regulators decide to change the current process.","Gerard Cassidy","And then, just as a second question. Obviously, speaking of 20 years ago, profitability for the industry you guys\u2019 was much higher. We all recognize that return on equity levels due to the extra capital you and your peers have to carry, post the financial crisis, will probably not be reached at the levels that we saw back in the late 1990s. The ROAs back then for you folks at one point you got into the 2s. What do you think peak ROA could be for you guys? I wouldn\u2019t expect it to be in the high 1s, but is there still movement upside into the mid-1s for profitability number?","Tayfun Tuzun","Well, our expectation is that we would reach mid-1s. Right? So, when you look at it including the MB acquisition, unless the environment significantly changes, we would expect to reach the mid1s. Beyond that, it becomes difficult because then you get into the point in cycle with respect to credit and interest rates. But, we will take it year-end time and we will try to achieve our targets but we clearly are on the upward side.","Greg Carmichael","Gerard, the only thing I would add, we\u2019ve communicated earlier that the combined franchise with MB Financial, as we look at that in 2020, the ROA range we\u2019ve put out there is 1.55% to 1.65% to give you some indication where we think we\u2019re heading.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Marinac with FIG Partners.","Christopher Marinac","Thanks. I also had a credit quality question, just to follow up on our Gerard\u2019s comments here. Do you think that the economic outlook this year allows classified and criticized to fall or is it more of a stable year with just modest changes as time progresses?","Frank Forrest","It\u2019s hard to imagine that it\u2019s going to get much better than it is. When you get to a below 4% criticized base, based on my long history, that\u2019s about as good as it\u2019s probably going to look. If we get well below that, then you\u2019re probably not classifying your loans correctly. So, the outlook right now for 2019 for us is steady state. We might see a slight uptick depending on where rates are and where the economy goes, but we\u2019re in a much better place than we were. I mean two and half, three years ago, we were running at close to 7.5% criticized, which was one of the highest than almost all of our peers today. Our number of 3.3% is one of the very best of all of our peers. So, again, I think it speaks highly of the deliberate pace that we\u2019ve had to make sure that we reduce the risk in our portfolio and we feel good about it. But below 4% is hard to imagine that we get much better that from an industry perspective. ","Greg Carmichael","And Chris, I also want to highlight, we do actually quote this almost every opportunity we find, but we have the lowest CRE exposure amount in the peer group. So, when you think about where we are in the cycle and the asset classes that would be subject to deterioration depending upon how that cycle moves forward. That is not getting enough attention from our perspective. That significantly alters the behavior of our balance sheet today relative to our experience going into and past the crisis.","Lars Anderson","The point I\u2019ll make on CRE, as we\u2019ve talked before, it\u2019s primarily a portfolio of both national and large developers who have very diversified large balance sheets. So, we're very confident based on client selection that we\u2019ve focused on, large -- the things focused on in the last two to three years that we\u2019ve banking with right people and that we\u2019re successful through cycles. We do have exposure at local levels but we don't have significant exposure to smaller developers, who could have liquidity issues in a very quick period of time. So, we feel very good about, one, the quality of both; and two, we\u2019re very deliberate that we're comfortable with where we are relative to the total exposure today.","Frank Forrest","And I would say, Chris, if you look at our construction portfolio, you saw that that was stable on a linked quarter basis. Our commercial mortgage was up slightly, but that is not an area that we would see contributing significantly in the future, in \u201819 to the growth of the commercial bank. In fact you could see that begin to decline as a number of asset classes such as urban luxury living, big portion, going back a number of years ago will continue to mature, payoff move to the permanent market and that construction portfolio will begin to decelerate.","Operator","Your last question comes from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray.","Kevin Barker","Just to follow up on credit one more time. I noticed that you mentioned that there was no real change or outlook on your credit mark for MBFI last quarter. But this quarter, we\u2019re starting to see pickup in nonperforming and problem loans and MBFI, in fact they were up roughly 25% quarter-over-quarter, or up excluding purchase account accretion about 50% since the deal was announced. Could you give a little bit of comment on your expectations for the credit mark, if that has changed or the credit outlook at MBFI?","Greg Carmichael","Not at this point, not until we close the transaction, I don\u2019t think it would be appropriate to do it. But, what I will say is that again this portfolio, it\u2019s a fairly small and it\u2019s a very diversified portfolio compared to ours; it\u2019s one-seventh the size of our book. They\u2019re mostly small balance, lower in business banking and middle market loans, so very granular. It\u2019s something that we still feel very comfortable with and we could manage it and hold it into our credit disciplines as we go forward, but really do not want to comment on another public company until we close relative to the specifics of your question.","Operator","Your last question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matt O\u2019Connor","I know you guys have been trying to grow the credit card and kind of all other consumer book. Can you just remind us the targeted customer base there and how big these portfolios get? They are obviously quite small, but they do kick off a higher yield and little bit higher charge-off. Just remind us the strategy there and any kind of concentration limit that you might put in place?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes. Matt, our target audience continues to be prime, super prime type of range, so that there is no change with respect to the credit exposure profile. With respect to targets, concentration targets, as you said that these levels are very low, and as a matter of fact, as you know, our total consumer book has been declining and now we've been trying to achieve a better balance between consumer and commercial exposures. Credit cards have a significant room to grow. We are little over $2 billion; unsecured loans do as well. We do have as you may remember, something, $2 billion type of target with respect to the GreenSky loans but these levels do not create any concerns with respect to exposure limits in unsecured consumer lending, given especially the profile of the borrowers.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Could you just remind us how big is the GreenSky book, and of the $2.2 billion, other consumer, what else is in there?","Tayfun Tuzun","$1.22 billion was the balance at the end of the quarter, increased guide.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay. And then, if\u2026","Tayfun Tuzun","And the other stuff, we have basically collection of unsecured exposures that have been organically created exposures in our private banking with respect to borrowers from that side as well.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And obviously that mix shift is one of the drivers of the NIM that we\u2019ve been seeing, as you\u2019ve been running off some of the consumer and growing those portfolios? ","Tayfun Tuzun","Remember that that\u2019s been deliberate, right? Because when we decided to reduce auto loan exposures from where we were in 2015, the concern was that we were not getting paid in that business appropriately. And we\u2019re also -- as we reiterated, we\u2019re not portfolio in conforming mortgage loans. So, all of that clearly plays a positive role with respect to NIM expansion. So, yes, we agree with that.","Chris Doll","Thank you everyone for your interest in Fifth Third.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bank Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Richardson. Sir, you may begin your conference.","Jeff Richardson","Thanks, Rebecca. Good morning. Today, we'll be talking with you about our second quarter 2012 results.","This call may contain certain forward-looking statements about Fifth Third pertaining to our financial condition, results of operations, plans and objectives. These statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. There are a number of factors that could cause results to differ materially from historical performance in these statements. We've identified some of these factors in our forward-looking cautionary statement at the end of our earnings release and in other materials, and we encourage you to review them. Fifth Third undertakes no obligation and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call.","I'm joined on the call by several people, Kevin Kabat, our President and CEO; Chief Financial Officer Dan Poston; Chief Credit Officer Bruce Lee; Treasurer Tayfun Tuzun; and Jim Eglseder of Investor Relations.","During the question-and-answer period, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin Kabat. Kevin?","Kevin T. Kabat","Thanks, Jeff. Fifth Third reported strong second-quarter results that followed a very strong first quarter as well. Net income to common shareholders was $376 million, and earnings per diluted common share were $0.40, up 14% from a year ago. As outlined in the release, EPS results included $0.04 of benefit from gains in the warrant we hold in Vantiv, as well as the effect of seasonally high -- higher income tax expense, which reduced quarterly earnings by about $0.02. So earnings strength was also very evident underneath the headline results. Second quarter return on assets was 1.3%, and return on tangible common equity was 14%. Despite a sluggish economic environment, core trends in our operations remain favorable, as evidenced by solid loan growth, continued revenue strength, particularly in mortgage banking, and our ability to manage expenses during the quarter.","In addition to mortgage, other revenue growth drivers included card and processing revenue, up 9% on higher transaction volumes, and corporate banking revenue is up 5% during the quarter, as lending volumes and associated business production remained healthy.","We continue to generate solid loan growth, particularly in C&I loans, which were up 4% sequentially on an average basis. Average portfolio loans were up 6% from a year ago, driven by a 17% increase in both C&I and residential mortgage loans. Expenses were down 4%, reflecting both continued careful expense management and the benefit of a couple of unusual items. As a result, PPNR results were again very strong and north of 2% of assets despite the current interest rate headwinds for the industry.","Credit trends also continue to improve. Quarterly charge-offs of $181 million were down 18% sequentially and 40% from a year ago, the lowest level we've seen since the end of 2007. And net charge-off ratio was 88 basis points, down 20 basis points from last quarter. That kind of reduction is both more than expected and sooner than expected. Capital levels also continue to be very strong, with a Tier 1 common ratio of 9.8% and tangible common equity ratio of 9.5%. On June 8, we submitted our annual capital plan to the Federal Reserve, which we believe should address the basis for the Fed's objections. Our resubmitted plan, like our original plan, included increasing our quarterly dividend and initiating common share repurchases beyond those in the amounts of gains from the sale of Vantiv shares. The plan was developed using updated macroeconomic scenarios as of March 31, which did not require substantial changes to our basic capital distribution plans.","As we previously discussed, we didn't make certain adjustments to the assumed timing of distributions given the changed timeline relative to the plan submitted in January. We currently expect response from the Fed by late August, given our submission in early June. While I realize there's a high level of interest in this, we can't provide additional information given the nature of this process.","Looking ahead to the second half of 2012, the overall economic picture remains about where it's been for the last year or so. So we remained focused on blocking and tackling, making sure that we're out on the street talking to our customers and prospects, person-to-person. We have remained focused on our customers and their needs, ensuring they have a valuable partner at the table offering real solutions, and it's paying off today. In fact, in a recent study, the American Banker and Reputation Institute measured consumer perception to Top 30 U.S. banks, Fifth Third Bank is one of only 8 banks to improve its reputation rating over the past year. Only 2 banks showed greater improvement than Fifth Third. We're seeing the benefits of these actions in our production and our results.","And while Dan will discuss our outlook in more detail, we expect another set of strong results in the third quarter, with similar core revenue results, continued expense discipline and continued credit improvement. At this point, I'll turn it over to Dan. Dan?","Daniel T. Poston","Thanks, Kevin. I'll start today with Slide 4 of the presentation. As Kevin discussed, second quarter results were strong, driven by favorable mortgage banking and corporate banking revenue results, continued expense discipline and lower charge-offs and provision. For the quarter, we reported net income of $385 million and recorded preferred dividends of $9 million. Net income to common shareholders was $376 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.40. Second quarter results included $56 million in gains on Vantiv warrants, or about $0.04 per share on an after-tax basis. Earnings were reduced by $19 million or about $0.02 per share from the seasonal effect of stock options expirations on income taxes.","There were a number of other unusual items which we outlined in our release, which more or less offset one another from an earnings perspective. You'll recall that first quarter earnings per share of $0.45 included several income items related to Vantiv, that together contributed a total of $127 million in fee income for the quarter, or about $0.09 per share on an after-tax basis. All in all, we saw good momentum this quarter really across the whole company, which was born out in our earnings results.","Taking a look at Slide 5, tax equivalent net interest income increased -- excuse me, decreased $4 million sequentially to $899 million, and the net interest margin decreased 5 basis points to 3.56%, both of those in line with our expectations. The decline in net interest income was primarily driven by asset yield compression in the securities portfolio in the loan book, but was partially offset by the net loan growth. Vantiv's refinancing in March reduced NII by $2 million, and higher purchase accounting incretion increased NII by $2 million. Interest expense declined as a result of lower hedge ineffectiveness and a deposit mix shift into lower yielding products. You'll recall that hedge ineffectiveness increased interest expense last quarter, while we had a benefit of $1 million in the current quarter. The 5 basis point decline in net interest margin during the quarter was in line with our expectations despite the negative impact of the sharp drop in longer-term rates in late May and in June. Margin compression was driven by lower securities and loan yields and partially offset by deposit mix shift and the impact of hedge ineffectiveness on the first quarter.","On the loan side, we've seen continued slow compression in yields driven by the loan repricing, particularly in the C&I and auto portfolios. On the C&I side, portfolio average yield was down 7 basis points compared with last quarter. Yields on new originations have remained relatively stable, so the reduction in portfolio yields is largely due to the portfolio effects of repricing and a mix shift toward higher quality loans. On the indirect auto portfolio, portfolio average yield also continued to decline, reflecting both increased competition in this space, as well as the portfolio effect of replacing order higher yielding loans with new lower yielding loans.","We will continue to closely manage pricing and loan volumes to ensure that the returns in this space remain appropriate. Looking forward, we currently expect NII in the third quarter to be relatively stable in the $900 million range. On the plus side, our redemption of TRUPs in August will benefit third quarter NII by about $4 million, and day count will add another $5 million or so. Offsetting those benefits will be an estimated $5 million in lower purchase accounting accretion, with the remainder of the decline primarily related to the impact of repricing on the investment securities portfolio. In terms of the margin, we currently expect NIM to decline 2 or 3 basis points in the third quarter. That would reflect about 2 basis points of benefit from the TRUPs redemption, offset by 2 basis point detriment from lower purchase accounting accretion and 1 basis point negative effect of day count. The remaining decline is a couple of basis points, which is largely due to repricing.","Our expected -- expectation today would be for NII to be stable or perhaps up modestly in the fourth quarter with margin compression of a few basis points, similar to what we expect in the third quarter.","Turning to the balance sheet in Slide 6. Average earning assets increased $1.2 billion sequentially, driven by $1.1 billion of growth in average portfolio loans and a $400 million increase in securities, partially offset by a reduction in loans held for sale. Average securities  portfolio balances reflect the pre-investment of portfolio of cash flows during the quarter, as well as higher cash balances held at the Fed, which are included in the short-term investment balance. We would expect average security to be down modestly in the third quarter, but to remain fairly stable in light of the current rate environment and outlook.","Average portfolio loans and leases increased $1.1 billion sequentially, driven by higher C&I and residential mortgage balances. Average loans held for sale were down $337 million during the quarter, driven by decreased residential mortgage warehouse balances.","Looking at each portfolio. Average commercial loans held for investment increased $973 million sequentially, or 2%, and $3.3 billion, or 8%, year-over-year. C&I loans increased to $32.7 billion, a 4% increase from last quarter and a 17% increase from a year ago. Our C&I production continues to be strong and has been broad-based across industries and sectors. Demand continues to be strongest in the large corporate and mid-corporate space, although refinance activity into the capital markets by these borrowers in the second quarter reduced growth somewhat. Commercial line utilization remained at 32% this quarter, which is consistent with last quarter. Given our strong levels of production and pipelines, we expect continued solid C&I growth in the second half of the year.","Commercial mortgage and commercial construction balances declined in the aggregate by $316 million sequentially, or 3%. We've seen most of the run off that we expect to see in these portfolios, and thus, they shouldn't be much of a drag on commercial loan growth as we go forward. Average consumer loans in the portfolio increased $113 million sequentially and $1.3 billion compared to a year ago. Residential mortgage loans held for investment were up 4% sequentially. The sequential growth reflect the strong originations during the quarter due to the rate environment and the continued retention of jumbo loans and certain shorter-term high-quality residential mortgages originated through our branch retail system. Average auto loan balances declined 1% sequentially, as we managed volume and pricing in that business over the last several months. As I mentioned earlier, we reduced our origination volumes for competitive reasons where the profit potential wasn't there.","Home-equity loans were down 2% sequentially, and average credit card balances were down slightly due to seasonality. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect loan growth to be driven by continued solid growth in C&I loans as well as the mortgage portfolio.","Moving on to deposits. We continue to manage our deposit book by focusing on higher value transaction deposits while managing non-relationship deposit accounts down. In total, average core deposits increased $294 million from the first quarter. Average transaction deposits, which exclude consumer CDs, were up 1% sequentially and 9%, or $6 billion, from a year ago. Growth in transaction deposits was largely driven by interest checking balances, which were up 6% from the prior quarter and 26% from a year ago. Consumer CDs continue to decline down $192 million in the quarter, driven by our continued disciplined approach to CD pricing. For the quarter -- for the third quarter, we currently expect transaction deposits to be relatively stable compared to the second quarter and for consumer CD balances to continue to decline.","Turning to fees, which are outlined on Slide 7. Second quarter noninterest income was $678 million, a decrease of $91 million from last quarter, which benefited from the effect of Vantiv's IPO. There were a number of items that affected each quarter. Second quarter results included a $56 million positive valuation adjustment on Vantiv warrants, as well as $17 million in charges related to the VISA total return swap, $17 million negative valuation adjustments on property held for sale. Net investment securities gains were $3 million in the quarter.","First quarter results included $127 million in net benefits related to Vantiv's IPO and warrants, $19 million in VISA charges and $9 million in securities gains. Excluding those items from both quarters, fee income of $653 million was up $1 million from a pretty strong first quarter; underlying fee results included another strong quarter in mortgage banking revenue, which was down slightly from the first quarter; a 9% increase in card and processing revenue; and a 5% increase in corporate banking revenue.","Looking at each item or each line item in detail. Deposit service charges increased 1% sequentially and 4% from the prior year. Sequential comparison was driven by a 2% increase in commercial deposit fees and a 1% decline in consumer deposit fees. The year-over-year comparison reflected a 7% increase in commercial deposit fees largely due to new customer account growth, which was partially offset by 1% decline in consumer deposit fees. For the third quarter, we expect to see a slight decline in deposit fees, which includes the effect of our elimination in June of daily overdraft fees and continuing customer overdraft issues. Investment advisory revenue decreased 4% from last quarter and 2% on a year-over-year basis. Sequential decline is largely due to the first quarter positive seasonality and trust tax-preparation fees, otherwise, revenues reflected overall market valuation trends and the effects of market volatility on customer activity.","We currently expect investment advisory revenue to be stable to modestly higher in the third quarter. Corporate banking revenue of $102 million increased 5% from the first quarter and 7% from last year. Sequential increase was driven by higher foreign exchange, institutional sales and interest rate derivative revenue. We expect third quarter corporate banking revenue of about $100 million, consistent with the strong second quarter levels.","Card and processing revenue was $64 million, up $5 million from the first quarter and down $25 million from a year ago. The year-over-year decline was driven by the impact of debit interchange legislation, which cost us about $30 million on a quarterly basis. That was partially offset by increased transaction volumes and mitigation activity in this line item. The sequential increase was driven by higher transaction volumes, which is more reflective of the growth in this business. We expect transaction volumes to drive continued growth in card and processing revenue during the third quarter.","Mortgage banking net revenue of $183 million declined $21 million from the near record levels in the first quarter, but increased $21 million from a year ago. Originations were $5.9 billion this quarter versus $6.4 billion in the first quarter. Gain on sale margins were wider in the second quarter, reflecting market trends and a higher proportion of retail channel and HARP originations. As a result, gains on deliveries were $183 million, up $9 million from the previous quarter. MSR valuation adjustments, including hedges, were a negative $22 million this quarter versus a positive $15 million in the first quarter. Currently, we would expect mortgage banking revenue to be up about $10 million or so in the second quarter, with gains on deliveries similar to our strong second quarter levels and with lower MSR valuation adjustments. We expect deliveries to increase modestly and margins to be slightly lower.","Turning next to other income within fees. Other income was $103 million this quarter versus $175 million last quarter. Second quarter results included the $56 million Vantiv warrant gain, the $17 million valuation adjustment on VISA total return swap and the $17 million valuation adjustment on bank premises held for sale. First quarter results included net benefits related to Vantiv's IPO and warrants of $127 million and a $19 million charge on VISA total return swap. Exclude these items, other income was $81 million compared with $67 million in the first quarter.","Credit costs recorded in other noninterest income were $17 million in the second quarter compared with $14 million last quarter. We expect third quarter credit costs and revenue to be down modestly.","Looking at overall fee income expectations for the third quarter. We currently expect fee income in the $670 million range, plus or minus, up about $15 million from the second quarter, excluding the significant items that I discussed earlier. Our outlook does not include any assumption with respect to the Vantiv warrant, which is a mark-to-market asset. The $56 million gain we recognized in the second quarter was driven primarily by a $3.60 increase in Vantiv stock price during the quarter, and that relationship should produce a decent estimate of changes in our valuation, if you'd like to track that.","Turning to expenses on Slide 8. Noninterest expense of $937 million declined sequentially by $36 million or 4%. Current quarter expenses included a $9 million reduction to the FDIC insurance expense and an $8 million benefit from the sale of affordable housing investments. You'll recall that expenses in the prior quarter included a tax-related benefit of $23 million, offset by $28 million in various other charges. If you exclude these items, noninterest expenses of $954 million were down $14 million. That decrease reflected a $17 million decline in FICA and unemployment expense from seasonally high first quarter levels, partially offset by a $12 million increase in initial marketing costs and support of our new branding campaign that we talked more about in April. Otherwise, expenses were down $9 million, primarily in compensation expense.","Credit-related costs and operating expense were $41 million, up $7 million from last quarter and in line with our expectations. Mortgage repurchase expense was $18 million this quarter compared with $15 million last quarter and reflected continued stable loss realization from GSE putback. We expect that to generally continue, although I would note that the GSEs have indicated to us that toward the end of this year, they plan to start requesting files for any loan that is nonperforming. That will likely lead to an increase in repurchase claims and some increase in repurchase expense. However, we expect that overall repurchase expense will continue to remain at relatively manageable levels for us.","In terms of the third quarter, we currently expect total credit-related costs recognized and expense to increase about $5 million from the second quarter levels. Overall for the third quarter, we expect core operating expense of about $970 million to $975 million, up about $15 million to $20 million, to $954 million in core expenses this quarter. That increase reflects about $8 million in expected hedging curtailment expense, which is a seasonal item. The remaining increase: in branding-related marketing expense of about $6 million to $7 million, as well as higher mortgage incentive and fulfillment costs. As a reminder, we expect marketing expense to return to more normal levels in the fourth quarter, reducing in expenses by about $15 million from the third quarter levels. Additionally, due to our redemption of TRUPs in August, we will incur about $27 million in net charges due to the hedge termination and the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs. Those charges will also be recorded in noninterest expense.","Moving on to Slide 9, in PPNR. Pre-provision net revenue was $636 million in the second quarter compared with $694 million in the first quarter. Excluding the items listed on the slide, which are also outlined in our release, PPNR in the second quarter was $594 million, up $12 million from the first quarter and about $25 million better than we were anticipating coming into the quarter. We expect third quarter core PPNR to remain strong in the $585 million range, excluding the TRUPs-related charges that I mentioned of $27 million. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 31.8% due to tax expense of $19 million associated with the expiration of employee stock options during the quarter. We currently expect the effective tax rate to be in the more normal 28.5% range for the third and fourth quarters.","Turning to capital, which is outlined on Slide 10. Capital levels continue to be very strong. Tier 1 common increased 13 basis points to 9.8%. Tier 1 capital was 12.3%, up 11 basis points from last quarter, and the total capital ratio was 16.2%, up 17 basis points from the first quarter levels. Tangible common equity was 9.5%, including unrealized gains of $454 million after-tax, and 9.2% if you exclude those. During the quarter, we repurchased $75 million of common shares from our after-tax gains related to the sale of Vantiv shares. This reduced capital ratios by about 7 basis points during the quarter.","Looking forward, as we outlined in our release, we are currently evaluating the regulators' notices of proposed rulemaking for capital standards. The proposed rules for capital definitions and required ratios are in line with Basel III and our expectations. The proposed standardized approach contains a number of elements that have not previously been proposed in the U.S. or in Basel. We haven't completed our evaluation and interpretation of these rules, which are subject to comment and to change. However, our initial evaluations suggest that the rules as proposed would increase our risk weighted assets and that our pro forma Tier 1 common ratio will likely be lower than our current Tier 1 common ratio of 9.8%. Whatever the final shape of the rules, we are comfortable that we will continue to have significant excess capital, and that our capital ratios will substantially exceed the new well capitalized minimum and the new buffered minimums, including [indiscernible] of those new regulations.","That wraps up my remarks. Now I'll turn it over to Bruce to discuss credit results and trends. Bruce?","Bruce K. Lee","Thanks, Dan. As Kevin mentioned, we had a really good quarter in terms of continued credit improvement. Certainly, it is the best overall level of credit performance for Fifth Third since 2007, prior to the financial crisis.","Starting with charge-offs on Slide 11. Total net charge-offs of $181 million declined $39 million, or 18%, from the first quarter and $123 million, or 40%, from a year ago. Commercial net charge-offs of $78 million declined 24% sequentially and 45% from last year. The 67 basis point of losses was the lowest level recorded since the fourth quarter of 2007. We saw improvement in C&I net charge-offs, down $8 million sequentially and in commercial net charge-offs down $5 million. However, the biggest improvement was in commercial construction net charge-offs, which were a net 0 compared with $18 million last quarter. I would also note that our home builder portfolio balances are down to $376 million, less than 12% of peak levels and representing less than 1% of total loans.","Commercial lease charge-offs increased to $7 million due to 1 large charge-off that accounted for the entire amount. Total consumer net charge-offs were $103 million, down 13% sequentially and 37% from a year ago. Improvement was broad-based and reflects underlying trends in overall consumer credit environment and the impact of our previous portfolio management actions. All in, it was a good quarter for us from a credit perspective, and we continue to see steady improvement across our loan portfolios.","Looking ahead to the third quarter, we currently expect net charge-offs to be down about $10 million or so.","Now moving to nonperforming assets on Slide 12. NPAs, including those held for sale, totaled $1.7 billion at quarter end, down $111 million, or 6%, from the first quarter. Excluding held for sale, NPAs were $1.6 billion, down $54 million or 3%. Commercial portfolio NPAs: $1.2 billion and declined $43 million, sequentially, driven by commercial OREO, which was down $40 million. We saw improvement across most portfolio categories, with commercial construction NPAs down $30 million, commercial mortgage NPAs down $13 million, and commercial lease NPAs down $5 million. C&I NPAs were up $5 million or 1%.","Within portfolio NPAs, commercial TDRs on nonaccrual status were down $10 million on a sequential basis. Commercial accruing TDRs were down $26 million and remained fairly low at $455 million. We expect to continue to selectively restructure commercial loans where it makes economic sense for the bank. In the consumer portfolio, NPAs declined $12 million, $437 million or 122 basis points, with NPLs down $5 million and OREO down $7 million. Accruing consumer TDRs were flat sequentially and non-accruing consumer TDRs were down $8 million in the quarter. The TDR book continues to perform in line with our expectations. The portfolio has been relatively stable for past several quarters, as opportunities for new restructurings have become more limited due to our past proactive practices and more stable residential real estate credit condition.","Looking ahead to the third quarter, we currently expect NPA to continue to decline, with the majority of the improvement in the commercial portfolio, which should be down about $100 million.","The next slide, Slide 13, includes a rollforward of nonperforming loans. Commercial inflows at $203 million were up $35 million in the second quarter. The increase is attributable to 2 or 3 larger credits that we expect to cure with no loss this quarter. And we currently expect third quarter inflows to be closer to first quarter levels. Consumer inflows for the quarter were $182 million, down $2 million.","Moving to Slide 14, which outlines delinquency trends. Loans 30 to 89 days past due totaled $370 million, up $3 million from last quarter, with consumer up $14 million and commercial down $11 million. Loans 90 plus days past due were $203 million, down $13 million from the first quarter. Total delinquencies of $573 million were down $10 million from last quarter and remained at precrisis levels. I'd also mention that our commercial criticized asset levels continued to improve in the second quarter, down over $400 million, or about 6%, sequentially.","On to provision in the allowance, which is outlined on Slide 15. Provision expense for the quarter was $71 million and included a reduction in the loan loss allowance of $110 million. Coverage of nonperforming assets remains strong at 125%, and 2.8x annual -- annualized charge-offs. We expect to see continued declines in the reserve.","Slide 16 outlines our recent mortgage repurchase experience. The vast majority of our activities have been with the GSEs, and as Dan mentioned earlier, those claims and losses associated with them have remained fairly stable the past several quarters, although we expect this will likely increase some with increase buyer request. We've provided a detailed break out of loans sold by vintage and remaining balance. Repurchase request and losses have been concentrated by 80% in the 2005 to 2008 vintages, which represent just 14% of balances. Overall results for the quarter demonstrated significant improvement in our credit metrics, and while we still have work to do, we remain headed in the right direction.","I'll turn it back over to Kevin now for any closing remarks. Kevin?","Kevin T. Kabat","Thanks, Bruce. As Dan and Bruce outlined, it was another strong quarter for Fifth Third. Our core businesses continued to perform well and have good momentum as we head into the second half of the year. Credit results also continue to trend favorably, and I appreciate the focus, the hard work of employees this quarter as we move forward. So that wraps up our remarks. Rebecca, can you open the line for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]  And your first question comes from the line of Paul Miller.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Yesterday, there was a couple of your competitors who were on a call said that Ohio, the Midwest, is some of the most competitive pricing out there for commercial loans. I was wondering if you could add some color to that?","Kevin T. Kabat","As we talked about last quarter, I think that comment was made by competitors as well. And from our standpoint it is competitive. It continues to be competitive, although we feel like from our perspective and the growth that we've had that -- and as we mentioned, in terms of our comments earlier, pricing on new productions have been relatively stable, and we feel pretty good about kind of the value we're getting for prices paid from that perspective. So again from our standpoint, it is competitive out there. We're being disciplined, I think, and sensible, in terms of where we're targeted and where we're focused, in competing, I think, you see that relative to our commentary on the indirect auto paper, for example. But we feel really good about the value we're creating long-term for shareholders with the new business we're putting on at this point.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And just a quick follow-up, have you seen any slowdown in activity or loan demand given the recent news reports about the fiscal cliff and troubles in Europe, or is it the Midwest a little bit different?","Kevin T. Kabat","What I'd tell you Paul is that we still see good solid growth. Our production continues to be good. Our pipelines continue to be good. We have seen some of the higher quality, larger credits going to the capital markets where they can refinance debt at historically low levels, but production continues to be good. I think there is generally a consensus out there and a tone of cautiousness in the marketplace. And I think people are watching and paying attention to what's going to happen later this year and some of the resolution of some significant issues that will have consequences on the economy directly in the first part of next year. But again from our standpoint, we're still seeing good activity to drive the momentum that we've had continuing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Todd Hagerman with Sterne Agee.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Bruce, just a question on credit and your outlook,  if you will. I think you mentioned that in terms of the credit quality improvement, it seems to be accelerating more than what you would expect it at this stage of the game. As I look at the metrics, NPL seemed to be stabilizing a bit, the reserve really seems to be slowing down, and your new NPLs ticked up a bit this quarter. I'm just curious, given that scenario, are we close to kind of reaching an inflection point as it relates to kind of provisions and the reserve release, which did slow this quarter relative to Q1?","Bruce K. Lee","First of all, I think we are starting to see a little bit of an inflection between the NPLs, although we think they will continue to decline next quarter, charge-offs will continue to decline as well. Reserve release is formula-driven. It clearly depends upon what our past history was, economic outlook, and we would expect to see continued release, although we do believe the pace will probably slow as the balance sheet continues to grow and we put more new loans on the sheet.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. In terms...","Bruce K. Lee","I think an inflection point suggests turning the other way, and I think what you've seen over the last 2 years and I think what we expect is consistent with that, which is improvement continues, the pace can't -- either pace must slow. But I don't think we're near an inflection point so much as we're just staying at continued improvement, but at a pace that reflects having gotten lots of problems behind us. But we still got more that we'll be able to get resolved in the future.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Right. And again, the point being just in terms as I look at the balance sheet growth relative to the stabilization, some of the credit metrics, that it appears that yet again that reserve release would intuitively begin to slow at this stage of the game?","Kevin T. Kabat","Yes, I think that's fair.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And then just quickly on the mortgage side, could you just quickly on the statistics in terms of just the gain on sale margins, again, expanded this quarter. Just curious kind of if you can make the comparison Q1 to Q2, exactly kind of what you're seeing relative to the production in the mix?","Daniel T. Poston","Sure. So overall, our mortgage results continue to be at near record levels, driven by low interest rates in the HARP program. We saw really good results and we ramped up quickly to take advantage of the refi wave in the fourth and the first quarters. This quarter, I think we saw a continuation of similar results. From a spread standpoint, I think our margins for the quarter were up probably 40 to 50 basis points. That was driven by a number of things, the market conditions were very favorable, obviously.","We were also able to shift some of our capacity to the retail line of business, to the HARP program and less of our capacity was allocated to the wholesale channel. So that had a positive impact on margins overall as we shifted some of that volume to the more profitable segment of the business. As I mentioned earlier, we ramped up pretty quickly in the first and -- or in the fourth and first quarters, and probably captured more than our fair share of business during that period of time. I think the environment has gotten more competitive as rates have continued to move lower and others have ramped up their capacity and that competition shows both in terms of competition for business as well as for personnel. So as we go forward, I think we expect volumes in the third quarter, as we mentioned, to be slightly higher, and perhaps that to have a slight dampening effect on overall margins. But for margins continue to remain very, very strong and for overall results to be slightly stronger in the third quarter than in the second.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","So that, I'm assuming that implies not much change in terms of the rate environment, in terms of your outlook?","Daniel T. Poston","That's correct.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Erika Penala with Bank of America.","Stephen G. Austin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Actually Stephen Austin on behalf of Erika. Just a couple of questions on your NIM, I just wanted to kind of talk a little bit about big picture. I know -- I appreciate the guidance on the second half, and I know you've got some room on the CD repricing as well as the TRUPs in the third quarter. And I'm just wondering kind of further out, is there anything you're thinking about that kind of offsets some of the pressure that we're likely to see given the likelihood of lower for longer on rates?","Daniel T. Poston","I think for the last sort of 2 or 3 quarters, we've talked about the fact that it's difficult to fight yield compression with sort of actions other than growing your earning assets, and that remains the most powerful tool to keep NII stability. We continued obviously, to manage the liability side of the balance sheet, and there are always opportunities. If this lower rate environment continues, we will see those opportunities. We've seen those in Q1, we've seen those in Q2, and I suspect that there will be further opportunities beyond just the redemption of trust preferreds on the liability side. On the asset side clearly, the fight is against sort of repricing, higher coupon loans and higher coupon investment securities. And there unfortunately, we don't expect the rate environment to change between now and year end, as we see sort of the continued Fed's commitment to keep rates low, potentially executing another QE, which may include keeping the rates low beyond their current plan. So in that environment, I think again, the best tool remains growing loans, growing your earning assets prudently and managing NII.","Stephen G. Austin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And nothing else out there like a swaps expiring or anything else we should be thinking about?","Daniel T. Poston","Nothing big.","Stephen G. Austin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just kind of a quick question on post the Visa and MasterCard settlement and the temporary reduction on the interchange. Do you guys expect any impact from that?","Daniel T. Poston","Well, there will obviously be an impact that will apply to us as well as others in the industry. It is a relatively modest reduction, it's 10 basis points. And it relates only to credit card interchange not to debit card interchange. So it does have an impact on us, but we expect that to be relatively modest.","Operator","And there are no more questions at this time.","Jeff Richardson","Okay. Thanks, everyone, for your call.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, all participants\u2019 lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to hand a conference over to your first speaker today, Chris Doll. Please go ahead, sir.","Chris Doll","Thank you, Prince. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today, we'll be discussing our financial results for the third quarter of 2019. Please review the cautionary statements on materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain reconciliations to non-GAAP measures along with information pertaining to the use of non-GAAP measures as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance. We undertake no obligation to and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call.","This morning, I'm joined by our President and CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Chief Operating Officer, Lars Anderson; Chief Risk Officer, Frank Forrest; and Treasurer, Jamie Leonard. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Tayfun, we will open the call up for questions.","Let me turn the call over now to Greg for his comments.","Greg Carmichael","Thanks, Chris. And thank all of you for joining us this morning. Earlier today, we reported third quarter 2019 net income available to common shareholders of $530 million or $0.71 per share. Our reported EPS include a negative $0.04 impact from the items shown on Page 2 of our release, mostly from merger-related expenses associated with MB Financial.","Excluding these items, adjusted third quarter earnings were $0.75 per share. Our financial results were very strong and reflect our ongoing discipline throughout the bank as well as the strength of our diversified revenue streams. We generated strong fee revenue, including a record in capital markets while tightly managing our expenses. Our revenue and expense results exceeded our July expectations.","During the quarter, we also returned 96% of our earnings to shareholders in the form of common dividends and share repurchases. Adjusted pre-provision net revenue increased 28% from a year ago to quarter. The strong performance reflects our ability to generate strong core revenue growth, diligently manage our expenses and deliver on our financial commitments from the MB Financial acquisition.","We also generated strong core deposit growth compared to the prior quarter while proactively lowering interest-bearing deposit cost. All of our key return and profitability metrics improved significantly in the third quarter as we achieved our year-end financial targets by generating an ROTCE excluding AOCI of 16.5%, an ROA of 1.35% and an efficiency ratio below 57% on an adjusted basis. Our ROTCE has increased 280 basis points. Our ROA has increased 7 basis points. And our efficiency ratio has decreased 260 basis points from the year-ago quarter.","End-of-period loans were flat sequentially. Our commercial loan production continued to be strong during the quarter but was muted by elevated payoffs. Consistent with our prior guidance, we generated average consumer loan growth of 2% sequentially. We remain focused on maximizing our returns through the full cycle rather than generating a lower-quality loan growth. Credit quality once again remained relatively benign during the quarter. Non-performing assets and the NPA ratio both declined from the prior quarter, and many of our credit metrics remain at or near historical low levels.","Before I turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our financial results and fourth quarter outlook, I'll review our four key strategic priorities to improve our long-term performance. First, we continue to leverage technology such as our data analytics capabilities to accelerate our digital transformation. Our investments are focused in areas that reduce the friction inherent in traditional banking channels while also investing in areas that drive operational efficiencies. We have made considerable investments over the past several years to modernize, simplify and rationalize our infrastructure.","In addition, we're investing in advanced fraud and cybersecurity technologies to detect and respond to threats quickly. In total, our annual technology spend exceeds $650 million. While we will continue to invest in technology next year and beyond, we expect our investments will lead to improved efficiencies throughout the bank.","Second, we continue to invest to drive future organic growth in some areas of the bank. The ultimate goal of our investments is to improve both the employee and customer experience in order to support sustainable, profitable growth. We believe it is critical to provide our employees with the right tools to maximize productivity, particularly those who directly interact with our clients.","To that end, we recently announced an increase in minimum wage for our employees to $18 an hour effective at the end of this month, which will primarily impact those located in branches in our operations center. We fully expect that this increase will lead to lower employee turnover, with better customer experience and, as a result, improved revenue growth. We have also added talent and capabilities to our Texas and California geographies. We remain pleased with our ability to successfully generate strong relationship growth while maintaining a credit standard consistent with our in-footprint, middle-market banking business.","In addition, we've already seen positive financial outcomes from our renewable energy M&A advisory team, which complements our investment banking capabilities to deliver strategic client solutions throughout our national commercial franchise.","Third, we continue to expand our presence in select key geographies, including Chicago. As I have mentioned previously, our strategy is to generate a higher market share in large and high-growth markets. Our employees remain energized about the combined potential for Chicago. Our overall employee attrition continues to track our original deal expectations. Most importantly, we have not experienced any material client attrition. We remain very pleased with the middle market loan production in our Chicago region, which was by far, the strongest region during the quarter.","Although we are not finished working to ensure a sustainable success, we remain pleased with the progress we have made so far. We are confident in our ability to deliver the financial synergies from the MB Financial acquisition, as previously communicated. We continue to expect to realize the $255 million in annual expense synergies by the end of the first quarter of 2020 and have already completed many of the key expense actions. We also continue to expect revenue synergies to generate approximately $60 million to $75 million in annual pretax income by 2022.","Our commercial teams have done a great job in laying a foundation to leverage our capabilities and strength across our entire franchise. We already see success generating incremental revenue opportunities. For instance, we are successfully leveraging our enhancements and capabilities to provide value-add client solutions to all our middle-market and corporate banking clients. We continue to believe that Fifth Third Chicago is in a position of strength that allows us to generate stronger deposit, household and revenue growth moving forward.","With the MB acquisition significantly improving our position in Chicago MSA, we are continuing to invest in our Southeast markets. With their deposit growth trends, I expect the population growth and greater market vitality.","Lastly, we are focused on maintaining our disciplined approach throughout the company. While we continue to expect generally stable credit quality, we are cognizant of the evolving economic and interest rate environment. From a balance sheet perspective, we have successfully generated strong deposit growth while maintaining pricing discipline. We expect to continue our strong deposit growth at minimum going forward. Our average loan-to-core deposit ratio of 91% is the lowest in over 15 years, reflecting our ability to generate strong core deposit growth and an unwillingness to stretch for loan growth. We expect that this ratio will remain in the low 90s for the foreseeable future.","Our balance sheet management philosophy of focusing on improved performance to the full economic cycle positions us well for the future. Given our capital management priorities, our focus on returning capital through dividends and repurchases, in addition to the organic growth strategies I mentioned, bank acquisitions are not a priority. We have continued to demonstrate our discipline in managing our expenses diligently and investing in areas of strategic importance. Though expense declined $3 million sequentially, excluding merger-related items, we generated year-over-year positive operating leverage on an adjusted basis for this quarter. Tayfun will share about more about expense expectations for the fourth quarter.","Our clearly defined strategic priorities and our proactive balance sheet management and our continued discipline throughout the bank position us well into the next year and beyond. We remain cognizant of the dynamic economic and interest rate environment. We continue to focus on through-the-cycle outperformance to create long-term shareholder value. I'm pleased to report that we were again able to deliver strong financial results. I'd like to once again thank all of our employees for their hard work, dedication and for always keeping the customer at this time with everything we do.","With that, I'll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our third quarter results and our current outlook.","Tayfun Tuzun","Thank you, Greg. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Let's move to the financial highlights on to Slide 4 of the earnings presentation. During the quarter, we achieved strong revenue growth with flat expenses and continued benign credit results. With a 3% quarter-over-quarter increase in adjusted total revenue and a slight decline in expenses, our annualized core PPNR as a percent of earning assets of 2.3% in the third quarter of 2019 reached the highest level since 2013.","Reported results for this quarter were negatively impacted by two notable items, a $22 million after-tax impact from MB merger-related charges and an $8 million after-tax negative mark related to the Visa total return swap. Adjusting for those items, pre-provision net revenue increased 7% from the prior quarter, and our efficiency ratio improved 180 basis points to 56.7% as strong firm-wide fee growth more than offset lower net interest income during the quarter.","As Greg mentioned in his opening remarks, our adjusted return metrics were also very strong in the third quarter. We achieved an adjusted ROA of 1.35% and an adjusted return on tangible common equity of 16.5% excluding AOCI despite the market dynamics and stable capital levels during the quarter.","Our adjusted ROTCE is now over 280 basis points higher compared to a year ago and our adjusted ROA is up 7 basis points for the same period as most of our peers have experienced declines in those metrics. At our original CET1 target, which was closer to 9%, our ROTCE excluding AOCI would have been approximately 17.5% in the third quarter. Our performance this quarter also helped us achieve our previously stated year-end return targets one quarter sooner than we anticipated. Clearly, environmental factors especially interest rates will have an impact on these returns going forward. Our third quarter credit performance continue to reflect the generally benign macroeconomic environment with both the NPL and NPA ratios declining quarter-over-quarter.","Moving to Slide 5, total average loans declined less than 1% sequentially. Our focus continues to be on generating high quality loan growth to maximize our returns through the full cycle. In our commercial business, strong origination volumes in C&I were more than offset by elevated payoffs and paydowns. Total commercial line utilization decreased over 1% sequentially, reflecting the broad market uncertainties.","I would also like to point out that the third quarter average loan growth metrics were impacted by higher payoffs and paydowns at the end of June. We also continue to see declining balances in large ticket in direct leasing where we halted new originations in early 2018. Average commercial real estate loans were flat from last quarter. Our CRE balances as a percentage of total risk-based capital remain very low at less than 80%, which keeps our exposure relative to capital near the bottom of our peer group.","We expect that near-term loan growth will continue to reflect the software environment for corporate capital investments. With our expanded capabilities, our new originations continue to remain strong. However, payoffs and paydowns have resulted in muted net loan growth so far this year. Assuming a similar environment in the fourth quarter, we expect average commercial loans to be relatively stable compared to the third quarter.","As always, our focus is on client selection and prudent underwriting as we plan to grow our balance sheet in the best long-term interest of our shareholders. Average total consumer loans grew 2% from last quarter. Overall, consumer loan demand remains at healthy levels within our risk appetite. This quarter, growth was driven by strong auto loan production of $1.8 billion during the quarter.","Auto production strengths were the highest in nearly a decade again with the same strong risk profile that we have targeted for the past number of years. Home equity production was 5% higher this quarter compared to last quarter, but due to pay downs and payoffs, our balances declined. Our credit card growth was in line with the industry.","The residential mortgage portfolio was flat and in line with our balance sheet management preferences in the current rate environment. In the fourth quarter, we expect total average consumer loan balances to increase 1% to 2% sequentially.","Moving on to Slide 6. Reported net interest income was stable compared to the prior quarter. Adjusting for purchase accounting accretion, NII decreased $14 million sequentially or 1%. The purchase accounting adjustment benefited our third quarter NII by $28 million and our net interest margin by 7 basis points.","The adjusted third quarter NIM of 3.25% decreased 7 basis points from the second quarter. Third quarter margin compression was slightly elevated relative to our July expectations due to a larger decline in LIBOR and the shift in the yield curve, as well as elevated cash balances resulting from strong deposit growth.","Our overall interest bearing liability costs continued to be very well maintained down 6 basis points during the quarter. Interest bearing core deposit costs decreased 2 basis points sequentially as we expected. We expect interest bearing core deposit costs in the fourth quarter to decline approximately another 15 to 18 basis points from the third quarter assuming an October fed rate cuts.","During the quarter, the yield on the loan portfolio declined 9 basis points and as we expected, our investment portfolio yield maintained a relatively stable level with the decline of only 4 basis points. Total premium amortization was less than $3 million.","On a core basis, we expect fourth quarter NIM to decline 4 to 5 basis points from the core third quarter NIM of 3.25%. Our guidance incorporates 25 basis points fed rate cut in October and results in a core NIM for the full year 2019 of approximately 3.26%, a 4 basis points increase compared to 2018.","We currently expect our fourth quarter net interest income, excluding PAA to be down approximately 1% sequentially, reflecting the NIM impact and the relatively stable loan growth outlook. As we look ahead to next year, the hedge positions will start contributing meaningfully and at an increasing level to the overall NII based on our current rate outlook.","We expect our core NIM in the first quarter of 2020 to expand a couple of basis points from the fourth quarter of 2019, given the benefit of $4 billion of previously executed forward starting hedges that will begin in December and January. At this time, we expect full year 2020 core NIM to be in the range of approximately 3.2% to 3.25% depending on the size and timing of Federal Reserve actions. We would expect to be at the upper end of the range assuming no fed rate cuts in 2020 and expect to be at the lower end of the range assuming two additional 25 basis points rate cuts in March and September of 2020. We assume that deposit betas will be in the 40s.","In summary, we expect our NIM to widen a few basis points for the full year 2020 relative to the expected Q4 level, if there are no rate cuts and remain fairly stable, if there are two more rate cuts.","Moving on to Slide 7. We had a stronger quarter in fee income than we guided to in July. Adjusted non-interest income increased 11% sequentially led by strong performances in both corporate banking and mortgage banking. As you recall, in July, we guided to a strong second half fee performance and we realized the larger portion of our anticipated growth in the third quarter.","During the last two years, we deliberately channeled our investments in a number of diverse fee generating businesses to maintain our ability to grow total revenues in different environments and our year-to-date non-interest income results demonstrate the increasing benefit of having a platform with a wider scope of product and service capabilities.","Corporate banking fees were up 23% from the prior quarter, significantly exceeding our prior guidance driven by strong growth and debt capital markets, M&A advisory and lease related revenue, all reflecting our diversified and enhanced capabilities to better serve our clients. Our capital markets teams generated record revenues this quarter, partially impacted by clients accessing the debt markets for financing.","Additionally, the renewable energy M&A team that we hired two months ago already closed to transactions during the quarter. For the fourth quarter, we currently expect corporate banking revenues of approximately $150 million or up 15% from the year ago quarter, but down from this record third quarter. Mortgage banking revenue of $95 million increased 51% sequentially. Origination volume of $3.4 billion was up 17% from the prior quarter.","Our gain on sale margin of 232 basis points was up 66 basis points sequentially and 69 basis points from the same quarter last year, driven by expanding primary, secondary spreads, which we anticipate will remain elevated in the fourth quarter given industry wide capacity constraints. Our mortgage platform is stronger today than three years ago based on our investment in our loan origination system. The cyclical nature of this business is providing good revenue support in this environment.","Wealth and asset management revenue increased 2% from the prior quarter due to higher personal asset management revenue. Deposit service charges were flat compared to the prior quarter as higher consumer deposit fees were offset by lower commercial deposit fees. Our strong performance this quarter elevated our second half total fee outlook raising our full year 2019 fee income growth to 17% to 18% from our July guidance of 15% to 16%, once again highlighting the diversification benefit and strength in fee income generation.","Because of the record high numbers in the third quarter, we expect our fourth quarter total non-interest income to decrease approximately 4% from the adjusted third quarter of 2019. This outlook is reflective of seasonality in mortgage banking. We also expect higher wealth management revenues during the quarter.","Moving on to Slide 8. Third quarter reported expenses included merger related items of $28 million, as well as intangible amortization expense of $14 million. Adjusted for these items and prior period items shown in our materials, non-interest expense decreased $3 million from the prior quarter. We remain on track to deliver on the previously provided outlook for MB related expense savings.","We continue to expect to achieve $255 million in savings by the end of the first quarter of 2020 and to capture approximately 80% of the savings on a run rate basis by year end. Additionally, we continue to expect our total after tax merger charges, inclusive of the merger related charges recognized in current and past periods as well as projected future charges to be approximately $250 million after tax. We expect current \u2013 we expect fourth quarter expenses to continue drift slightly lower from the adjusted third quarter level, including the impact of the $3 raise in our minimum wage from $15 to $18 effective at the end of this month.","As we look ahead to 2020, we are mindful of the challenging outlook for revenue growth related to slower loan growth and lower interest rates and plan to manage the trends in our core expenses appropriately. While we maintain our focus on investing in our businesses for long-term growth, we will not disregard the near term realities associated with the market environment and the impact on operating leverage. We will share our 2020 expectations with you in January.","Turning to credit results on Slide 9. Third quarter credit results continued to reflect the generally benign economic environment. Our key credit metrics remain at or near historical lows. The third quarter NPA ratio of 47 basis points declined 4 basis points sequentially, while the NPL ratio decreased sequentially to 44 basis points from 48 basis points. Compared to last quarter, commercial net charge offs increased 5 basis points and consumer net charge offs were up 9 basis points, reflecting seasonal factors.","The ALLL ratio increased slightly sequentially to 1.04% of portfolio loans and leases. We currently expect fourth quarter charge offs to generally track the third quarter\u2019s performance.","Again, I would like to remind you that the current economic backdrop continues to support a relatively stable credit outlook with potential quarterly fluctuations, given the current low absolute levels of charge offs. We expect to the \u2013 with respect to the upcoming CECL adoption, our expected ranges appear to be in line with other banks that have already disclosed their information. In our legacy portfolio, we expect the impact of CECL to result in a 30% to 40% increase in reserves.","Due to differences between the accounting treatment of MB\u2019s loans under the acquisition accounting methodology and the treatment under CECL, the increase in CECL reserves for our combined loan portfolio will be in the range of 40% to 55%. This incremental impact is predominantly due to the fact that under the CECL methodology, there is no mechanism that converts the non-PCI discount that we established at the time of acquisition to loan reserves.","Turning to Slide 10. Capital levels remained very strong during the third quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 9.6% and our tangible common equity ratio excluding AOCI was 8.21%. Our medium-term CET1 target remains at 9.5%. Our tangible book value per share was $21.6 this quarter, up 17% year-over-year and up 5% from the second quarter.","During the quarter, we completed $350 million in buybacks, which reduced our share count by approximately 13.4 million shares or about 2% of our common shares outstanding compared to the second quarter. We expect to execute the remaining approximately $900 million of repurchases over the remaining three quarters in the CCAR cycle, in addition to raising our dividend by $0.03, which is subject to board approval.","Slide 11 provides a summary of our current outlook. We plan to provide more information regarding our 2020 outlook in January consistent with our normal timing. In summary, I would like to reiterate a few items. Our third quarter results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress that we\u2019ve made over the past few years towards achieving our goal of outperformance through the cycle. Our execution on the MB acquisition is on track to meet our targets on both expense and revenue synergies.","As always, we remain intensely focus on successfully executing against our strategic priorities and remain confident in our ability to outperform through various economic cycles.","With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A.","Chris Doll","Thanks, Tayfun. Before we start Q&A, as a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. We will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have a lot at this morning. During the question-and-answer period, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator. Prince, please open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Good morning.","Greg Carmichael","Good morning.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Thanks for all the clarity on the guidance for the fourth quarter and I appreciate you don\u2019t want to give anything explicit on 2020 relating to costs, but you did say you\u2019re mindful of kind of the tougher revenue environment. And I was hoping if you could just talk about some of the puts and takes as we think about 2020. And I\u2019ll put a couple out there, the easy ones out of the other way. And like you obviously got the full year benefit of the MB cost saves, which will drag for minimum wage. But remind us kind of where you are in some of the investment cycle, whether it\u2019s related to technology or some of your expansion efforts, how those might compare next year versus this year.","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes. Thanks, Matt, for your question. Just the MB comparison also need to take into account the fact that we will have four quarters with MB expense base versus three quarters in 2019. So I just want to point that out. And obviously, the MB picture is intact and we will deliver those cost savings. In terms of the drivers of the expense page that we are now looking at as we are building our 2020 plan, the tech investments clearly are underway. I think we\u2019ve done quite a bit to improve our infrastructure and focus on customer-facing tools this year that will continue into next year.","Our expansion plans, whether it\u2019s related to retail expansion in the Southeast, which is mostly financed by closing branches in the North as well as prudent geographic expansion in commercial, we are still keen on moving on because those are our long-term growth drivers and we\u2019ve had good success in the efforts over the past two years.","Having said that, I think those decisions, the incremental investment decisions will be made with the environment in the background. And we also look to improve the productivity of the existing expense base. When you think about it, we had about a $4.4 billion total expense base on an annual basis. About $2.3 billion of that is in headcount-related expenses. That\u2019s salaries, benefits and other headcount expenses. So we need to make sure that we get the productivity out of that expense base appropriately, and that should continue to provide some ability to fund those incremental expansions from savings on the expense [indiscernible] $0.5 billion of that $4.4 billion total expense base is in equipment and occupancy, and we continue to focus on efficiencies there.","And about $400 million of that is in pure IT cost, away from headcount-related IT cost. So these areas still will give us the opportunity to look for efficiencies as we continue to prudently and selectively invest in the company. But the revenue growth is strong, and we believe that despite the fact that we will have challenges associated with the rate environment, the fee-based and the diversified product and service offerings will continue to support that revenue growth into 2020. So that\u2019s the color that I can give you today. But again, we\u2019ve been very focused on positive operating leverage over the past two, three years. And that\u2019s still in our minds as we are building the 2020 plan.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay, that\u2019s helpful very detail. Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from John Pancari from Evercore. Your line is now open.","John Pancari","Good morning.","Greg Carmichael","Good morning, John.","Tayfun Tuzun","Good morning.","John Pancari","Just on the acquisition on MB. I know there\u2019s been some press about departures, banker departures going to competing banks. And I just wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about what you have seen on the bank upfront because I know some of the reports were including other departures that were unrelated. And have those departures been consistent with your expectations or have they exceeded? Thanks.","Greg Carmichael","John, as I mentioned \u2013 this is Greg. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the execution against the expense synergies is going as planned. The large part of that expense synergy obviously was personnel. So you absolutely expect some of that personnel to move to other banks. We fully expected that. I would say, right now, 90% of all the high performers that we targeted retaining from a banker perspective are still with the bank today. So we have not lost those. And it\u2019s very much in line with our expectations that we\u2019ve modeled in.","And there\u2019s probably a little more to come as we continue to work towards our expense synergy numbers, but you would expect that both in the back office and some of our sales force. So we bring the two companies together, look at our gearing ratios and what we need in that market while those bankers basically didn\u2019t have opportunities with Fifth Third and end up with another bank. So you\u2019re going to have banks want to tap that a little bit, but that\u2019s to be expected and within our modeling for this transaction.","John Pancari","Okay, great. Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And then just separately, I appreciate all the guidance you gave on the loan side and everything. So really, I just want to ask about demand, what you\u2019re seeing in your markets right now, if you are seeing any erosion in confidence on the commercial borrowers\u2019 side. I mean we have seen some macro data that would support the view that there could be some moderation, whether it\u2019s ISM or CapEx or whatnot. So if you can give us a little bit more color on what you\u2019re seeing, that would be helpful.","Lars Anderson","Yes. So this is Lars. Frankly, I\u2019ve been in the market a lot recently. And I have not seen any improvement, I don\u2019t believe, in terms of the perspective of our clients relative to the economic environment. I\u2019d say that we can continue to see a very heightened level of concerns and uncertainty with tariffs, global slowing, a lot of growing uncertainty now in Washington around public policy. These are all laying heavily on our clients\u2019 minds. And certainly, we\u2019re taking that into consideration as we look at the market environment, which we do with the \u2013 operating in the fourth quarter and in 2020.","So with that said, we\u2019re very pleased with the investments that we\u2019ve made. We had a very, very strong \u2013 in fact, the strongest quarter a commercial loan growth in the third quarter. We did have offsetting that, utilization rates back off about 140 basis points. That\u2019s about $1 billion swing in terms of our outstanding. A good portion of that, however, were positioned very well. As you know, we\u2019ve invested in our capital markets platform, in particular, in FRM, our bond underwriting and distributing.","And frankly, we are well positioned to capture a lot of that. That is a portion of the record level of capital markets fees that we recognized in the third quarter. So it\u2019s not always just about the balance sheet in outstanding loans. It\u2019s about helping your clients. Depending upon the current economic environment and with our broadened capabilities, we well positioned ourselves to do that. So frankly, I feel very confident about the future for our company given the investments that we\u2019ve made and look forward to continue to execute against our opportunities.","John Pancari","Thanks, Lars. Appreciate it.","Operator","Next question is from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Ken Usdin","Thanks, guys. Good morning. Tayfun, I was just wondering \u2013 thanks for giving the color on where the NIM could settle out. How can \u2013 how is it going to work with the purchase accounting from here just given your current schedule? And then how CECL might change the expected contribution from that us to think about next year? Thanks.","Jamie Leonard","Hey Ken, it\u2019s Jamie. That\u2019s actually a very complicated question. The first part is very easy. Purchase accounting, we were at $15 million in the second quarter and increased to $28 million in the third quarter just given the higher CPRs. We\u2019re forecasting again that assuming zero prepayments, that number will be about $15 million fourth quarter. And in the first quarter, there\u2019s roughly $150 million of PAA left to go. So that part is fairly straightforward.","The more complicated part in terms of how the seasonal impact all of this, the PAA really shouldn\u2019t be impacted. However, the impact on income recognition from PCI loans is still being evaluated. The big four accounting firms are still having discussions with the FASB in terms of whether that should be \u2013 continue to be recognized on an effective yield basis or recognized more on a cash flow for those that would need to go to non-accruals. So quite complicated with no official answer yet. So we\u2019ll provide more guidance once we hear back.","Ken Usdin","Okay, got it. And then just follow up just on the deposit side. I believe you guys talked about 15 basis points to 18 basis points interest-bearing cost decline in the fourth. It\u2019s a healthy beta on the way down. Can you just talk about what\u2019s happening on the deposit front in terms of product pricing and your confidence in getting that type of response across the deposit base? Thanks.","Jamie Leonard","Yes. We think and are confident in our ability to deliver a 40% beta on the three moves, July, September and October. That full beta will actually be realized through the end of the first quarter. And what we\u2019ve done from a rate perspective is, midway through the third quarter, we reduced our go-to-market rates on the retail side. From a 1.5% offer, we pulled it down to 1% because, as we\u2019ve said before, we really aren\u2019t interested in competing with online banks or attracting hot money.","And so no not all of our peers move their promo rates during the quarter. And that\u2019s why we were able to deliver the reduction that you see in the third quarter of 2 basis points but are confident that will continue into the fourth quarter. And then on the \u2013 from the CD side, we talked about this last quarter. We\u2019ve got about $1.9 billion of CDs to mature at a 2% rate in the fourth quarter. And our go-to-market rate right now is roughly 1.2% and there\u2019s another $2 billion in the first quarter. So from a retail perspective, we feel very good about the steps we\u2019ve taken and that those numbers will materialize. And then on the commercial side, large portion of that deposit is indexed. So as those rate cuts occur, we\u2019ll realize that. So again, we think our strong market share in the majority of our markets allows us the opportunity to move a little bit earlier than perhaps some of our peers can deliver those deposit reductions.","Ken Usdin","Great. Thank you, Jamie.","Operator","Gerard Cassidy from RBC, your line is now open.","Gerard Cassidy","Good morning.","Greg Carmichael","Hey Gerard.","Gerard Cassidy","Tayfun, can you share with us \u2013 one of the things I think investors and the analysts are trying to get their arms around is next year\u2019s CECL, so called day two number. The day one number which you gave us, the amount of capital or the amount of reserve, that will go up when you guys change to CECL. And you pointed out on the legacy portfolio, 30% to 40% increase. Is that a rough idea of what we can think of provisioning going forward in day two, that provisions under CECL could be as high as 30% to 40% higher than what they would have been if CECL was not implemented? Or is that just way off base?","Tayfun Tuzun","Well, Gerard, it\u2019s a difficult question to answer because clearly, there is going to be dependence upon what the economic scenarios are and how each portfolio is growing because as many banks have said and we\u2019re seeing the same thing, clearly, the pressure on the commercial side is much less compared to the mortgage side and the consumer side.","And also there are different \u2013 as you consider the full life of that product, there are different phases that are governed by the economic scenario outlook for the first few years and then there is a regression back to normal and then back to normal historically. So it is difficult to answer. We are still working on finalizing the models. And I\u2019ll be able to give obviously a lot more clarity as we move into the first quarter. But I think there is a decent chance that provisions will go up based upon where that growth is coming from relative to today.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay, thank you. Greg, you pointed out in your opening comments that acquisitions are not a priority right now. And you look at the big merger we saw this year between BB&T and Suntrust and you look at the stock performance of those companies the day prior to the announcement today and they\u2019ve outperformed the bank index. Would you guys consider a merger of equals? Or what would make you think about something like that in the future?","Greg Carmichael","First of all, Gerard, we\u2019re \u2013 from a responsibility perspective, we have an obligation to our shareholders and our Board to assess any opportunity that makes good business sense for our shareholders. So if an opportunity of that nature emerge, we will discuss it. We will look at it. We\u2019ll make the right decision for long-term benefit of our shareholders. At this point right now, we have a lot on our plate, completing MB Financial, the organic growth strategy we have.","We\u2019re very pleased with the performance of the franchise. We don\u2019t think we need to do anything but continue to invest in our business and grow our business and deliver on the results that we\u2019re talking about today. But once again, if something did emerge of that nature, we would consider it as we would be required to. But at this point right now, we are not interested in an acquisition. We\u2019re focused on driving the outcomes we\u2019re looking for through an organic perspective of our business.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. Thank you for the color.","Operator","Next, Peter Winter from Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open.","Peter Winter","Good morning.","Greg Carmichael","Hey, Peter.","Peter Winter","Can you give an update on credit? Obviously, nice decline in non-performing assets. But I was just looking at the increase in net charge-offs quarter-to-quarter, which should be fairly stable in the fourth quarter and then this reserve build and then finally just what\u2019s happening with criticized loans.","Jamie Leonard","Yes. Let me make just a short comment and I\u2019ll turn it over to Frank for more color. I mean we\u2019ve always said that at these very low levels of charge-offs, there is going to be small variations. But we\u2019re still in the teams in terms of commercial charge-offs and very much in line on the consumer side. The other thing that I want to point out is the consumer charge-offs, if you\u2019re looking at the year-over-year comparisons, we had a charge-off portfolio sale last year. So that lowered the absolute rate last year.","In terms of the provision bills, really, I mean for any given portfolio when you think about it, if you sort of compare the economic environment at the end of June to the economic environment at the end of September, the background is different then. So the 2 basis point increase in reserve coverage is really more reflective of that. And I\u2019ll turn it over to Frank for any color on the actual sort of portfolio trends here.","Frank Forrest","Yes. Hey Peter, yes, good question. Just some perspective. When you think about reserve builds, one thing to keep in mind. This quarter, as you look at it, we had a $35 million build. Of the $35 million, $28 million was unfunded on the funded portfolio and $7 million is on increases in reserve for unfunded commercial commitments. When you go back and you think about 2018, for example, we had reserve releases of $122 million. We said at that time and we said over subsequent quarters that we were at an inflection point.","Tayfun has mentioned that several times this morning. We have been at an inflection point. Our numbers have been historically low across the board. We\u2019re really sort of still at an inflection point. Our non-performing assets are below 50 basis points. That number if you compare it to the median reported peer numbers is better than the peer. We expect that to stay stable. That\u2019s an important number. Our charge-offs are well within our risk appetite. We expect that to remain there. We haven\u2019t changed our guidance at all.","When you think about criticized assets, we\u2019re watching criticized assets closely. The third quarter included the results of the shared national credit exams for banks. We included that in our numbers. We did have a blip up in criticized assets. One particular large corporate credit was involved in that. We don\u2019t see any loss and that credit has been restructured. Where we saw an increase in criticized assets has really been in sort of core middle market. And so when you look at core middle market, those ones tend to be secured loans and backed by guarantors.","And so we don\u2019t see any particular trends or patterns related to geography or more risk type that\u2019s totally concerning to us. If you think about our large corporate book and you think about commercial real estate, those are books that typically have a lot of volatility in a market. Our criticized assets are below 3%. Both those portfolios are very well underwritten, very stable portfolios. Our leverage book is performing well. We\u2019ve reduced it by 50% in the last three years. So all the work that we\u2019ve done to change the mix of this portfolio is still reflected in our results today. And so yes, we did have a build in the third quarter. We did that because we wanted to take a very conservative view of where we are, that the market has changed a bit in the third quarter and we do live in a world that Lars was talking about where our borrowers are more on edge now than they have been before.","Tariffs are taking an impact on the weekend customers, are not really having an impact on strong customers. So as I step back and think about it, 2018, we had a significant release. In 2019, for the most part, it\u2019s been stable. We took a look in the third quarter and we bumped it up a bit. We think it was the prudent thing to do. We manage this book conservatively, and I think it\u2019s been reflected clearly in our results over the past two to three years. And our outlook has not changed. So I\u2019m still very comfortable with where we are. And I\u2019m very comfortable with the positions we\u2019ve taken to change the outlook of this company going forward relative to repositioning the portfolio in a much different manner than we did in the past.","Peter Winter","That\u2019s great. Very helpful, really helpful. Tayfun, on expenses, I know you\u2019re not ready to give 2020 guidance. I\u2019m just wondering with the full quarter \u2013 I guess fully realizing the expense saves by the first quarter next year, could you say expenses in the first quarter, you would expect to be down from 4Q?","Tayfun Tuzun","Today, it\u2019s very early to be able to give you that perspective, Peter. The difference between the run rate just with respect to the MB portfolio from the fourth quarter to the first quarter is about $20 million. So on a run rate basis \u2013 because on a run rate, about $65 million \u2013 255 million divided by 4 gives you about a $65 million to $70 million type of number. And then we\u2019re going from 80% realization to 100% realization. And then our first quarter is always the high quarter because we have the VC numbers and the FICO numbers, all that stuff. So let us wait a little longer to give you that color. But as I said, we are very focused on making sure that we deliver the right expense numbers for next year given the background on the revenue side.","Peter Winter","Thanks, Tayfun.","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes.","Operator","Next question is from Brian Foran from Autonomous. Your line is now open.","Brian Foran","Hi, good morning, everyone.","Tayfun Tuzun","Good morning, Brian.","Greg Carmichael","Hey, Brian.","Brian Foran","So \u2013 and one follow-up on CECL. I\u2019m almost reluctant to ask because my understanding is tenuous at best. But my understanding was to reflect a double-count benefit where CECL had lifetime reserves and then the old PCI accounting had marks on these acquired loans. And then \u2013 so you\u2019re effectively reserved twice. And then that reverses through the P&L as the loans mature. So is your comment that it\u2019s unclear how that double-count benefit will work? Or is the comment that double-count benefit might not actually be there?","Tayfun Tuzun","Well, we will have to wait for more clarity throughout the quarter. And I\u2019m hesitant to give you more guidance at this time. But what I pointed out to was that from a pure CECL impact perspective, the current methodology does not provide a mechanism to convert a non-PCI discount into the CECL reserve number. That really is more of the impact on a day one basis. But let\u2019s wait until the first quarter so that we can give you a bit more clarity on that.","Brian Foran","Fair enough. One small follow-up. I still get a fair amount of questions on GreenSky from investors. I mean it\u2019s such a small piece of your book. I sometimes wonder if there are Fifth Third investors or GreenSky investors who are asking it. But could you maybe give us an update, where does the loan book stand now and any thoughts on the growth trajectory going forward?","Tayfun Tuzun","So the loan book stands at about $1.4 billion. Clearly, incremental growth this year came in lower than we expected because the prepayments in the portfolio are overwhelming a preset level of originations. If you remember going two years ago, when we first announced the partnership, we thought by now we would be at $2 billion, which was the back-end goal. And so in terms of the portfolio metrics, credit is behaving as we expected and the margins are behaving as we expected and the margins are behaving as we expected.","And the company clearly announced a period of time in which they will be evaluating different strategies and we are waiting for that. And depending upon in what direction they choose to go, we will make our own decisions based on how we see those loans benefiting our balance sheet. So I think there\u2019s still probably some questions that need to be answered because \u2013 before we can give you a clearer direction on GreenSky levels.","Brian Foran","Thank you for that.","Operator","Next question is from Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Erika Najarian","Hi, good morning.","Tayfun Tuzun","Good morning.","Erika Najarian","So despite a solid quarter, the stock got down at the open, and I\u2019m wondering if some of that is the hope the market had that you\u2019d provide a little bit more directional, if not specific clarity, in expenses. So I guess I\u2019m going to try one more time. If I take out the impact of a March 22 close and I just look at consensus numbers or expectations for revenues starting in the second quarter of 2020, it seems like consensus is expecting flat year-over-year revenue growth from the second quarter of 2020 onwards.","And I\u2019m wondering that given your message for positive operating leverage, if after the seasonal increase in the first quarter, the message really here is that if that is really the revenue outlook that will transpire in 2020, that the expense base would have to go down from that $1.117 billion in the fourth quarter.","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes. So I think the trajectory of the revenue outlook we gave you some perspective on our margin expectations in 2020, a 5 basis point difference depending upon when and how much the Fed decides to cut, if they decide to cut. But we still expect a decent level of fee income growth. We\u2019ve seen good income growth this year in fees, and the investment should continue to provide support for better fee income growth going forward than our \u2013 in the last couple of years. And I\u2019m very hesitant to give you more clarity than that in terms of the revenue side, and we will manage the expenses accordingly.","And I think we are very focused on making sure that the expense base does not move away from us as we look at that revenue trend. And our teams are very focused, and we have about six weeks to eight weeks in front of us here to finalize our plan, and we are optimistic that we will be able to provide good guidance to you guys in January. In terms of what the market was expecting, the \u2013 what we guided in July, it\u2019s playing out for the second half of the year, very much in line with our guidance. The NIM, it came down a little bit more than we expected based on the rate movements.","But in terms of the revenues, we had a great third quarter obviously, and that is capturing pretty much what we expected from the second half. And with the mortgage seasonality upon us moving from third quarter to fourth quarter, it is difficult to build upon this very strong third quarter in fee income and project even higher fee income in the fourth quarter. So we\u2019re mindful of that, and a couple of transactions on the capital markets side and advisory side came in, in the third quarter. But in general, our outlook was strong for the second half of the year, and we are now actually showing a very strong second half performance.","Erika Najarian","Okay. And so the follow-up question is \u2013 thank you for giving a clarity in terms of your net interest margin expectations for next year. And Jamie, I\u2019m wondering \u2013 I wanted to clarify, that range of 3.2% to 3.25%, that includes two rate cuts from here. And if that\u2019s the case, then the contribution from the $4 billion in hedges should be a positive $40 million annualized, with LIBOR at $150 million is included in that size.","Jamie Leonard","So the guide we have is the cut in October plus two more in 2020, March and September. And in order to help \u2013 let\u2019s just look at all of the hedges that we have in place from a cash flow perspective. So our cash flow hedges in the first three quarters of 2019 made about $2 million. Over the next five quarters, if those rate cuts play out, those $11 billion of hedges are going to make $155 million. So that\u2019s $15 million in the fourth quarter, and then the rest spread out across 2020.","So that\u2019s really the backdrop for our confidence in the NIM overall, not compressing going forward the way you saw it in the third quarter. We just unfortunately did one-year forward-starting swaps, and we probably should have done seven-month forward-starting swaps to protect the third quarter. But when you look at first quarter of 2019 versus first quarter of 2020, our guide is that NIM would be down 5 or 6 bps with those July, September and October cuts, and I got to believe that\u2019s going to be best-in-class performance over that period of time.","Erika Najarian","Got it.","Tayfun Tuzun","Our NIM results, actually, Erika, when you look at the cumulative change in NIM this year, we are ahead of our peers. I mean it\u2019s been a very, actually, very good performance for the first three quarters of this year when you look at it on a cumulative basis. Also when you look at it, as people are guiding now for the fourth quarter and the way we are guiding for the fourth quarter, in 2019, NIM performance is very strong.","Erika Najarian","Understood. I think that the market maybe thinking that industries generally top ticking on fees. I don\u2019t think the skepticism is over, actually, your net interest income. I think it\u2019s a combination of just the industry top ticking on fees and then sort of what the expense management fallout will be from there. But I very much appreciate all the detail on NII. Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from Saul Martinez. Your line is now open.","Saul Martinez","Hey guys. I\u2019ll ask another question on CECL, just a pretty popular topic on this call. Your reserve rate shows about, I think it was 104 basis points this quarter. With the CECL reserves 40% to 55%, that will take you more or less I think to about 150 basis points, ALLL ratio. Do you expect your growth going forward, the balance \u2013 your growth in balance \u2013 loan balance is to \u2013 on average, under the CECL methodology, come from products that have higher or lower than 150 basis points lifetime losses.","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes. Good question. So when you think about the portfolios that are driving a higher percentage of CECL reserves, Residential Mortgage, we have, at this time and probably in the near to medium term, have no plans to grow the Residential Mortgage book. Home equity loans have been in decline now for a number of years. That\u2019s another portfolio that is carrying a high percentage. And then sort of other consumer loans, inclusive of GreenSky loans, also carries a higher percentage.","So those \u2013 all those three portfolios will probably display a relatively lower growth rate compared to other loans on our books. And commercial, clearly being our largest portfolio, getting back to a more normalized level of commercial loan growth would indicate that perhaps that day one percentage would be overstating the incremental impact on reserves.","Saul Martinez","Yes, got it. So I mean, under the CECL methodology, your commercial, especially your C&I, I would think would be \u2013 I don\u2019t know if materially, but it should be much lower than 1.5%. And just the normal \u2013 ALLL ratio should gravitate down at that as\u2026","Tayfun Tuzun","Everything else being equal, including the economic scenarios that are being applied to that is a reasonable assumption.","Saul Martinez","Yes, okay. Got it. Thank you. On \u2013 and I guess I want to go back to NII and specifically on deposit betas and deposit prices. It seems like you have good visibility in terms of the betas on the rate cuts for July, September, October. But if I look into next year, if we do get a margin in the September cut, I mean, how confident are you with those 40% betas on future cuts? Because \u2013 and I asked because if your guidance comes to fruition, I calculate that your deposit costs \u2013 interest-bearing deposit costs are going to be probably in the 80 basis point range, probably lower \u2013 obviously lower, all in. It just doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s a lot of room for deposit costs to come down from these levels given the low jump-off point, and deposit costs are already low relative to short-term rates from a historical standpoint. So I guess the question is if rates do continue \u2013 short rates do continue to come in, maybe even more than what you\u2019re expecting, how does the deposit beta outlook change?","Jamie Leonard","Yes. This is Jamie, Saul. You\u2019re right in that our fourth quarter forecast, our interest-bearing core deposits is in the, Saul, mid-80s basis points of cost. And then that number coming off of the other rate actions we would take, plus a March cut, we\u2019d be into the 70s of that point in time. We still think there\u2019s opportunity to operate at a 40% beta on the next couple of cuts. But certainly, once you\u2019re beyond those cuts and if you had more in 2021, you would start to bump up against some of your deposit floors and some of your products.","So we model all of that in our interest rate sensitivity tables, and that\u2019s where you see that when the Fed starts cutting 100 or 150 basis points that the outcomes aren\u2019t as productive as on the first couple. But I think for the foreseeable future, the next three or four cuts, the 40% beta is a good number for us.","Saul Martinez","And are those cuts \u2013 are those betas coming pretty \u2013 are they pretty balanced between retail and commercial? Or are they\u2026","Jamie Leonard","No, it\u2019s very barbelled, where retail right now, we think from July, September, October, will be in the 25% to 30% range, and commercial will be \u2013 and our Wealth & Asset Management group would be in the 60% range. And that\u2019s similar with what we saw on the way up the 225 basis points of fed hikes.","Saul Martinez","Right. Okay, got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Next question is from Mike Mayo from Wells Fargo Security. Your line is now open.","Mike Mayo","Hi, can you hear me.","Greg Carmichael","Hey, Mike. How you doing?","Mike Mayo","So three things which we can observe: your expenses are controlled; the MB Financial closings took place; and tech is a priority. So we can see that. So can you just give us some more understanding of what\u2019s happening under the hood as it relates to technology? Like do you close three of the four MB Financial data centers? So how many data centers did you have at the peak? How many do you have now? And where do you think that can go? And then maybe how many apps did you have at the peak? And what happened pre and post-merger with MB Financial? And anything else on technology, such as the cloud and what percent of the apps you might want to move to a public cloud?","Greg Carmichael","And Michael, I\u2019ll try to answer that question in the order in which you asked it. First off, from a technology perspective, obviously, we\u2019ve invested in technology as other banks have done that. But we really like the returns we got from those investments. If you go back in 2007, just look at our central operations, and you look at 2007 to 2019, we grew that expense base 1% over that 12-year period of time. And we\u2019re $30 million bigger in assets, and this will be more in transactions. We focus a lot of our technology investments in operational efficiencies, back-office capabilities, artificial intelligence capabilities to better serve our clients.","We\u2019re getting paid well for those type of investments. We\u2019ll continue to do that as well as our customer-facing opportunities, where we continue to leverage technology to improve the way we serve our customers and reach our customers and the effectiveness from a cost perspective of how we talk to those customers. In addition to that, we\u2019re investing in cybersecurity as you would imagine, with fraud. If you look at our fraud losses, we\u2019re down year-over-year. I would tell you, very few of our peers like are down year-over-year. Because of the investments we made in technology, we get paid well for that.","So we\u2019ll continue to do that at the right pace in how we think about it. As far as data centers go, we run with two data centers. We\u2019ll run in the future with two data centers. Those data centers, I think, are about 200 miles apart as a requirement from a conduit perspective. And right now, with MB Financial, there\u2019s two additional data centers that we\u2019ll close down and consolidate into our operations. Most of their applications will consolidate onto our applications, and most of their applications were eliminated, except for those applications that were supporting their asset base lending platforms and their leasing platforms. Everything else, for the most part, is consolidated into Fifth Third, and the majority of that is complete.","So we got work to do on the cleanup of the data centers, as you would expect, but that\u2019s all part of the plan and part of the numbers we explained to you, and we\u2019ll absolutely execute well on getting that done. With respect to the cloud, listen, we don\u2019t just move applications from our legacy to the cloud in current state. If we have the opportunity to reengineer an application and it\u2019s suited for the public or private cloud, we\u2019ll then move it to public or private cloud. We do use a public cloud. We do use private clouds. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s really based on the application. We\u2019re very mindful of the risk, so we\u2019re very mindful with the applications. Do we allow it to be in that cloud environment.","So we\u2019re really diligent about how we think about our infrastructure. A lot of our investments are also around remonetization of our technology infrastructure, our legacy platforms, to make them more agile so we can move more quickly in this digital age. So we\u2019ll continue to do that. And the cloud\u2019s part of how we do that, but we\u2019re less concerned about how many apps we have in certain areas. But if you just move a current application up into the cloud, it\u2019s probably going to cost you more money to operate. Okay?","Mike Mayo","Yes. I guess just that last comment was interesting. And as far as data centers though, where were you at peak? And just to be clear, you have two data centers. You have two more with MB Financial. You have four or\u2026","Greg Carmichael","We got four data centers, Mike, and we\u2019ll go back down to two.","Mike Mayo","Okay. So you will have four total data centers when you\u2019re done.","Greg Carmichael","Yes.","Mike Mayo","And how does that compared\u2026","Greg Carmichael","Mike, we\u2019ll have two data centers when we\u2019re done. We had two going into the merger. MB had two. We\u2019ll consolidate their two onto our two, so we\u2019ll have two at the end of day.","Mike Mayo","Okay, great. So two data centers.","Greg Carmichael","Right.","Mike Mayo","And how does that compare \u2013 and look, you have the tech background. You know this stuff. I mean, how does two data centers for a bank your size compare to peer? Or how many total data centers does the industry have? And why do so many banks not give this information when we ask? So I appreciate you giving this to us.","Greg Carmichael","Yes. I mean first off, two has always been, in any business where there was prior days, in the manufacturing sector, two data centers is the more optimal way of running it. You have to have the space to prep the leaser off different grids and so forth from a telecom perspective, but two is the optimal way for us to run our business, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve \u2013 how we\u2019ve operated it. That\u2019s where we\u2019re most efficient, we get the best leverage of our talent and our resources and our use of our capabilities. So more than that would not make sense for Fifth Third or most companies, I believe, but that\u2019s how we see things. And we\u2019ll consolidate, once again, the two MB onto our current two legacy of Fifth Third data centers.","Mike Mayo","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from Marty Mosby from Vining Sparks. Your line is now open.","Marty Mosby","Thanks. Good morning. I have three quick questions, and then I want to kind of dive into my little deeper subject. But if you get into first three, your capital and your buybacks, you bought about $350 million this quarter. You\u2019re kind of foreshadowing $300 million per quarter. I thought there was kind of an overhang of past gains that you could have a catch-up this quarter. So I was curious why it went a little bit higher in the share repurchase in this particular quarter.","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes. Good question, Marty. The $300 million per quarter is probably a good directional guidance. What we did was, as you remember, at the beginning of this year, we were thinking that we would probably be going towards a 9%-type capital number, but we chose to actually be at the upper end of our target, at more like 9.5%. So we had the Worldpay gains that still remain, that we executed in the first quarter. We decided not to execute the buybacks related to that. That\u2019s about $200 million or so in gains that we\u2019ve kept on the balance sheet. That\u2019s the difference that you\u2019re seeing.","Marty Mosby","Okay. And that\u2019s \u2013 keeping that going forward, you want to keep that higher capital ratio, so that\u2019s there?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes. For now, in the near term, that\u2019s probably a good target.","Marty Mosby","Okay. And then you showed a schedule on preferred dividends kind of oscillating between 33 and 17. Is that going to be the pattern going up and down each quarter given the semiannual payments on Series H?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes. More or less, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen, and then it would change as any of the preferreds reach their fixed period and move to floating, but those are a few years off. So for the foreseeable future, that\u2019s a good pattern.","Marty Mosby","Okay. And then I just wanted to bring up a point on purchase accounting. You have the uptick this quarter from 15 to 28, and then you have the reserve build of 50. So when you look at those two things, the reserve build more than offset this uptick in purchase accounting accretion. And those are kind of tied because as you\u2019re taking those loans out as they\u2019re prepaying and then coming back in as a normal loan, you\u2019re having to kind of rebuild reserves on loans that were in purchase accounting accretion. So there\u2019s an actual \u2013 not a real benefit this quarter from this transaction or this kind of process. There\u2019s actually a negative weighing on the quarter that kind of releases as you go into next quarter.","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes. Marty, I don\u2019t think those two are necessarily connected to each other. Clearly, the higher prepayments have resulted in a higher purchase accounting accretion number for the quarter, but the build is not necessarily on MB loans. So it is a broader environmental factor that takes into account many other variables in our ALLL methodology. So I would not connect those two together.","Marty Mosby","If they\u2019re not connected, there\u2019s some offsetting going between the reserve build that\u2019s negative and positive in the purchase accounting accretion.","Tayfun Tuzun","I would still say that they are not connected to each other.","Marty Mosby","Right, got it. Now going into CECL again. One, I wanted to answer Gerard\u2019s question. I think we\u2019re missing a little bit of math, so let me kind of give you what my thought is and then get your response. The thought that you increased your allowance by 30% or 40% and that your day two provisioning costs are going to be 30% to 40% higher, does it work out that way for this reason? If you look at your allowance over the last five quarters, you had provisioning of $475 million; you had net charge-offs of $409 million, which represented 85% of your loan loss provisioning. So that doesn\u2019t change day two. You\u2019re still going to have to cover your losses. What you\u2019re going to have increased is, the 15% of what you paid over the last year in loan growth goes up by 30%. So you could go from 15% to 20% of your allowance that\u2019s related to loan growth, which would be at that higher ratio because you\u2019re going to have the higher reserve level that you\u2019re going to have to maintain. So it\u2019s only the incremental part on loan growth that goes up by 30%, 40%. That\u2019s not your total amount of loan loss provision that you have every quarter because that\u2019s really mainly related to the losses, not the allowance ratio. Does that make sense?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes, it does. And I think there \u2013 the second question, I think, was Peter or somebody else asked the question in terms of what that incremental number is based on the growth dynamics that we would see in our portfolios. So what you\u2019re saying is correct. And on top of it, which portfolio growth also has an impact on that provision, that is purely related on incremental loans.","Marty Mosby","Yes. So if you had the exact same mix of loans, you would keep the 150 ratio. So instead of providing at 105, you\u2019re going to be providing at 150. So just on the incremental loan growth doesn\u2019t go up 30%. Your whole loan loss provision doesn\u2019t go up 30%. Losses are the majority reason for loan loss provisions, so the net charge off ratio still will be the main driver for your loan loss provision.","Tayfun Tuzun","That is correct. I interpreted Gerard\u2019s question in the same unit in terms of just applying it to incremental loan growth. So\u2026","Marty Mosby","Yes. But Gerard was kind of get lost in that and assume \u2013 they kind of think although that means our loan loss provisioning has to go above that amount, it really doesn\u2019t have to. And the only thing I was going to leave as a guidance and just for everybody in the industry to kind of think about is because of day two, don\u2019t think of day one as a real good chance to round up our allowances because we never get this back. This isn\u2019t an allowance like we had in the past, where you kind of can build it given your economic belief of what\u2019s going to happen and then eventually kind of recapture that. This is a true to life, through the cycle kind of provisioning.","So rounding up on the CECL is just going to more volatility and higher provisioning that really never gets realized until you actually liquidate your bank. So actually being conservative in a sense of rounding up. In our mentality, we\u2019ve been trained to do that for so long. It\u2019s not a good answer given the way the accounting is going to be different day two as we move forward. So I\u2019ll just encourage everybody to not just think of this as \u2013 I\u2019ve heard so many people say, \"This is our chance to round up allowance to prepare for the recession.\" This thing won\u2019t give you any benefit as you into that recession. So it\u2019s not a reserve you\u2019re getting benefit from. So anyway\u2026","Tayfun Tuzun","Thanks for that fact. I think that\u2019s very helpful, Marty.","Greg Carmichael","Thank you, Marty.","Marty Mosby","Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from Vivek Juneja from JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Greg Carmichael","Hey, Vivek.","Vivek Juneja","Hi. Sorry, I\u2019m going to get a little more prosaic. Just a corporate banking line item. You mentioned lease remarketing. Can you tell us what the gain is on that for this quarter?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes. That lease item, Vivek, includes more than just remarketing. Because remember, we now have two new leasing businesses under our hood, LaSalle leasing and Celtic leasing. So it\u2019s a broader number. There were just some leverage leases that paid off during the quarter. And I think that number was, I don\u2019t know, in the single digit, upper single-digit number, something like that.","Vivek Juneja","Okay. Okay. Great. And that number, given that you\u2019re doing more in leases, it was likely to be more volatile going forward as a result, Tayfun?","Tayfun Tuzun","There is some volatility associated with the underlying business, especially on the technology side, which is dependent upon the timing of the technology contracts that are coming due. But in general, I think the trends will be positive. I think we expect that line item, as we are also now investing more in that business, to continue to grow. We may see some seasonality going forward. And \u2013 but in general, I think the trends will be up.","Greg Carmichael","Yes. And I will just add, as we continue to build out our equipment finance kind of [indiscernible] frankly in the regional banking market with MB joining us, our strength in syndicating these transactions has grown significantly. We\u2019ve got some great talent there, and we would expect that, that will continue to grow in the future.","Vivek Juneja","Okay. Great. Second question, just wanted to clarify the numbers that I think Frank may have put out. Criticized assets, Frank, was it 3% criticized assets to loans? Or was it \u2013 did I get that not correct? Or was it up 3%? And how did \u2013 what was the change linked quarter?","Frank Forrest","Let me talk in terms of classified assets, which is probably better than criticized assets. Classified assets are loans that are rated substandard. Criticized assets include loan that have potential problems, but they\u2019re not well-defined weaknesses at this point in time. Our classified assets were up 5% of the quarter. And again, as said before, they fluctuate quarter-to-quarter up and down, still well within our risk appetite, within our tolerance.","Vivek Juneja","Okay. And has that increased, as you said, mostly from the shared national credit exam results?","Frank Forrest","No. It actually was more in the quarter \u2013 on the classified, it was actually just more on our quarter middle market. That\u2019s a granular portfolio, and as said before, it\u2019s a portfolio that is the well secured. So while the level of the problem loans goes up, it doesn\u2019t change our outlook relative to nonperforming or the loss in a material way.","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes. I think the SNC portfolio levels, and I don\u2019t have the actual numbers in front of me, but they\u2019re almost like 50% in terms of these credit metrics, where theirs is classified criticized, they are well below the broader portfolio credit metrics. So\u2026","Frank Forrest","Yes. I mean that\u2019s right. And what I did mention before and maybe what you reflected on, our large corporate book, which is the Shared National Credit portfolio, for the most part, a level of criticized assets in that entire book is under 3%, and that\u2019s maybe what you were referencing. That\u2019s a fair number. And the same goes for our commercial real estate portfolio, was under 3%, which is where the banks have had the preponderance of their problems over the past decade or so. So those are books we manage very carefully. We feel very, very comfortable with the overall asset quality. So I think that was in response to your question.","Vivek Juneja","Yes. Okay, thank you.","Frank Forrest","Thank you.","Operator","Next question is from Christopher Marinac from Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is now open.","Christopher Marinac","Hey, thanks. Just wanted to ask about the talent pool in Chicago and the turnover that has happened with MB. Is most of that behind you? And are you confident with kind of what\u2019s happened on backfill with your staff.","Greg Carmichael","First off, as we said earlier, the true rate that we\u2019ve seen so far is exactly what we modeled in. 90% of all of the outperfomers that we intended to keep we offered position to work still at the bank. This is normal with respect to an acquisition in the market by a larger bank. There\u2019s individuals that we didn\u2019t offer positions to that are going to shop to other banks. A lot of that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing right now. We\u2019re getting close to the end of that tail, all right, and we feel very comfortable about the talent that we have to serve that market, the talent that we retain. As I\u2019ve mentioned in our prepared remarks, we had very little client attrition associated with this transition.","And Chicago was one of our strongest production markets in core middle market across all of our regions this quarter. So we feel really good about the talent that we have. And once again, to get $255 million of expenses on your job, a lot of that is people-related expenses. So you would expect those individuals to shop for other banks. And I know other banks have [indiscernible] is having success recruiting against entity. But that\u2019s just part of this process of consolidating two financial institutions. You\u2019re going to get some of that attrition, which is to be expected and planned for.","Christopher Marinac","Great, Greg. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks very much.","Operator","There are no further questions. I\u2019m turning the call over to Chris Doll.","Chris Doll","Thank you, Prince, and thank you all for your interest in Fifth Third.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","Thank you. Sameer Gokhale, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Sameer Shripad Gokhale","Thank you, Shelby. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today, we'll be discussing our financial results for the third quarter of 2016. This discussion may contain certain forward-looking statements about Fifth Third pertaining to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, and objectives. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from historical performance and these statements.","We've identified some of these factors in our forward-looking cautionary statement at the end of our earnings release and in other materials, and we encourage you to review them. Fifth Third undertakes no obligation and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call.","Additionally reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures we reference to in today\u2019s conference call are included in our earnings release along with other information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures. A copy of our most recent quarterly earnings release can be accessed by the public in the Investor Relation section of our corporate website www.53.com.","This morning, I'm joined on the call by our President and CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Chief Operating Officer, Lars Anderson; Chief Risk Officer, Frank Forrest; and Treasurer, Jamie Leonard.","Following prepared remarks by Greg and Tayfun, we will open the call up to questions. Let me turn the call over now to Greg for his comments.","Greg Carmichael","Thanks, Sameer, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. As you can see on Page 3 of the presentation, we reported third quarter net income to common shareholders of $501million and earnings per diluted share of $0.65. During the quarter some notable items resulted in a net positive $0.22 reported earnings per share. Tayfun will provide further details in his opening comments.","During the quarter we continue to focus on North Star Initiative. Our Q3 results provided further evidence of the progress we were making. Our net interest margin was well managed and stable sequentially, reflecting our focus on higher quality customer relationships. Adjusted fee income excluding MSR valuation adjustments was up 4% year-over-year and the growth rate has accelerated since the beginning of the year.","Expenses were down 1% this quarter, compared to second quarter of 2016. During the quarter credit quality remained stable with a decrease in both non-performing and criticized asset levels for the second quarter in a row. The slight elevation in our charge-offs primarily reflects quarterly volatility in the low levels we\u2019ve been experiencing. We expect the benign credit environment to continue for the foreseeable future.","Production metrics continue to be strong with mortgage volume up $2.9 billion, up 7% sequentially and up 27% from last year. Q3 volume represented the highest level of quality originations in the last three years. In our commercial business, we remain focused on higher quality relationships that will enable our business to outperform through the cycle. As a result commercial loan production for relationship manager is up 7% and fees for relationship manager up 22% on a year-to-date basis.","Our overall commercial loan balances reflect the soft loan demand which persisted during the quarter. Regardless of the environment we\u2019ll continue to focus on relationships that meet our return objectives. We\u2019re also investing in developing new origination channels. For example, during the quarter we announced our strategic alliance with GreenSky and investment in and partnership with GreenSky will help us to efficiently generate additional consumer loan volumes while allowing us to leverage the technology platform in existing merchant relationships.","While we continue to invest for growth in our businesses, we recognize that this remains a challenging environment for quality revenue growth, given a limited support from the broader economic environment to maintain a strong focus on expense management. The ongoing reviews across business and staff functions, we\u2019ve already taken significant steps to reduce our expense base. We completed sell and consolidation of 108 branches this year which is expected to drive approximately $60 million in annualized cost savings.","Last month we announced the plan to sell and consolidate an additional 32 bank branches, which should generate incremental cost savings of $12 million annually. As a result total branches are expected to be down 12% since we began this process late last year. We expect these actions to generate expense savings of $72 million yearly. With rapid changes in technology and customer behavior we\u2019ll continue to implement our omni channel strategy. We believe this will allow us to further optimize our branch network to best serve the needs of our customers.","We\u2019re also making a necessary technology that just acts like [ph] digital and operational capabilities. Our investments in digital channel are paying off. In the third quarter approximately 20% of consumer deposits were made using our mobile app, compared to 60% a year ago. Overall, we\u2019ve seen a 25% increase in mobile usage year-over-year. We\u2019ve also seen 106% increase year-over-year in checking savings accounts opened online. We expect to continue to making investments to drive higher digital option and creating more integrated customer experience while creating efficiencies [indiscernible].","To optimize workspace utilization, we\u2019re evaluating non-branch facilities for additional efficiency. During the quarter we saw one of our Michigan facilities which generated $11 million pretax stake. We\u2019re working on similar opportunities to reduce expense, run rate, while improving the overall work environment for our employees. We also renegotiate key vendor contracts during the quarter as disclosed earlier. As a result of our strong execution and focus on expense management, we now expect year-over-year expense growth to be sub 4% in 2016, compared to our original guidance of 4.5% to 5% at the start of the year. The actions we\u2019re taking should help us to achieve a positive operating leverage in 2017.","For the near term expense management is at the top of our priority list, we\u2019re also maintaining a long-term perspective on our strategic plans. During the third quarter, we formerly launched Project North Star to line our entire organization toward a higher and more sustainable level of profitability within the next three years. Our energies are focused on generating the right mix of expense reductions, key revenue enhancement opportunities and balance sheet optimization in order to achieve ROTCE targets. Assuming the current operating environment persists, we expect to achieve 12% to 14% ROTCE run rate by the end of 2019.","We expect the contributions from Project North Star to be additive to the improvements that we\u2019re already making on our base run rate. These initiatives will leverage our strength and middle market lending, industry verticals, especially lending areas in our commercial business. In the consumer business growth initiatives in mortgage banking and personal lending will provide support for more balanced growth in our overall loan portfolio. We continue to expand our capabilities in businesses such as capital markets, insurance and wealth management that generate attractive returns.","In initiatives such as our commercial end-to-end process redesign project will help generate additional efficiencies for improving the overall customer experience. We intend to achieve these targets without changing our risk appetite or our ongoing discipline of maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our capital and liquidity levels remain strong and improved from last quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio reached 10.16% from 9.94% at the end of the second quarter and our liquidity coverage ratio was 150%, 25% above the current requirement. As previously disclosed, reserve an object [ph] to an increase in our common dividend of $0.14 per share in the fourth quarter.","In summary, I was pleased with the solid results we generated despite soft economic conditions. Our results demonstrate the progress we\u2019re making toward our targets on the Project North Star as well as our longer term strategic goals. I also want to thank all of our employees for their hard work and dedication and for keeping the customer at the center of everything we do.","With that, I will turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our third quarter operating results and current outlook.","Tayfun Tuzun","Thanks, Greg. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Let's move to the financials summary on Page 4 of the presentation. As Greg said, overall we are pleased with our results in the current economic environment. The growth in our net interest income, the stability of the net interest margin and the decline in our expenses are indicative of our focus on improving shareholder returns.","For the third quarter, there was a net positive impact of $0.22 per share resulting from several items. The most significant item was $280 million pre-tax gain from the termination and settlement of certain Vantiv TRA gross cash flows and the expected obligation to terminate and settle the remaining TRA gross cash flows.","Our underlying fee revenues were solid during the quarter. Mortgage origination and pass through fees were 31% higher in the third quarter on a year-over-year basis. Corporate banking revenues were seasonally down slightly from a robust second quarter as we had previously indicated.","Expenses continued to be tightly controlled as we continue to look for efficiencies throughout the organization. The quarter-over-quarter improvement in overall key credit risk indicators is supportive of the benign credit outlook.","So with that let\u2019s move to Page 5 for the balance sheet discussion. Average commercial loan balances decreased 1% sequentially and increased about 1% year-over-year. The sequential decline reflected some softness in C&I loan demand and was consistent with industry trends.","Our spreads widened as we continued to reposition and optimize the portfolio into a more attractive risk return profile that we believe will be more resilient in the economic downturn. Our C&I has increased every quarter since the third quarter of last year. CRE growth of $354 million this quarter partially offset some of the decline in C&I loan balance.","As we discussed before, in construction as well as in term lending our teams are cognizant of valuations and supply demand dynamics created by the lack of attractive investment alternatives. Our discipline client selection and credit underwriting in CRE will continue to rely on stringent standards.","Average consumer loans decreased $78 million from last quarter and we\u2019re down 2% year-over-year. Auto loans were down 3% from last quarter and 12% year-over-year in line with our lower origination targets and focus on improving risk adjusted returns in this business. Our strategy so far this year has resulted in higher returns on assets and capital than our initial expectations in our indirect auto business.","Residential mortgage loans grew by 3% sequentially and 10% year-over-year, as we kept jumbo mortgages, RMs as well as 10 and 15 year fixed rate mortgages on our balance sheet during the quarter.","Our residential mortgage originations were up 7% from last quarter 27% year-over-year. During the quarter our origination mix was roughly in half between purchase and refinance volumes. About 70% of the originations came from the retail and direct channels and the remaining were originated through the correspondent channel.","Our home equity loan portfolio decreased 2% sequentially and 7% year-over-year, as loan pay downs exceeded strong origination volume. Our originations this quarter were up 15% compared to last quarter and 20% higher year-over-year.","Our goal is to achieve a better balance between commercial loan growth and consumer loan growth. Our new partnership with GreenSky should help enhance our ability to generate consumer loans, especially as we start to implement their technology in our own business. In addition our new initiatives in credit card lending should also support stronger growth going forward.","Average investment securities decreased by 239 million in the third quarter or 1% sequentially. Our yield widened by 2 basis points quarter-over-quarter, partly due to higher discount accretion during the quarter.","Average core deposits decreased $98 million from the second quarter. Average core deposits were negatively impacted by approximately $302 million due to the Pennsylvania branches sold in April. Excluding these deposits, average core deposits were flat on a sequential basis and up 1% on a year-over-year basis. Our liquidity coverage ratio was very strong at 115% at the end of the quarter.","Moving to NII on Page 6 of the presentation; taxable equivalent net interest income increased by $5 million sequentially to $913 million. The increase was primarily driven by improved investment portfolio yields, an increase in 1-month LIBOR, and the impact of the day count. The increase was partially offset by the full quarter impact of $1.25 billion of unsecured debt issued late in the second quarter and lower average C&I loan balances.","The NIM was stable from the second quarter at 2.88% and wider than we forecasted in July. The positive impact of higher yielding investments and an increase in 1-month LIBOR was offset by the full quarter impact of the second quarter debt issuance and the day count.","Our outlook for NIM has improved relative to our July forecast. With no rate hikes for the rest of the year, we now expect the NIM to be stable to down 1 basis points in the fourth quarter, which includes the full quarter impact of our September debt issuance. On a full year basis, we would expect a NIM of about 2.89% which is up 1 basis point from 2015.","We expect NII to be down slightly in the fourth quarter from the full quarter impact of our debt issuance and more normalized discount accretion on the investment securities portfolio. We are still projecting full year NII growth of 2% despite ongoing challenges the low environment - the rate environment and stable loan growth.","We will continue to execute a balanced interest rate risk management strategy as we have over the last three years. Our NIM out performance should not imply that we have outside exposure to a declining portfolio yields. We estimate that in a static interest rate environment, the investment portfolio would only have a detrimental impact of 2 basis points in 2017 on the Bancorp\u2019s net interest margin.","A key contributor to this stability is that approximately 48% of our investment portfolio consists of lockout and bullet securities. Keeping nearly our entire investment portfolio in the available for sale category has also allowed us to maintain some flexibility to reposition the investment portfolio in response to changing market conditions.","Shifting to fees on Page 7 of the presentation, third quarter non-interest income was $840 million compared with $599 million in the second quarter. Our fee income adjusted for items disclosed in our earnings release was $596 million. Also excluding the impact of the net MSR valuation, fee revenue was up 2% versus last quarter and up 4% compared to the third quarter of 2015.","Despite the environmental factors, our underlying fee revenues were solid. Mortgage production gains on sale were up 13% quarter-over-quarter, reflecting the robust origination volume that I mentioned earlier and a 39 basis points increase in the gain on sale margin.","Mortgage banking net revenue of $66 million was down $9 million sequentially, primarily due to net MSR valuation adjustments during the quarter. Net MSR valuation adjustments were negative $9 million, compared to a positive $6 million last quarter. We expect our fourth quarter mortgage origination revenue to be seasonally a little lower than the third quarter by 5% to 10% above last year\u2019s fourth quarter.","Corporate banking fees of $111 million was seasonally down $6 million or 5% sequentially, reflecting decreases in loan syndication revenue and foreign exchange fees, partially offset by an increase in corporate bond underwriting revenue. These were up 7% on a year-over-year basis, driven by strong corporate bond underwriting and loan syndication revenues.","The expansion highlights, our efforts to increase the scale and scope of our product offering in line with relationship driven model that we\u2019re executing. We expect corporate banking fees in the fourth quarter to be stable relative to the third quarter.","Deposit service charges increased 4% from the second quarter driven by a 6% increase in retail service charges as well as 3% increase in commercial service charges. The increase in retail service charges reflected seasonally higher customer activity. Deposit service charges decreased 1% relative to the third quarter of 2015, reflecting reduced monthly service charges as part of our new consumer checking account line up.","Total wealth and asset management revenue of $101 million was flat sequentially as market value improvements were offset by lower transaction driven retail brokerage fees. Revenues declined 2% relative to the third quarter of 2015 as investment management and institutional fees were more than offset by lower brokerage fees.","We discussed the third quarter impact of Vantiv TRA transactions in July during our second quarter earnings call. These transactions were very beneficial from both risk management as well as shareholder return optimization perspective.","As you may recall, our prior guidance for 2016 called for 5% annual adjusted fee growth off base of $2.3 billion for 2015. The space excluded impacts of Vantiv as previously discussed which are mentioned on Slide 11 of our presentation. Excluding Vantiv related items the Visa total return swap adjustments and any impacts from branch sales and consolidations we continue to expect annual fee growth of 5% growth for the full year.","Next, I would like to discuss noninterest expense on Page 8 of the presentation. Expenses of $973 million were $10 million lower than in the second quarter including the impact of the FDIC surcharge. This reflects a decrease in compensation related expenses and employee benefits resulting from the impact of the second quarter of 2016 retirement eligibility change as well as other reductions in operational expenses.","As Greg stated earlier, we are making good progress in executing on key strategic initiatives and managing our expenses at the same time. We now expect expense growth to be below 4% level compared to our July guidance of 4% and 4.5% to 5% at the start of the year. Once again I would like to remind you that our guidance includes the impact of the increased amortization of our low income housing investments which most of our peers reflect in their tax line.","On an annual basis this line item contributes nearly 3% to our efficiency ratio. It also includes an increase in the provision for unfunded commitments and the impact of one-time benefits related to the settlement of legal cases in 2015. These three items make up roughly 2% of the forecasted increase in expenses. As we have previously discussed generating positive operating leverage is our top priority going into 2017 and our recent trends are supportive of that outcome.","Turning to credit results on Slide 9, net charge-offs were $107 million or 45 basis points in the third quarter, compared to $87 million and 37 basis points in the second quarter of 2016 and $188 million and 80 basis points in the third quarter a year ago. The sequential increase in charge-offs was primarily due to $22 million increase in C&I net charge-offs.","Total non-performing loans excluding loans held for sale were $586 million, down $107 million or 15% from the previous quarter resulting in an NPA ratio of 63 basis points. Commercial NPAs decreased $94 million or 17% from the second quarter. In addition our criticized asset has steadily improved over the last four quarters and our criticized asset ratio is now at the lowest point since third quarter of 2007.","The strength in the key credit metrics indicates continued overall stability, but given the absolute loan levels there may be volatility in some periods periodically. Our provision was $11 million lower than that last quarter, partially driven by improving non-performing loans and criticized asset levels.","Our results in reserve coverage as a percent of loans and leases decreased one basis point to 1.37%, but was up two basis points from last year. Our previous guidance that led charge offs would be range bound with some quarterly variability is unchanged. We expect the fourth quarter charge-offs to be lower than the third quarter charge-offs. Also we continue to believe that our provision expense will be primarily reflective of loan growth.","Moving on to capital and liquidity on Slide 10, our capital levels remain strong and are growing. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.16%, an increase of 22 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 76 basis points year-over-year. At the end of the third quarter common shares outstanding were down approximately 11 million or 1.4% compared to the second quarter of 2016 and down 40 million shares or 5% compared to last year's third quarter.","During the quarter we executed an accelerated share repurchase of $240 million which reduced the share count by 10.98 million shares. This repurchase includes our 2016 CCAR repurchases as well as the third quarter after tax cash flows realized from the Vantiv TRA termination and settlement.","Our book value and tangible book value are up 12% and 13% respectively year-over-year. We expect our fourth quarter tax rate to be between 23.5% to 24.5% range. This quarter we will be finalizing our 2017 financial plan as well as our outlook for Project North Star which is a three year project. As Greg said, we expect Project North Star to contribute meaningfully to our base performance which makes it slightly [ph] improving dependency compared to our more recent performance.","The priorities embedded within the North Star project are intense focus on expense management, smart balance sheet management and capital efficiency and revenue growth initiatives in high return businesses. These expectations include higher to historical growth in personal lending including credit cards, expansion of our middle market and vertical business commercial and widening the scope and scale in our capital markets businesses.","Expense savings should include lower infrastructure and delivery cost in IT, lower total compensation cost and other operational expense savings in foreign exchange management, legal work and savings related to a more efficient data infrastructure and end-to-end process redesign.","This quarter we are working on finalizing our 2017 financial plan as well as the construct of our Project North Star. Our goal is to share our expectations with you later this quarter and more in our January call. We have included the updated outlook on Slide 11 for your reference.","And with that let me turn it over to Sameer to open the call up for Q&A.","Sameer Shripad Gokhale","Thanks, Tayfun. Before we begin Q&A, as a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourselves to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. We will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have this morning. During the question-and-answer period, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator. Shelby, please open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jill Shea with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Jill Shea","Good morning guys, just on the loan growth side, can you provide us some color in terms of what you are hearing from customers and just any color in terms of overall demand and then just how much is the foreign exchange related to the environment and softness and demand and how much it is actually related to deliberate pulling back in terms of relationships or industries?","Lars Anderson","Yeah, so Shea this is Lars and just a few comments there. First of all what we are hearing from clients, they continue to be cautious, they are asking about making significant investments. I guess you'd seen some of that play out in the lower M&A activity that we are seeing as we've headed further into the year. That uncertainty also revolves around questions about political what is going on in China, Brexit, EU type issues. So those are certainly coloring some of the advancement that we are seeing. We did clearly see a slower production in the third quarter, but I would see that as a little bit more seasonal which we typically see lower levels in July and August. So I would say it was more pronounced this third quarter, however with the things that we are doing investing in our verticals, new businesses and frankly we\u2019ve got some geographies some markets there are performing very well. I would expect that we will continue to see loan growth at a good stable rate on a go forward basis. We got great business model one that clearly is being well received in the market place, our advisory base relationship model is long embraced and we are seeing that reflected in deeper client relationships that is helping us to drive fee income.","Jill Shea","Great thanks, it\u2019s very helpful and then maybe just quickly on the margin, it held up quite nicely this quarter. Can you just walk through the moving parts there, I think you spoke to some of that in your opening remarks in terms of the loan and securities yields, but could you just walk us through your expectations keeping that margin stable sequentially as we move forward, maybe just some puts and takes there?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yeah, I think, we obviously were happy to see a stable margin, a good amount of that is due to what Lars just talked about, discipline pricing on the commercial side, we actually as I mentioned has been able to increase our C&I yield four quarters in a row now, that is helping out, very focused management of the investment portfolio, environmental factors clearly have played out very similar to the way we envision them and the investment portfolio is contributing a lot to. Jamie, anything else you want to add to the margin side?","Jamie Leonard","Yeah, as Tayfun mentioned the third quarter walk is what we would expect some of these to recur in the fourth quarter. So from the second quarter to the third quarter, loan yield expansion was one basis point of improvement and then the investment portfolio of this kind of accretion was another 2 basis point on top of that and that was offset by the day count impact of negative 1 basis point in the debt funding impacts of negative 2 basis points. So we expect going forward for the fourth quarter, obviously it\u2019s been an active year on the debt side for us and we have refinanced all of our maturities for the year, so the debt you can expect to be pretty quiet. But the long yield expansion that we\u2019ve seen every quarter this year we expect to continue into the fourth quarter and for us it is driven by C&I and auto yields, they both increased 3 basis points in the third quarter. And then the one - normally from the third quarter would be the investment portfolio had tremendous performance in the third quarter with the discount accretion, you saw that how we are obviously pleased with our position on the portfolio, but that should normalize in the fourth quarter just given the faster speeds in the third quarter than what we are expecting in the fourth quarter. So that will be a little bit of headwind for us in the fourth quarter but I think the loan yield and the other actions we have taken to generate either a stable and perhaps down a basis point and that assumes there is not Fed increase in the fourth quarter.","Greg Carmichael","Jill, and if I could just tag on this has been a very deliberate strategy over the past years. We focused on balance sheet managed event and redeploying our capital into business that we felt that we could get better returns. By stabilizing our core coupon we have been able to benefit more from the LIBOR rise than many of our peers and we are going to continue to do that and in fact that\u2019s part of our North Star strategy.","Tayfun Tuzun","And beyond the fourth quarter we stand by our statement that we made last quarter that we see stability in 2017 without any rate increases and what is encouraging is when you take a look at the debt refinancing that we had this year, 2017 is relatively lighter year, so that also would be supportive of that stable outlook for 2017.","Jill Shea","Okay, great thank you so much.","Tayfun Tuzun","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Erika Najarian","Yes, good morning.","Greg Carmichael","Good morning, Erika.","Erika Najarian","So I just wanted to ask a follow up question, you mentioned that beyond fourth quarter you see stability in the net interest margin without a rate hike. I am wondering as you continue to go through the balance sheet optimization which is clearly beneficial to margin, how should we think about average earning asset growth going forward? It\u2019s been flattish this year and I am wondering if some of the heavy lifting in terms of exiting certain portfolios is going to abate next year and perhaps average earning asset gross could pick up.","Greg Carmichael","Thanks for the question Erika, this is Greg. First of all we have done a lot of - maybe in the last year plus and really exiting out of all other sectors and focusing on profitability would it be commodities, term loans, leverage loans. We basically pushed out almost $2 billion over the last year. So while that is going to abate as we go into 2017, 2018 a lot of heavy lifting is going to be done and has been done this year. So when you get to think about next years, we\u2019re looking at the forecast, we expect commercial loan growth to be close to nominal on GDP maybe slightly north of that. And consumers given some of our focus on indirect auto and bringing down the originations, there we expect that to be flat to slightly up next year. Then we focus on other opportunities such as mortgage and unsecured lending as Tayfun mentioned in his operating comments. And Lars do you want to add any colors.","Tayfun Tuzun","We will be finalizing this outlook obviously before in January and I don\u2019t take this as guidance for 2017, but the trends that Greg mentioned is fairly high intact [ph].","Lars Anderson","Yeah, I would just emphasis again this has been a very deliberate plan of balance sheet management and to ensure that we are optimizing our capital and our liquidity from a corporate perspective and is an alignment with our relationship banking strategy. And I would tell you one of the complements to this is, as we build out businesses such as the verticals where we are delivering specialized industry expertise, it is also helping to speed our capital markets business and drive that at rates that are far beyond the expansion of what has been pretty much a flat industry. We may be growing our capital markets in the 14%, 15% rate.","Tayfun Tuzun","And the other color I want to make Erika is, away from the commercial portfolio, our decision to take down auto loan originations at the start of this year had an impact clearly on total loan growth on an average to average basis compared to last year\u2019s third quarter, our auto loan portfolio balances are down $1.3 billion. So making those adjustments and focusing on capital returns and other balance sheet target. Actually we are quite pleased with where we are with respect to where our balance sheet is today.","Erika Najarian","Got it and my follow up question is, I thought you made a very important point on the defensiveness of your securities yield. Could you explain further what exactly it means to have, I'm talking about 48% of your investment portfolio and lockout or bullet securities as we think about in a static environment for the yield curve, why that's not going to pressure the yields further?","Gregory Carmichael","Thanks for that question and I'm going to ask Jamie to provide some details. We have seen some write-offs during the quarter that clearly had a different tone and what we are seeing. So, it's important for us to provide you more details about our thoughts here. Jamie?","James Leonard","Yeah, what's important about it is, Erika, and one of the changes we actually made in the disclosure this quarter was that when you have 48% of the portfolio or last quarter's 51%, we actually updated that disclosure to reflect the 24-month time horizon where is prior times we've discussed it. We just looked at it 12 months, but obviously this is a big focus item for all of the analysts and investors just given the outperformance in the yield and the point and then updating the disclosure was the same in the next 24 months about half our portfolio, we will not have cash flows return to us and we've talked every quarter about whether we were or not going to reinvest cash flows out of the portfolio. In the third quarter we didn't like the entry points we were seeing and so we didn't reinvest over half of the cash flows from the portfolio, but the total level of cash flow that come off the portfolio are a pretty low level as a percent of our book relative to our peers and that's really where you can dig in and see when folks are invested in pass-through securities, you have extension risk and you have prepayment risk in the bullet and locked out cash flow play that we've been running for over two years and talking to you about that really benefits in the environment that we're seeing today and that's why we're very pleased with how we're positioned. We're obviously over a long-term time horizon going to be subject to market yields and next year that will be about a two basis point NIM impact if rates were to stay where they were today. But overall this is just not a big risk for the third given how we've positioned the portfolio.","Gregory Carmichael","Yeah, we've seen it in the third quarter with respect to how this discount accretion played against free amortization that was deliberately done. We positioned the portfolio for potentially higher prepayment. So, I think all in all we\u2019re pretty pleased with where the portfolio stands.","Erika Najarian","Thank you. That was a clear explanation. I appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Marinac with FIG Partners. Your line is open.","Christopher Marinac","Thanks. Good morning all. I want to delve into the GreenSky relationship that I was curious. We will see bounces in the fourth quarter from that and also how many quarters in the future until the technology is beginning to be implemented system wide?","Gregory Carmichael","Chris, we\u2019re onboarding on assets as we speak and we're very pleased with the initial pathways that we're in right now. The average cycle of boring [ph] right now is about 750. So, we are onboarding assets as we speak. We\u2019ve targeted roughly $90 million to $100 million a quarter. It\u2019s what our forward-looking expectations are for - as a generation of Green Sky. On the technology front, we're going to focus on two phases. First phase is our digital adoption, deploying our digital channels or mobile web-based applications that will start to roll out second quarter next year is what was targeted for right now and then after that we\u2019ll focus on the branch adoption of the technology, which will probably be at 2017, early 2018.","Christopher Marinac","It sounds great, Greg. Thank you.","Gregory Carmichael","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Matt Burnell","Thanks for taking my questions. Let me start by asking a question on the margin and I know you haven't spent a lot of time talking about 2017. But if we were to get a 25-basis point hike in late December, I presume that doesn't have much effect on the December - sorry on the fourth quarter margin. But last year the margin was up about six basis points from the fourth quarter - sorry for the first quarter \u201816 after the hike in the fourth quarter. And I'm curious if your positioning is similar to that now where you might expect a roughly similar benefit from a 25-basis point hike. And then if that occurs, what you're thinking about margin through the course of the year since this year the margins sort of worked its way back down after the initial benefit in the first quarter?","James Leonard","Yeah, Matt, this is Jamie. I\u2019ll take that one. The benefit to us if the Fed were to move in the second week of December, it\u2019s about one basis point to margin benefit and that's what we saw in the fourth quarter of \u201805 with that move. When you dice that, the margin transition from 4Q \u201815 to 1Q \u201816 we were up six bps, eight of that actually was driven by the Fed move. So, our view on December 2016 move, if it were to happen, it's probably going to be slightly less beneficial than the eight basis points that we saw last year just given the deposit rates maybe a little more competitive on the second move in each prospective move. So I think on the high side it would be eight and then we're looking at this more in the six range. But, yes, it would - we\u2019re positioned that it would be very beneficial to us. And then as Tayfun said, part of the change that occurred from Q4 \u201815 to where we are today on the margin was in a large part driven by the $3.7 billion of debt maturities we had this year and now - next year we\u2019re at a $1.2 billion level of maturities. That was really the biggest influence on the margin compression this year that that obviously would not repeat and therefore you would expect some stability to growth in them going forward if that were to be raising rates.","Matt Burnell","Okay. That's helpful. And then for my follow-up, let me ask about deposit growth. It seems relative to others who have reported so far this quarter that your deposit growth even adjusting for the sale is really typically flattish. Many other banks have almost been complaining about the level of deposit growth relative to loan growth. How much of your client optimization activities have been - have affected deposit growth and what other trends are you seeing in deposit growth that you think might improve over the next couple of quarters?","Tayfun Tuzun","I think you have to look at that picture from two sides. One is commercial. The other one is consumer. And on the consumer side, I think we expect to continue to grow the consumer book at healthy levels. On the commercial side, almost the entire decline has been on deliberate customer actions. And those are unlikely to repeat at that level and given our plans in the treasury management business and the expansion of our relationships, we would expect to get back on a growth pattern in commercials.","Matt Burnell","Thank you, Tayfun.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Matt O'Connor","Good morning.","Gregory Carmichael","Good morning.","Matt O'Connor","Can you talk a bit about the underlying expense growth if we think about exiting this year into next? Obviously 2016 was a big year on the technology, the compliance spend, has that peaked? And some of the puts and takes and any comments on the overall expense growth as you think about next year?","Gregory Carmichael ","I\u2019ll make a few comments and I'll turn it to Tayfun. First off, we are fully committed and we expect to have positive operating leverage as we go into 2017, so that's number one objective. We\u2019ll continue to stay focused on expenses. As I mentioned in prior discussions on our technology investment, the high watermark will be 2016. So, we expect our technology investments to subside as we go into 2017 and 2018, not at the current levels we are seeing today 2016, so we expect that to improve. In addition to that a lot - as I mentioned before on Project North Star, as you think about Project North Star, the opportunity to benefit we get from Project North Star is expense improvement. We expect to see that start to impact our run rate in 2017, some of the actions that we've already taken and actions that we have planned going forward. So, Tayfun, if you want to pull the bucket on here [ph].","Tayfun Tuzun ","Yeah, it\u2019s a bit too early to provide more detailed outlook on \u201817, Matt. But we clearly are keeping a very close eye on compensation expenses and FD accounts. So, that is going to help us. And as you said many times here, over the last two, three quarters, or even going beyond that to late \u201815, we expected and we did achieve a peak on our recent compliance related headcounts and going forward that type of increase is unlikely to repeat itself. Some of these larger vendor contracts in 2017 will be hitting our expense line on a full year basis, which is going to be beneficial. There is going to be workspace management saves, some related to branch closings, some related to broader tactics and strategies that our team is executing there. So, there is a combination of factors that indicate to us that this expectation of positive operating leverage even in a static environment is achievable.","Matt O'Connor","And then now just separately a clarification question regarding next year, you had said, I think the NIM percent, was it going to be stable? If I may choose the NIM percent versus net interest income dollars stable in a flat rate environment and on what bases that half of it? If it\u2019s a NIM percent that half of 289 that you expect for this year?","Gregory Carmichael","Yeah, we\u2019re already basically going through the full year NIM and at this point, Matt, it\u2019s too early to give you an interim guidance for 2017.","Matt O'Connor","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Ken Usdin","Hey, guys, thanks very much. Your credit quality continues to be very good aside from the points you made about variability, I was just thinking the pretty sizable release this quarter and they still have upper 1,3 type of reserve ratio. With the move to also build the consumer going forward, you mentioned that provisioning would be in line with loan growth. Can you just help us think about just how much improvement you still see is underneath the surface and what would you be concerned about as far as any variability in other parts of the book?","Lars Anderson","Yeah, so I\u2019ll ask Frank to also join in and comment on the credit quality. Look, I think we have seen a very significant change in the underlying credit factors right. When you think about the decrease in NPLs, the decrease in criticized assets, those are meaningful, visible, and important changes and again results of some deliberate actions that we've taken over the past year or so. Beyond - obviously they all contributed to where we ended up with the results. But you have to keep in mind the reserve coverage only went down by 1 basis point and we've been watching our peer group over the last two, three quarters. We've seen more meaningful decreases in coverage from others and ours has been relatively stable. We're actually up compared to last year's third quarter. As we look forward clearly - if there is a significant change in the way the portfolio grows that we will reflect that in the provision as we said baring any significant environmental changes we would expect provision to move overall with loan growth and that probably is a statement that other have made. Frank, any color on sort of credit environment today?","Frank Forrest","Ken, and excuse me, I have laryngitis. The work we've done has really been deliberate over the last 18 months to reposition the portfolio. The result of that is we cut $0.5 billion less in criticized assets this quarter, big number, very meaningful. We've taken about a billion for off the leverage book in the last 12 months and that was the high risk piece of the leverage book. Our commodity exposure today in outstanding is $35 million. That\u2019s it. It\u2019s all we have left. We're essentially out of the coal business.","Our real estate exposure relative to our peers is much lower and it's underwritten primarily to national and large regional developers, we believe in a very, very prudent manner. And our energy book as we talked about before is 2% of our total book. We're looking at maybe $60 million to $80 million of losses in energy that's over the next eight to nine quarters.","So, we've taken very deliberate actions for the work we're doing and coordinated with Lars on the commercial side to reposition this balance sheet to ensure that as we move towards the next recession, we're far better done in control and a far better position to be very successful in managing credit through the cycle and so all of these things are, I think, are pretty self-evident today. Our non-accrual loans, again we've talked about before continue to come down quarter after quarter. We'll see some lumpiness like everybody does. But for the most, our outlook is very positive for 2017 relative the credit based on all the different things and the actions we've taken very deliberately with a lot of discipline in the last 18 months.","Ken Usdin","Great, thanks for that color. And so, as a follow-up to that point, you've gone to the - it seems like more to the end of kind of cleaning up the book, cleaning out the book, and so as you pivot to future loan growth, obviously a couple of things where you are clearly talking about on the consumer side, but where do you expect to then be looking to grow, I should say, on the commercial side aside from what the environment will give us, is to change this philosophy in terms of like how fast you want to be growing in other parts of commercial and where do you see the commercial side growth coming from?","Lars Anderson","Yeah, so first of all, I think, Ken, you\u2019ve touched on a good point. I mean part of it's going to be driven by the overall economic environment and that's why we guide towards GDP. But as we continue to build out our industry verticals, those are continuing to provide nice lift for us, as well as drive excellent fee income and frankly attractive returns for our shareholders. We're going to continue to focus on that. We're going to continue to build that industry expertise, but I would tell you in some of our core middle market regions, we've seen nice growth in North Carolina, Chicago, throughout the Europe, South Florida, Cincinnati, so we're going to continue to focus on execution, improving that client experience, investing in new industry verticals, and frankly growing what is a very healthy commercial real estate portfolio where we've really seen some nicely improved attractive asset quality metrics under a underwriting structure that is much different from the last cycle centralized in an expert line of business both on the line and with risk partners.","Gregory Carmichael","Ken, the only other thing I would add to the Lars\u2019 comments, if you exclude the deliberate exits, we would have grown the commercial book 6% to 7% in 2016. So, it gives you some perspective of just how much lift we've done to reposition a book about quality and profitability. These guys have done a fantastic job.","Ken Usdin","Helpful, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is open.","John Pancari","Good morning.","Gregory Carmichael","Good morning, John.","John Pancari","Regarding the North Star initiatives, I just want to try to get a little bit more detail there. I know you just said that the amount of cost saves is about a third of the overall benefit that you expect out of the program. So, of that cost save component, can you give us an idea of the timing of the recognition as you move through \u201817 and then \u201818? I'm just trying to get an idea how we could really start to put that to numbers. And then separately around the revenue enhancement side, assuming obviously that\u2019s the rest of the savings that two-thirds, what type of revenue enhancement are you looking for? Thanks.","Lars Anderson","Yeah. So, in terms of - the way we look at project North Start to give you a very broad picture, the qualification of the improvements in returns translates to a roughly $800 million type pretax income improvement between now and 2019. So, the way we think about it is there is a base performance uplift from the businesses that we have and in a base-case scenario probably roughly divided, let's call it a $300 million to $400 million. We can do that by managing the expenses and then growing the revenues that are already in place. And then we look at some of the balance sheet optimization targets that we are establishing. That probably, I don't know, it\u2019s called itself in the [ph] $100 million to $150 million range and then roughly another $150 million to $200 million in fee income growth. So, that leaves somewhere around $150 million or so in expenses. These are broad numbers. We will share more details with you.","The timing of the expense saves will start coming in 2017. Some of them are already in play. You probably see the major restructuring and I think it will accelerate into 2018 and 2019. Some of the projects, underlying expensive projects relate to the commercial business and to redesign that project is picking up. It's going to have somewhat of a delayed impact, but again we would see probably a more meaningful save in 2018. And then there are other infrastructure investments that we're making. But that doesn't mean \u201817 does not have any of those. I think there are some expense initiatives in play that also will contribute to \u201817 and those are the types of details that we would like to share with you as we approach the year end and the beginning of the New Year [ph].","John Pancari","Okay good and then I know you gave the ROTCE expectations and ROA expectation. Have you given what this all means in terms of the efficiency ratio for North Star?","Jamie Leonard","Our target for North Star John is sub 60 by the end of 2019 run rate.","John Pancari","Okay all right and then secondly on just a quick here on the credit side do you have your shared national credit balance as of September 30,I believe it was around $26 billion or so last quarter.","Jamie Leonard","It is right around $26 billion, that\u2019s correct.","John Pancari","Okay, so unchanged.","Jamie Leonard","Yeah, unchanged.","John Pancari","And then the leverage loans, do you have that quantification?","Tayfun Tuzun","We haven\u2019t given out that probably and I don\u2019t I think it is a little bit of misleading at this point given there is no single definition of market [ph] for us.","Greg Carmichael","I would tell you that we have, continue to reposition that portfolio so that we position ourselves to outperform through more challenging economic times. We have been very specific and deliberate there so we are in a better position today.","John Pancari","And you are talking about the leverage portfolio, correct?","Greg Carmichael","Leverage portfolio.","John Pancari","Okay and has there been any pressure to slow the growth initiative for the [ph] credit portfolio?","Tayfun Tuzun","Well, what we are really focused on is buying relationship and building those out to the extent that we leverage the shared national credit market, that\u2019s more kind of just symptomatic, it is not an end for us, we are not focused on growing snick [ph] what we are focused on is growing industry expertise core middle market where we believe that we can add value, develop deep client relationships that fit within our risk appetite and provide attractive returns.","Greg Carmichael","Let me add a little bit to that, if you look at the snick portfolio again which is $26 billion or about 49% of our total commercial book, its investment grade quality. If you exclude the inter GPs of snick for a moment we have very little lose in that. Our criticized asset levels 3.75% [ph] on the entire snick, but it\u2019s primarily an investment grade portfolio. Three quarters of that portfolio is as large as really deep relationships about a quarter is credit only and a lot of those are fairly new relationship to over building a relationship on, so this is not a standalone portfolio credit only book that we are buying jut to grow a portfolio. It is tied deeply into our strategy of dealing with relationships with top clients and I will tell you in many of our snick relationships we have a very meaningful piece of the fact that number of banks there is a syndicated facility [ph]. So we feel very good about it and I don\u2019t think at the end of the day all exceed 50% of our total book over time but we don\u2019t necessarily have a problem with where it is relative to the performance that has given us and the fact that it is built in to our core strategy of deepening our industry vertical in our lid cap relationship.","John Pancari","Okay great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill & Partners. Your line is open.","Scott Siefers","Good morning guys.","Greg Carmichael","Good morning Scott.","Scott Siefers","I think at this point most of my questions have been answered but maybe Tayfun or Jamie just sort of take that question the base of running assets. So your end of period versus your average I think the end of period base is a couple of trillion dollars higher. Can you just go through sort of nuance of what happens with the base of running assets in the fourth quarter, just trying to get a sense for movement within the balance sheet.","Jamie Leonard","Scott are you looking at end of period interest earning assets?","Scott Siefers","Yeah exactly, which I think are about $2 billion to $2.5 billion higher than the average base.","Jamie Leonard","Yeah, because in that you do have the $1.2 billion mark on the investment portfolio in the end of period and then you also will have a run up in some of the cash balances and then in our NIM guidance and our guidance for the fourth quarter we typically see a run up in those cash levels as we do expect strong deposit growth and so our short term overnight investments might have a little bit of a load there, but nothing that\u2019s - we are not expecting anything that\u2019s unreasonable to what it occurred last year.","Tayfun Tuzun","If you look at Page 29 of the earnings release table on the just loan side you don\u2019t see that [indiscernible].","Scott Siefers","Okay, just the average just as kind of the [indiscernible] the best think to kind of go off nothing unusual at the end of period?","Tayfun Tuzun","There is nothing unusual.","Jamie Leonard","We haven\u2019t talked about it but I think part of what your question headed is just on the investment portfolio we will reinvest portfolio cash flows in the fourth quarter and that should result in average security portfolio being stable the third quarter level so, don\u2019t expect a lot of movement from the investment security both in the quarter.","Scott Siefers","Okay, all right, that\u2019s perfect. Thank you for the clarification.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA, your line is open.","Mike Mayo","Hi I was looking for more color on project North Star, I didn\u2019t completely understand that base performance up lifts, you are looking for $800 million in additional pretax and it looks like about equal amount balance sheet optimization fees and expenses and that base performance uplift is what and just more generally how do you think about expenses over the next to get to that 12% to 14% RTCE, the expenses stay flat or they go up a little bit or down or what?","Jamie Leonard","Based on the performance on the expense side is pretty flat Mike. I mean in terms of if you check out initiatives I think we probably will be lot more stability in the expenses and in terms of the expenses related to these initiatives and number of them are truly sort of well I guess more changes and investments that truly are going to lift revenue fairly quickly. So our goal clearly is to fund those expense initiatives, to fund those revenue initiatives with expenses elsewhere so, that\u2019s the only way we will be able to get to sub 60% efficiency level so we are not necessarily looking to have added investment cost to achieve revenue growth but actually achieve based expenses to fund those initiatives.","Mike Mayo","So flat expenses from 2016 to 2019 is that the concept?","Jamie Leonard","Mike just be patient with us as we finalize the details we will share more of it towards the end of the year or early next year.","Mike Mayo","Okay and just a big picture question and you have 1191 branches now and you have been passed out of the Greg and reduced those branches, you have more to go and also your mobile banking that is big percent, 20% consumer deposits for mobile apps that I guess that is better than some big banks. What is the right number of branches as digital delivery catches hold I mean if you look out over the some three to four year period where could that number go?","Greg Carmichael","Mike it is a great question and I don\u2019t know the answer, it really gets down, we looked it over 50 variables that we mentioned before when decided to close or consolidate branch. So it is really is driven by the consumer preferences and you\u2019re seeing that migration and adoption to our mobile apps on our digital capabilities, I think 40% plus of all of our checks are now coming digital channels, 20% through mobile, so that\u2019s going to pace us, could it be another 10% plus, absolutely. So we are going to look at this every single year, we\u2019ll continue to test against it, probably get through the lenses, 50 different variable we assess and we will continue to make adjustments to our branch infrastructure. Obviously that helps us fund some of our investments in digital or [indiscernible], so we are looking for that transformational cost also as we reduce our branch infrastructure, but more to come there as far as the pacing the numbers I am not comfortable giving you a number. ","Mike Mayo","All right, thank you.","Greg Carmichael","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Elliott","Hello, thank you for taking the question. If I look at slide 10, I can see that the capital ratios have continued to build up even with the pretty significant repurchase you got. So I was wondering given the changes we have been hearing from the Fed on how the [indiscernible] process is going to work, how they're going to look at different sorts of capital return, whether it's buyback or dividend, how does that influence your thinking on the role that increased capital return could play in getting you to that 12% to 14% ROTCE?","Tayfun Tuzun","So, our thoughts around capital returns really don't incorporate a significantly different capital base than what we have today. So, we're not counting on our ability to leverage the balance sheet more so than what we are doing today. Clearly, we are cognizant of the communication coming down from the regulators in terms of the design of the regime that they're expecting over the next, a number of years. It's a little too early exactly how that will play an impact on our business. We are mildly positive. But in our financial projections, we are foreseeing a stable capital picture, give-or-take a quarter from where we are today. So, it is not meaningfully contributed to the return expectations that we have.","Geoffrey Elliott","And then if I could just clarify on something you were saying earlier, I thought I caught a number of 1.3 or maybe 1.4 billion decline in leverage loans, but then I also heard you say you didn't disclose the leverage loan balances. So, maybe you could just kind of tie those two comments together?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yeah, I think, Lars and then Greg have commented on the drop. We - the definition of leverage loans, of course, today is not quite uniform. So, it's a meaningful drop. Let me stay it that way. It's a meaningful drop from our leverage loan book. And I doubt that our leverage loan book is significantly different from peers. Frank, I don't know, if you want to - or Lars, if you want to comment on that?","Frank Forrest","The thing to focus on with leverage lending at least from our perspective, there is all types of companies that are leveraged. That\u2019s where we've had injuries and where most of our peers, I think, have had issues. They\u2019ve been over reliance on enterprise value lending, financing M&A transactions and deals went sideways. And when they went sideways, the problem is the loss and the default [ph] is very high. That's our prior experience. And as a result of that, we've been very judicious and going through as Lars has talked about and looking at all of our client relationships, looking at our sponsor relationships, looking at the types of credits that we would finance, and our leverage environment, industries that we should consider and industries, probably cyclical industries for example, we probably shouldn't consider finance in a leverage environment.","So, we talk about 1.4 billion reclassifying or leaving the books. It's the highest risk piece that we've focused on which are enterprise value deals, highly leveraged deals, clients who don't fit our risk profile and leverage that's outside of our comfort zone. And those are the credits that we\u2019re moving out. So, whether it's 10% or 20% to me it's a more meaningful number than that, because we're taking the highest risk slice of the portfolio and that\u2019s leaving the books. And what remains of portfolio that we think is performing very well. We have clients that we know well. We respect well. We have a great history with them through cycles and they have the ability to manage their leverage, because they\u2019ve proven it over time and it's the right kind of leverage in an industry that is much more stable versus much more cyclical. So, I think we know this space well. We\u2019re repositioning ourselves in a place where we can continue to be delivering leverage finance to the right clients, right relationships, the right returns with a lot less volatility than what we've had in the past.","Geoffrey Elliott","Great, thank you.","Lars Anderson","Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Vivek Juneja","Hi, a couple of questions. Tayfun, I think I heard you say that or maybe it was Greg about balance sheet optimization as part of project North Star and you've talked about reducing your single product relationship. So, how much more run-off should we expect from commercial loans as part of that?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yeah. So, it is a core part of North Star as we look in particular as a commercial bank. It will be difficult to tell the exact number as we look out over the next three years. I would maybe give you a little guidance that all things being equal in the economic environment, as Greg had said, we've done a lot of the heavy lifting this past year around $2 billion. I could see another billion dollars of balance sheet optimization, but frankly that's going to be over a period of time and we're going to be reinvesting that capital in relationships that provide the right kinds of return and right risk profile for our company on a go forward basis.","Vivek Juneja","Okay. And given then intense competition for C&I loans, you\u2019re confident of being able to get some higher spread, because obviously competition hasn\u2019t awaited given the loan growth we are seeing in the industry?","Gregory Carmichael","Yeah, to that point, I mean, I think Lars and team have done a fantastic job and we have four quarters in a row. We've seen our yields improve in C&I lending. So, once again a testament to the work they've done to reposition the balance sheet and the relationships and, Lars, if you want to add any?","Lars Anderson","Well, I would just kind of go back to the prior question. This is about balance sheet management. This is about prudently using our capital and reinvesting it in the right kinds of relationships. And it's not just about credit, it's about the entire relationships. It's about the solutions in developing deep strategic advisory type relationships and we're seeing that happen and play out on a go-forward basis. So, I would just underscore as I look across almost every business line that we have in the commercial bank, we've either stabilized or slightly increased and in some cases moderately increased our core loan spreads, which has allowed our company really to benefit from a large part of the rise that we've seen in LIBOR or in some institutions you've seen some of that absorbed away within our spreads. Let me tell you something. The market is no easier today from a competitive environment perspective than it was several quarters ago. In fact, I would submit that it is more aggressive today. Smaller banks are going up market. Larger banks are going down market and non-banks are playing at levels we haven't seen before. So, we're going to have to be at our best. So, frankly we've got great bankers with great businesses. I've got a lot of confidence in them that we can continue not just for bulk orders, but for the long-term to produce.","Vivek Juneja","And with this asset-based lending fit into that, has that been as part of your growth in this?","Lars Anderson","Yeah, that's a great question. So, asset-based lending, as you know, we would not include in the leverage lending portfolio. But it\u2019s something that\u2019s very attractive. When we are out with the client, we want to be very active in providing a broad range of solutions including credit solutions. ABL has not been a growth area of this company. We have a new leader. We have a new team in a number of our producers and we have new alignments both on the line and in credit and we see it as a significant area of growth for us on a go-forward basis. One of the benefits of that is it's a very relationship-centric type extension of credit with treasury management and other products and services and it also tends to outperform when the cycle turns, which is complimentary to what Greg shared with us as the vision for our company.","Vivek Juneja","Thank you. Tayfun, if I may, just one quick one. Tax rate, very low for fourth quarter, is that a sustainable longer term rate and if so, what are you doing to get that much loss you\u2019ve seen of [ph] any of our banks?","Tayfun Tuzun","So, I think we commented that there was a positive tax impact from a couple of lease terminations here this quarter. Look, in terms of the tax as a combination of the fact that we are using a different accounting for our low income housing investments and leasing business really is contributing as well. I gave you some guidance for the next quarter and beyond that I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s any other color on the tax rate. ","Vivek Juneja","Yeah, my thought was, is the next quarter\u2019s tax rates sustainable level going forward or is that just good to be in an unusually low level for that quarter?","Tayfun Tuzun","Let\u2019s talk about next year - when we give the guidance for next year Vivek. The 23.5 to 24.5 for the next quarter right now is the only comment that I\u2019ll make.","Vivek Juneja","Okay, all right. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray Your line is open.","Kevin Barker","Good morning, could you just expand upon some of the declines that you\u2019re seeing in your auto loan balances. I know you\u2019re re-pricing your yields on that, but are you moving into a more riskier credit or a less riskier credit, given that the yields are moving higher in that portfolio?","Lars Anderson","That is more about our approach heading into the year to trend back production in some of the lower spread, lower yielding asset classes. So for us last year we originated close to 5 billion, this year our expectation is, we\u2019d be in the $3.4 billion range in terms of auto originations. But the credit profile this year - the average FICO was 746 year-to-date where 56% used, 45% new and that\u2019s consistent with \u201815 levels, so it was 69 month average term and obviously the rations are much shorter than that and advance rate LTB is in the 91% range this year. So it\u2019s pretty much the same old [ph] that we\u2019ve had versus prior years. It\u2019s more a function of trimming volume and focusing on getting better pricing.","Kevin Barker","So when you refer to better risk adjusted pricing, you\u2019re just saying it\u2019s not worth it to take market share in this type of market, is that fair?","Lars Anderson","Absolutely right.","Kevin Barker","Okay and then are you seeing the competitive pressures being stronger in the higher FICO scores or in the lower FICO scores?","Lars Anderson","I think the competitive pressures are about the same, I mean everybody is sort of focusing on this broad spectrum of origination and some even lower FICO bans than we are.","Kevin Barker","Okay, thank you for taking my questions.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.","Sameer Shripad Gokhale","Okay, thank you Shelby and thank you all for your interest in Fifth Third Bank.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Sameer Gokhale, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin.","Sameer Gokhale","Thank you, Adam, and good morning and thank you for joining us. Today, we'll be discussing our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2017. This discussion may contain certain forward-looking statements about Fifth Third pertaining to our financial condition, results of operations, plans and objectives. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from historical performance and these statements.","We've identified some of these factors in our forward-looking cautionary statement at the end of our earnings release and in other materials. And we encourage you to review them. Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call. Additionally, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures we reference during today's conference call are included in our earnings release along with other information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures.","A copy of our most recent quarterly earnings release can be accessed by the public in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website, www.53.com. This morning, I'm joined on the call by our President and CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Chief Operating Officer, Lars Anderson; Chief Risk Officer, Frank Forrest; and our Treasurer, Jamie Leonard. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Tayfun, we will open the call up for questions.","Let me turn the call over now to Greg for his comments.","Greg Carmichael","Thanks, Sameer, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. As you'll see in our results, we reported full year 2017 net income of $2.2 billion and EPS of $2.83. Our results reflect the hard work of our employees, the support of our North Star initiatives. In 2017, we again took a number of significant steps to improve profitability and better position us for success. We will discuss the economic environment in our fourth quarter results. I would like to take a few moments to review some of the key accomplishments during the year.","First, we continued to optimize and strengthen the balance sheet. We exited approximately $1.5 million in C&I loans that did not meet our targeted risk or return profile and this helped drive a significant improvement in our credit metrics. This fold [ph] the exit of $3.5 billion in C&I loans in 2016. As I mentioned before, we have now completed this process. We also continue to reduce our indirect auto exposure. This reflects our decision over two years ago to curtail originations to improve returns while mitigating credit risk. We have succeeded in improving returns in this business and plan to gradually increase our production volumes in 2018.","These decisions highlight our commitment to building a franchise that performs well with the various business cycles. During the year, we re-launched our brand campaign through print, television, radio, and digital advertising. As we share with you this number, the re-launch was very well received and continues to strengthen our brand in the marketplace. We continue to focus on improving the customer experience by advancing our digital first, customer centric agenda and have made significant progress through several of our North Star initiatives.","We launched our innovation center and just recently introduced an app called Momentum that helps millennials tackle student debt. As you know, student debt is an issue for many millennials. Since we launched Momentum in September of last year, we have had over 40,000 customers download the app. We also replaced our branch teller software platform. The new platform helps to mitigate compliance and operational risk through automation and improves the efficiency and speed of transaction processing.","Our new mortgage loan origination system was launched across all channels in 2017. Although there is more work to be done, this initial will generate both NII as well as fee income opportunities by reducing our cost of originating mortgages. This business remains very important to Fifth Third as an anchor product and a proven tool to acquire households.","We are leveraging analytics to drive both an improved client experience and to enhance our own capabilities. We unveiled several innovative solutions this year, including the rollout of a digital real-time financial risk and equity management platform for our commercial customers. This platform significantly improves the information our customers have access to in a convenient digital format. We implemented advanced propriety data analytics to help in further optimizing our branch network. And we significantly enhanced our use of data analytics and improved the way we market to our customers.","Our continued focus on customer service and creating more durable relationships has a recognizing number of third-party customer surveys. We are rated as one of the best brands in commercial middle market banking, and number one among our peers in relationship manager, product knowledge for Greenwich Associates.","Expenses continue to be well-managed. Excluding [indiscernible] tax reform, full-year expenses were flat year-over-year. We achieved this while investing heavily in key initiatives in the project North Star. We expect to generate further efficiencies in 2018 as we continue to implement our North Star initiatives.","In 2017, we increased the pace in which we delivered better price and services through our buy partner build philosophy. We completed several acquisitions and strategic partnerships this year, including the acquisition of Epic Insurance and Integrity HR and R.G. McGraw Insurance which allowed us to continue to develop our insurance capabilities.","Our strategic partnership and equity investment in NRT and Sightline expand our product offerings within our entertainment, largely in leisure vertical. We are the first bank to join Mastercard's B2B Hub. This Hub provides an end-to-end automated platform that converts payable processes traditionally done by paper into an electronic transaction.","Our CRA rating was upgraded outstanding, reflecting our commitment to improving the lives of our customers and wellbeing of the communities we serve. We received top rankings in several employee satisfaction surveys, including the Gallup Great Workplace Award for the fourth year in a row. Our employees are responsible for recommending our strategies, and we believe that a highly engaged workforce will help us to achieve our strategic and financial objectives. We hosted our inaugural Investor Day in December. Our senior leadership team laid out a detailed roadmap of our strategic parties, how our operations are designed to facilitate our one bank approach, and how we are leveraging technology in order to improve the customer experience.","The strength of our balance sheet and earnings allows to raise our quarterly dividend by $0.02 to $0.16 per share in the third quarter of 2017 and we returned over $2 billion of capital to shareholders during the full-year of 2017. As a remainder, we have Fed approval to increase our dividend and additional $0.02 in the second quarter of 2018, waiting for approval.","Before discussing our fourth quarter results, I want to take a moment to discuss the new tax legislation. There was a uncertainty for much of the fourth quarter as borrowers await to more clarity. We believe new tax law will help energize the economy and further accelerate growth in our businesses. We are optimistic that we will retain most of the run rate benefits of lower taxes with a super pan on the competitive dynamics. At year-end, I was also excited to distribute a portion of the benefits from tax reform to our employees in our charitable foundation.","Moving to the fourth quarter results, we reported net income of $509 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.67. Some non-core items, including additional benefits from the new tax legislation, resulted in a positive $0.15 impact to reported earnings per share in the quarter. Tayfun will provide further details about these items in his opening comments.","Despite the impact of delivered commercial exits as well as a continued decline in indirect auto loan balances, our total average loan portfolio was flat sequentially. Our adjusted net interest margin expanded three basis points sequentially. This improvement primarily reflected higher yields on our investment portfolio as well as a good mix of consumer loans with higher yields.","Excluding the impact of non-core items mentioned in our earnings release, expenses were flat compared to the third quarter 2017, as we continue to focus on managing our expenses diligently. Credit quality remains stable, criticized assets were at the lowest levels in nearly 12 years, while non-performing assets continue to decrease, marking the lowest our NPA ratio has been in over 11 years. Fee income was up 3% sequentially. Adjusted for renewable items mentioned in the earnings release as we had discussed at our Investor Day, we believe fee growth should accelerate as our North Star initiatives are fully implemented and as we pursue additional strategic acquisitions and partnerships.","Our capital liquidity levels remain very strong with our common equity Tier 1 ratio at 10.6%, while our LCR exceeded regulatory requirements by nearly 30%. I would like to once again thank all of our employees for their hard work and dedication as evident in our financial results and our customer satisfaction scores, and our community outreach efforts. I was pleased that we were able to deliver strong financial results in our North Star initiatives, and remain on track.","With that, I'll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our fourth quarter results and our current outlook.","Tayfun Tuzun","Thanks, Greg. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Let's start with the financial summary on slide 4 of the presentation. As Greg mentioned, during the quarter, our underlying NIM expansion, continued focus on disciplined expense control, stable credit quality and efficient capital management reflected our commitment to driving improved financial performance and shareholder returns. Reported results were significantly impacted by the items noted on page 1 of our release, including a number of items primarily resulting from the recently passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.","The largest item was a $220 million income tax benefit resulting from the re-measurement of our deferred tax liabilities. The detailed benefit was partially offset by a $68 million impairment related to affordable housing investments in the fourth quarter. We also recognized a $27 million reduction to interest income related to the re-measurement of our leverage lease portfolio.","Lastly, we recognized $30 million in one-time discretionary expenses related to employee bonuses and charitable contributions in response to the passage of the tax act. In addition to the items associated with the new tax law, our reported results were impacted by a couple of other items. As we discussed during the last quarter's earnings call, this quarter's taxes reflected additional tax expense of $20 million related to our gain from the Vantiv sale in the third quarter.","Our fourth quarter results also reflected an $11 million reduction to non-interest income associated with the Visa swap. Adjusting for the non-core items disclosed today and in our prior periods, on a sequential, year-over-year, and full year basis, our ROA, ROTCE increased, our efficiency ratio improved, net interest margin expanded, expenses remained relatively flat, and our credit metrics also improved.","We achieved our objective of delivering positive operating leverage, while lowering the risk profile of our company and increasing regulatory capital levels from last year. Relative to last year's fourth quarter, our adjusted net interest margin was up 19 basis points, adjusted NII was up 7%, non-interest expenses were flat, total charge-offs remained stable, NPAs were down 34%, and the criticized asset ratio declined 70 basis points.","These positive results were accompanied by a 22 basis point increase in our common equity tier I ratio and 8% reduction in shares outstanding. Although some of our balance sheet decisions had a negative impact on loan growth in 2017, the benefits of our strategic actions are apparent in our financial results. And we expect them to continue to have a positive impact on shareholder returns going forward.","Moving to slide 5, the environment continues to be challenging for commercial loan growth. Despite the wait and see approach that many clients took during the fourth quarter while the tax bill was being debated, we generated the highest commercial origination volume since the second quarter of 2015. Although our loan production was strong, net loan growth was muted as payoffs also remained elevated. As the tax legislation is now final, companies have begun to adjust their capital investment plans.","We are optimistic that increased spending will drive higher loan demand. Average total loans were flat sequentially. Growth in C&I, commercial real estate, residential mortgage, credit card, and other consumer loans was mostly offset by a continued reduction in home equity and commercial lease balances, deliberate commercial exits and the planned decline in our indirect auto loan portfolio.","Average commercial loan balances were up approximately $150 million compared to the third quarter and were down 1% year-over-year, including the impact of our planned exits. Excluding the impact of these exits, average commercial loans were up 1% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. We continue to see strong middle market originations in our regions, especially in Florida, Indiana, North Carolina, Chicago, and Tennessee markets.","The sequential increase in average C&I balances along with 1% growth in commercial real estate loans was partially offset by a 1% decline in commercial leases. As we mentioned in December, given our focus on profitable relationship-oriented growth, we have halted originations in non-relationship based equipment leasing. We expect end-of-period commercial leases to decline $400 million to $500 million by the end of 2018.","Average growth in commercial real estate loans in the fourth quarter was mainly driven by drawdowns at the end of the third quarter as commercial construction balances were down 2% on an end-of-period basis. We continue to maintain a conservative risk profile in construction lending as we are in the later stages of the cycle. As of year-end, we have completed our balance sheet optimization initiatives, which has resulted in over $5 billion in deliberate loan exits since the first quarter of 2016.","This includes approximately $200 million of commercial exits in the fourth quarter of 2017. Growth patterns in 2018 and beyond will now reflect business as usual activity. Commercial loan production across the board has been strong. We remain competitive and are maintaining our focus on profitable relationships, particularly in our middle market lending business, which is a focus area in 2018 and beyond.","We recently expanded our middle market lending footprint to California and are in the process of evaluating other geographies. This should provide future loan and revenue growth opportunities. Additionally, as we mentioned in December, we plan to launch two new verticals this year to augment C&I loan growth within our corporate lending portfolio. We currently expect our end of period total commercial total portfolio to grow about 1% from yearend in the first quarter and about 3% by the end of 2018, which includes the impact of the run off of our national leasing business.","In consumer, including the planned decline in the indirect auto loan portfolio, average loans were up 1% sequentially and down 1% year-over-year. Excluding auto, average consumer loans were up 3% year-over-year. Auto loans were down 10% year-over-year, reflecting the ongoing impact of our decision to curtail indirect originations and redeploying capital. Our pace of origination activity will continue to be correlated with risk adjusted returns in this business.","Given current spreads and returns on capital, we currently expect our total production to be closer to $4 billion and at the end of period auto portfolio declined approximately $500 million by end of 2018. Residential mortgage loans were flat sequentially and up 5% year-over-year as we continue to retain jumbo mortgages, ARMS as well certain 10- and 15-year fixed rate mortgages on our balance sheet during the quarter.","Our home equity loan origination volumes were 2% lower sequentially and up 2% year-over-year. As loan pay downs in our legacy continue to exceed origination volumes, our portfolio decreased 2% sequentially and 9% year-over-year. Our credit card portfolio increased 3% from the third quarter. Purchase active accounts were up both sequentially and year-over-year, reflecting stronger growth from new card rollouts at the end of 2016.","We continue to expect our new card offerings and our enhanced analytical capabilities to drive faster growth in 2018. While we expect balances to be flat sequentially in the first quarter reflecting seasonally higher pay downs, we currently expect card balance growth in the mid to high single-digits by the end of 2018. Other consumer loans increased 28% sequentially. Growth was driven by the personal lending portfolio primarily through loans generated from our GreenSky partnership.","We continue to expect personal lending balances to grow to $2 billion by the fourth quarter of 2019 from approximately 900 million at the end of 2017. Loan originations will remain focused on high quality prime customers with GreenSky providing first loss coverage as we have discussed before. Growth in personal loans should allow us to generate a higher ROE revenue stream and help us achieve a better balance between our commercial and consumer portfolios.","In the first quarter, we expect total end of period consumer loans to be stable relative to the fourth quarter. For 2018, we expect end of period loan growth of between 2% and 3%. Excluding indirect auto loan balances we expect consumer growth north of 4% driven by the initiatives we have previously discussed. Our investment portfolio balances remain relatively stable in the fourth quarter as we had expected. We expect to continue to maintain our investment portfolio at roughly the same level in the first quarter.","We had strong deposit performance in the fourth quarter. Average core deposits were up 2% sequentially. The sequential increase in commercial interest checking deposit and commercial demand deposit account balances was partially offset by lower consumer savings and commercial remarket account balances.","Typical of rising rate environments, deposit markets remain comparative. We continue to make rational decisions between pricing appropriately for profitability and maintaining and growing relationship based LCR friendly deposits. Despite the environmental pressures, we believe we have an opportunity to steadily grow the consumer book while accelerating growth in commercial deposits.","Our modified liquidity coverage ratio continue to be very strong at 129% at the end of the quarter. Taxable equivalent net interest income of $963 million was down $14 million from the previous quarter, primarily due to the leverage lease re-measurement triggered by the change in tax law. Excluding this item, adjusted NII was up $13 million or 1% from last quarter and up 7% compared to the adjusted NII from the fourth quarter of 2016. Our strong NII performance primarily reflects the positive impact of higher interest earning asset yields as well as the continued shift into higher yielding consumer loans.","The NIM adjusted for the same lease item increased three basis points from the third quarter to 3.1%, exceeding our previous guidance by five basis points. The sequential improvement was driven by improving investment portfolio and loan yields predominantly from our consumer categories. The NIM in the first quarter of 2018 should be approximately 3 to 5 basis points higher compared to the fourth quarter. We expect full year 2018 NIM in the 3.15% range, exceeding our December guidance including the impact of two rate hikes one in March and another one in September.","Absent any Fed moves in 2018, we would expect full year NIM to be consistent with the fourth quarter of 2017 at around 3.1%, five basis point impact of these two partial year moves approximate the full year impact of a 25 basis point move in the fed funds rate for us. Supporting this outlook, overall deposit pricing so far has remained relatively muted with cumulative betas since the first fed move at the end of 2015 in the low to mid-20% range on a blended basis.","Consumer has been in the mid teen range with commercial in the low-40s. The incremental blended data for the last move in December is in the high-20s and we project a beta in the 45% to 50% range for subsequent rate hikes. If we see betas at lower ranges, our margin could exceed our guidance. We expect our first quarter net interest income to be between $975 million and $980 million or down approximately 1% from fourth quarter's adjusted NII, which is largely driven by day count.","For 2018, we expect NII growth to be approximately 5% from the adjusted 2017 NII of between $4 billion and $4.07 billion, exceeding -- again exceeding our December guidance. Credit spreads continue to pressure margins across the banking sector, but the strategic actions we have taken during the last two years have led to a redeployment of capital away from lower returning loans and help us achieve a very good NII and NIM profile.","Excluding the impact of the Visa swap and Vantiv gains, non-interest income in the fourth quarter was $587 million compared to $571 million in the third quarter or up about 3% sequentially. The sequential increase was primarily due to the $44 million Vantiv TRA payment in the fourth quarter of 2017 and an increase in wealth and asset management revenue, partially offset by a decline in corporate banking due to the lease residual impairment and seasonally lower mortgage banking revenue.","Mortgage banking net revenue of $54 million was down $9 million sequentially. Origination fees were down $8 million sequentially, reflecting lower rate lock volumes and tighter spreads. Originations of $1.9 billion were 10% lower than the third quarter with a fourth quarter gain on sale margin of 206 basis points compared to 228 basis points in the third quarter.","During the quarter, 57% of our origination mix consisted of purchase volume. Approximately two-thirds of our originations continue to be sourced from the retail and direct channels and the remainder through the correspondent channel. Corporate banking fees of $77 million were down $24 million compared to the third quarter. The sequential decline was due entirely to a lease remarketing impairment which was previously disclosed at our Investor Day.","Excluding the impairment of $25 million, corporate banking revenue was up $1 million. Despite the continued challenging market environment, we grew FICC revenue 20% sequentially. We saw broad based growth with derivatives, commodities and institutional brokerage, all up from the last quarter and last year. FX revenues were also up 16% sequentially. This was offset by lower other capital markets revenue from deals that were pushed out from the fourth quarter to the first quarter of this year, primarily with an ECM and DCM.","We currently expect corporate banking fees to increase between 5% and 10% sequentially, excluding the lease remarketing impairment from this quarter, driven by an already solid pipeline that was augmented by deals pushed out from the fourth quarter of 2017. Deposit service charges remain unchanged from the third quarter. Card and processing revenue was up 1% sequentially, reflecting a seasonal increase in credit card spend volume and debit transactions, offset by higher rewards.","Total wealth and asset management revenue of $506 million was up 4% sequentially, reflecting the equity market improvement during the quarter. Recurring revenues in this business have increased to 83% of fees from the mid-70s last year. We plan to continue to shift our product and service offerings toward more recurring revenue streams to mimic our reliance on transactional activity. In the first quarter, we expect to record an approximately $415 million pre-tax step up again, given the recent close of Vantiv\u2019s acquisition of Worldpay. This gain is greater than previously expected and leaves us with an additional unrealized pretax gain of roughly $0.5 billion at current market prices. Given the post-acquisition name change, we will be referring to the company has Worldpay going forward.","As our ownership percentage of the new company will be approximate 4.9%, we will continue to benefit from utilizing the equity method of accounting going forward related to our ownership in a larger and now global company. For the first quarter of 2018, we expect fees to be between $560 million and $570 million excluding the Worldpay step up or down approximately 4% from our fourth quarter adjusted non-interest income shown in the release.","Recall that this comparison incorporates the impact of the TRA payment which was $44 million this quarter. Excluding the impact of the TRA, we expect core fee income growth of 4% in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter. For the full year of 2018, we expect fees to grow between 5% and 6% from adjusted 2017 levels and grow to approximately $2.4 billion. Implicit in this guidance is a $20 million of TRA related income in the fourth quarter of 2018 rather than the $44 million level in 2017.","Despite subdued client activity, we are optimistic about our fee growth trends given the investments that we are making to grow the scale and scope of our fee producing products and services. We remain focused disciplined expense management while continuing to invest for revenue growth. Reported non-interest expense increased 10% sequentially. Excluding the onetime items that were recorded in the aftermath of the tax law changes, expenses were flapped from the third quarter of 2017 against our October guidance of 1.5% growth.","Overall, expenses were well managed in 2017 and our focus on operational efficiencies along with our revenue growth led to positive operating leverage for the year. Our adjusted efficiency ratio for 2017 was under 62% in the fourth quarter and under 64% for the full year. Recall that the amortization of our low income housing investments is recognized in expenses, which most of our peers reflect in their tax line which adds approximately 2.5% to our efficiency ratio relative to our competitors.","We will focus on continuing to drive positive operating leverage while still making strategic investments that position us for long term out performance. We expect that strategic investments in technology will continue to differentiate us from our peers, while also supporting revenue growth and cost saving opportunities across our company. As we have evidenced over the course of 2017, we will continually scrutinize other areas to reduce run rate expenses in order to achieve our long term efficiency target of sub 60%.","We currently expect total expenses in 2018 to be between $4 billion and $4.1 billion. This guidance largely matches our guidance in December except for the impact of the minimum wage increase that we implemented and higher amortization on low income housing investments triggered by the change in tax law, which in total is about $30 million. Furthermore, our outlook also includes about $20 million in expenses associated with insurance acquisition that we closed late in the fourth quarter.","First quarter expenses are expected to be up about 9% from adjusted fourth quarter expenses, mostly related to annual seasonality associated with the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes. The quarterly expenses are expected to be coming down meaningfully from the first quarter levels every quarter as the year progresses.","Turning to credit result on slide nine, fourth quarter credit results followed the positive trend that we've seen all year as the charger offs remain at pre-crisis levels impacted by our strategic decision to focus on reducing volatility and charge offs. Net charge offs were $76 million or 33 basis points, up four basis points from the third quarter of 2017 and up two basis points from last year. Commercial charge offs were 22 basis points, up one basis point from the third quarter and two basis points year-over-year.","Consumer net charge offs of 51 basis points were seasonally up eight basis points sequentially and were up two basis points year-over-year. Total portfolio non-performing loans and leases were $437 million or down $69 million or 14% from the previous quarter and down 34% from last year. Our NPL ratio of 48 basis points was at a 10 plus year low.","Total C&I NPLs at were down 19% sequentially and 42% on a year-over-year basis. Nearly all loan categories showed a sequential improvement. At the end of the fourth quarter, the criticized asset ratio improved significantly from the previous quarter to 4.6% of commercial loans which will continue to strengthen our balance sheet and improve our performance in stressed environments.","Our loss provision was flat compared to the third quarter, reflecting among other factors improvement in criticized assets and non-performing loans, offset by an increase in net charge offs and higher period end loan portfolio balances. The reserve ratio declined one basis point to 1.3%. Our reserve coverage over NPLs has now increased in three consecutive quarters to 274% and is one of the highest among our peers.","While we remain in a relatively stable credit environment and the economic backdrop continues to support a continued benign credit outlook, we nevertheless caution you that we could potentially experience some upward pressure in the future. That being said, in light of our strength in balance sheet, we believe that our provision expense will be primarily reflective of loan growth and some normalizing of credit losses. Our capital levels remained very strong during the fourth quarter.","Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.6%, essentially flat quarter-over-quarter and up 22 basis points year-over-year despite the $273 million share buyback initiated during the quarter and a declaration of our $0.16 dividend. In 2017, we returned over $2 billion to common shareholders in the form of dividends and repurchase or 95% of earnings. Recall that we have another potential $0.02 dividend raise scheduled for June pending approval from our board. Our tangible common equity ratio, excluding unrealized gains and losses, increased five basis points sequentially and increased seven basis points year-over-year.","At the end of the fourth quarter common shares outstanding were down 12 million shares or 2% compared to the third quarter of 2017 and down 57 million shares or 8% compared to last year's fourth quarter. Book value and tangible book value were both up 9% from last year. Effective capital management is a very important component of our overall strategic approach. As we mentioned in December, we believe that the improved overall credit profile of our company has translated into an ability to operate our company at lower capital levels.","Our goal is to always be very prudent with the amount of capital that we keep on our balance sheet and aim to maximize the long term return on that capital through varying environments. Business environments change and we have to make sure that our balance sheet remains resilient. With the lessons learned from the financial crisis, we will remain focused on creating long term shareholder value.","With respect to taxes, our fourth quarter rate was impacted by the BTL re-measurement and other items disclosed in our release. These items grow the tax benefit for the fourth quarter. Excluding the BTL and the Vantiv tax recognition carryover from the third quarter, our tax rate was 25.5%. We expect our full year 2018 tax rate under the new legislative environment to be in the 15.5% to 16% range, which is impacted by the step up gain from the Vantiv Worldpay deal.","Excluding this onetime impact in 2018, we project our normal run rate to be between 14% and 14.5%. Our guidance in December based on the 20% marginal tax rate was 12.5% to 13.5%. With the 21% corporate tax rate, this outlook is very close to our previous guidance. Overall, our tax credits continue to impact our effective tax rates. As Greg mentioned, net of the increased compensation that he announced at year end in conjunction with the tax reform and the trigger change in our low income housing and acquisition, we expect most, if not all of the tax benefits to fall to the bottom line.","This should by definition increase our long term return targets. On a normalized run rate basis, a 12% to 12.5% reduction in our effective tax rate should have a positive impact of 1.5% to 2% on our North Star ROTCE targets. This moves the upper end of the ROTCE target to the 15.5% to 16% range for the fourth quarter 2019 and beyond and increases our ROI targets by approximately 15 basis points to a range of 1.35% to 1.45%. Our revenue growth outlook, our ability to achieve positive operating leverage without changing our risk appetite, our strong balance sheet and our strategic positioning give us confidence in our ability to create additional shareholder value.","With that, let me turn it over to Sameer to open the call up for Q&A.","Sameer Gokhale","Thanks, Tayfun. Before we start Q&A, as a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. We will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in our time we have this morning.","During the question-and-answer period, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator. Adam, please open the call up for question.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Gerard Cassidy. Gerard, your line is open.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you. Good morning, guys.","Greg Carmichael","Good morning.","Gerard Cassidy","Tayfun, can you share with us with the step-up process that you pointed out of $415 million in the first quarter of 2018, in the past, if I recall, the gains that you've been able to garner from this investment have been used to repurchase your common stock. Do you plan to -- go back to the Fed intra CCAR period to do that again, or would you wait until the next CCAR, and possibly use it at that time to buy back the stock.","Tayfun Tuzun","Gerard, given that we are getting -- we're past the half-point and we're getting closer to the end of this CCAR period, we would plan to do that in the next CCAR period.","Gerard Cassidy","Okay, very good. And then second, on the commercial loans. I think you said you had elevated payoffs in the quarter. Can you give us some color what you're seeing where your customers are paying off the loans vis-\u00e0-vis what you saw maybe earlier in the year?","Greg Carmichael","Yes, Gerard, good question. We did see, I think along with most of our other peers in the industry, significantly elevated pay-downs and payoffs. Over half of that I'd characterize in -- I would direct to our commercial real estate portfolio line of business. The majority of that were asset selling, very low cap rates, high quality assets. Also, a number of those that were moving to the permanent market with a continued flat yield curve, the balance of that would be some of those end-of-year movements that you've seen in the industry, where companies were simply de-levering and maybe positioning themselves relative to the new tax policy. Frankly, we're still trying to figure that one out and see where that one goes. But I would say that was widespread though across geographies and across our businesses, but nothing out of the ordinary beyond that.","Gerard Cassidy","Great. Thank you, guys.","Greg Carmichael","Sure, thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Erika Najarian. Erika, please let us know your company name too. Your line is open.","Erika Najarian","Yes, good morning. Bank of America.","Greg Carmichael","Good morning, Erika.","Erika Najarian","Thank you so much for the detailed outlook. And I'm wondering, you were very specific in terms of reiterating a dollar expense range for 2018. And as we think about the NII outlook and the NIM outlook, it appears as though there's some conservatism baked into either the number of hikes or the deposit reprising assumptions. And the question here is, if the revenue results in 2018 are better than what's outlined on slide 11, does the $4 billion to $4.1 billion range hold regardless?","Tayfun Tuzun","With respect to the expenses, I would say, yes. I think more movement on the expense base related to variable revenues comes more from the fee line items. But in general, the impact of a higher-than-guided NII performance should still keep that expense range intact.","Erika Najarian","Got it. So just to be clear, if you outperform an NII that expense range is intact, but if you outperform on fees then that's when you may be at the high end or out of the range but still keeping with the positive operating leverage target?","Tayfun Tuzun","Absolutely.","Greg Carmichael","And Erika, this is Greg. We continue to focus on expenses as evident on our 2017 performance of flat year-over-year growth. This is an area of heighted focus in the organization. We continue -- will continue to focus on that as we move into 2018, and do a better job of managing expenses on as we move into the year.","Tayfun Tuzun","And just so you know, in general, if during the year we outperform NII, everything else being equal, only, and only due to rate changes, our variable compensation typically does not move.","Erika Najarian","Thank you. That was clear, appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Pancari. John, please let us know your company name. Thanks. Your line is open.","John Pancari","Evercore ISI. Wanted to get your thoughts on the payout target, longer-term post tax reform, any change to your targeted 120 million to 140 payout.","Tayfun Tuzun","Look, I think in general, the more money we make, you would expect a higher payout in dollars. We're still clearly waiting for the Fed\u2019s CCAR assumptions and background, and we will run that through our numbers. But we are still targeting a sort of mid 9-type cap -- CET1 position for 2019. And our payoffs will correlate to that target.","John Pancari","Okay, thanks. And then my follow-up is around North Star. I know initially, when you laid out the program and in several of your updates posted, you were commenting on the 800 million in pretax income that you were targeting under North Star, but you didn't focus on that 800 million at the Investor Day. So is that still a target, that dollar amount? And does it change at all with tax reform, and if so what is the new number?","Tayfun Tuzun","It does. And I don't necessarily have an updated number for you as to the impact of the tax reform. But as you recall, in December, during our Investor Day, we discussed that there were some adjustment to revenue expectations, especially related to loan growth assumptions. And we did say that, both in 2016, and '17, and also in '18, our loan growth assumption is somewhat lower than the initial estimate that we had when we laid out our expectations. But in return, we also mentioned the lower asset growth enabled us to purchase a higher amount of capital, which continues to support the same ROTCE targets that we laid out. And as the tax reform also is moving these targets out, we are actually ahead of our initial expectations with respect to that.","John Pancari","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Please, your line is open.","Matt O'Connor","Good morning.","Greg Carmichael","Hi, Matt.","Matt O'Connor","Sorry if I missed it. The expected TRA in the fourth quarter going forward, should we assume it stays at the $44 million, which I think came in higher than expected or what's the expectation on that at this point?","Jamie Leonard","Yes, Matt, this is Jamie. The fourth quarter of '17 number was $44 million. That is what we guided to all throughout 2017, because it's based off of the Vantiv tax return from a year prior. So that number is locked in a year in advance. So the 4Q '18 number is also fairly close to being locked in, and that's about $20 million. And then going beyond 2018, given the change in tax rate from 35% down to 21%, the go-forward number on those TRA cash flows would be in the $24 million range.","And then those numbers shouldn't change appreciably as long as Worldpay has sufficiency of income to utilize and tax rates don't further change. And the only then variable to all of this would be whenever we would sell our remaining Worldpay interest, it would generate another $340 million or so of cash flows over the next 16 years. So, really look at $20 million for 4Q '18, $24 million beyond and until another disposition occurs.","Matt O'Connor","Okay, that's helpful. And then just separately, if we look at your [Technical Difficulty] seeing at some peers, as we think about reserves to loans. And I'm just wondering if you feel like that gives you a little more flexibility to essentially grow into the reserves levels or how you're thinking about those. You've obviously been de-risking, the loans have not been growing, and most of the credit metrics have been improving, and you've had very good release. So just wondering how your thought of those levels going forward. Thank you.","Greg Carmichael","And I'll ask Frank to comment on the credit profile of that, but in general, we believe that the reserve levels are at the right level. So in that sense, I wouldn't characterize a future flexibility associated with the ratio. But, Frank, do you want to comment on credit?","Frank Forrest","Yes, I mean, our charge-off are a crazy number. Our commercial losses over the last five quarters have ranged from roughly 20 to 30 basis points. Our consumer losses have been in the 40 to 55 basis points range. Those have been slightly higher actually than our peers. Again, it's a trailing number. Our NPAs have been coming down nicely, and in fact, we talked about criticized assets. That will come down, but now the other remainder is from our perspective, we\u2019re nine years into a recovery, and I think we will continue to see some early signs that we will continue forever. And so, there certainly is conservatism. I view this realism, that's nine years is far beyond where we typically would see a pressure. So overall, we feel we are not where we are, but 130 coverage we are comfortable with that that covers 275% [Technical Difficulty] we feel that that's prudent based on where sit today.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Siefers from Sandler O'Neill. Scott, your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, good morning, guys. This is actually Brendon on the line for Scott. Just I wanted to start with the commercial loan outlook, I believe just compared to the outlook you gave in December, if you look, you've improved the outlook for commercial growth a little bit, can you just talk about what's underlying that improvement in the commercial outlook?","Greg Carmichael","Well, first of all, I will tell you that as I look at the activity levels that we had in the fourth quarter, they were substantially elevated. It was a very strong quarter of production, and it was across all of our corporate banking verticals, it was across nearly all of our geographies. If the tax policy changes, beginning to come into play, I frankly -- I had a lot of conversation with a number of CEOs and CFOs, middle market corporate relationships over the last few days, and various -- unquestionably a growing optimism, that can create a tailwind I believe for us as we look at 20018.","But I'd also remind you that we've continued to reallocate our resources. We've, consistent with our North Star strategy, have built out new verticals, our TMT vertical continues to frankly accelerate, and we are developing a very strong name there. Our healthcare vertical had a great quarter. I think they were well positioned for 2018. The ACA Act, with that kind of becoming a little bit less of an issue; there is more clarity in that industry. We are very active there, and I think that you will see more around that space in the near future; energy -- with energy prices that's clearly creating a tailwind.","And frankly, I'm really pleased we have some leadership, we have recruited additional middle market bankers throughout, some of our footprint, look you know, what we shared in the past around the Floridas and North Carolina, we got Tennessee really moving, Indiana being our strongest region for the year. But some of the markets where we have recruited bankers, we have new leadership such as Georgia, such as Cleveland, Northeast Ohio, such as Chicago, these are markets that frankly had a really good fourth quarter and we believe are very well positioned for 2018. Tayfun shared with you growth in that nominal kind of GDP, I believe that there could be some tailwind there. I'm optimistic we got the right business model, we got great talent and I'm looking forward to again.","Unidentified Analyst","I appreciate all the detail and color over there. And then, just turning to corporate bank fee just want to make sure I have the guidance for the 1Q, correct. Is it fair to say you take the 77 million from this question, add back the $25 million impairment and then the growth of 5% to 10% off of that higher level, is that correct?","Greg Carmichael","Yes, it is correct.","Operator","And your next question comes from Peter Winter from Wedbush. Peter, your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is actually Anthony on for Peter. My first question on deposit costs. They seem to tick up across most categories again similar pace we saw last quarter. Any of that promotional or what are you seeing there in terms of deposit pricing competition.","Jamie Leonard","Yes, this is Jamie. The betas that Tayfun referenced, cumulative beta, roughly 22% does include some increases in promotional offers, both in the retail segment as well as with some exceptional pricing in commercial. In terms of the acceleration of the beta, the June hike, we experienced about a 35% beta relative to that 22% that we've had cycled to-date and when you break that down by product, commercial accounts experienced above average beta at about 41% cumulatively whereas the consumer accounts have experienced a below average beta of about 15%.","And then add a little more color, when you break it down by the line of business, that 22% cumulative data translates to 6% in retail, 46% in our wealth and asset management line of business and then 52% in commercial. So I think that highlights where we\u2019ve come and as Tayfun I mentioned, we are in that 45% to 50% modeling for the next couple of rate hikes.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And my follow-up is on the auto charge-off rates, it seems like it ticked up again a little bit this quarter about 10 basis points. I know you're looking to shrink the auto portfolio, but can you give any color on what's driving the continued increase in the charge-off in auto? Thanks.","Jamie Leonard","Yeah. You have to realize that there is a denominator impact of that as well because the portfolio is shrinking and beyond just some seasonality, there is really no, but we\u2019re pretty pleased with what's going out on the auto.","Operator","The next question comes from Christopher Marinac from FIG Partners. Christopher, your line is open.","Christopher Marinac","Hi, good morning. Just wanted to ask about the LCR and as it pertains to not being part of your guidance and to what extent that could help if that plays into your hand later this year?","Greg Carmichael","Our LCR target is to operate north of 110 level, so clearly the 129 is a bit elevated driven to some extent by just seasonal inflows and some cash positions, but it certainly gives us some flexibility as the year progresses. But also keep in mind, that\u2019s just a point in time on the last day of the quarter. So it does move around intra quarter. But it would certainly give us some flexibility as 2018 progresses.","Christopher Marinac","Do you think that will drive both margins and NII if that changes in your favor?","Greg Carmichael","Yes.","Christopher Marinac","Okay, great. Thank you very much guys.","Greg Carmichael","Thank you.","Operator","And your final question comes from Saul Martinez from UBS. Saul, your line is open. Saul Martinez, your line is open. Please state your question.","Greg Carmichael","All right. Okay, I think we will end the call there. Thank you Adam, and thank you all for your interest in Fifth Third Bank. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations department and we will be happy to assist you.","Operator","And this concludes today's conference call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","Sameer Gokhale, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your call.","Sameer Gokhale - Fifth Third Bancorp","Thank you, Natalie. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today, we'll be discussing our financial results for the first quarter of 2017. This discussion may contain certain forward-looking statements about Fifth Third pertaining to our financial condition, results of operations, plans and objectives. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from historical performance and these statements.","We've identified some of these factors in our forward-looking cautionary statement at the end of our earnings release and in other materials, and we encourage you to review them. Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call.","Additionally, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures we reference during today's conference call are included in our earnings release along with other information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures. A copy of our most recent quarterly earnings release can be accessed by the public in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website, www.53.com.","This morning, I'm joined on the call by our President and CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Chief Operating Officer, Lars Anderson; Chief Risk Officer, Frank Forrest; and Treasurer, Jamie Leonard. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Tayfun, we will open the call up for questions.","Let me turn the call over now to Greg for his comments.","Gregory D. Carmichael - Fifth Third Bancorp","Thanks, Sameer, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. As you'll see in our results, we reported first quarter 2017 net income of $305 million and EPS of $0.38 per share. Before, I get into the core quarter results, like to make an observation about the operating environment. I believe that the geopolitical uncertainty and concerns about administration's ability to implement pro-growth policies have caused borrowers to remain cautious.","Having said that, we at Fifth Third are not getting distracted by these macroeconomic challenges and are continuing to execute on initiatives we outlined for you in the Project North Star. Now, in terms of the quarter, overall, our results for the first quarter were solid. During the quarter, we benefited from higher interest rates, while credit quality remained stable, our balance sheet positioning as well as the benefit from increased short-term interest rates. We will continue to focus on limiting the downside impact of lower interest rates by maintaining an asset sensitive position.","During the quarter, we diligently managed our expenses, while continuing to invest in certain areas of growth. Non-interest expenses were flat year-over-year. This include the impact of the $18 million in compensation-related expenses that we typically recognize in the second quarter, but recorded in Q1 given the change in our long-term incentive grant date. Our adjusted net interest margin expanded 7 basis points sequentially. Our NIM is currently at the highest level since third quarter of 2014.","During the quarter, we managed funding costs very tightly and we expect that to continue in this environment. Our total loan balances decline 1% sequentially, primarily driven by C&I loans and some seasonality in our consumer portfolio. Excluding the impact of roughly $600 million in commercial loans we intentionally excited, total commercial loans were up 1% sequentially and 5% year-over-year.","Our clients remain cautiously optimistic about the prospects for increased economic activity, and we have seen some improvement in our loan production pipeline in April. As we discussed earlier in the year, we plan to exit about $1.5 billion of C&I loans this year, which will impact our net loan growth.","Fee revenues were lower sequentially and year-over-year, primarily due to a lease remarketing impairment and lower mortgage banking revenues. The sequential comparison was also impacted by the $33 million, Vantiv TRA payment that we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016.","Corporate banking revenue was affected by a $31 million lease remarketing impairment related to oilfield services exposure. Excluding this impairment, corporate banking revenue was up 4% sequentially. Expanding our capital markets business remains an integral part of our North Star strategy.","Our capital markets fees were up 90% compared to the fourth quarter and 14% year-over-year. The recently hired key talents expand our M&A advisory and investment banking capacities. They should further improve our ability to generate additional fee revenues. Our M&A groups provide advice to a wide range of vertical industry sectors, including consumer retail, diversified industrials, downstream petroleum, healthcare, and technology, media and telecommunications.","Mortgage banking revenue was affected by seasonality and higher rates as expected in addition to lower MSR hedge gains. Total mortgage origination volume of $1.9 billion was up 10% from last year and higher than almost all of our peers. Despite the increase in originations, mortgage banking revenue was down 33% year-over-year. This reflected significantly lower rate loss volumes in the first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2016.","As many of you know, we recognize revenue when we enter into rate loss. This can cause the timing of revenue recognition to differ from the timing of loan funding. It also reflects small derivative gains and lower MSR revaluation gains compared to a year ago. Growth in our wealth and asset management revenue was strong during the quarter, up 8% sequentially and 6% year-over-year, as our revenue reached an all-time high. Along with capital markets, wealth and asset management revenue is expected to provide a lift to our fees as we execute on our strategic initiatives.","During the quarter, credit quality remained stable. Non-performing assets and non-performing loans decreased and our criticized assets remained relatively flat. Within our commercial real estate portfolio, criticized assets are currently at their lowest levels since 2004. We believe that our prudent underwriting strategy and the focus on larger developers is bearing fruit. We expect the credit environment to remain stable for the foreseeable future.","We're making good progress on our North Star initiatives across the board. In retail banking, our omni-channel investments and branch automation projects will start to benefit our results more meaningfully later this year and into 2018. Our ongoing efforts in digital have resulted in continued growth in both mobile usage and overall engagement with our mobile offerings. Our loan enrollment is up 56% year-over-year and nearly 50% of all deposits are now made through our mobile and ATM channels.","The initiatives in unsecured lending and credit card businesses are well underway. We're also making good progress in expense initiatives in operations and technology, as well as workspace management.","Our capital levels remain strong. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 10.8% from 10.4% last quarter. Our earnings contributed to a tangible book value of $16.89 per share, which was up 2% from last quarter and up 3% over last year. We recently submitted our 2017 CCAR plan to the Federal Reserve. Our strong capital levels and ongoing earnings power are supportive of higher levels of capital return to our shareholders.","Overall, our results were solid and we remain well positioned to achieve our long-term objectives. I am pleased that Fifth Third Bank was just awarded Gallup's Great Workplace 2017 Award for the fourth time in a row. This award is the measure of employee engagement, the degree in which our employees feel connected, valued and supported in the workplace.","I want to thank all of our employees for their continued dedication in serving our clients and improving the performance of our bank. Our employees are our most important asset and I believe that our focused strategy and the high degree of employee engagement create a powerful combination.","Now, with that, I'll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our first quarter results and our current outlook.","Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp","Thanks, Greg. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Let's move to the financial summary on slide 4 of the presentation. During the quarter, the expansion of our net interest margin, our focus on disciplined expense management and stable credit quality reflected our continued commitment to driving improved financial performance. The quarter's results included two items that had a net neutral impact on earnings per share.","First quarter results reflected the partial reversal of a charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2016 for estimated credit card refunds. This was offset by a negative mark from our Visa swap. Another isolated item was a $31 million lease remarketing impairment related to an exposure to an oilfield services company, which negatively impacted our non-interest income.","Average commercial loan balances were down 1% sequentially and year-over-year. As we have discussed over the past few quarters, we continue to exit lending relationships that do not meet our desired risk return profile. Excluding the impact of these exits, commercial loans were up 1% sequentially and grew by 5% year-over-year. The sequential decline reflected the combination of softer loan demand resulting from a less certain fiscal outlook as well as elevated capital markets activity driving higher corporate loan refinance volumes.","Healthy level of capital markets activity is keeping loan spreads at very competitive levels, but our teams continue to focus on growing relationships to create value both for our clients and our shareholders. The sequential decline in average C&I balances was partially offset by 2% growth in commercial construction loans this quarter. This growth came predominantly from drawdowns on existing commitments.","Spread from construction loans are stable and coupons have expanded reflective of the move in LIBOR. At this time, we have roughly another $900 million of exits to go for the remainder of 2017. Our outlook remains relatively similar to our guidance in January. Excluding these anticipated exits, we continue to expect to grow total commercial loans in the low-to-mid single digits in 2017. Including these exits, we expect our commercial loan portfolio to grow by about 2% on an end of period basis.","Average consumer loans were down 1% from last quarter and down 2% year-over-year. Excluding auto loans, consumer loans were flat sequentially and up 3% year-over-year. Auto loans were down 4% from last quarter and 13% year-over-year. We firmly believe that reducing capital deployment in this business is the right decision, especially given the changing risk profile due to the pressures on used car values.","Residential mortgage loans grew by 2% sequentially and 10% year-over-year as we continued to retain jumbo mortgages, ARMs, as well as certain 10- and 15-year fixed rate mortgages on our balance sheet during the quarter. Our home equity loan portfolio decreased 3% sequentially and 8% year-over-year, as loan pay-downs exceeded strong origination volumes. Our originations this quarter were 9% higher year-over-year. Unlike the auto loan space, this is a portfolio that we intend to grow.","The portfolio decline is predominantly due to pay-downs in the legacy home equity portfolio, and a growing preference for personal unsecured lending over HELOCs. With improved analytics and targeted marketing campaigns, we expect to start growing this portfolio in the second half of this year.","Our credit card portfolio was seasonally down 2% from the fourth quarter and down 2% compared to the first quarter of 2016. Excluding the agent bank portfolio, which we sold in the second quarter of 2016, our credit card portfolio would have been up modestly on a year-over-year basis. As we have discussed before, this is an area of significant emphasis within our North Star project. We expect the upgrades in our analytical capabilities to start showing results during the second half of this year and into 2018.","Our GreenSky partnership is also continuing to perform in line with our expectations. This partnership should also help support faster consumer loan growth. Excluding the deliberate reduction of indirect auto loan balances, we are expecting to grow our consumer and mortgage loans by a mid-single digits rate in 2017 on an end of period basis. Consistent with our strategy, the redeployment of capital from indirect auto lending to other parts of Consumer Lending franchise will provide further support for higher ROTCE and ROA levels.","Average investment securities increased 4% sequentially in the first quarter, primarily due to opportunistic investments made at the end of the fourth quarter. We expect to maintain our investment portfolio at roughly the same level. Average core deposits were flat sequentially driven by increased commercial and consumer interest checking balances.","On a year-over-year basis, core deposits were up 2%. Excluding the impact of the strategic exits from St. Louis and Pittsburgh in 2016, core deposits were up 3%. Increases in money market and savings balances were partially offset by a decline in CDs. Our modified liquidity coverage ratio continued to be very strong at 119% at the end of the quarter.","Adjusted net interest income was up $2 million from the previous quarter. The fourth quarter's reported result included a $16 million estimated charge for refunds to certain bank card customers. In the first quarter, with the completion of our analysis, this charge was revised and resulted in a $12 million reversal of the prior charge.","Our solid underlying NII performance includes the $13 million negative impact of a lower day count, reflects higher short-term market rates and lower wholesale funding balances, partially offset by declining loan balances. Excluding the credit card charge and reversal, the adjusted NIM increased 7 basis points from the fourth quarter to 2.98%, exceeding our guidance of 2.94% to 2.95%.","We currently expect NIM expansion of 2 basis points in the second quarter compared to our adjusted first quarter margin of 2.98%. On a full year basis, we expect the NIM to be at the high-end of our original guidance range of 2.95% to 3% that we gave in January, assuming additional rate increases in September and December.","Overall, deposit betas so far have remained low and are in the mid-teens with commercial betas in the low 20% range. Our guidance assumes that on a blended basis, consumer and commercial deposit betas will increase to the 30% range in the coming months for the most recent move in March and the next rate hike. For subsequent rate hikes, we expect deposit betas to be closer to 50%.","Including the impact of day count, we expect our second quarter net interest income to be up by 1% to 1.5% sequentially from our adjusted net interest income in the first quarter. Adjusted non-interest income in the first quarter was $536 million, compared to $608 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The fourth quarter of 2016 included $33 million in TRA income from Vantiv.","Mortgage banking net revenue of $52 million was down $13 million sequentially. Originations were 10% higher compared to last year's first quarter, but our gain on sale margin was 198 basis points compared with 347 basis points last year due to lower rate lock revenues and a larger proportion of correspondent originations. In addition, we also had lower net MSR revaluation gains in the first quarter.","During the quarter, our origination mix was relatively evenly split between purchase and refinance volumes. Approximately two-thirds of the originations continued to be sourced from the retail and direct channels, and the remainder were originated through the correspondent channel. While we are building up our capacity to grow mortgage originations, we are also investing in our servicing business. Recently, we executed two acquisitions for a total of $6 billion in service loans. These portfolios are in the process of being on-boarded.","Corporate banking fees of $74 million were down $27 million or 27% sequentially, reflecting the impact of the $31 million lease remarketing impairment. Excluding the impact of the lease impairment, corporate banking revenue increased 4% compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, driven by solid capital markets fee growth of 19%.","Deposit service charges seasonally decreased 2% from the fourth quarter and increased 1% relative to the first quarter of 2016. Card and processing revenue decreased 6% both sequentially and on a year-over-year basis. The sequential decrease partly reflects seasonality following higher holiday spending in the fourth quarter. The payments business is an important focus area for our North Star project.","In addition to targeting growth in consumer payments, we have ambitious plans in the commercial space. We are combining improvements in our existing business and are complementing them with new partnerships like Transactis and AvidXchange. Total wealth and asset management revenue of $108 million was up 8% sequentially, due to strong brokerage revenue and seasonally strong tax-related private client service revenue.","Revenues increased 6% relative to the first quarter of 2016, mainly due to the higher personal asset management and brokerage revenue. Excluding mortgage banking revenue and non-core items shown on slide 13 of the presentation, we expect non-interest income to grow by 3% in 2017. The adjustment to previous guidance on non-interest income is largely due to the lease impairments that we recorded in the first quarter.","In the second quarter of 2017, on the same basis, we expect non-interest income to be up 8%. In addition, we expect mortgage origination fees to increase by approximately 30% sequentially in the second quarter.","We remain focused on disciplined expense management while still investing in areas of strategic importance. Non-interest expenses were flat compared with last year, including the impact of approximately $18 million in long-term incentive expense that was pulled forward from the second quarter to the first quarter due to a change in the date of our long-term compensation awards. Excluding this item, expenses were down 2% year-over-year and were up less than 1% sequentially, reflecting seasonally higher compensation costs.","The sequential increase in FICA, workers' comp and 401(k) expenses totaled $36 million or nearly 4% of our expense base. We expect expenses in 2017 to be up about 1% compared to 2016, including the incremental expenses associated with new initiatives under Project North Star, the same as our guidance last year quarter.","In the absence of North Star related expenses, we would have expected our total expenses to decline by about 0.5% in 2017. Our first quarter expenses came in below our expectation and guidance by a significant amount. Despite this outperformance, we expect our expenses in the second quarter to be lower than in the first quarter.","Our guidance today continues to reflect our commitment to achieve positive operating leverage in 2017, while we're making substantive progress in lowering our efficiency ratio towards our long-term target of sub 60%. Adjusting for the 3% impact from the difference in accounting for low income housing compared to all of our peers, which has no bottom line impact, this is an ambitious target.","Turning to credit results on slide 9; net charge-offs were $89 million or 40 basis points in the first quarter, an increase from $73 million and 31 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2016, but an improvement from $96 million or 42 basis points in the first quarter a year ago. The sequential increase was primarily due to an $11 million increase in C&I charge-offs.","Total portfolio non-performing loans were $657 million, down $3 million from the previous quarter, resulting in an NPL ratio of 72 basis points. Total NPAs were down 3% and loans 90 days past due and still accruing decreased 11% sequentially. Our loss provision was $20 million higher than last quarter. Our resulting reserve coverage as a percent of loans and leases of 1.35% was 1-basis point lower than last quarter and 3 basis points lower than last year.","Our allowance coverage of NPAs increased to 172% from 157% at the end of the first quarter of 2016. Our previous guidance that net charge-offs will be range bound with some quarterly variability is unchanged, and we continue to believe that our provision expense will be primarily reflective of loan growth.","Our capital levels remained very strong and grew during the first quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.8%, reflecting an increase of 37 basis points quarter-over-quarter and 95 basis points year-over-year. Our tangible common equity, excluding unrealized gains and losses, increased 28 basis points sequentially and 60 basis points year-over-year.","At the end of the first quarter, common shares outstanding were flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 and down 20 million shares or 3% compared to last year's first quarter. We have buyback capacity of approximately $340 million remaining in our CCAR 2016 plan that we expect to execute this quarter. Book value and tangible book value were both up 2% from last quarter.","As I mentioned previously, our common equity Tier 1 ratio has increased very significantly over the past year, while we steadily continued to de-risk our balance sheet. We have submitted our capital plan under the 2017 CCAR. This plan includes a request for additional share buybacks and dividends. Given the 95-basis point increase in our common equity Tier 1 ratio since the first quarter of last year, our strong capacity to generate additional capital and the reduced level of risk exposure across the board, we are seeking to increase the level of capital distributions over the next CCAR cycle.","With respect to taxes, our effective tax rate was positively impacted by an $8 million benefit associated with the exercise and vesting of employee equity awards. We expect our second quarter tax rate to be roughly around 25% and the full year 2017 tax rate to be in the 24% to 25% range.","Our guidance reflects the benefit from our recent actions and provides support for the initiatives under Project North Star. Our North Star performance expectations were clearly stated last year: end of 2019 run rate ROTCE between 12% and 14%; ROA between 1.1% and 1.13%; and efficiency ratio sub 60% without any meaningful help from the environment.","We also projected that given the timing of the project 2018 would be the first year of step-up towards these targets. At this time, we are expecting on a full year basis to be above an 11% ROTCE and close to 1.1% ROA with continued strong expense control. The timing of the progress is more than one year ahead of our original expectations, given the improvement in rates, assuming that there will be two additional Fed rate increases this year and two more next year.","These initiatives will leverage our strength in middle market lending, industry verticals and specialty lending areas in our commercial business. In the consumer business, growth initiatives in mortgage banking, credit card and personal lending will provide support for more balanced growth in our overall loan portfolio.","Additionally, efficiency initiatives in retail banking, aided by use of technology, should continue to drive increased shareholder value. We continue to target higher revenue growth by expanding our capabilities in businesses such as capital markets, insurance and wealth management, which generate attractive returns.","Our revenue growth outlook, our ability to achieve positive operating leverage without changing our risk appetite, our ongoing discipline of maintaining a strong balance sheet, and the long-term strategic positioning of our business lines together provide a positive backdrop for our shareholders. We have included the updated outlook on slide 11 for your reference.","And with that, let me turn it over to Sameer to open up the call for Q&A.","Sameer Gokhale - Fifth Third Bancorp","Thanks, Tayfun. Before we start Q&A, as a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. We will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time that we have this morning. During the question-and-answer period, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator.","Natalie, please open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","Hello. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Maybe starting off on the net interest margin, 7 basis points of core NIM expansion this quarter, but it sounds like you're talking about something lower, maybe 2 basis points in 2Q. So, could you explain to us where that dynamic comes from? Why a smaller 2Q benefit than 1Q benefit?","Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp","You maybe referring to the reported net interest margin there because we are \u2013 adjusted net interest margin is 2.98%. Jamie, you want to comment on what we're seeing here in the next few quarters?","James C. Leonard - Fifth Third Bancorp","Sure. Geoffrey, it's Jamie. On the first quarter NIM expansion of 7 bps on the core basis, 7 basis points of improvement was driven by LIBOR and the Fed short-term rate increases plus 2 basis points from day count, and then the benefit of 1 basis point from lower cash levels and then that was offset by a return to more normalized discount accretion levels, so that was 3 basis points of erosion in the first quarter from the investment portfolio. As you recall in the fourth quarter, we had strong levels there.","So that's what drove the first quarter 7-basis point improvement. And then to your question as to why not another 5 to 7 basis points in the second quarter, as Tayfun mentioned in the script, we expect a 2-basis point improvement and that will be driven by the fact that our forecast doesn't have another Fed move in it until September, so we have rates relatively flat. We will benefit in the C&I yield area probably 8 basis points on a yield basis, so let's translate that into 3 to 4 basis points of NIM improvement from the March Fed move, net of the deposit betas and some funding mix, and then that will be partially offset by 1-basis point erosion from day count and then potentially 1-basis point decline in loan spreads.","So, when you add it all up, the first quarter really benefited from both the December move and the fact that the market had an increase in LIBOR rates ahead of the March move and our second quarter will only have in it the benefit of the March rate hike.","Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp","And also we gave you the underlying beta assumptions and if we see more discipline in deposit pricing in the market and outperform, then our margin expectations may prove to be more conservative, but that remains to be seen obviously.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","And just on that point, I guess, on the call, you mentioned 20% beta so far, 30% expected for the next couple of rate rises, 50% later, but then if I look at slide 16, you're talking about 70%. Should we kind of see that slide 16 disclosure as more kind of academic at this point? How do we kind of square out the 70% on slide 16 with the 30% and the 50%?","Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp","Yeah, we have been using those assumptions in our rate risk disclosure since, I think, the end of 2015. But we basically disclose sensitivity tables around those numbers. So despite the fact that we are using, clearly, a 69%, 70% beta in the risk disclosures, we are also bracketing it by disclosing the impact of potential deposit runoff as well as 25% higher and 25% lower beta.","So we're giving you enough information to bracket the beta behavior and then we're supplementing that with what we are seeing today, and also, based on what we are seeing today, we're giving you our expectations. So we want to give you the full picture, that's why we are continuing to use those assumptions and those risk tables.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","Great. Thank you.","Sameer Gokhale - Fifth Third Bancorp","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Gregory D. Carmichael - Fifth Third Bancorp","Good morning, Matt.","Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Tayfun, you mentioned that you're still committed to operating leverage improvement this year, which has been a pretty consistent theme of yours. But I believe, in the January call, you mentioned a specific basis point amount of improvement at around 250 basis points, is that still your target or has that changed from January?","Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp","Are you referring to the efficiency ratio improvement?","Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yes.","Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp","Okay. We are still expecting an efficiency ratio improvement. I don't quite recall exactly how we guided the efficiency. But, again, when you go back and look at our guidance, our guidance really has not changed from January. So what we committed to in January still holds.","Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Can you maybe...","Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp","With the exception of \u2013 the only change we made, I want to clarify that, because in the morning I saw some reports. The only reason why we made a change in our non-interest income expectations is just due to the lease remarketing impairment that we recorded in Q1. With the exception of that, we actually moved our NII guidance up a little bit from where it was.","Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. That's good color. And Jamie, maybe a question for you. It looked like securities yields were stable or a little bit lower this quarter. If that's correct, can you give us a sense as to how you're thinking about reinvesting the cash flows coming off that portfolio since you're guiding to relatively stable AFS securities balances?","James C. Leonard - Fifth Third Bancorp","Yeah. On the available for sale book, we did have a decline in the security yields from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. Again, that's just driven by the discount accretion outperformance in the fourth quarter. Our book is very close to par from a premium position. And with 52% of the portfolio in bullet or locked-out cash flows, I would say that this is going to perform a very stable portfolio. We had about $600 million of cash flows in the first quarter. That's what I would expect to continue over the remaining three quarters. And I would expect the portfolio yield on a full year basis to be in a 3.05% to 3.10% range, again, very stable strong performance.","Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you for the color, gentlemen.","Gregory D. Carmichael - Fifth Third Bancorp","Thank you.","Sameer Gokhale - Fifth Third Bancorp","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy from RBC. Your line is open.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. Good morning, guys.","Sameer Gokhale - Fifth Third Bancorp","Good morning.","Gregory D. Carmichael - Fifth Third Bancorp","Good morning.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Tayfun, could you give us \u2013 I know this is more of a theoretical hypothetical type question, but obviously there's regulatory change coming on the horizon, possibly the global SIFI number will be lifted to over $250 billion in assets and you guys won't be considered as a SIFI. In that scenario, where would you be comfortable in taking the LCR ratio down, assuming you got relief on that as well?","Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp","I think our thoughts around LCR ratio in terms of today's environment is to manage it right around the 100% to 115% level. Gerard, it would be speculative for me to necessarily project an LCR ratio in a different environment because in that environment, probably, there will be other changes. But any change on that would be positive. It would be positive for earnings, it would be positive the way we manage our liquidity, but I don't want to necessarily speculate an expectation based on that.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Sure. And then moving on to a second question, obviously, you guys have highlighted your strategy on bringing down auto. Can you share with us \u2013 you mentioned that there is a higher risk profile, which we all are aware of. Can you share with us what you're seeing, whether it's residual values or delinquencies or loan to value of the automobile is a problem? And also, can you remind us where you think you want to get the automobile portfolio down to it before it stabilizes?","Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp","Yes. So, I think \u2013 I'll answer your second question first. I think the stabilization in that portfolio will be achieved sometime during 2019. And the portfolio today is going down by about $1.5 billion or so a year. So, by the end of this year, we would expect to be right around the $9 billion \u2013 maybe a little bit lower than $9 billion. I think, ultimately, the average balances in 2019 are probably going to be around $7 billion \u2013 $7 billion, $7.5 billion, and that's probably a balance that we would comfortably manage going forward.","We are not \u2013 our statistics on the auto portfolio are a little bit skewed because you have a declining balance portfolio, therefore, the basis point numbers, whether it's in delinquencies or charge-offs are skewed compared to somebody who's growing their portfolio. We are clearly seeing loan recoveries. Certain used cars are showing deterioration. In terms of default percentages, we're not seeing default percentages going up because the portfolio is a high prime portfolio, which is not as sensitive as subprime borrowers, but the recovery rates in general are looking weaker.","Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp","You're welcome.","Gregory D. Carmichael - Fifth Third Bancorp","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Erika Penala Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning.","Gregory D. Carmichael - Fifth Third Bancorp","Good morning, Erika.","Erika Penala Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I just wanted to make sure I understood one of Tayfun's remarks correctly. Because of a more optimistic outlook on the Fed, we can now expect you to achieve 12% to 14% ROTCE a year earlier, in 2018 versus 2019?","Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp","We are expecting \u2013 the guidance that I gave was in 2018, we are expecting to be above 11% ROTCE and close to a 1.1% ROA. So we are entering our North Star target that we projected for very end of 2019 in 2018 now.","Erika Penala Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I see. And my follow-up question is, embedded in that guidance for next year in terms of ROTCE above 11%, are you assuming a fully realized deposit beta of 50%?","Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp","Yes.","Erika Penala Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter from Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.","Peter J. Winter - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Good morning.","Sameer Gokhale - Fifth Third Bancorp","Good morning, Peter.","Gregory D. Carmichael - Fifth Third Bancorp","Good morning, Peter.","Sameer Gokhale - Fifth Third Bancorp","How are you?","Peter J. Winter - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","At the onset of the call, you guys talked about that with the macro environment that borrowers remain cautious. I'm just wondering could you talk about what you're seeing in terms of loan pipelines and just the loan environment in the Midwest.","Gregory D. Carmichael - Fifth Third Bancorp","I'll start off and ask Lars to provide additional color to it. First off, I would tell you, we use the term cautiously optimistic in the past. Lot of the uncertainly that's happening in the administration and there are concerns around their ability to basically achieve some of the objectives they haven't finalized with the corporate tax rates, improve the economic growth and so forth are some concerns out there.","So it's been pretty sluggish. With that said, we look at our strategic portfolio, we've been able to grow our C&I portfolio roughly about 5%. If you strip out the things that we were pushing out, that $600 million we talked about earlier, but it's been pretty sluggish. But we are starting to see the pipeline pick up in April and we're optimistic that by the full year end of period growth in commercial will be over 2%.","Lars, I don't know if you want to.","Lars C. Anderson - Fifth Third Bancorp","I think you hit it well. I would just tell you that we did see a pickup in activity levels as we moved through the first quarter. I would say that the comments generally are somewhere between optimism and enthusiasm. However, we have not yet seen that kind of come through to fundings, but I must say I'm a little bit more optimistic about our pipeline as we look at the second quarter and later in the year.","However, ultimate results are obviously going to be impacted by the overall macroeconomic environment. We got a number of lines of business that I would say despite the fact that this is a slow growth environment, you can see that in 8-K data, do continue to do very well, particularly in some of our industry verticals, some of our geographies look attractive.","Peter J. Winter - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Great. And just a quick follow-up. On capital, you mentioned that you're going to increase the capital return as part of the 2017 CCAR. I'm just wondering do you target a capital ratio for a common equity Tier 1.","Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp","Traditionally, what we said was that in our CCAR submissions, we intend to keep capital ratios flat going in and coming out of the CCAR period. But we have seen, as I said, nearly a 1% increase over the past 12 months. I think 10% probably is a decent level in this environment and regime for us to target and that's the number that we have in mind.","Peter J. Winter - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","And is there a timeframe that you want to hit that level?","Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp","Look, ultimately, we are forced to manage our capital over the next four, five quarters, so that's what the market horizon is.","Peter J. Winter - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.","Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Rahul Patil - Evercore Group LLC","Yes, this is Rahul Patil on behalf of John. It looks like the better revenue environment, given higher rates, is helping you achieve Project North Star targets sooner than expected. But could you provide an update around your expense reduction efforts as part of the North Star, are you still targeting around $116 million in cost saves? Any incremental color on that front would be helpful.","Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp","Yeah. Obviously, we are displaying, as of today, a pretty good discipline on expense management, so some of our recent efforts from 2016, including renegotiation of contracts, et cetera, are helping out quite a bit. As we look forward, there are many areas of focus, including workspace management, including \u2013 in technology, utilization of cloud space and other infrastructural investments, investments in more efficient data infrastructure as well as improvements in just overall consulting legal expenses, et cetera. They're all underway. They are moving in line with our expectations. Our goal is to continue save on our day-to-day operating expense base in order to be able to finance North Star related projects. And all of those in general are in line with our expectations.","Sameer Gokhale - Fifth Third Bancorp","Operator, can we move to the next question?","Rahul Patil - Evercore Group LLC","Hello?","Sameer Gokhale - Fifth Third Bancorp","Yes, Rahul, go ahead. Okay. Natalie, I think \u2013 let's move on to the next question. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Sameer Gokhale - Fifth Third Bancorp","Hi, Ken.","Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp","Good morning.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","One further follow-up on the expense side. So great \u2013 good start on the first quarter, and then I see the second quarter guidance versus a year ago, which is also pretty flat. So just wondering, just underneath that, Tayfun, you just made the point about good expense control. Do we see a kind of downward trajectory from here, especially as we get into the more meatier part of North Star next year? What if any \u2013 gross increases are you still burdened by, whether it's tech compliance otherwise or why can't we see kind of a netting down from here?","Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp","Yeah, but for the expense related to North Star initiatives, our expenses would've been down this year again. In general, organically, we have some organic inflation in compensation expenses. Our goal is to fund that organic increase in comp expenses, which is basically a reflection of wage inflation, by saving across the board in the next two, three years, so that we can actually absorb that and find other savings to fund the remaining North Star expenses.","So we are optimistic that as some of the North Star initiatives come online, including the branch digitization efforts that reduce a significant amount of branch transportation costs, and other expenses, that we will be able to achieve that. So in terms of when do we expect the absolute numbers coming down, into 2019, clearly, as some of the North Star initiatives start easing up, we are going to build that into our forecast. At this point for 2017, the numbers are looking very good with very, very modest increases in total expense.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Got it. Okay. And then just a second point on the fee side, taking your point that the second quarter growth is a lot related to just the first quarter low start in corporate services. Can you just talk a little bit about fee dynamics, where do you see growth? And then also if you could \u2013 you did talk about mortgage. I know you excluded because of the volatility of it, but \u2013 and try to just help us think about some of the dynamics underneath the mortgage business and the moving back and forth between servicing and production?","Gregory D. Carmichael - Fifth Third Bancorp","I'll start off. First off, when you think about the fees in this year as you look to the second, third and fourth quarter, areas of opportunity, growth in wealth and asset management, we're really pleased with the performance we're seeing. As we mentioned, we're up 6% year-over-year and we expect that to continue to be a strong performer this year, as well as the large investments we made over the last four or five years are in capital markets, including a lot of talent acquisitions.","We expect to continue to see strong performance in capital markets. We're up 90% sequentially and 14% year-over-year is another opportunity. Mortgage, we'll expect as you would the seasonality in second quarter to pickup over the first quarter. We're also replacing and implementing a completely new digital platform that goes online this year, which will improve our efficiencies and our capacity in that business, so we're very optimistic about our prospects to grow that business as we move into the latter part of this year and into next year. So those are the areas of strength and I'll let Tayfun to add anything else he wants to comment on that?","Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp","Yeah. So in terms of a few more items on \u2013 line items, in payments processing, I would expect that line item to be steadily growing as the year progresses. In deposit fees, obviously, it's been a tough environment with respect to growth in deposit fees for the sector, but our expectation is, again, into second half of the year, we have some initiatives especially in corporate treasury management, and we would expect a slight pickup in that line item in the third and fourth quarters.","Mortgage, we expect a pickup in the second quarter. I think, given sort of the rate outlook today, once we achieve that uptick in Q2, we should see those levels holding up in Q3 and Q4. So, obviously, that bodes well for the second half of the year. Wealth and asset management unless there's a significant change in market level should see steady growth throughout the year.","Greg mentioned capital markets and overall corporate banking; we would expect a steady increase in that line item. That should give us a very healthy increase year-over-year in corporate banking. So, all-in-all, our expectation is that we will do well across the board. There are number of initiatives, as I said, that are underway that would support this type of loan growth \u2013 I'm sorry, fee growth.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Thanks for all the color.","Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby from Vining Sparks. Your line is open.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","Thanks. Tayfun, I want to ask you about the purchase of servicing. We've heard several banks talking about that. Are we kind of leveraging the arbitrage between the assumed prepayment speeds and the actual prepayment speeds, because what we looked at with the value of servicing, is it's been pushed so far down relative to any historic value that once rate started to go up and prepayment speeds began to slow, there was a lot of hidden value in those portfolios. So was that part of the \u2013 kind of strategy here is to take advantage of the difference between assumed and actual prepayment speeds?","Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp","Marty, that's probably part of it. Although, I don't think that necessarily we're making aggressive assumptions about prepayment speed changes. But when you think about it, going back two, three years, we had servicing capacity that far exceeds where we are today due to higher prepayments over the last couple of years. And we have a certain fixed cost base.","It is a good business from a return perspective. We do it well, and we are very selective in terms of the profile of the servicing portfolios that we go after, and we service them very efficiently, and therefore, we view servicing, given the certain fixed cost basis, as a very good return business. And we will continue \u2013 we're adding, as I said, $6 billion worth of servicing here. Those transactions are being on-boarded, and we would expect that to grow going forward.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","And then when we did our deposit analysis, we showed that your \u2013 the high watermark or the most aggressive pricer on Jumbo Time over one year, you got a relatively high rate there. I was curious what the funding strategy was or what you had in or thinking in that pricing mechanism?","Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp","That's more of a leftover initiative from a couple years ago where we ran some promotional offers there. But, right now, I would expect that to be a fairly stable line item for us.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","And then lastly, Greg, from a strategic standpoint, we've heard a lot today about financial efficiencies and looking at maximizing and optimizing portfolios, but as you're going through Project North Star and you're thinking about strategically where Firth Third is heading, what kind of progress are you seeing, what kind of successes, what are the things that you're seeing develop as Fifth Third is kind of creating a new identity for itself in the marketplace?","Gregory D. Carmichael - Fifth Third Bancorp","Marty, we talked about being good through the cycle, so everything we do, we put through that lens, and that's why you've seen us optimize the balance sheet the way we have and do some heavy lifting, we did $3.5 billion last year, we pushed out either credit related or return related another $1.5 billion this year, $600 million in the first quarter, so a lot of heavy lifting around the balance sheet and you're seeing that start to show up with respect to, on the credit quality, and what we expect from that balance sheet going forward from a performance perspective.","On the investment side of the house, we're investing heavily in the things that create additional efficiencies for the company. We talk about new mortgage loan origination platform, we talk about the digitization of our whole branch infrastructure, we're going to eliminate hundreds of thousands of documents that move back and forth between the branch network with significant cost savings. We reduced our branch count by about 12%. We continue to look for ways to continue optimize that.","We did $6 million improvement in staffing and re-optimization \u2013 or optimization in that sector. Vendor negotiations, we did $40 million of cost takeouts. So we're going to continue with those type of opportunities. We've added heavily in our technology space and our risk and compliance space. There's opportunities to continue to optimize around those areas. We'll look at artificial intelligence to really focus on our operations to create more efficiencies in that sector.","So we're focused on the efficiencies, but we're also looking at how we drive revenue and improve our fee businesses. So that's why you're seeing additional investments in areas like M&A advisory services, expansion of all the capital markets capabilities, but what we're looking forward is to create a balanced infrastructure and business that would be good through the cycle with a higher rate of fee contribution onto our revenue and the balance sheet that will perform well through this cycle.","That's what we're working on, that's how we put \u2013 the view we put on anything we look at with respect to what we're going do or not do it. And then it gets down to execution, and we tend to execute extremely well. We have clarity on what we're executing towards. So we feel really good about the talent we have to execute these plays. And as we have already, you'll see those results continue to show up in our numbers. We talked about the expenses we're at today. We think there is a lot of upside or opportunity to drive improved expense performance going forward. We want to see some of that materialize before we talk more about it.","Marty Mosby - Vining Sparks IBG LP","Thanks.","Gregory D. Carmichael - Fifth Third Bancorp","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez from UBS. Your line is open.","Saul Martinez - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I wanted to drill down a little bit on a couple of fee lines. First, on corporate banking, there is obviously some lumpiness there in terms of the quarterly results and you had, obviously, the impairment this quarter, you had a similar thing in 1Q 2015.","But if I take a step back and I look at sort of the quarterly run rate for corporate banking fees, it's been pretty consistently in the sort of $105 million to $115 million range for a few years now. So I wanted to \u2013 can you just talk a little bit about or outline some of the efforts there to sort of really restart and really get that fee line moving and what's your level of optimism that you can kick start that revenue line and really sort of break out of the range you've been in over the last couple of years.","Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp","Hey, Saul, let's \u2013 I'm going to sort of digest it a little bit and then I'm going to turn it over to Lars in terms of what we are doing. In terms of the capital markets fees, so capital markets fees is roughly 60% of total corporate banking fees any changes obviously from quarter-to-quarter. The challenging part there that also includes our FICC revenues, the interest rate derivates, commodity derivatives, foreign exchange, et cetera. That business has been under pressure just due to environmental factors.","And the overall capital markets fee growth is being somewhat limited by the pressures on that business. We are actually doing certain things in that business. I'm going to turn over to Lars to articulate those. So, as that business recovers, I think we'll do well, the rest of the capital markets business is a combination of corporate bond fees, loan syndications, and M&A advisory equity capital markets. Again, Lars and his team are working very diligently to change the slope for any growth.","The remaining pieces in corporate banking fees other than capital markets are basically the lease remarketing, obviously, that's been a bit lumpy, and then just overall fees associated with loan activity, letter of credit and other corporate banking fees. So those obviously \u2013 as the loan environment changes, those also would be positively impacted.","But Lars, you guys are doing a lot of things here to change the slope.","Lars C. Anderson - Fifth Third Bancorp","Yeah. So I think the point on our FICC businesses is critical. That's been one that obviously globally we've seen kind of a risk off ever since Brexit. What you've seen across a lot of the regional bank platforms is the FRM businesses and foreign exchange, interest rate commodity hedging have been very weak. However, in spite of that, that historically has been a big part of our company.","We're there with our clients, we're talking to them, we're strategizing, so that when we get back into a risk on type of environment that we will be positioned with them. And I would tell you that we're making technology investments there to improve even the delivery and go to a digital real-time environment. And I see that this frankly is a North Star opportunity for us to drive some significant fee income for us for the future. So I'm optimistic on that part of it that Tayfun referenced.","The investment banking piece of it, loan syndication, corporate bond underwriting, equity underwriting, M&A \u2013 our investment banking revenues are up 45% on a common quarter basis. So I don't think there's any question about it that we're moving market share in the regional banking space there. And that's really important to our core strategy that Greg talks about. It's advisory base, it's a relationship base, and we're bringing solutions and ideas to these clients to help them to grow, be successful. This is a developing story and one that we continue to invest in, in technology as well as talent and align it with our industry verticals, the areas of our company that we want to grow.","Saul Martinez - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. No, that's helpful. And I'd love to pick your brain at some other point offline on what you're doing. But if we can move to payments as well, and obviously, you guys highlighted some of the things that impacted the results this quarter. I think you mentioned reward, the agent bank card sale, obviously, seasonality sequentially. But can you talk more broadly about business momentum?","It's obviously \u2013 it seems like a pretty important part of your strategy going forward. And do you feel like you're getting traction and how optimistic are you that you can really start to ramp up the revenues. I think you did mention that you see steady growth during the course of the year, but if you could maybe comment a little bit more broadly on your strategy, what you're seeing in the marketplace and how quickly can you really start to see that line item move in an upward trajectory?","Gregory D. Carmichael - Fifth Third Bancorp","We're optimistic that we can grow that line as we move forward. A lot of the investments that we recently made as part of Project North Star start to really take hold in the second, third, and fourth quarter of this year and into next year, of course, on the card business. We introduced a couple additional products. We completely reengineered our analytics team in that area and we're optimistic \u2013 and we're starting to see it already, some lift in that business as we had projected we would, which will continue to materialize through the year.","In addition to that cash management, we made numerous investments in technology, in fintech space, in partnerships to continue to be additive to support our verticals, which is extremely important. We continue to focus on cash management solutions such as our CPS technology. We've got over 10,000 plus devices now installed, and you're really starting to see that show up in a meaningful way as we move through the rest of this year. So we're optimistic we can grow that line item, and Tayfun, if you want to add any more color.","Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp","Yeah. So, when you think about payments business and split it into consumer and commercial; on the consumer side, with respect to balances, as Greg said, we introduced a couple of new cards in Q4. And when you do that, it tends to have an impact on just outstanding balances. So we're going through that, but those cards are getting great traction and we expect that they will contribute to balance growth.","And also, as Greg mentioned, we are truly investing in our analytical capabilities and partnering up with some teams well known in the industry to improve both the front-end analytics as well back-end. So the consumer side is going to be an important part of the picture. But on the commercial side, the two areas that we are currently very focused on is pricing and optimization and regular treasury management in the regular treasury management portfolio, which is basically a stand-alone project without even touching upon growth there. And the other piece is commercial card.","Our commercial card revenue is, in general, about $60 million, $65 million on an annual basis, but I think we are expecting with this new project of integrating commercial card into our overall relationships across the board, we are expecting healthy growth there as well. So, you will see more credit exchange coming, which is matched a little bit, obviously, with higher cash rewards, but overall going into 2018 and 2019, we are very optimistic about (01:06:17).","Saul Martinez - UBS Securities LLC","That's helpful. Did you disclose how much the sale of the agent bank card portfolio impacted the payments line year-on-year? Was it material?","Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp","Yeah, that was in the second quarter and was about $10 million...","Saul Martinez - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.","Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp","...of gains in the second quarter of last year.","Saul Martinez - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Ricky Dodds - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, guys. This is actually Ricky Dodds from Matt's team. Most of my questions have been asked, but maybe following up on Marty's question, a bigger picture one on some of the recent investments you've made. I think you said in the prepared remarks that GreenSky is performing in line with expectation. I was wondering if you could touch on some of the other recent investments there or partnerships, things like ApplePie, and perhaps give us a sense of their performance versus maybe your initial expectations and then, additionally, how meaningful can these businesses be over time? Thanks.","Gregory D. Carmichael - Fifth Third Bancorp","Yeah, first off, GreenSky, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, is ramping up, and we're very pleased on the performance of GreenSky with respect to our expectations from balance sheet perspective, but also some of the more strategic components of that on the referral part and also the investments in the technology sector embedded into our franchise will start to come on later this year. So that's going well and as planned. Other areas that we're looking at, you mentioned ApplePie, we're just in the infancy of really studying that opportunity and determining how best to position that, and right now, we're early in that phase. So I wouldn't comment too much about that one.","Other investments that we're making that will come online, as I mentioned, the mortgage loan origination platform, that comes online third quarter of this year. We'll start to roll it out segment by segment. Our branch optimization and digitization, that starts to come online later this year. So we expect to see the returns of that, and the improvement of that. And then investments in Transactis and AvidXchange are right on target with respect to our expectations. Albeit, they will be fairly modest this year, but we expect those to ramp up over time as we move into 2018 and 2019.","Ricky Dodds - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. And then, lastly, maybe a quick question on Vantiv, just wondering if you can provide maybe your updated thoughts on the stake and then what the plans would be when and if you were to decide to monetize that?","Gregory D. Carmichael - Fifth Third Bancorp","Right now, we have an equity position about 17.8% in Vantiv. We've been very, very diligent about how we've managed that position. It's a significant source of our off balance sheet capital for us. We've been very strategic with it. When you look at this, trust me, every single quarter, right now, we're comfortable where we're at, but that may change next month. But we'll continue to look at it. Once again, it's all focused on what creates the greatest value for our shareholders. And over time, our patience has paid-off well for our shareholders.","Ricky Dodds - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks, guys.","Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Marinac from FIG Partners. Your line is open.","Christopher Marinac - FIG Partners","Thanks. Just wanted to ask about the criticized loan mentioned in the slides, would that be applicable for the commercial as well?","Frank R. Forrest - Fifth Third Bancorp","I'm sorry. What is your question regarding criticized loans?","Christopher Marinac - FIG Partners","Would criticized loan be applicable for the commercial and the consumer side in terms of being flat?","Frank R. Forrest - Fifth Third Bancorp","Yes. Criticized loans were slightly up this quarter about $70 million. But, as a reminder, over the previous four quarters, criticized assets were down $955 million and we project that they will continue to remain flat to slightly improve for the rest of the year.","Christopher Marinac - FIG Partners","Great. Thanks for that, Frank. And then just a quick question for Tayfun; what are the mechanics on lower tax rates in the future? Should we be thinking of that as sort of retention of whatever cuts may occur?","Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp","Are you talking about with respect to potential changes in the tax rate regime?","Christopher Marinac - FIG Partners","Correct, correct. So for every drop in tax, how does that work?","Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp","Yeah. Look, I think, clearly, the corporate tax rate alone does not necessarily define the ultimate picture. As you know, our guidance for this year is in the 25% range. So we do have deductions and it's important for us to maintain those deductions in place as the overall corporate tax rates come down. I don't have a guidance as to what every percent of change in tax rates would be just because the outlook is very cloudy as to how the complete tax regime may look like in the future. We will benefit from it. We'll benefit more if we can maintain our reductions, but if they take it away we'll benefit less. That's our current thinking.","Christopher Marinac - FIG Partners","Great, Tayfun. Thanks very much for the color.","Tayfun Tuzun - Fifth Third Bancorp","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja. Your line is open.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. A couple of quick ones; could you give us your retail sector exposure?","Frank R. Forrest - Fifth Third Bancorp","Hi, this is Frank. Let me break it down for you. We've got right under $1 billion in CRE retail, that's broken out between the stabilized portfolio, which is about $650 million and construction, which is $350 million. And then on non-CRE retail, we have a $1 billion to general retailers and we've got another $3 billion to specialty retailers. In the non-CRE retail, the outstanding is around $1.8 billion and, to give you an idea, that's about 3.5% to 4% of our commercial portfolio, and it's performing very well.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Okay. And how much of this is ABL or is it just straight lines, unsecured lines?","Frank R. Forrest - Fifth Third Bancorp","Well, it's a combination, most of these are mid-cap and large-cap companies that tend to be revolving lines of credit, some term credit.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Okay. Thanks, Frank. Lars \u2013 a couple of questions for Lars. Lars, you mentioned something about that you're doing commodity hedges. Could you tell us what you're doing in commodity hedges and also in equity underwriting? In response to an earlier question, you mentioned both of those. What kind of an infrastructure you built up in equity underwriting?","Lars C. Anderson - Fifth Third Bancorp","Yeah. So, today, what we're essentially doing is we're laying off on the commodity hedging, we are providing risk management services effectively there to our clients as they look out into the future and they're trying to manage their margins, obviously, with a risk off environment. There's been less activity there.","The equity underwriting has been something that has been an area that we have more recently been growing. It's a relatively small part of our overall investment banking platform are dominated by loan syndications, corporate bond, underwriting. But, for selective names, we're certainly in the underwriting of often times conversion of some of their balance sheet over to equity where we can improve their capital stack. So it's an advisory-based business, and we don't expect to be a leader in equity underwriting, but it's got to be a part of the entire kind of capital stack solution advisory approach to our clients.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. So you're not in the business yet of like equity research or equity trading capabilities...?","Gregory D. Carmichael - Fifth Third Bancorp","No, we're not.","Lars C. Anderson - Fifth Third Bancorp","No, we're not.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","There are no more questions at this time.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Sameer Gokhale, Head of Investor Relations, the floor is yours.","Sameer Gokhale","Thank you, TaShawn. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. Today, we'll be discussing our financial results for the second quarter of 2017. This discussion may contain certain forward-looking statements about Fifth Third pertaining to our financial condition, results of operations, plans and objectives. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from historical performance and these statements.","We've identified some of these factors in our forward-looking cautionary statement at the end of our earnings release and in other materials, and we encourage you to review them. Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call.","Additionally, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures we reference during today's conference call are included in our earnings release along with other information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures. A copy of our most recent quarterly earnings release can be accessed by the public in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website, www.53.com.","This morning, I'm joined on our call by our President and CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Chief Operating Officer, Lars Anderson; Chief Risk Officer, Frank Forrest; and Treasurer, Jamie Leonard. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Tayfun, we will open the call up for questions.","Let me turn the call over now to Greg for his comments.","Greg Carmichael","Thanks Sameer, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. As you'll see in our results, we reported second quarter 2017 net income available to common shareholders of $344 million and earnings of $0.45 per share. our reported EPS includes negative $0.01 per share impact from the Visa total return swap. Our results for the quarter were very strong and reflected our continued focus on profitable revenue growth, expense management and credit discipline. Our ROTCE and ROA metrics improved both on a sequential and year-over-year basis as we made progress toward achieving our North Star objectives. We're also pleased that the Federal Reserve did not object to our capital plan. This will allow us to both increase our dividend and significantly increase capital distributions to our shareholders compared to last year. At approximately 120% of consensus earnings estimates, our expected payout ratio is one of the highest in the industry.","I like to make a few observations about the operating environment. Given the political gridlock, the timing of potential changes to the regulatory environment remains uncertain and expectations for more fiscal stimulus have been tempered. On the other hand, the data on jobs growth is encouraging and we like other banks are benefiting from recent Fed rate hikes. A strong jobs outlook combined with modern inflation and healthy consumer spending also leads me to believe the yield curve will steepen as long-term interest rates begin to rise. ","However, the sustainability of the strong employment data and the prospect of higher interest rates will depend on whether we see acceleration in real GDP growth. We like many of you will like to gain more clarity to get a better directional read on a longer term outlook. We are operating under the assumption that economic growth in the near term will remain muted. When I laid out our vision for North Star in September of 2016, we announced that we expect to realize significant benefits without assuming any meaningful changes in the regulatory and macro environment.","As our Q2 results demonstrate, we're going to make progress towards enhancing our profitability while improving our balance sheet resiliency. In Q2, we benefited from effective expense management, an improvement in our key credit metrics while growing revenues. Our asset sensitive balance sheet allows us to continue to benefit from increased short-term interest rates. Our commercial loan production in the second quarter was the strongest since the first quarter of 2016 with a healthy pipeline as we look ahead to the rest of the year. Our adjusted net interest margin expanded 3 basis points sequentially, exceeding our previous guidance reflecting the benefit of higher rates. In addition, we maintained pricing discipline on commercial loans which helped the overall net interest margin. Our pricing discipline partly reflects our focus on client selection as we are interested in building durable long-term relationships rather than pricing simply to drive faster near-term loan growth.","Our total average loan portfolio was flat sequentially. This reflected the impact of delivered commercial exits as well as continued decline in indirect auto loan balances. The trend in our loans continued to reflect our decision two years ago with curtailed originations to improve our returns on capital. From a commercial perspective, we announced at the beginning of the year that we plan to exit about $1.5 billion of commercial loans this year, which will impact our net loan growth. ","In the first half of 2017, we have exited $900 million of loans, split evenly between return and credit related exits. Excluding deliberate exits, our average commercial portfolio grew 3% year-over-year compared to reported decline of 2%. And in the consumer portfolio, if you exclude the auto loans, average consumer balances grew 4% year over year compared to the reported decline of 2%.","In terms of fee income, excluding the impact of [indiscernible] in earnings release, fee revenue was 7% higher sequentially. The sequential increase primarily reflected $31 million lease remarketing impairment recorded last quarter. During the second quarter, we continued to diligently manage our expenses while investing in other areas of strategic importance. For example, we invested in repositioning our brand through print, television, radio and digital advertising. While it is early, the feedback on our brand launch has been very positive. In Q2, non-interest expenses were down 3% sequentially and year-over-year. The year-over-year decline partially reflects the benefits of our early North Star initiatives to reduce expenses. We now expect 2017 expenses to be flat year-over-year and Tayfun will expand on this in his prepared remarks.","Turning to credit quality. During the quarter, credit quality continued to improve. Our criticized asset ratio decreased significantly to 5.5%, is now at the lowest level in over ten years. Non-performing assets also decreased with our NPA ratio at the lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2015. These forward-looking credit metrics to adjust that credit quality should remain relatively stable in the near term. ","Our net charge-off ratio also decreased significantly and remains at pre-crisis levels. Our capital and employee levels remain very strong with our common equity tier-1 ratio at 10.6%, while LCR exceeded the regulatory requirements over 20%. As I mentioned previously, we are very pleased with the outcome of this year's CCAR exercise. Our capital plan allows us to increase our dividend by 29% compared to current levels and increase capital deployment for share repurchases by 76% compared to last year\u2019s CCAR submission.","Under the Federal Reserve\u2019s DFAS scenario, we again show less capital destruction compared to the peer group median. The plan we submitted was prudent from a risk management perspective, but appropriately focused on achieving the right results for our shareholders. The results prove that there is no inherent conflict between those two goals. We\u2019re also making solid progress on our North Start initiatives. ","We expect to generate an ROA near 1.1% and ROTCE of roughly 11% by 2018 and remain confident in our ability to achieve our North Star targets by the end of 2019. We have previously communicated that with project North Star we expect to generate $800 million in incremental analyzed pretax income by the end of 2019. This was a function of expected base improvements, additional expense savings and revenue growth initiatives.","These improvements consist of continued improvements in our core expenses such as vendor management, staffing, and process improvements. The additional expense saves we had mentioned will come from a number of items such as IT efficiencies and facilities management. On Slide 11 of the earnings presentation, we are providing you with more specifics on North Star revenue initiatives that we expect will drive growth in pretax income. ","We expect these initiatives to drive almost $300 million of annualized pretax income growth by the end of 2019. One area of particular focus is in our commercial business, but we plan to expand that depth and breadth of our client offerings over the next few years. In commercial lending we are investing to improve fee income as well as net interest income. Our balance sheet initiatives include growth in middle market lending, with expansion to new markets, significant growth in asset-based lending and additional vertical build outs.","The objective to develop a strategic partnership with our clients by providing expertise in delivering a differentiate customer experience. This approach helps building during relationships, allows us to manage risk and drives profitability. About a year ago, we started expanding our ABL capabilities with investments in infrastructure and talent. We now have the ability to underwrite and service any type of ABL product and over the past year we have closed a number of complex deals that we could not have done before. ","In fact our ABL portfolio has roughly doubled in the past year. We have also made substantial investments to build out industry verticals. Our go-to market strategy by vertical has proven to be effective that allows us to build and leverage sector expertise to better serve the needs of our customers. We continue to evaluate new opportunities that add to our existing verticals in healthcare, T&T, energy, retail and entertainment leisure and lodging.","While we\u2019re undertaking these growth initiatives but at the same time implementing a project to improve effectiveness and efficiency of our commercial money processes to support growth and enhance client service. The objective of this project is a streamline of processes to improve cycle times, reduce our cost of serve and also provide our relationship managers with additional capacity to generate new business. This is what help produce better outcome for our clients, our employees and our shareholders. ","In capital markets, our investments include significant upgrade for technology platform, expansion of our sponsored coverage group and additional ECM and DCM capabilities with added resources and talent. Our wholesale payments initiatives include recently launched projects to grow our commercial card business, enhance our commercial portfolio with advanced liquidity managed tools to better manage cash flows and leverage technology solutions similar to AvidXchange and Transactis. These investments are all aimed at keeping our relationship and generating higher and more consistent commercial payments revenue.","Insurance is a new initiative for us with modest by expanding on expectations. We believe this business is a good complement to our other commercial offering. In the consumer business we are in the process of rolling out a new loan origination system with a correspond mortgage channel. In the fourth quarter, the new system will be implemented in our direct and retail mortgage channels. During the first half of next year, we will work on integrating the new system with our home equity platform. ","This initiative will create both NII as well as fee income opportunities while reducing our cost to originate consumer mortgages. As we discussed previously, we are also in the process of digitizing our branch operations in an effort to get to a paperless environment. This will be achieved with branch scanning, the use electronic signatures and running more self-service transactions. Once completed this initiative is expect to reduce our paper count by 700 million pages per year, with efficiency generated from reduced paper and transportation expenses, we expect to save $10 million annually.","This initiative includes replacement of our branch teller software, this new platform will improve the customer experience, mitigate compliance and operational risk through automation and ultimately improve the efficiency and speed of transaction processing. We have powered this in 10% of our branch network and are very happy with the results. We\u2019ll gradually implement this across the rest of our branch network in the second quarter of 2018. ","We are working diligently on our personal and small business lending initiatives and have entered into select partnerships to help drive loan growth. These initiatives will help us achieve a better balance between commercial and consumer loans. We are partnering with fintech companies to reduce cycle times, run our product line up and expand our distribution channels. Partnerships with companies like ApplePie Capital to enhance our product offerings and cover a wide spectrum of borrowers with the diverse funding needs.","In consumer credit cards, we have already launched an initiative to upgrade our analytical capabilities focused on growth in our footprint. We are partnering with a consulting firm with deep expertise to enhance our in-house abilities and we believe we have an opportunity to simply grow our consumer payments business. The wealth in asset management, we are focused on expanding our remarket capabilities through acquisitions, additional resource deployment and a rollout of a digital investment platform that will enhance the economics for certain clients segments. We are on target to launch the new digital platform in December. Overall, we had a very good quarter and our North Star initiatives remain on track. Tayfun will share additional financial details around these initiatives in his prepared remarks.","I would like to once again thank our employees for their hard work and dedication evident in our financial results and our customers\u2019 satisfaction scores and community outreach efforts. We certainly launched a series of community advisory forms both at the regional and national level. This gives us a terrific opportunity to increase engagement and better meet the needs of the communities in which we serve. I am also especially proud of our efforts initiated on May 3 or Fifth Third Day to provide over a million meals supporting local food banks during the quarter. ","Furthermore, we recently announced a $10 million contribution to support the Cincinnati Cancer Consortium, this gift is a critical step in supporting an effort to achieve a National Cancer Institute designation with Cincinnati Cancer Consortium and NCI designation will lead to more research funding and better outcomes for cancer patients throughout the greater Cincinnati region. I\u2019m pleased that our entire organization is aligned in fulfilling our stated purpose to improve the lives of the people in the communities we serve.","With that I\u2019ll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our second quarter results and our current outlook for the remainder of the year.","Tayfun Tuzun","Thanks Greg. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Let's begin with a financial summary on Slide 4 of the presentation. Greg mentioned, during the quarter our continued focus on disciplined expense management, the expansion of our net interest margin, stable credit quality and efficient capital management all reflected our commitment to driving improved financial performance. We achieved positive operating leverage both on a year-over-year and sequential basis during the quarter. We expect to achieve positive operating leverage again next quarter and for the full year. Overall, average loans were flat sequentially mostly as a result of continued exits from certain commercial exposures and the planned decline in our indirect auto loan balances. New origination levels were strong giving us an optimistic outlook for 2018 and beyond as the deliberate acts especially in C&I will be coming to an end this year.","Average commercial loan balances were flat sequentially and down 2% year over year. Excluding the impact of the exits that Greg mentioned in his prepared remarks, average commercial loans were up 1% sequentially. The sequential decline in average C&I balances was partially offset by 2% growth in commercial real estate loans this quarter. Much of the quarterly average growth in construction loans came from drawdowns near the end of the first quarter. With the summer construction season in full swing, we would expect client utilization to remain strong. On the other hand payouts will continue into 2013, 2014 vintages as construction loans either sell or move to the permanent market. We are currently seeing increased pipelines in office and industrial as the demand for multi-family is moderating. We've kept a conservative risk profile in construction lending and will continue to be diligent in underwriting as we are at the later stages of this cycle. Expanding new production spreads, combined with the move in LIBOR result in a 24 BP yield improvement in that portfolio.","At this time, we have roughly another $600 million of exits to go for the remainder of 2017 which should be split about evenly across the next two quarters. Excluding these anticipated exits, we expect to grow total of commercial loans in the low to mid single digits in 2017. Assuming the muted economic environment persists, including these exits we expect our commercial loan portfolio to grow by about 1% on an end of period basis, which is slightly below the guidance we gave last quarter. We remain competitive in all of our markets and maintained a disciplined approach in pricing and underwriting, which is enabling us to grow profitable relationships. To further boost future loan growth, we are expanding our commercial sales force in both regional and national businesses. As Greg mentioned, we are also looking to expand through additional geographies in middle market lending, which we expect will increase future loan and revenue growth. Average consumer loans were down 1% from last quarter and down 2% year-over-year. Excluding auto, average consumer loans were up 4% year over year. Auto loans were down 14% year over year. The reduction in auto balances continues to reflect our decision to curtail indirect originations and redeploy capital elsewhere.","Residential mortgage loans grew by 1% sequentially and 10% year over year as we continue to retain jumbo mortgages, ARMs as well as certain 10 and 15 year fixed rate mortgages on our balance sheet during the quarter. Our home equity loan originations were 17% higher this quarter sequentially and up 7% year over year. As loan paydowns in our legacy book continued to exceed strong origination volumes, portfolio outstandings decreased 3% sequentially and 8% year over year. And credit card portfolio was down 3% from the first quarter, although end of period balances were up 2% sequentially. We are seeing stronger growth related to the new card rollout that we executed at the end of last year with purchase active accounts up both sequentially and year-over-year. We expect that our simplified and more competitive card offerings along with our enhanced analytical capabilities will allow us to drive faster growth in the second half of this year and into 2018.","Excluding the deliberate deduction of indirect auto loan balances, we are expecting to grow our consumer and mortgage loans by a low to mid single digit rates in 2017. The outlook reflects our current expectation, the HELOC paydowns on older vintages will continue to outpace production in the near term. Consistent with our strategy, the redeployment of capital from indirect auto lending to other parts of our consumer lending franchise should provide further support for higher ROTCE and ROA levels. Our investment portfolio balances remained relatively stable in the second quarter as we had expected. We continue to expect to maintain our investment portfolio at roughly the same level. Average core deposits were down 1% sequentially as growth in the consumer portfolio was offset by declines in the commercial portfolio. As sequential decline in money market and interest checking accounts was offset by increases in savings balances. We feel good about our deposit balances as we continue to make rational decisions between pricing them appropriately for profitability and maintaining and growing relationship based LCR-friendly deposit.","The market especially in large commercial accounts is becoming more competitive, which we expected all along and our margin and NII outlook already reflect the market dynamics as we observed them today. Our modified liquidity coverage ratio continued to be very strong at 122% at the end of the quarter. Net interest income of $945 million was up $18 million or 2% from the previous quarters adjusted NII and is up $37 million or 4% from last year. Our strong underlying NII performance reflects the positive impact of higher short-term rates. Growth in NII came both from the consumer and commercial portfolios, reflecting higher interest rates, partially offset by the impact of higher wholesale borrowings. Over the last year, expansion in earning asset yields significantly outpaced the increase in our cost of funds. The adjusted NIM increased 3 basis points from the first quarter to 3.01% exceeding our previous guidance.","Excluding the prior quarters card remediation impact, our total loan yield was up 11 basis points sequentially, with commercial yield up 13 basis points. As we look ahead, third quarter NIM should be a couple of basis points wider than the second quarter NIM. With the assumption of a rate increase at the very end of the year, we currently expect the full-year NIM to be roughly in line with our margin in the second quarter. Overall deposit betas so far have remained low and are in the mid teens with commercial betas in the 30% range. Our guidance assumes that on a blended basis, consumer and commercial deposit betas will increase to the 40% range in the coming months for the most recent move in June. For subsequent rate hikes, we expect deposit betas to be in the 50% range. If we see betas at lower ranges, our margin could exceed our guidance.","We expect our third quarter net interest income to be up by about 2% sequentially. For the full year we expect NII growth approximately 5%. Excluding the impact of the Visa swap, non-interest income in the second quarter was $571 million compared to $536 million in the first quarter which included a $31 million lease remarketing impairment. Mortgage banking net revenue of $55 million was up $3 million sequentially. Originations were 17% higher than the first quarter and our gain on sale margin improved to 209 basis points compared with 198 basis points. Original fees were up 28% sequentially in line with our guidance. During the quarter, our origination mix was heavily weighted toward purchase volumes as refinance activity remained muted despite the lower rate environment. Approximately two thirds of the originations continued to be sourced from the retail and direct channels and the remainder originated through the corresponding channel.","This quarter we executed on the purchase of servicing rights on nearly $4 billion worth of mortgages in addition to the $6 billion we discussed with you last quarter. $2.4 billion of the nearly $10 billion has been onboarded this far, with the rest scheduled for the third quarter. Corporate banking fees of $101 million were up $27 million or 36% sequentially, reflecting the impact of the $31 million lease remarketing impairment last quarter. Corporate banking revenues this quarter reflected a broader decline in trading activity across the industry. ","We expect that this line item will exhibit some quarterly variability given the nature of the capital markets business. We currently expect corporate banking fees to increase 6% to 8% in the third quarter sequentially. We have a strong pipeline that we look to execute during the second half of the year. Deposit service charges were relatively stable, up $1 million from the first quarter of 2017 and the second quarter of 2016. Card and processing revenue increased 7% sequentially. The sequential performance was driven by an increase in customer transactions and spend volume compared to the seasonally lower first quarter.","Total wealth and asset management revenue of $103 million was down 5% sequentially, due to seasonally higher tax related private client for services revenue in the first quarter, partially offset by higher personal asset management revenue. Revenues increased 2% relative to the second quarter of 2016, mainly due to higher personal asset management and brokerage revenue. Recurring revenues in this business have increased to 80% of fees from 75% in the second quarter of 2016 and 72% in the second quarter of 2015 as we have continued to shift our product and service offerings toward more recurring revenue streams to limit our reliance on transactional activity. Excluding mortgage banking revenue and non-core items shown on Slide 14 of the presentation, we expect non-interest income to grow by 2% in 2017, the change from our previous guidance of 3% is primarily due to the second quarter\u2019s lower capital markets activity, which we expect to pick up in the second half of the year.","For the third quarter on the same basis, we expect fee growth of approximately 2% over the second quarter levels. We remain focused on disciplined expense management, while still investing for a future revenue growth. Non-interest expenses were down 3% both sequentially and year-over-year, which was better than our guidance and was broad based across nearly all of our expense lines. Since the beginning of 2016, we have been able to report improving expense results almost every quarter. ","Excluding the impact of the amortization of low income housing related investments, which nearly all of our peers show in their tax line, our efficiency ratio is approaching 60%. We will maintain our expense discipline, we now partially fund the wide array of investment that Greg discussed. We plan to invest a portion of our savings this year to drive near-term growth momentum. A good example of this is our investment in direct marketing, we believe we\u2019ve significantly improved direct marketing analytics capabilities which we have been enhancing over the last year, we will be able to impact future retail household growth to support both loan and deposit production.","As a result of our improved outlook, we will grow our direct marketing expenses in the third quarter. Similarly, our investments in technology continue to support many revenue growth and expense saving opportunities across our company. Our teller automation project is nearing completion, the mortgage project is in progress and our teams are working on the initiatives to enable easy access to direct personal credit offers. Despite all that investment activity, we now expect the expenses in 2017 to be roughly flat compared to 2016 including incremental expenses associated with new initiatives under project North Star. This improves upon our guidance last quarter that called for expenses to be up 1%. Any increase relative to this guidance would be related to higher than anticipated growth in business activity. In the absence of North Star related expenses, this guidance implicitly points to a decline by about 1.5% in 2017.","Given the expectation of a ramp up in some North Star investments and the marketing spend that I just mentioned, we currently expect third quarter expenses to be up about 1% from reported expenses in the third quarter of 2016. Our guidance today clearly reflects our commitment to achieving positive operating leverage in 2017. We are making substantive progress in lowering our efficiency ratio towards our long-term target of sub-60%. Turning to credit results on Slide 9. We are very pleased with our second quarter credit results. Total quarterly net charge offs were the lowest in nearly 17 years. Net charge-offs were $64 million or 28 basis points, an improvement from $89 million and 40 basis points in the first quarter of 2017 and from $87 million or 37 basis points in the second quarter a year ago.","The sequential improvement was driven by an $18 million decrease in C&I net charge-offs. C&I net charge-offs were positive impacted by higher than normal recovery levels. Consumer charge-offs were down $70 million sequentially and stable year over year. Total portfolio non-performing loans were $614 million, down $43 million from the previous quarter, resulting in an NPL ratio of 67 basis points. The largest concentration is in energy with roughly a third of the balances related to 2016 downgrades. New transfer to the NPL portfolio were at their lowest levels since the second quarter of 2015. Total NPAs were down 7% from last quarter, with sequential improvement in nearly all loan categories. They criticized asset ratio has decreased to 5.5% from 5.8% of commercial loans at the end of the first quarter and has had a ten-plus year low. Our loss provision was $22 million lower than last quarter reflecting the positive trends in our loan portfolio. With the resulting reserve coverage as a percent of loans and leases of 1.34% only one basis point lower than last quarter. Our allowance coverage of NPLs increased to 200% from 188% last quarter. Our previous guidance that net charge-offs will be range bound, some quarterly variability remains unchanged. And we continue to believe that our provision expense will be primarily reflective of loan growth.","Our capsule levels remained very strong during the second quarter. Our common equity tier-1 ratio was 10.6% reflecting a decrease of 12 basis points quarter over quarter and an increase of 70 basis points year-over-year. The sequential decline in capital was driven by a $342 million share buyback initiated during the quarter. Our tangible common equity excluding unrealized gains and losses decreased 13 basis points sequentially but increased 38 basis points year-over-year. The result of this year's CCAR exercise were very strong. The combination of our strong current capital levels, the continuing improvement in the risk profile of our balance sheet and our strong earnings resulted in a consensus payout ratio, which is near the top of our peer group. We expect to increase both dividends and buybacks strongly over the next four quarters subject to economic conditions and the ultimate approval of our Board of Directors.","Going forward, we intend to be balanced between dividend increases and share buybacks. As you know any future reduction in our Vantiv ownership gives us additional capacity for further share buybacks. We also think that our current capital levels are higher than what we need to run our company from a through-the-cycle safety and soundness perspective, given the significant improvement in the risk profile of our organization. As we continue to execute our strategy in this evolving regulatory environment, it is likely that we may see further decrease in our overall capital levels. At the end of the second quarter, common shares outstanding were down 11 shares or 2% compared to the first quarter of 2017 and down 17 million shares or 4% compared to last year second quarter. Book value and tangible value were both 1% from the last quarter.","With respect to taxes, we expect our third quarter tax rate to be roughly around 25.5% and a full-year 2017 tax rate to be in 24.5 to 25.5 range. Our guidance reflects the benefits from our recent actions and provide support for the initiatives under North Star. Slide 12 provides an updated outlook for your reference. As we discussed with you some of the initiatives are already impacting our performance especially on the expense side. The implied decline in our base expenses excluding our North Star related expenses is indicative of the ongoing impact of the expense initiatives. Our North Star performance expectations were clearly stated last year. End of 2019 run rate, ROTCE between 12% and 14%, ROA between 1.1% and 1.3% and efficiency ratio sub-60% without any meaningful help from the environment. We also projected that 2018 would be the first year of step up towards these targets. During last quarter's earnings call, we guided to a 1.1% ROA and 11% plus ROTCE in 2018 assuming two more rate increases this year and two more next year. We had one of the rate increases in June and we have one more project in December of this year.","If we see two more in 2018, our expectations should still hold. Our revenue growth outlook, our ability to achieve positive operating leverage without changing our risk appetite, a strong balance sheet and our strategic positioning give us confidence in our ability to create additional shareholder value. To that end, we are pleased to announce that we will be hosting our first ever Investor Day on December 7 in New York. Our Executive Team will share additional details about their businesses and the progress we are making towards our strategic objectives.","With that let me turn it over to Sameer to open the call up for Q&A.","Sameer Gokhale","Thanks Tayfun. Before we start Q&A as a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow up and then return to the queue if you have additional question. We will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have this morning. During the question and answer period, lease provide your name and that of your firm to the operator. TaShawn, please open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question does come from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill + Partners. Your line is open.","Scott Siefers","Tayfun, I was hoping you could just - obviously a lot of guidance I appreciate the transparency. As you look into the back half of the year, you suggested a rebound in corporate banking revenues off a softer 2Q due to capital markets. I\u2019m wondering if you can maybe walk through some of your expectations for some of the other drivers that you see gets you to the updated guidance for the full year, just in fee income specifically.","Greg Carmichael","Yes. So I\u2019ll make some overall comments and then Lars probably can provide some color on corporate banking. In general, our expectation, when you look at the main parts of our fee revenues, mortgage, I think, it's going to be a fairly stable quarter in the third quarter. So we're expecting the current environment to continue, so there's nothing out of the extraordinary in terms of our expectations for mortgage. Wealth and asset management has been weighing up so stably, nicely growing for us. ","The deposit piece, we're seeing payments income growing into the second half of the year similarly. I don't have any out of the ordinary expectations with respect to any of the other fee income items. I just want to remind you that we obviously, the way, as we always do, we have the fourth quarter TRA payment that we are expecting from Vantiv.","Turning over to the corporate banking side, clearly, we have a look at our pipeline and maybe Lars can provide some color on what we're seeing there.","Lars Anderson","Yes. So first of all, when you look at the overall corporate banking fees, I would point out, you may see in the appendix there that the core business lending fees were actually up nicely on a linked quarter basis and Scott that was reflective of the record production that we've had this quarter, the highest level that we've seen in -- over a year. Beyond that, obviously a lot of headwinds in the sales and trading and FICC business which you of course have seen across the industry. ","That's going to be largely driven by the yield curve, volatility in the overall market place in what we see and some of our FRM businesses. So that will impact that. The good news for us is that, is we've continued to strategically position ourselves to build out our advisory businesses, in particular in the investment banking, M&A and that's become a much bigger part of our overall, our overall corporate banking fee mix. So that's a real positive, because as I look towards the second half of the year, we're seeing activity level start to pick up, Scott, both at the larger transactional level and in our core middle market that look fairly promising. ","And I think that would help us to deliver some pretty attractive fee incomes. We're also continuing to add expertise and resources that align with a number of our industry verticals, which -- that too will be incremental I think to the growth of some of our corporate banking fees for the second half of the year and beyond.","Scott Siefers","And then finally just one kind of ticky tack question, either for you Tayfun or maybe Jamie. I think in the past, you guys have talked about securities yield in like the 305, 310 range for the full year. Any update on how you guys are thinking about?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yeah. I still believe that we will be right in that range. We think the portfolio is well positioned and we're pleased with the results.","Operator","And your o next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.","Geoffrey Elliott","Maybe starting with Vantiv, clearly there is potential for them to undertake a pretty significant transaction. I wondered if you could give some thoughts on how a big transaction by Vantiv would change, just your thoughts around continued ownership. And then second, any accounting impact from your percentage ownership dropping down?","Greg Carmichael","Geoffrey, thanks for the question. This is Greg. At this point right now, since we\u2019re just in early stage due diligence with Worldpay, we are not in a position to make any comments about that transaction or the impact or how we feel about that transaction to Fifth third. So more to come on that on our next earnings call once that transaction materializes or decided to do something different. At this point, we have no comment on that transaction.","Tayfun Tuzun","And on the equity method accounting that you were alluding to, Geoff, there is a pretty low threshold for that. I think the ownership percentage would have to decline to low single digits before the accounting methodology would change.","Geoffrey Elliott","Thank you. And then another one on non-interest income, I guess kind of taking a step back, if you look at the lines that make that up year-on-year, service charge is up 1%, wealth and asset management is up 2%, but pretty much everything else looks like it's down year-on-year. So how should we think about understanding that in the context of the growth initiatives that you're talking about?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yeah, I think, the one comment that I will make because it is such a large item, corporate banking piece are a significant line item and there is fee income associated obviously with the nearly $4.5 billion of loans that we've exited over the last 18 months. So we need to take that into account when analyzing the year-over-year change in corporate banking. ","As we move forward and reach the end of the year, with those exits coming to an end, I would expect the momentum in corporate banking to actually move up. And also in capital markets, on page 11, we are listing a number of initiatives that directly impact being fee income growth in addition to other areas such as wholesale payments, insurance. So as we look forward into \u201918 and \u201919, there are some significant pick-ups in all of these areas with respect to fee income growth expectations.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is open.","Gerard Cassidy","Greg, when you look at what the Treasury proposed about a month ago in changes for the banking industry, both legislatively and regulatorily, if you had to pick one or two that you think would best benefit Fifth Third, what would those choices be of some of the proposals they meant.","Greg Carmichael","First of all, so I think on the, of course, the thing was very well done and 149 pages, [indiscernible] institutions and some of the things that they\u2019re looking at and we\u2019re all basically put together by input from the banks and I think LCR would be one that we want to look at, they\u2019re looking at, if we can see some improvement on how that is calculated and how that\u2019s viewed. I think that would be very positive.","In addition to that, I think overall on the capital management, I mean, as we talked about, we\u2019re strong from a capital perspective, our ability to put that capital and making it easier for us to do business, especially in the area of small business lending and some of the changes that the guidance would suggest, I think it would be make it easier for us to serve that sector. So those are the two areas that we like to see some progress made. And then obviously from a regulatory perspective overall, some of the activity with the [indiscernible], trying to get that a little more fluid and a little less complex in some of the redundancy that creates, the cost to create for banks would be another step forward I think and allowing us to better serve our customers.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. And I apologize if you guys mentioned this on the call and I missed it, but when you -- when we look out, as you mention you're in a strong capital position, did well in CCAR, what's the long term dividend payout ratio you guys think you'll get comfortable with. Obviously, the Fed seems to have lifted that line in the sand at the 30% mark where you guys can go higher or how do you guys think about it?","Greg Carmichael","First off, it really gets down to how we view our forward earnings opportunities and the amount of capital we have to deploy. As the CCAR data suggests, we\u2019ve got forward an increased dividend of 2% this quarter, another 2% or $0.02 in the 9 months from now. So that's very strong. I would see that south or north of 30%, but with respect to putting a number on it right now, I don't want to do that, but I think if you look at the next -- the next 9, 12 months, I think we feel really good about our ability to increase our dividend and deploy capital for that line.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Ken Usdin","Thanks again for that revenue slide on North Star. I wanted to ask you, you mentioned that you're not including the baseline in the expense initiatives, so just given the fact that you guys can or willing to articulate the revenue side of North Star, can you help us understand what was originally I think you guys said 150 million to come from the cost side and how you'd expect that to kind of project and manage the overall growth rate of expenses? Thanks.","Lars Anderson","Yes. Thanks, Ken. So when we started to play out our expectations last year, we mentioned that about 45% of the improvement will come from an uplift in our base performance and we still believe that is the case. And we clearly have a very strong business composition and we look to see better performance over the next two years. In terms of -- you are correct, in terms of the expenses, our expectation is roughly 20% of that money, of that amount that we identified. Obviously, we have started some of those initiatives and the ongoing improvement in our actual expenses and expense guidance reflects the results, whether it\u2019s related to vendor re-negotiations, any work space management savings or even on just headcount efficiencies. ","I think we are moving on with some of those initiatives. As we look forward and we discussed this in some meetings last quarter with investors, we expect our base expenses, excluding North Star related investments to remain well managed. We will be entering our planning period here shortly in the next 90 days and our guidance to our businesses will be to maintain their expense base, the core expense base into next year, but we will see what the outcome will be and we will update all of you during the Investor Day, but we clearly expect ongoing efficiencies coming out of our business as we look forward.","Ken Usdin","Okay. So we'll look forward to that update. Then just one follow-up on the NIM, to clarify before, you\u2019re 305, 310 on the securities book and what you're expecting for the full year on NIM, but can you just talk about just progression from here and the puts and takes given the June hike and then just the balancing act between deposit betas and asset repricing. Thanks.","Jamie Leonard","Sure. This is Jamie. As you look ahead on the third quarter NIM, we do expect as Tayfun mentioned, a two basis point expansion from the second quarter 301 into the third quarter and that\u2019s really driven by three basis points improvement from the June Fed move, net of the deposit betas, which is a 40% assumption and then 2 basis points of improvement from continued loan pricing discipline and the favorable loan mix shift you're seeing on the balance sheet and that's offset by 1 basis point erosion from day count and 2 basis points of a detriment from our funding actions, which you saw in part was the June holding company issuance. And so in our outlook, we do assume a December Fed move in, however as we said here today, that's looking less likely. The good news is it doesn't have that big an impact on our projections.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Erika Najarian","Just a follow-up question on fees, I just want to make sure understanding the fee guidance correctly, so based upon which we\u2019re growing full year fees adjusted on a 2% basis ex-mortgage, is that 2016 base, 2.1 billion.","Tayfun Tuzun","That's correct.","Erika Najarian","Okay. And so if I think about the progression again, I mean my peers had sort of asked about this, but the progression is pretty significant on an implied basis so if 500 -- if the adjusted fee is in the first quarter with 484 and the second quarter is 516 and then you gave us guidance for 3Q that implies 526, that means that fourth quarter fees ex-mortgage would have to be over 600 million. And I'm wondering what I'm missing there or if I'm not missing anything, what's driving that significant progression upward.","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes. So Erika, just another reminder that in the fourth quarter, as we\u2019ve had for many years now, we have a 40 plus million dollar payments related to the Vantiv TRA agreement. So that\u2019s clearly the small item that moves the fourth quarter fee income up. In addition to that, there are a couple of obviously pipeline related expectations in corporate banking. The timing of that is, we cannot necessarily plan for the timing. We are laying it out for the second quarter and that\u2019s providing a lift and also, relative to the first quarter, which was weaker in corporate banking, I think the third and fourth quarter numbers look better. That's what\u2019s driving the increase as we approach the end of this year.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And just as a follow-up question, just switching gears, as you pointed out during the call, the CET1 ratio of 10.7 seems very robust for your size and risk profile. And I'm wondering what your thoughts are over time what an appropriate, sustainable level of CET1 would be for your company?","Tayfun Tuzun","I think that given the risk profile of our company, in the long term, the company can be operated with a capital ratio of 8.5% to 9%, but I think it's very early for us to guide to that, but if the regulatory environment continues to evolve in a direction it has been, we can see our capital ratios starting to move to a nine handle. And whether or not we can take it down below that would be a reach at this point, but somewhere around 9.5% is clearly a very good number that we can achieve without the significant change. Our CCAR filing has a 10% number as we exit the currency CCAR period. So there is some room for us to improve our leverage ratio from the current level.","Erika Najarian","And just squeezing one more in since Greg mentioned LCR as a binding constraint that you'd like to go away, given your robust LCR today, how much in freed liquidity could be deployed if LCR is not applicable to bank your size?","Jamie Leonard","Yeah. This is Jamie. A couple of benefits from the -- if the LCR were to be eliminated, there are benefits besides the ability to deploy those excess securities into loans or other things, including the flexibility to rotate out of the lower yielding level one securities into level twos. That help would be 20, 25 basis points of yield enhancement. Right now, we're up about $10 billion of level ones and then that also generates a better convexity profile going forward. So the benefits aren't just the ability to deploy the excess capital or the excess liquidity. It's also what we currently hold could generate higher returns. ","Right now, in our LCR calculation, 122% at the end of the quarter, within that number, we have about 2.9 billion of level 2As above the cap. So at a minimum, that could be deployed. And then, the final benefit that we see from an LCR revision standpoint is that certain classes of deposits will certainly become more bankable and more valuable, such as financial sector deposits that have 100% outflow assumption and we believe that could alleviate some of the pricing pressure that we're seeing on commercial deposits today.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ken Zerbe","I guess first question just in terms of slide 11 you have in terms of North Star, specifically the personal lending line, it's obviously the biggest contributor to the 299 million, but can you just remind us, maybe break it out a little bit more, I mean how much of that 74 comes from tech enhancements versus the higher net interest income from unsecured lending, which I would imagine would come at a bit more risk than the rest of your portfolio. Thanks.","Lars Anderson","First of all, let me answer the first part of your question. That's a combination of our own credit card growth, so pure net interest income and our GreenSky partnership where we continue to grow the portfolio. In addition to that, we also have expectations of an expanded offer for our own personal unsecured lines. In terms of the risk profile, Ken is, we, first of all, the GreenSky portion of that growth is coming at a super prime level. I mean, we're talking about 750, 760 type FICO scores. ","We\u2019re monitoring that and it's behaving within our expectations. So we don't see a significantly increased risk profile, even in our under stressed conditions. Similarly, in our credit card portfolio, the focus is in footprints and this is retail customers who have a very positive credit risk profile. And the same approach would be used in our own personal unsecured lending. So our expectation is this growth is not going to alter the risk profile of our consumer lending.","Ken Zerbe","Got it. Okay. And just sort of related credit question. On slide 19, you talk about your retail exposure. So thanks for the additional information there. But you do mention the 3.1 billion as being higher risk retail and I just want to kind of make sure we clarify, like how much of that is truly, truly higher risk? Are you seeing deterioration and I see you have anchor malls or mall anchors, regional malls, et cetera, and how do you differentiate the risk within that retail portfolio?","Frank Forrest","Hey, this is Frank. Good question. I would call it core retail, higher risk is probably not the right terminology. So think about it this way. As the slide shows, we\u2019ve got just over 3.1 billion all in, in retail exposure floor that we manage. We manage the vast majority of that -- two thirds of that through our vertical, very closely 3% of our total loan book, it\u2019s not substantial. When you look at the 1.9 billion on the slide, most of that is specialty retail. The remainder of that would be general retail. ","The vast majority of that is not to the clothing sector or to the electronics store sector that\u2019s been most volatile, 3% of it\u2019s the mall anchors, but really what\u2019s more important to your question is that 98% of the specialty and general retail that you see there ,the 1.9 billion, they\u2019re pass rated credits. There's only 2% of that portfolio that\u2019s criticized. ","So we're not seeing deterioration. It\u2019s performing better than our overall C&I book at this point. When you look at the balance, there's less than $1 billion in CRA, which gets a lot of attention, 769 million. Only a third of that is to regional malls, you know that over 80% are to AB property. So we feel very good overall and the REIT book is primarily very high grade exposure. We feel very good about the overall exposure we have to retail. So higher risk is really not the right term when the vast majority of this portfolio is [indiscernible] performing to our expectations.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is open.","John Pancari","On the commercial loan growth front, for the second quarter, aside from the exits that you flagged, it still appears that the underlying commercial growth trends were somewhat weaker and I know part of that could be some of the -- on the real estate side, some of the permanent financing market impact, but what other areas did you see any softness in the quarter and is it indicative of any demand factors on the commercial side? Thanks.","Tayfun Tuzun","Speaking specifically, I think John to this quarter, we saw a pickup in activity frankly and it was across nearly all of our verticals with the exception of healthcare, which we've been managing very carefully over the last couple of years is, there's obviously a lot of uncertainty there to client selection and working carefully with that vertical. It\u2019s been a high priority for us, but we've seen nice growth in a number of our verticals that I mentioned previously. Commercial real estate is really, that's actually been a source of some growth for us. I would not see that as a headwind. ","A lot of the growth that we've seen more recently over the past two quarters to our earlier point is later stage, the maturity of our construction portfolio, but we would expect that the growth rate of that would begin to reduce over a period of time. In fact, if you looked at it, commercial real estate on a year-over-year versus linked quarter, you would see that already beginning to play out. If you look across our core middle market franchise, we saw a pickup in activity level. In fact, we saw the highest production in our core middle market also this past quarter in over a year. ","Indiana, Florida, Tennessee, North Carolina is a perennial leader in the clubhouse there. So I'm feeling more optimistic about our ability to grow that core middle market franchise in commercial -- overall commercial portfolio. But it will certainly be influenced by the overall economic environment as we head into the second half of the year, but pipelines look promising. We're investing resources into it. We're expanding our capabilities and frankly I think that we're well positioned to grow that for a number of quarters to come.","Lars Anderson","John, I wouldn't describe our second quarter activity as weaker. I mean, we had -- it was strongest origination quarter since the first and second quarter.","Greg Carmichael","John, the other thing I would add John is, if you excluded the strategic assets of 600 million and look at what we\u2019ve done this year, we would be up 3% year-over-year in the commercial growth and that\u2019s the focus of the organization is on the opportunity that we\u2019re looking forward to, that the relationship we want to bank. I think we\u2019re doing a pretty good job, especially in a very muted environment, we\u2019re doing a pretty good job of building these relationships. We\u2019re growing our commercial relationships, we\u2019re growing our consumer households. That\u2019s what this bank is focused on, the quality, return profile of our balance sheet and that\u2019s been evidenced in the numbers we discussed today.","John Pancari","Okay. So that decline, the modest decline in end of period commercial balances on a linked quarter basis and the 3% year-over-year decline in commercial balances, that\u2019s mainly all the, for the quarter, that\u2019s mainly all the exits then?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes.","Greg Carmichael","Yes. Like I said, 2% is for the full -- where we're at right now on the strategic assets. If that comes to an end John, at the end of this year, those strategic assets are done, we\u2019ve accelerated those types of assets, I think the outcomes with respect to yield, with respect to credit quality we\u2019ve got, demonstrate that was the right decision. Our thought around the indirect auto lending and what we\u2019re seeing with used car prices and the volumes out there, we\u2019re a year ahead of everybody else. We like what we\u2019re doing in that sector. Once again, it\u2019s about quality and being good for this cycle. So we feel really good about production and where we\u2019re at for the remainder of this year, given the environment we\u2019re operating in, the competitive nature of the quality relationships that we\u2019re going to go after. So I\u2019m very encouraged with what the team is producing.","Tayfun Tuzun","And one last thing John that I would just kind of give is evidence of the growth of our quality portfolio with very careful client selection is, we continue to take market share in the investment banking face, for regional banks, we\u2019ve done that throughout \u201916 and this year. That's a key part of our relationship building, fine strategy, aligning that with where we want to grow, right risk appetite, right risk profile, right return profile.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Your line is open.","Saul Martinez","Wanted to ask about capital allocation strategy, you obviously have a ton of excess capital, especially in light of, Tayfun, your commentary about where you can operate ultimately. And so in, obviously you have Vantiv in your back pocket, but how do you think about capital allocation in the context of M&A, your M&A strategy? And once you get off of any sort of regulatory or CRA restrictions, how would you be thinking about potentially doing something from a, not only just degeneration businesses, but would depository institutions also be part or could they be part of this strategy?","Greg Carmichael","So right now, our focus is building a strong bank with all the objectives that we've already stated as project. So that\u2019s job one for this business right now that we\u2019re focused on. We've been very, very thoughtful about how we deploy capital for strategic opportunities in the non-depository sector, non-banking sector such as our investments in the fin-tech space, wealth and asset management, insurance space. We\u2019ll continue to do that and deploy capital smartly in those opportunities because it creates the opportunity for us to enhance our value proposition to our customers. That makes sense. With respect to doing a brick and mortar bank type of deal, that is right now not in front of us. It's not we're focused on. And the regulatory environment will play itself out and the environment at some point will probably be more conducive to doing these type of deals, but right now, it's not what we're focused on.","Saul Martinez","Just switching gears, very helpful color on Project North Star, the revenue growth plans. Can you just give us a sense so as to how much of the growth in the or the revenue figures for \u201918 and \u201919 are sort of fee based opportunities and how much of it is more balance sheet driven or NII. Could you give us a sense of sort of the parameters around that?","Greg Carmichael","Hey, Saul. I\u2019ll give it to Tayfun in a second, but we\u2019ve communicated, it\u2019s really a third, a third, a third of our North Star, 800 million. A third of it is expense, A third of it is balance sheet optimization and a third from fees. So in general, that\u2019s how you should think about the numbers we\u2019re putting forth and how we\u2019ll achieve that 800 million improvement.","Tayfun Tuzun","Yeah. I think, Saul, it\u2019s, the one area in terms of balance sheet growth, given some direction with respect to GreenSky alone and that will move the balance sheet. The other balance sheet items are likely to come towards the end of 2018 and into 2019nine. And when we get together in December, in the Investor Day meeting, we will give you a better breakdown of fee versus net interest income.","Saul Martinez","Right. So if I look at -- if I think about the 112 and the 299 respectively, it sounds like it's really more fee generation that -- at least initially than sort of balance sheet and NII.","Tayfun Tuzun","The goal is, yeah, I mean I think at the beginning, you'll see a higher fee income growth and NII growth will probably catch up to a certain extent in 2019.","Saul Martinez","And final just related question, in terms of, there was obviously a big swing 13 million to 112. Just the glide path, should we be thinking that\u2019s later \u201918 or earlier \u201918 or any sense of just the glide path in terms of when that really starts to kick in and move the needle on your revenue growth.","Tayfun Tuzun","Yeah. Many of these projects are longer term projects that start to provide the bottom line support. So it is going to be more back ended than front ended.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Christopher Marinac with FIG Partners. Your line is open.","Christopher Marinac","Thanks. So just want to go back to the improvements on the portfolio and the quality of relationships, et cetera. Should we be seeing some loan pricing improvements the next couple of quarters or again going back to the North Star improvements that you outlined in terms of what it captured there?","Lars Anderson","Yeah. So I mean, first of all, I would tell you, we were pleased to see loan spreads actually widen on new production this quarter. We continue to stay very disciplined in terms of our pricing strategy and overall relationship strategy. I'm not sure that I would count on that type of expansion on a linked quarter basis throughout the balance of the year, but I do think it evidences our overall sales force\u2019s commitment to building out relationships with a very disciplined credit pricing, but overall commitment to relationship pricing.","Tayfun Tuzun","Yeah. I think, Chris, two factors that play a role there. One is the exit, especially the credit related exits that carry a higher coupon, so from a overall portfolio yield perspective, we are very pleased that we achieved what we achieved even after that and then the other one is the market continues to be very competitive. It\u2019s difficult to be predictive about the widening of spreads.","Lars Anderson","Yes. So back to John\u2019s question about loan growth in those first two quarters, if you think about that $900 million that came out, there was a large portion of that that we would define as leverage, higher coupon and yet in spite of that, we were able to execute in verticals and in areas where frankly we've been able to largely offset that.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Matt O'Connor","The expenses came in a lot lower than I think you were guiding to a few months ago, I think it's about maybe 25 million, which obviously annualizes a big number. And I'm just wondering is that realization of some of the efficiency savings a little bit sooner, is it some of the fee revenues coming in a little bit weaker, kind of general lumpiness, just help reconcile the expenses being much lower than what you thought a few months ago?","Greg Carmichael","This is Greg, Matt. I think first off, we'd done a nice job of managing our personnel expenses and really focused on that. Also, the other areas of non-discretionary line items, we've been very myopic and really going out to what we see those opportunities. We put the pedal down, so to speak, on continued focus on vendor management, information technology and those areas. So we feel that most of that improvement really didn\u2019t come from a production perspective, came really from our focus on improvement in expenses and the organization is well designed to go after these opportunities, we put a lot a focus on it and quite frankly some of it just matured quicker than we anticipated and which is encouraging, because a better execution and a better credibility to execute on these plays, so we're very proud of what we're seeing right now that\u2019s mostly on just execution initiatives.","Operator","And there are no further questions over the phone at this time.

A copy of our most recent quarterly earnings release can be accessed by the public in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website, www.53.com. ","This morning, I\u2019m joined on the call by our President and CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO Tayfun Tuzun; Chief Operating Officer Lars Anderson; Chief Risk Officer Frank Forrest, and Treasurer Jamie Leonard. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Tayfun, we will open the call up for questions.","Let me turn the call over now to Greg for his comments.","Greg Carmichael","Thanks Sameer, and thank all of you for joining this morning. Earlier today, we reported second quarter 2018 net income available to common shareholders of $563 million and earnings of $0.80 per share. Included in these results are several items noted on Slide 4 of the investor presentation. On a net basis, these items had a positive impact of $0.17 on our reported earnings per share. Excluding these items, our quarterly EPS was up approximately 11% on a sequential basis and up 37% year-over-year. ","Our financial results for the quarter were strong and reflect our continued focus on driving profitable revenue growth, managing expenses prudently, and disciplined underwriting. I am also pleased that we are realizing the benefits of several initiatives we implemented under Project North Star. ","Before discussing the highlights of the quarter, I\u2019d like to make a few observations about the macroeconomic environment. Recent economic data has shown acceleration in GDP growth. Labor markets are strong and the unemployment rate is still very low, but the resulting skill labored shortage may constrain GDP growth. Recent discussions about tariffs have also created uncertainty. As many of you know, the U.S. economy is now in the second-longest period of economic expansion on record. It is unclear how long the positive momentum will continue. In the current economic environment, we believe it is prudent to remain cautious and to maintain our disciplined focus on credit quality and profitability.","Moving on to our quarterly results, our financial performance for the second quarter was strong and continued to reflect the benefits of actions we undertook under Project North Star. Commercial loan originations were strong even though we remained focused on disciplined underwriting and client selection during the quarter. Commercial middle market originations were up over 25% year-over-year, the highest levels in years, while corporate banking originations increased by 28% year-over-year to a record high during the quarter. This strong growth partly reflects the benefit of our commercial client experience initiative, or CCEI, which we implemented earlier this year. You may recall that CCEI was an end-to-end process redesign initiative. Recent results show that we have reduced cycle times in middle market lending by 30 to 35%, exceeding our original expectations. The reduced cycle times have allowed our commercial relationship managers to become more productive, helping drive very strong, high quality growth in loan originations.","Average credit card balances were up a very healthy 7% year-over-year while card purchase volume was up 10% year-over-year. One of our initiatives under Project North Star was to deploy advanced analytics in the credit card business in order to improve activation and usage rates. We have already started seeing the benefits as growth in our credit card purchase volume is significantly outpacing competitors in our footprint. This is a meaningful shift from a year ago when we lagged our peers.","Fee income reflected very strong growth in public banking revenue and a strong deal pipeline as we entered the second quarter. Total corporate banking revenue grew 36% sequentially to $120 million. Over the quarter, we have begun to see the benefits of the implementation of Vision 2020, which is also part of North Star. Vision 2020 is the digital redesign of our financial risk management interface which allows our commercial clients to interact in a real time environment and make better decisions using market data. I believe that our continued focus on offering the right products, executing well, and delivering on strong customer experience is helping to drive these results. A great example is Coker Capital, a healthcare M&A advisory firm which we acquired in February. I\u2019m very pleased with our corporate banking results, and we expect to build on this momentum going forward.","We recently completed the implementation of our new mortgage loan origination system across all of our channels. The new mortgage loan system significantly improves our capacity to originate mortgages and enhances the efficiencies of our processes. Although the mortgage business is currently under pressure due to a very tight gain on sale margins and low inventories, we expect to see the benefits of our new loan origination system over time. ","During the quarter, we expanded our wealth and asset management pools with the launch of Optify, an automated investment advisory platform. Optify will enable Fifth Third to build upon our established advisor-led approach and offer an integrated digital experience.","One of the areas we talked about at our investor day was the use of enhanced analytics across our bank, including deployment of geosciences capabilities to help optimize our branch network. In the second quarter, we leveraged these newly developed analytical capabilities to evaluate our physical branch network. This evaluation supports a three-year plan which results in the closure of approximately100 to 125 branches, mostly in legacy slow growth areas, while opening roughly the same number in higher growth locations with more attractive demographics. We believe this plan is the right long-term strategy to increase households and further support revenue and deposit growth.","We continue to enhance our digital capabilities but believe the physical branch is still relevant and plays an important role in giving customers an integrated banking experience. As we strategically close branches, we will continue to invest in our digital capabilities. ","We\u2019ve already seen positive results from our digital investments. On the consumer front, new checking account production volumes through digital channels were up approximately 50% year-over-year. Additionally, 54% of our total consumer deposits are made through our mobile and digital ATM channels, and nearly two-thirds of all customer transactions are now completed digitally. We are also seeing substantial benefits on the commercial side of the house. We recently launched a managed payable solution and an advanced electronic FX platform. In addition, we continue to see strong enrollment growth in our commercial portal. Although we have primarily focused our digital capabilities in footprint, our architecture is structured to give us the flexibility to expand outside our current footprint. ","Our digital transformation efforts have received a significant amount of industry recognition. I was pleased that Tim Spence, who heads our Payments, Strategy and Digital Solutions team was recently named Digital Banker of the Year by the American Bankers Association. This award was well deserved for Tim\u2019s efforts in leading Fifth Third\u2019s digital transformation.","As I touched on earlier, our focus on managing expenses continues while we invest for future growth. During the second quarter, we completed another phase of workforce reductions. These reductions were primarily concentrated in back office and support functions and we incurred a $19 million charge related to severance expense. We expect to reduce headcount to generate an additional $80 million in expense savings over the next 12 months. Although these reductions involve difficult decisions, we believe that they are the right decision for our bank as they not only reduce expenses but also result in more streamlined processes across our businesses.","Turning to credit quality, our results continue to reflect the benefit of actions we took to reduce volatility of credit losses and to improve the resiliency of our balance sheet. In 2016 and 2017, we exited $5 billion of loans that did meet our risk or return requirements. We announced this in 2016 as part of our balance sheet optimization goal within North Star. As we have exited these loans and remained focused on disciplined client selection, we have continued to see an improvement in key forward indicators of credit quality. Our criticized asset ratio decreased significantly to 3.87% from 4.83% in the first quarter and 5.5% in the second quarter of 2017. We believe that our criticized ratio has moved from one of the highest in our peer group to one of the lowest over the last two years. This improvement should bode well for us, especially when the economic cycle turns. ","As you can see from these highlights, our North Star initiatives are progressing very well and we are seeing the benefits in our results. We expect most of the remaining initiatives to be executed by the end of this year. This timeline is well in line with our plan to integrate MB Financial as the transaction closes. ","In the second quarter, we received the results of our CCAR submission and were very pleased with the outcome. As expected, we received a non-objection to our capital plan, allowing us to increase our dividend by 33% and increase capital deployment for share repurchases by 42% compared to last year\u2019s CCAR submission. We view the non-objection as very positive and we are pleased that we were allowed to continue to return capital to shareholders without waiting for a response to our upcoming submission pro forma for MB Financial. ","We continue to make good progress towards the close of MB and have assembled a talented and experienced team from both companies to move forward with our integration plan. Tayfun will provide additional details on our progress, but one of the key areas of focus is on employee and customer retention. As I mentioned when we announced the transaction, Mitch Feiger, the CEO of MB Financial will continue as Chairman and CEO of the combined franchise in Chicago. Several members of Mitch\u2019s current leadership team will lead the business going forward, complemented by members of the Fifth Third team in Chicago. We have identified specific roles for these individuals and the majority of them will report directly to Mitch. ","We believe that retaining talented leaders from both organizations will serve to help both employee as well customer retention. We are maintaining regular communication with employees from both companies and are also conducting customer listening sessions on an ongoing basis. The listening sessions are meant to address any questions or concerns that customers may have. We are pleased that we have seen minimal employee or customer disruption since we announced the acquisition. With the organizational structure in place and the right team members to lead the integration efforts, we are confident that we\u2019ll be able to realize the cost savings we announced in May.","At the time of the announcement, we intentionally excluded revenue synergies when discussing the financial impact of the acquisition. Based on our current analysis, which is still ongoing, we expect to achieve between $60 million and $75 million in pre-tax income from revenue synergies by year three. We intend to update you with additional details on these benefits between now and closing. The larger part of these revenue synergies is in our combined commercial banking business. We intend to realize these synergies by leveraging MB\u2019s capabilities in core middle market ABL and leasing across our footprint. ","We also plan to expand business relationships with current MB commercial customers in Chicago while offering our more comprehensive set of capital markets and treasury management products and services. With additional revenue synergies, we expect the IRR from the transaction to increase an additional 150 to 200 basis points and tangible book value earn-back to decrease from 6.8 years to 5.9 years. We continue to believe that the economics of this transaction are very compelling and look forward to sharing our progress with you over the course of the year.","I\u2019d like to once again thank our employees for their hard work, dedication, and for always keeping the customer at the center, which is evident in our financial results. We were pleased to have recently received validation of our efforts from two separate, independent third parties. First, Kiplinger just named Fifth Third the Best Regional Bank and runner-up for the Best Private Bank across the entire U.S. based on the strength of our offerings. We were the only bank mentioned in both categories. Our decision sciences team won the 2018 Special Achievement in Geosciences Award, which recognizes organizations across the globe for making significant advancements in the scientific field of geosciences. We received this award for the innovative work related to our branch network analytics. ","I was pleased we were again able to deliver strong results, and we remain on track to achieve our North Star targets.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our second quarter results and our current outlook.","Tayfun Tuzun","Thanks Greg. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Let\u2019s move to the financial summary on Slide 4 of the presentation.","As Greg mentioned, during the quarter NIM expansion, strong commercial loan originations, diligent expense management and significant improvement in key credit quality indicators reflected the progress we have made to enhance our financial performance while maintaining the resiliency of our balance sheet. Reported results were positively impacted by the items noted on Page 1 of our release. ","The most significant item was a $205 million pre-tax gain from the sale of the Worldpay shares. We believe the timing of the sale and the expected return of capital via buybacks in the coming quarters will be rewarding for our shareholders, given the recent trading range of our stock. The remaining unrealized gain in our Worldpay stake is approximately $400 million based on their current stock price. Our ownership percentage is about 3.3% and at this level, we continue to use the equity method of accounting. The sale also generated $120 million in incremental pre-tax TRA benefits to be recognized over the 15-plus years.","The gain along with an $11 million positive pre-tax benefit from GreenSky\u2019s IPO was partially offset by a $30 million branch network optimization charge, $19 million in pre-tax compensation expense primarily related to a workforce reduction, a $10 million pre-tax charge related to the Visa total return swap, and a $10 million pre-tax contribution to the Fifth Third Foundation. Excluding these items, our underlying core ROA and ROTCE metrics continue to substantially improve. Core ROA of 1.33% improved 10 basis points sequentially with core ROTCE of 14.6% improving 1.3% from our adjusted first quarter results. ","Moving to Slide 5, during the second quarter, average total portfolio loans were flat compared to the first quarter of 2018. Growth in C&I and personal loans was offset by decreases in home equity loans and commercial leases. Commercial loan growth of 1% was driven by strong origination activity in both middle market and large corporate loans. As Greg mentioned previously, our corporate banking originations this quarter were the highest ever and commercial middle market originations were the highest in years. However, pay-offs near the end of the quarter were elevated, which resulted in slightly slower than anticipated loan growth for the quarter. Much of the pay-down activity was the result of clients tapping the capital markets, and we were able to capture capital market fees associated with those pay-downs. Assuming the rhetoric around trade war subsides, we expect to achieve our previously discussed loan growth targets for the year.","On the topic of tariffs, it is still too early to tell whether they will have much of an impact on our clients\u2019 businesses. Our discussions with them indicate that they intend to pass the higher costs onto their customers, but it is unclear whether they will be able to achieve a complete offset, which may affect their profitability and growth plans. We will continue to monitor the situation closely.","Average C&I balances were up 1% or approximately $510 million compared to the first quarter of 2018, and were up 2% or approximately $690 million year-over-year. The sequential increase in average C&I balances was partially offset by a 3% decline in commercial leases. We expect commercial leases to continue to decline another $150 million through the end of the year. This reflects our goal to decrease our exposure to non-relationship based leases that have historically experienced significant fluctuations in asset values.","Similar to prior quarters, price competition in commercial lending remains aggressive. We are continuing to focus on striking an appropriate balance among growth, risk management and profitability. ","Average commercial real estate loan balances were flat sequentially in the second quarter with mortgage down 1% and construction up 2%. We will continue to maintain a cautious approach in commercial real estate lending, particularly in certain segments of multi-family given where we are in the cycle. We currently expect our end-of-period total commercial portfolio to grow by about 3% sequentially in the third quarter. For the full year, we expect the portfolio to grow by 4%, including the impact of the planned run-off of our national leasing business.","In consumer, average loans were down 1% sequentially and flat year-over-year, but were up 2% year-over-year excluding auto. Auto loans were down 5% year-over-year, reflecting the ongoing impact of our decision to curtail originations and redeploy capital elsewhere. The rate of decline in the auto portfolio should continue to slow as we expect originations to increase to about $4 billion in 2018 from $3.7 billion in 2017. Higher origination levels reflect the more attractive returns we\u2019ve been seeing so far this year.","Average residential mortgage loans were flat sequentially and up 1% year-over-year with continued balance sheet retention of jumbo mortgages and arms. Separately, we acquired a $2 billion servicing portfolio to be on-boarded in the third quarter, bringing the total acquired servicing portfolio to $14 billion since the beginning of last year. ","Our average credit card portfolio was flat sequentially, but balances grew by 7% year-over-year as we are starting to see the benefits of North Star. We expect card balance growth in the mid to high single digits for 2018. ","Personal and other consumer loans increased 8% sequentially to $1.7 billion. This quarter, we also launched a new digital lending enhancement that allows our customers to apply for a loan on our mobile app and receive funds almost instantly. We believe that we are one of the only banks to offer this.","In the third quarter, we expect total end-of-period consumer loan balances to be relatively flat compared to the second quarter. For 2018, we expect end-of-period loan growth of approximately 1%, reflecting continued mortgage origination weakness. Excluding indirect auto loans, we expect consumer loan growth of about 2%.","Our average investment portfolio increased 1% in the second quarter as market dynamics led to a few opportunistic purchases. We expect to maintain our portfolio balance at roughly the same level in the third quarter. ","We had solid deposit performance and household growth in the second quarter. Average core deposits were up 1% sequentially. An increase in interest-bearing commercial and consumer account balances was partially offset by lower commercial demand account balances. As is typical in a rising rate environment, we continue to experience deposit migration from demand deposits to interest-bearing accounts. Overall, deposit markets have been very competitive, particularly for operational commercial deposits. Despite the environmental pressures, we believe we have an opportunity to steadily grow the consumer book, leveraging our recent success in analytical driven direct marketing. In addition, over the long term our decision to open new branches in high growth markets will enable our retail franchise to support a higher deposit growth rate. From a profitability perspective, these new branches will be more efficient as they will be highly automated, smaller in size, and require lower staffing levels than the branches we are planning to close. ","Taxable equivalent net interest income of $1.024 billion was up $25 million or 3% from the first quarter, reflecting higher short-term market rates, a higher day count, and growth in middle market C&I loans. The NIM increased three basis points from the first quarter to 3.21% and has expanded 20 basis points on a year-over-year basis. The sequential improvement was primarily driven by higher short-term market rates and growth in higher yielding commercial loans, partially offset by a higher day count and incremental commercial deposit pricing pressure, as I mentioned earlier.","Our cumulative beta leading up to the June 2018 Fed hike was 29%, with consumer in the low 20s and commercial in the high 40s. The March rate hike resulted in a beta of approximately 45%, and we expect the June rate increase to result in a beta of approximately 50%. We expect incremental increases in deposit betas with additional future rate hikes.","The NIM in the third quarter of 2018 should be flat from the second quarter despite a two basis point negative impact of day count. We expect full year 2018 NIM to be between 3.2 and 3.22%, including the impact of a September rate hike. The slight change in our outlook from last quarter reflects the expectation of increased deposit betas. Embedded in our forecast is about a 10 basis point increase in interest-bearing deposit rates in each of the next two quarters.","We expect our third quarter net interest income to be up approximately between 1 and 2% sequentially to $1.04 billion, which is largely a function of expected commercial loan growth and day count. For the full year of 2018, we currently expect NII to grow by 7% from the adjusted 2017 NII to approximately $4.12 billion. ","Excluding the impact of the non-core items, non-interest income in the second quarter increased 3% sequentially. The improvement was driven by a record quarter in corporate banking revenue and solid growth in card and processing revenue, partially offset by a seasonal decrease in wealth and asset management revenues. ","Mortgage banking net revenue of $53 million was down $3 million sequentially. Originations of $2.1 billion were 35% higher than the first quarter, but the second quarter gain on sale margin at 166 basis points was tighter than we expected and 23 basis points lower compared to the first quarter. We expect margins to continue to be tight during the remainder of the year. During the quarter, approximately 75% of our origination mix consisted of purchase volume, with two-thirds of our originations sourced from retail and direct channels and the remainder through the correspondent channel. ","Sequential growth in corporate banking revenue of $32 million or 36% exceeded our previous guidance of a 20 to 25% increase. The improvement was primarily driven by strong broad-based capital markets revenue growth led by corporate bond fees and loan syndication revenue. With the roll-out of the North Star initiatives, we believe we have the right long-term strategies in place to generate sustainably higher growth in corporate banking revenue in the future. Our solid pipeline of deals as well as the impact of the strategic investments in acquisitions should help us generate corporate banking fees between $110 million and $120 million in the third quarter, even as it tends to be a slower quarter in the capital markets, and of course subject to market conditions.","Deposit service charges remained unchanged from the first quarter. Card and processing revenue was up 6% sequentially, reflecting seasonally higher credit and debit transaction volume partly offset by higher rewards expense. Results in our credit card business reflect the benefit of continued investments in card analytics driving faster growth compared to the industry. ","Total wealth and asset management revenue of $108 million was down 4% sequentially, primarily driven by seasonally strong tax-related private client service revenue in the previous quarter. Year-over-year growth in wealth management was 5%. ","For the third quarter of 2018, we expect fees to be about $600 million or up approximately 6% from adjusted non-interest income in the second quarter. For the full year of 2018, we continue to expect fees to be approximately $2.35 billion. ","We remain focused on disciplined expense management while continuing to invest for revenue growth. Reported non-interest expenses decreased 1% sequentially. Excluding the one-time items recognized in both quarters, expenses were down 3% and lower than our guidance for a 2% decline. Third quarter expenses are expected to be down another 1% from the reported second quarter level even though we expect to invest more in marketing to support household growth.","Our direct marketing efforts have been very successful and have driven year-over-year household growth of 4%, generating IRR significantly higher than even our most optimistic assumptions. Leveraging this success, particularly in our high growth southeastern markets, we will continue to invest in additional marketing efforts. Close to 1% of our expense growth in 2018 is expected to come from the increase in our marketing budget.","In addition to higher marketing expense, we also expect to have higher incentive compensation expense directly tied to performance and elevated business activity. This increase in marketing expense should be partly offset by reduced compensation expenses related to the headcount reduction. This dynamic reflects our desire to achieve expense saves to invest in revenue growth opportunities in all business lines. The reduction in compensation expenses will start impacting our run rate in the third quarter, with a greater impact in the fourth quarter and beyond. At this time, our expense guidance range for 2018 remains the same as last quarter, adjusting for the non-core items disclosed in our earnings release.","Our adjusted efficiency ratio for the second quarter was 63%. Excluding the low income housing amortization expense which all peers reflect in their tax line, our efficiency ratio was 60%. We expect our efficiency ratio to continue to decline in the second half of this year. For the full year of 2018, we expect it to be slightly above 60% excluding the impact of low income housing amortization expense. Of course in 2020 and beyond, the combination of the North Star outlook and the MB Financial acquisition significantly changes the direction of our efficiency ratio.","Wrapping up the expense and revenue discussions, I want to reiterate that we expect to achieve positive operating leverage for the year as well as for the last two quarters of the year.","Second quarter credit results continued to follow a positive trend, reflecting the impact of deliberate actions that we executed to reduce high risk exposures during the past two years and an ongoing emphasis on disciplined client selection as a credit risk management tool. The criticized assets ratio, a key leading indicator of credit quality, continued to improve. At the end of the second quarter, criticized assets declined $562 million sequentially, with the criticized asset ratio decreasing to 3.87% from 4.83% last quarter, its lowest level in almost 20 years. ","Net charge-offs were $94 million or 41 basis points, up five basis points from the first quarter of 2018 and up 13 basis points from last year. Commercial charge-offs were 34 basis points, up 13 basis points from the first quarter and up 17 basis points year-over-year. Consumer net charge-offs of 52 basis points were down 8 basis points sequentially and were up 6 basis points year-over-year.","Total portfolio non-performing loans and leases were $437 million, down 28% from last year and down 3% from the previous quarter. The sequential decrease was primarily due to a 35% decline in C&I NPLs. As a result of the historically low criticized assets and low level of NPLs, the reserve ratio declined 7 basis points to 1.17%. ","As we remind you every quarter, the current economic backdrop continues to support a relatively stable credit outlook. We nevertheless caution that we could potentially experience some upward pressure in the future as we are generally in a very benign credit environment. Having said that, for the second half of the year, we expect both our charge-off ratios and dollar charge-offs to be below the first half numbers.","Capital levels remained very strong during the second quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.9%, up 9 basis points sequentially, reflecting the partial sale of our remaining Worldpay stake. Our tangible common equity ratio excluding unrealized gains and losses increased 19 basis points from last quarter to 9.33%. During the quarter, we initiated and settled a $235 million share repurchase which concluded our 2017 CCAR plan. We also raised our common dividend by $0.02 during the quarter to $0.18 per share. As Greg mentioned, we are very pleased with the CCAR 2018 results, including our ability to continue to return capital to shareholders under our original CCAR submission while we resubmit our capital plan to include MB\u2019s results. At this time, we are waiting to hear from the Fed regarding the details associated with the resubmission process. Our near term and long term capital targets remain the same as before. ","At the end of the second quarter, common shares outstanding were down almost 7 million shares, or 1% compared to the first quarter, and down 61 million shares or 8% compared to last year\u2019s second quarter. Book value and tangible book value were up 8% and 7% from last year respectively.","With respect to taxes, our second quarter rate of 15.5% was impacted by the Worldpay gain and other items disclosed in our release. Excluding these items, our tax rate was approximately 13.3%. We expect our tax rate for the full year to be in the 16 to 16.5% range. Excluding the items that are specific to 2018, we would expect our long term tax rate to be in the 15.5 to 16% range.","Slide 13 provides an update on the primary North Star focus areas we discussed at investor day, our progress in implementing those initiatives and the remaining work we have left to do between now and the end of 2018. As Greg discussed previously, we expect to be substantially complete with the work prior to the acquisition closing and conversion. In fact, as you heard from him earlier, we have already begun to see substantial benefits from implementing several of these initiatives across middle market loans, capital markets, credit card analytics, and credit quality improvements. ","Recall that last quarter, we revised our fourth quarter of 2019 ROA and ROTCE targets to reflect our confidence in retaining the vast majority of the benefits from the 2018 tax legislation. During our announcement of the MB acquisition, we further raised our fourth quarter of 2019 target to reflect the expected impact of the additional cost reduction initiatives we announced on our last earnings call.","The completion of the remaining North Star implementation work this year aligns well with the timing of the MB Financial integration. One of our key strengths as an organization is the ability to execute against our goals, as we have demonstrated over the last two and a half years. Given the number of items in our line of sight that are expected to positively impact our results over the next two years, including the MB acquisition, we simplified our financial targets to provide guidance for the full year of 2020. We believe this will provide the most appropriate and informative view of our expected outcomes from all activities. Based on our current forecast and given the assumption that the MB merger closes in the early part of 2019, we expect to achieve an ROTCE of 18%-plus and ROE between 1.55 and 1.65%, and an efficiency ratio in the low 50s range excluding the LIH expense for the full year of 2020. ","Slide 14 provides more detail on the expected financial benefits of additional actions I touched on briefly. As Greg mentioned in his remarks, we are implementing a comprehensive plan to redesign our retail branch network by reallocating our resources to higher growth markets. Utilizing the results of our proprietary technology to assess the health of our branch network across thousands of dimensions, we plan to open 100 to 125 branches predominantly in the southeast and close 100 to 125 branches within our midwest footprint, excluding MB, over the next 36 months. We expect that these actions will enable us to preserve the profitability of our retail franchise in the north and invest in the southeast for higher household revenue and deposit growth.","During the quarter, we reduced headcount primarily in the back office and staff areas. We expect these actions to result in an approximately $80 million pre-tax reduction in annualized compensation expenses. We are also evaluating additional expense saves in the procurement area and are using a third party consulting firm to help during this process. We hope to share the results with you later this quarter. Combining the reduction in compensation and the work in procurement, as well as other ongoing efforts, we expect to achieve expense efficiencies of between $100 million to $125 million on an annualized basis when fully implemented.","As I mentioned earlier, we intend to reinvest a portion of these savings in marketing to boost our household and revenue growth opportunities. We expect our forward-looking guidance on revenues to reflect these benefits. The impact of all of these actions are all incorporated into our 2019 and 2020 performance targets. As expected, the composition of expense savings and new investments change with the market conditions and new capabilities as we develop them, but we intend to keep all of our targets at the levels we previously forecasted or better going forward.","Now that we\u2019ve discussed our update on North Star, I want to spend a few minutes reviewing our recently announced acquisition of MB Financial with a focus on updates since the call in May. As Greg mentioned, this transaction adds significant value to our shareholders. We remain very confident in our ability to reduce expenses by $255 million, reflecting the in-market nature of the acquisition. ","When we announced the transaction, we discussed several expected financial metrics without assuming any revenue synergies. With revenue synergies included, the economics of the transaction become even more compelling. We estimate that by the third year of the acquisition, we can drive incremental annual pre-tax income of $60 million to $75 million based on these synergies. We plan to leverage MB\u2019s expertise in national asset-based lending and leasing through our footprint with a focus on middle market companies. We believe we can also generate additional benefits from utilizing our larger balance sheet and leveraging our capital market capabilities across MB\u2019s customer base. The impact of these additional opportunities on deal economics is substantial, as Greg mentioned previously.","Post-announcement, we have continued to make steady progress towards completing the transaction. We have focused on finalizing the structure of the management team and organization post-close, developing integration teams and retaining employees and customers. We believe we have very complementary capabilities and plan to adopt a blended approach with best practices from both organizations.","In summary, I would like to reiterate a few points. We reported strong financial results for the quarter and the benefits of North Star are becoming more apparent in our performance. We shared our progress on North Star and remain on track to substantially complete the initiatives by the end of this year. This timeline aligns well with the start of the MB integration work after the transaction closes. The economics of the MB acquisition are compelling even without revenue synergies, but we shared expectations for revenue synergies with you today to provide a more complete picture of the economic benefits of the deal. In addition, we took additional measures to reduce costs and generate significant annual savings. Today, we also announced another step towards optimizing our branch network. ","Over the last two and a half years, we have communicated what we intended to achieve, set a timeline for implementation, and executed very effectively on those plans. We expect to continue to do so and are confident in achieving our financial and strategic objectives. ","With that, let me turn it over to Sameer to open the call up for Q&A.","Sameer Gokhale","Thanks Tayfun. Before we start Q&A, as a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up, and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. We will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have this morning. During the question and answer session, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator. ","Caitlin, please open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Your first question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Elliott","Hello, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. It kind of feels as if there are a couple of changes on the outlook, the reference to expenses being at the low end of the 4.0 to 4.1 is gone, then the net interest income outlook is a bit lower. I know you touched on some of that in the prepared remarks, but can you just summarize in a nutshell what\u2019s behind those changes, what\u2019 s changed since the last time you spoke on this?","Tayfun Tuzun","Sure, let me start with the expenses, Geoffrey. As we have disclosed, we\u2019ve taken a couple of actions this quarter on headcount reduction. I think you will probably see the full impact of that in the fourth quarter, and obviously we said it has an $80 million impact on a full year run rate basis, and we will see that obviously in 2019. But at the same time, we have increased our investments in marketing. We are seeing very good results in our retail business. We are also allocating a little bit more money into credit cards and marketing. These are direct marketing actions that we\u2019ve been developing internally with heavy analytical content, and it\u2019s impacting our household growth relative to the industry, fairly significantly, so we decided to push that button a little bit harder for future revenue growth. ","The procurement savings are--the study is going on. That probably is also going to have a broader impact in 2019, and then relative to our performance, the activity levels, as you\u2019ve heard from us, in loan production and capital markets is quite high, and the compensation expense for this year is a little bit higher than before, so that all resulted in us keeping the same range. But you know we are very focused on expense management and will continue to make sure that the progress there is in line with revenue growth elsewhere.","In terms of NII, obviously we\u2019ve changed our outlook slightly, and most of that is due to the competition in deposit markets, the little bit higher rate, the commercial deposit markets, the migration from DDA to the interest-bearing accounts as well as just in terms of the rates paid is a little stronger, so we reflected that in our outlook and that impacted NII. Mortgage continues to be a tough one, the portfolio growth numbers there, so that impacted the numbers as well.","Is there anything else, Jamie, that you want to add?","Jamie Leonard","Maybe the only other factor, Geoffrey, is that the forecast does include some of the funding activity for the MB acquisition now post-announcement, which was May 21, so there are some funding costs in there.","Tayfun Tuzun","Also related to MB, they\u2019re not much, but there are some trickling costs associated with the MB transaction, whether it\u2019s in legal, etc., so that\u2019s also impacting the expenses a little bit this year.","Geoffrey Elliott","Thanks. Just following up on the NII side, you\u2019ve got 3% commercial loan growth baked in for 3Q18. That feels like quite a bit pick-up in pace. What gives you confidence that you\u2019re able to deliver there and not kind of struggle on the NII side because you\u2019re not getting the commercial loan growth you were hoping for?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes, so one technical comment and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Lars for him to comment on activity. Our loan growth towards the end of the quarter was a bit weaker because we had pay-offs that really happened at the end of the quarter, so obviously the growth in Q3 will be on that weaker ending balance for Q2. But besides that, obviously, we\u2019re seeing good activity.","Lars, you want to comment on the state of business there?","Lars Anderson","Yes, to your point, the end of period was substantially impacted by two things. One, we had a very active and constructive capital markets that allowed us to leverage the investments we\u2019ve made in our platform in investment banking and, frankly, monetize that, and that\u2019s part of what helped us lead to a really exceptional capital markets quarter But let me remind you, we had a record quarter of production in corporate banking, we had a record quarter of growth in middle market outstandings, one of the highest production quarters that we\u2019ve had in years in middle market banking. Our pipelines continue to be very strong. I think a lot of the economic environment, the tax reform and other geopolitical issues are very positive and have positioned us very well. ","As I look at the third quarter as well as the second half of the year, I think we\u2019re very well positioned. We selected industries, geographies, we\u2019ve recruited talent and, frankly, have positioned ourselves, I think to accelerate our growth into the third quarter and beyond. I have a high level of confidence that we will be able to deliver, albeit the macroeconomic environment will need to cooperate. ","Geoffrey Elliott","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is open.","Gerard Cassidy","Thank you, good morning guys. Tayfun, can you share with us, you look at your demand deposits, and this is similar to your peers, it\u2019s not just you folks seeing lower demand deposits on a year-over-year basis. Today they represent about 31.6% of total deposits. Why do you think--if we get to a normalized rate environment, say by the end of \u201919 Fed funds is 3%, where do demand deposits go as a percentage of total deposits? Where do they bottom out?","Tayfun Tuzun","Hard to tell, Gerard, because a lot of that also depends on your activity on the treasury management side and your ability to take market share in treasury management, which some of our newly introduced products will help us to achieve. There will probably be still continued migration on the commercial side more so, obviously, from demand to interest checking.","Jamie, any comments there?","Jamie Leonard","Yes Gerard, I would say that the DDA migration we experienced in the second quarter was perhaps more elevated than what we\u2019ll see the rest of this year, in part because we did increase our earnings credits rates during the quarter, so the beta on the ECR was about 45%, so that allowed and created excess liquidity for our customers that permitted them to pursue alternative investment options to help generate better income for those companies. That was predominantly in the large corporate and mid-corporate space, and with that adjustment in our managed rates during the quarter, we feel really good about where our ECs are positioned competitively, so I would expect the migration to slow a bit as the Fed continues to raise rates. But to Tayfun\u2019s point, if the Fed continues to raise rates and we get to a 3% terminal Fed funds rate, then certainly the DDA as a percent of the total will continue to go down, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see that type of compression that we\u2019ve experienced in the past year.","Gerard Cassidy","Very good. Then in the expansion into the new markets with the 100 to 125 branches over the next 36 months, can you guys talk to us on the proprietary technology you mentioned? What gives you the advantage over--obviously you\u2019re going into markets that are going to be very competitive with other banks. What edge do you think you\u2019ll have to be able to maybe garner some market share at the expense of others?","Greg Carmichael","Gerard, this is Greg. First off, on the geosciences front, some of the advancements that we\u2019ve made in that area that we were recognized for, they do a great job of really assessing the market opportunities, where best to locate that branch based on business opportunities, consumer growth, directional trends, competition and so forth. It\u2019s a very advanced model, so that gives us a high level of comfort when we go into these markets where to put those physical branches.","The other thing I\u2019ll mention is the branches we\u2019re putting in are very different from the branches we\u2019re closing - much more efficient branches, smaller real estate footprints, smaller square footage of the branch itself, lower staffing levels, and very highly automated when we go into these markets. But if you think about what we\u2019ve accomplished, we solved the Chicago density issue with the MB Financial acquisition. We think a smart way to expand in the southeast is to build on the franchise that we currently have there through a de novo process, so repositioning 100 to 125 branches from higher density legacy markets where we can continue to serve our customers with less branches and reposition them into the southeast. We\u2019re very comfortable we can continue growing households.","Tayfun mentioned the marketing spend, increasing market spend. We\u2019ve seen some great results on our investments in marketing. When you look at household growth over the last six quarters, we\u2019ve added net 118,000 new households. Consumer deposits over the last six quarters, I think are up close to $3 billion, so we\u2019ve been very successful. Our preferred banking platform is growing significantly, so we\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019re able to accomplish. It\u2019s really about repositioning and giving our southeast markets more opportunity to better serve their communities.","Gerard Cassidy","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian, Bank of America. Your line is open.","Erika Najarian","Hi, good morning. I also wanted to get some clarity in terms of your guidance relative to the deal when I compare the slides from the deal presentation and the updated slides today. When I look back at the MBFI deal presentation, you noted 4Q19 North Star targets of 16% ROTCE and ROA of 125 to 135, and you mentioned that you thought that the deal would be 200 basis points enhancing to ROTCE and 12 basis points enhancing to ROA. I\u2019m a little bit confused on a couple of fronts. One, you\u2019re telling us that North Star will be substantially complete by this year and that implies consensus with an ROTCE of 13.8 to an ROA of 1.25. But you did retain your ROTCE target for the combined company and you even increased the ROA range, so I guess I\u2019m wondering what the moving pieces are there. Is the deal going to be really the substantive catalyst to get to this range, and what happened to those 2019 enhanced North Star targets?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes, so there is absolutely no change in the way we described the deal, the impact of the deal on our North Star targets. When we made the comment about the North Star initiatives coming to a conclusion here at the end of 2018, that comment was really related to the internal work that is going on to be able to introduce the products and services and also the expense initiatives, but we will see the impact of that effort throughout 2019, basically leading into our end of 2019 North Star target. Assuming that the transaction closes in the early part of 2019, then the full year of 2020 clearly has all the expenses that have been associated with the transaction itself, so that\u2019s it.","We\u2019re not changing the impact of the North Star initiatives in terms of their timing, all we\u2019re saying is that the effort to finish the work internally, whether it\u2019s IT, whether it\u2019s organizational design or whatever, are coming to a conclusion. That was the comment. It was not meant to be a comment on financial metrics.","Erika Najarian","Got it. As a follow-up question to that, your 2020 targets look better than what we saw during the deal presentation, but the stock is down 5% at the moment. I\u2019m wondering, going back to Geoffrey\u2019s question on the NII guide, it does look like a modest step down in terms of the NII guide, but I think some investor observed that you added a September rate hike. Is the market reading it correctly that you did add a rate hike in there but did downgrade the NII outlook, and therefore the step-down on an apples-to-apples basis is a little bit more severe, and if that\u2019s the case, is that really because of all the pricing dynamics you mentioned during the prepared remarks?","Jamie Leonard","Erika, it\u2019s Jamie. We did pull forward in line with market expectation a rate hike that was previously expected in December to September in our current guide, and we did reduce the NII outlook predominantly driven by the commercial deposit migration and cost, but also inclusive of some wholesale funding activities related to the MB acquisition. But yes, you are reading that correctly.","The one item I would clarify on our forecast, however, is that we do assume in the third quarter one month LIBOR to Fed funds, or OIS spread, compresses from the 16 or so basis points we experienced in the second quarter down to 8 basis points or so in the third quarter, and that\u2019s a significant assumption that we would obviously do significantly better, given asset sensitivity and the C&I composition of the portfolio being heavily tied to one-month LIBOR. But each basis point of spread there is about a million dollars per quarter, so that is a significant assumption that is also in the outlook.","Erika Najarian","Got it. If I could just slip one more in, Jamie, you keep mentioning the wholesale funding impact. Could you give us a sense of what the full-year wholesale funding impact would be as we think about the moving parts of the guidance?","Jamie Leonard","I would say of the $30 million or so change in our outlook on NII, I would call it $25 million related to commercial deposits and $5 million related to wholesale funding activities.","Erika Najarian","Got it, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Ken Usdin","Hi, good morning guys. A couple just near-term questions for you. First of all, Tayfun, you talked about the third quarter on the fees, $600 million despite continued weakness in mortgage, and I think you said earlier that\u2019s with an expectation that corporate banking would hang in this $110 million to $120 million zone. Off of a 567, can you just help us understand what the nice lift will be to get you from the second to the third and that $600 million number?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes, there is a couple of other line items in corporate. We are forecasting potentially a little bit in private equity gains here in a couple of transactions that we have, and obviously the improvements in--the current success in capital markets will continue, so that\u2019s sort of--there\u2019s a few other items, nothing big significant. We\u2019re expecting pretty decent growth relative to the seasonal changes, so there\u2019s nothing more than that.","Ken Usdin","Got it, okay. Then on the expense side also, you mentioned that for the third quarter, just from a starting point perspective, that you\u2019re expecting down 1% from the reported 1037. Are you expecting there to be continued restructuring costs in there and even MBFI-related costs? I would have thought that the core expense number would be coming down more than just 1% off of a GAAP number that you just reported at 1037.","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes, the MB Financial-related expenses are just trickling down. That is going to probably continue through the remainder of the year. There\u2019s a little bit of an increase in technology expenses into the second half of the year, similar to our guidance before, and then we\u2019re also expecting continued good business activity driving--you know, these strong capital markets and strong origination levels typically result in higher performance comp-related expenses, so that\u2019s what\u2019s driving it. We\u2019re expecting since this headcount reduction is going to drive a more run rate number for the fourth quarter, we\u2019re expecting that to be a little bit more stronger in the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter, and then as I mentioned before, the marketing expenses clearly are going to drive the quarter-over-quarter change. We will be seeing a fairly sizeable increase in our third quarter marketing expense relative to the second quarter marketing expense.","Ken Usdin","Okay, got it. One last one, just on the incremental $100 million or so of savings. You mentioned spending part of it on all these initiatives that you continue to have. Can you help us understand, is that this continuous improvement type of thing, where you save another 100, you spend another 100? How are you expecting the Fifth Third legacy expense base to traject past 2018, I guess? ","Tayfun Tuzun","We clearly are intending to achieve efficiencies through those cost savings. We\u2019re not going to use those entire savings in order to invest in the business. Our guidance of an efficiency ratio in the lower 50s in 2020 clearly shows that we intend to maintain a good chunk of those expense saves as our bottom line. Even excluding the MB transaction, we are expecting a pretty decent move in our efficiency ratio, which leads to the conclusion that we intend to keep a good amount of these savings.","The other thing that I think needs to be realized is these investments in marketing are going to have an impact on revenue growth going forward, which obviously also positively impacts our efficiency ratio.","Ken Usdin","Yes, that\u2019s fair. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Good morning. I wanted to follow up on just the last line of conversation. As we think about expense growth in 2019 and 2020 for Fifth Third standalone, I realize we won\u2019t see the numbers because of the deal, but obviously there is some upfronting of the investment this year, there is some cost saves coming in. You are coming off of what will be a pretty high expense growth this year, so I was hoping maybe you could shed some light on what you think the standalone trajectory of expense growth will be at Fifth Third over the next year or two.","Tayfun Tuzun","I think you are right that when you look at the expenses this year with all the investment back into the company, we have seen a little bit higher expenses. We anticipate that our 2019 expense growth will be definitely below the levels that you\u2019re seeing in 2018, and we would hope that it would be meaningfully so. The year-over-year change in total compensation expense of $80 million is close to a 2% number on our total expense base off of this year, so those types of actions are intended to slow down expense growth moving into 2019 and 2020, even before you take into account the expense saves associated with MB Financial. ","It is a little bit too early to provide guidance for expenses in 2019, but as a management team, we are extremely focused in achieving a significantly lower expense growth in 2019.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay, because if you take the 4 to 5% expense growth you\u2019re looking for this year, layer in the synergies or cost saves that you\u2019ve talked about, it kind of will get you into maybe that 2, 3% if they all fall to the bottom line, which I think would be both more reasonable and well received, so any further color on that down the road, I think would be helpful.","Separately, you laid down some revenue synergies related to leveraging the MBFI franchise. What about potential loan run-off? I mean, they\u2019re quite large in commercial real estate, has some multi-family, has some indirect consumer that you guys haven\u2019t really done in the past. I guess you could argue either that could be synergies to you guys or there might be some right-sizing of that acquired book to align to your underwriting and strategy.","Jamie Leonard","Matt, it\u2019s Jamie. I think a good way to think of the revenue synergies is that it\u2019s inclusive of customer attrition, just normal branch closure type of activity. When it comes to the actual loan book coming over, through due diligence and through the last two months of efforts since the deal\u2019s been announced, we\u2019re comfortable with the indirect portfolio that they have coming over and maintaining, but our revenue synergies don\u2019t assume any significant changes to that book of business. The revenue synergies that are outlined on Slide 15, the first two categories really highlight what MB brings to the table in terms of our ability to link and leverage their products and experience, predominantly in the business banking and ABL and leasing, whereas the next three categories are more of what Fifth Third brings to the table. We just wanted to frame up where we see the opportunities on the combined business, and we\u2019re confident in our ability to drive those synergies.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is open.","John Pancari","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Regarding the MBFI deal, I know you indicated so far a minimal disruption in the deal. Regarding the banker lock-ups, I know it was asked about on the deal call and Mitch Feiger was--you know, it was unclear if Mitch was indicating that there was definite lock-ups or not. Were key bankers locked up, and can you give us a little bit of detail around that? Thank you.","Greg Carmichael","This is Greg. I\u2019m really pleased--as we get further into this transaction and discussions with MB Financial, we were extremely pleased with the talent that they have and our ability to bring together the best in class in our Chicago market, so part of the retention of these bankers starts with the leadership and our model in the Chicago market and how we\u2019re going to run that business, starting with Mitch as the CEO of that business going forward. The senior commercial middle market banker from MB Financial will lead that market for us, so it starts from a retention perspective to find the leadership team, which we\u2019ve done, and communicate out how we\u2019re going to operate in that market. Also, the combined opportunities when we bring these two franchises together that can be leveraged across the market and the advanced capabilities we have in capital markets and so forth with our customer base, the capabilities to leverage their ABL and equipment financing in our core middle market on a national level, those things when you put it together are extremely attractive, I believe to the MB Financial team and to the Fifth Third team. So the environment that we\u2019re creating in best in class to better serve our customers there and give our sales people and our teams more resources to offer into the marketplace, so that\u2019s going very well.","In addition to that, in key situations we have provided lock downs for those individuals through the transition and beyond to make sure that we have the right talent in place to lead the organization. But once again, I want to stress the key thing is our business model and combined best of breed talent in that marketplace, as I mentioned, a significant portion of the current MB Financial team will be in place from the combined perspective when we close this deal in a leadership role, so I think net-net we feel real comfortable. We haven\u2019t really seen any concerns in that area yet. We\u2019ve worked hard to get that right, we\u2019ve worked to communicate effectively to all the MB Financial employees, as well as our own Chicago employees, which is extremely important, and we\u2019ve done a nice job, I think. Mitch and his team have done a fantastic job of really putting their arms around the customer base.","John Pancari","Okay, got it. Thanks Greg. Then on the large corporate side, you mentioned the record corporate banking activity and originations that you\u2019re seeing. What are the yields that you\u2019re seeing, new money yields on your corporate paper that you\u2019re bringing onto the balance sheet, and then separately, what\u2019s the total size of your shared national credit balance as of June 30? Thanks.","Lars Anderson","Yes, a couple things there. First of all, what we\u2019re seeing in the corporate banking space is extremely aggressive - there\u2019s no question about it, so we\u2019re needing to be very selective. We shared with you our industry verticals, the new industry verticals which we have introduced where we tend to get outsized returns. We\u2019re not just looking at it from a credit perspective, we look at it from a total relationship perspective - that\u2019s our strategy, but I would tell you that largely the commercial originations that we\u2019re seeing today, while they are under some pressure, largely reflect our overall portfolio that we have at our company. What we are being able to execute on, again getting back to relationship, is we told you we were going to make North Star investments in capital markets and other capabilities. We\u2019re leveraging those successfully into that corporate banking space specifically. That\u2019s helping to drive a record level, not just corporate lending activities but also capital market activities for our company.","Tayfun Tuzun","In terms of the coupon, John, it\u2019s sort of between 4 and 4.5% in terms of production, so they are fairly close to where the portfolio yields are.","Lars Anderson","Correct. ","Jamie Leonard","John, the other question you had was the shared national credit balance. Our balance is actually down a couple billion over the last several quarters. It\u2019s roughly $26 billion to date, and again as Lars said, the vast preponderance of those credits are tied to deep relationships and not credit only. We feel very good about it. From an asset quality perspective, the shared national credit portfolio has less than 3% criticized assets and continues to perform exceptionally well, and it diversifies our portfolio across the enterprise.","Lars Anderson","Yes, one thing I would just add to that is the single largest driver of our commercial loan growth this quarter was core middle market, it was not corporate banking growth.","John Pancari","Got it, okay. And that SNC balance, that\u2019s based on the newer definition, correct?","Jamie Leonard","Correct.","John Pancari","Got it. All right, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is open.","Scott Siefers","Morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. One quick question on just the profitability program you guys detailed this morning. Tayfun, I think you guys had said total $100 million to 125 million in cost savings, although Greg you had mentioned some of the procurement stuff you guys would detail through the quarter. That latter procurement stuff, that\u2019s already included in the $100 million to $125 million, right?","Tayfun Tuzun","That\u2019s correct, yes. ","Scott Siefers","Okay, so there\u2019s no new dollar amount coming out in the next 90 days or anything?","Tayfun Tuzun","No, that\u2019s correct.","Scott Siefers","Okay, perfect. Then I just want to get back to the new 2020 targets for a second, I just want to make sure I\u2019m clear, because I think I still don\u2019t understand exactly what has changed from the enhanced targets back when you announced the MBFI transaction. I guess as I look at it, the standalone outlook is a bit weaker, but we have the additional profitability program you guys detailed this morning, and then you guys had also detailed the revenue enhancements from MBFI. Are those the three changes that have taken place since--","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes, with respect to the current year numbers, Scott, some of these are obviously a little bit elevated on an annual basis for 2018, so some of the incentive comp numbers, etc., are a little bit elevated beyond what the normal run rates would be. These are not all negatives as we look into 2019 and 2020. It\u2019s important to consider that.","Also in terms of year-over-year expense growth, when I was answering a previous question, the expense growth expectations into 2019 are clearly going to be below what we have here in 2018, and then revenue growth associated with both North Star initiatives and other investments, those are all baking into our performance targets for the end of next year and into 2020.","Scott Siefers","Okay.","Tayfun Tuzun","So all of these are--I mean, I think we\u2019ve been consistently raising these targets as we see our performance moving up, whether it\u2019s due to some environmental factors such as tax rates or higher expectations on other efforts, and then now plus MB we are moving onto that 18-plus range in return on tangible capital, and then we\u2019re raising our ROA guidance along those expectations.","Scott Siefers","Yes, okay. All right, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. ","Mike Mayo","Hi. Could you elaborate more on the increase in marketing? I think you said it related to credit cards, but why now and which markets, and does that tie into your expansion strategy in the southeast? Can you just confirm your expansion strategy in the southeast is more commercial than consumer, or maybe it\u2019s consumer too? Just shed more light on that if you could.","Tayfun Tuzun","One comment on the marketing - a large majority of the marketing spend, Mike, is related to the retail deposit household growth. There is a portion that goes into credit cards, but a significant amount of those dollars actually are intended to generate retail consumer deposits and household growth.","Greg Carmichael","The only thing I would add to Tayfun\u2019s comment there is we\u2019ve been very successful, Mike, as we alluded to, growing households and it\u2019s really across not just our legacy footprint but also in our high growth markets in the southeast. We\u2019ve been very successful. We measure everything here, as you know, and when you look at the advanced analytics we\u2019ve put in place and learning how best to market our opportunities and where we\u2019ll get the best returns, we\u2019ve tested that over the last year plus. It\u2019s worked extremely well, and there\u2019s a bigger ask there because there\u2019s a bigger outcome there and opportunity for us. So we\u2019ve decided to invest some resources, additional resources than planned to continue marketing at a higher level, given the success rate that we\u2019ve already had, and you\u2019re seeing that in our consumer deposit growth we\u2019ve had over the last six quarters, as I mentioned earlier, and our household growth and especially our preferred banking platform, in the customer acceptance of that platform and what we\u2019re seeing there from a growth perspective, so that\u2019s positive.","When we talk about repositioning in the southeast, obviously we\u2019re going to continue to invest in our commercial business, especially core middle market. It\u2019s extremely important to us, and we\u2019re seeing, as Tayfun mentioned and then Lars reiterated, we\u2019re seeing record performance in loan originations across our footprint, but especially in those markets also. But the investments we\u2019re going to make to reposition our branch network is just thoughtful thinking about how best to serve our customers and grow our business, and as you know, coming out of the crisis we hadn\u2019t invested heavily into those higher growth southeast markets coming off of some acquisitions. We think the smart way of growing that is being additive to those markets, using some of the advanced analytics that we have to place those branches, a much smaller footprint of branch, a higher automated branch, a lower cost branch in those markets to better serve the consumer-based customers there, and the business banking customers.","Mike Mayo","When you say those markets in the southeast, which specific markets?","Greg Carmichael","Obviously the Carolinas, the Georgia, Atlanta area, northern wedge. You\u2019ve got to look at Tennessee and Nashville in particular, parts of Florida are where the opportunities sit for us.","Mike Mayo","So this is de novo branch expansion in states where you don\u2019t have currently branches, except for Florida?","Greg Carmichael","No, we have branches in all those areas I mentioned before, we\u2019re just once again not the level of density that we need, I think to better serve that market and create more leverage of our products and services and marketing spend in those markets. So it just goes back to markets like Nashville, there\u2019s additional branches necessary in Nashville. If you look at Atlanta, once again the northern wedge of Atlanta, we\u2019ve got 38, 40 branches there. There\u2019s more needed to support those communities, so it\u2019s just being thoughtful how best to grow in those markets from a retail perspective and a business baking perspective is what we\u2019re looking at.","Mike Mayo","Last question on that. Longer term, over three to five years, how much larger would you like consumer to be in the southeast?","Greg Carmichael","Well I\u2019d tell you, from a growth perspective--how are you measuring that growth, Mike? When you say how much larger, from a deposit perspective?","Mike Mayo","Consumer revenues, consumer deposits. I mean, are we thinking about doubling the share there, reallocating capital to grow--","Greg Carmichael","We would like to grow significantly. I think we can grow significantly in those markets and take market share in the southeast markets, based on the teams we have in place, our capabilities, and what we\u2019ve seen with some of the advancements that we\u2019ve made, our marketing capabilities, and the products and services that we offer. So we think we can take share, we can even grow the deposit base at a disproportionate level than our legacy markets, and we think we\u2019re well positioned to do that. We\u2019ve just got to be smart about how we add to it, but it\u2019s really going to be a balanced mix.","Lars Anderson","Maybe, Mike, one data point to help frame up the size of the opportunity in the southeast. We have roughly 300 financial centers in the southeast today that average about $35 million per branch in consumer deposits. The rest of our franchise, or if you look at the midwest, we have almost 900 branches and they average about $53 million in average deposits per branch, so it highlights the weakness of the network, the overall network in the southeast and what that opportunity might look like when you\u2019re finished building out the network and what that consumer deposit book could grow to.","Tayfun Tuzun","In terms of the sort of--if you look at it from a branch growth perspective, you\u2019re looking at growing the branches in the key south markets by approximately 35 to 40%, so that\u2019s the next two, three years worth of expansion.","Mike Mayo","Great, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Christopher Marinac with FIG Partners. Your line is open.","Christopher Marinac","Thanks, good morning. As you expand in the southeast with the new branches, to what extent does that influence the deposit beta? Do you have rate specials embedded as you execute these?","Tayfun Tuzun","Chris, you have to realize that we\u2019re talking about a two to three-year expansion, so at this point I think the expansion itself is not going to have an impact in this rate environment. We will update that for you as this continues, because obviously unlike branch closings, branch openings take a little bit longer, so let us wait and see how that process goes before we show you an impact on deposits.","Christopher Marinac","Sounds good, Tayfun. Thank you. Do you expect any change on LCR as these next couple quarters unfold? ","Jamie Leonard","Are you asking from a regulatory standpoint or from Fifth Third specifically?","Christopher Marinac","Well really both, but I guess regulatory first would be great.","Tayfun Tuzun","Well, Randy Quarles\u2019 comments yesterday obviously have received some attention. We\u2019re just going to have to wait and see whether there are any changes associated with LCR. Within his comments, he appeared to refer to liquidity measures. We\u2019re just going to have to wait and see. ","Jamie Leonard","And for Fifth Third specifically, the one item that you saw in the quarter is the LCR did increase as we begin to position the portfolio to greater allocation to level 1s as we prepare for MB\u2019s balance sheet to come over, which at the deal announcement we said there would be some LCR dilution from the composition of their investment securities portfolio, so we will continue to migrate ours a little bit higher in advance of a first quarter close. ","Christopher Marinac","Sounds great, Jamie. Thank you very much, guys, appreciate it.","Sameer Gokhale","Okay, well thank you all for your interest in Fifth Third Bank. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations department, and we would be happy to assist you. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

[Operator Instructions] . With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin Kabat. Kevin?","Kevin T. Kabat","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Before touching on the fourth quarter highlights, I want to make a few comments about 2013 as a whole. Net income to common shareholders of $1.8 billion was the highest in the company's 155-year history. Net income to common shareholders increased 17% over last year. Earnings per diluted share of $2.02 were up 22% from a year ago. Our return on assets was 1.5% and return on average tangible common equity was 16%. Those ratios were 1.3% and 14%, excluding the benefit of Vantiv and other unusual items outlined on Slide 10 of our presentation. These are strong returns, particularly in this low interest rate environment. Net interest income was down 1% in 2013 despite a 23-basis-point decline in the margin. On a reported basis, fee income was up 8%, expenses were down 3% and PPNR was up 12%. Excluding the items I just referred to, PPNR was stable despite the significant decline in mortgage revenue with fee income down just 2% and expenses down 1%. The efficiency ratio declined 3.5% on a reported basis to 58% and was 60% on an adjusted basis. Full year average transaction deposits increased 6%, and loans grew 5%. Credit quality metrics showed significant continued improvement with charge-offs for the year down 29% and nonperforming assets down 25%. Fifth Third continues to accrete significant amounts of capital through earnings. We repurchased $1.7 billion and net of the equity issued in the Series G conversion, returned $1.3 billion to shareholders. Of that, about $200 million was related to the repurchases equal to 100% of gains from sales of Vantiv stock. The remaining $1.1 billion repurchases and dividends represented a 70% payout ratio of earnings excluding Vantiv gains. The same time, we retained the capital needed to support asset growth. As a result, our Tier 1 common equity ratio of 9.4% was more or less flat to 2012 levels, which was exactly what we aimed to do in our 2013 capital plan.","Meanwhile, we reduced our fully diluted share count by about 50 million shares, or 5%. While capital ratios remained above our target levels, our expectation is that we will continue to manage our capital position in 2014 at roughly current levels limiting the growth in capital through share repurchases and continuing to target dividends consistent with the Federal Reserve's 30% payout ratio guidance. Vantiv continues to be a success story for us and has contributed to be -- contributed to our ability to manage our capital through our ongoing disciplined monetization of our stake in Vantiv and the repurchase of our own shares with gains. In 2009 we entered a joint venture that enabled Fifth Third Processing Solutions, now renamed, to more effectively expand its operation as an independent entity, which has included meaningful M&A. The same time, we've maintained our long-term partnership, which was [ph] best-in-class payments processor. Today, we're reaping the benefits of our actions several years ago. Vantiv is now a $6-plus billion market cap company. Fifth Third remains its largest shareholder and our 25% stake represents a market value of $1.6 billion, which we're carrying on our books at about $400 million as of the third quarter. Additionally, we also hold long-term warrants in Vantiv valued on our books at nearly $400 million. In the meantime, since mid-2009, we've generated pretax gains of nearly $3 billion from the monetization of our Vantiv position. This has been a terrific business and investment for us and while we expect to sell our remaining stake over time, we'll continue to very much value our ongoing business partnership with Vantiv.","Now moving on to a few highlights of the fourth quarter. We reported fourth quarter net income to common shareholders of $383 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.43. Significant items during the quarter included a $91 million positive valuation on the Vantiv warrant, expenses to bill litigation reserves of $69 million, a negative valuation on the Visa total return swap of $18 million and several other smaller items that Tayfun will discuss in more detail. In total, these items contributed approximately $0.01 to quarterly EPS.","Returns on assets and equity remained strong and tangible book value per share increased 5% from a year ago, despite the impact of share repurchase activity. Average core deposits were up 6% from a year ago with transaction deposits up $5.5 billion including DDA growth of $1.5 billion. For the quarter, average portfolio loans grew 1% sequentially and period-end portfolio loans increased $1.4 billion, or 2%, which sets us up well for first quarter of 2014 growth. Fee income results were solid. Consumer deposit fees are up 6% from a year ago. Credit card balances are up 9% year-over-year and we continue to see the benefit of our investments in the mid-corporate space and in the energy and healthcare industries.","We continue to manage costs in a disciplined manner. Quarterly expenses increased 3% sequentially, driven primarily by higher litigation cost, partially offset by lower credit-related costs and mortgage banking expenses. Excluding the items I referred to earlier, expenses were $922 million. Overall, this was a strong quarter in terms of core expense management, although there was obviously a lot of noise in the expense results.","Capital levels remained very strong. Our Tier 1 common ratio is 9.4% on a Basel I basis and 9% pro forma on the new U.S. Basel III rules. Our leverage ratio is 9.6%, near the top of our peer group. Our ability to generate capital and our strong capital position under current and future capital rules gives us the ability to support balance sheet growth while continuing to return capital to shareholders in a prudent manner.","Looking forward to 2014, it is early in the year but most sectors of the economy appear to be on pretty solid footing that seems committed to pursuing a tapering path that keeps the economy moving forward. Sources of customer uncertainty related to the economy, budget battles, et cetera, have diminished and that makes us hopeful that 2014 will provide a stronger backdrop to economic activity and borrowing than 2013.","We continue to produce strong profitable -- profitability results due to Fifth Third's business model, revenue generation capabilities and disciplined expense management. These give us confidence that we're well positioned to win going forward, and have successfully built the foundation of that success over the last several years.","I want to thank our employees for their continued focus and drive, and our customers for their continued business and partnership with Fifth Third. With that, I'll ask Tayfun to discuss operating results and give some comments about our outlook. Tayfun?","Tayfun Tuzun","Thank you, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. As Kevin discussed, 2013 was a very good year for Fifth Third as we reported record net income. In a year with continued pressure on margins, our interest -- net interest income remained stable. Strong and consistent growth in card and processing revenue, investment advisory and deposit fees proves our ability to protect and grow our earnings as we transition from the mortgage refi blues [ph] . Full year expenses were down 3% despite a 4% increase in technology and communications expense as we continue to invest in our businesses. All said, these are results we are proud of, despite a challenging interest rate environment.","Moving to Slide 5 of the presentation. Fourth quarter earnings per diluted share were $0.43. Recall that current [ph] quarter results included $19 million or $0.02 per diluted share preferred stock dividends, which we did not have in the third quarter. There were also several items that affected earnings in this quarter which contributed about $0.01 overall to fourth quarter EPS. Those are outlined on page 2 of our release, and I'll note their impact to various line items throughout my comments.","Turning to Slide 6. Tax equivalent net interest income increased $7 million sequentially to $905 million. Despite ongoing margin pressure, we have grown net interest income the past 2 quarters. Net interest margin was 321 basis points versus 331 basis points last quarter. The 10 basis points margin contraction was attributable to higher cash balances, which reduced the margin by 8 basis points. Stronger-than-expected deposit growth and the debt issuances drove the cash position for the quarter.","In terms of balance sheet composition, you'll recall that last quarter we took advantage of higher interest rates to add to our securities portfolio and to change its composition. We continued to take advantage of higher rate opportunities throughout the fourth quarter and added about $550 million in [indiscernible] securities. The higher earnings from these securities, as well as higher loan balances contributed to the increase in net interest income. We also benefited from approximately $300 million in runoff of 2008 vintage CD maturities. These benefits were partially offset by the negative effect of loan repricing, lower mortgage held-for-sale balances and higher interest expense resulting from debt issuances during the quarter.","As I mentioned, deposit growth was better than we expected. In addition, we issued $1.75 billion in bank debt and $750 million in holding company debt during the fourth quarter, which benefits liquidity as we continue to improve our liquidity-to-coverage ratio. Market demand and pricing for these issuances was quite strong.","Loan and lease yields were generally lower although the 4-basis-point decline was less than we've seen in previous quarters. Reported C&I portfolio yields declined 3 basis points, driven by repricing within the portfolio, combined with a continued mix shift toward higher-quality loans. In the indirect auto portfolio, the average yield declined 6 basis points in the quarter. Competition for high-quality auto loans remains strong. Maintaining price discipline and achieving our profitability targets is important to us, and that resulted in lower production numbers during the second half of 2013.","In the taxable securities portfolio, yields increased 12 basis points, reflecting the benefit from higher securities yields. Combined with higher balances, the yield improvement generated an additional $17 million in interest income over last quarter. Our patience here has certainly paid off and you should expect us to exercise the same discipline across the board in our loan and investment portfolio decisions.","Turning to the balance sheet and Slide 7. Average earning assets increased $4.2 billion sequentially, driven by a $1.8 billion increase in investment securities and a $2.7 billion increase in short-term investment balances. The increase in average investment securities was driven by the combination of the net $2 billion of securities we added during the third quarter and about $550 million of net additions in the fourth quarter, primarily Ginnie Mae's in both quarters. The increase in short-term investment balances resulted from higher cash balances held at the Fed, as I already noted. Average held-for-investment portfolio loans and leases were up $623 million, but were offset by a $912 million decline in average loans held-for-sale.","Looking at each loan portfolio, average commercial loans increased $641 million or 1% from the third quarter and increased $3.7 billion or 8% from last year. Period and commercial loans increased 2.5% sequentially or 10% on an annualized basis. C&I loans of $38.8 billion increased $702 million or 2% from last quarter and increased $4.5 billion or 13% from a year ago.","C&I production remains strong this quarter and continues to be broad-based across industries with particular strength in manufacturing, as well as mid-corporate and large corporate lending. Commercial line utilization declined to 29% from 30% in the third quarter as clients continue to exercise a higher degree of caution and minimize line usage.","Commercial mortgage balances declined $226 million sequentially or 3%, while commercial construction balances increased $159 million. On an end of period basis, total CRE balances grew for the first time in over 5 years. This has been a headwind for loan growth, but it feels like we've seen the bottom in terms of the size of this portfolio and we expect it to grow in coming quarters.","Average consumer portfolio loans of $36.5 billion were flat from the prior quarter and increased $229 million or 1% from a year ago. Residential mortgage loans held for investments were up 1% from the third quarter. Average auto loans decreased 1% sequentially and increased 1% from the prior year. Average home equity loan balances were down 1% sequentially and 8% from the prior year reflecting continued runoff in the portfolio. And average credit card balances were up 3% sequentially and 9% from a year ago, driven by account growth and higher balance utilization.","Moving on to deposits. The fourth quarter was another very strong quarter for deposits with average core deposits up $2.3 billion or 3% from the third quarter. Transaction deposits increased $2.5 billion or 3% sequentially and $5.5 billion or 7% from a year ago. End of period DDAs were up 8% sequentially and 9% year-over-year.","The deposit simplification initiative that we completed in early 2013 continues to increase average consumer deposit account balances as we deepen relationships. We have seen particular strength in commercial deposits, which were up 6% sequentially. Expanded commercial relationships and the scale of our treasury management business continues to support commercial deposit growth. Average consumer CDs declined 4% sequentially as a result of the high-priced CDs that rolled off during the quarter.","Turning to fees, which are outlined on Slide 8. Fourth quarter noninterest income was $703 million compared with $721 million last quarter. Current quarter fee income results included a $91 million positive valuation adjustment on the Vantiv warrant, whereas last quarter's results included similar benefits from an $85 million gain on the sale of Vantiv shares and a $6 million positive valuation adjustment on the Vantiv warrant.","In the fourth quarter, we also received the first payment under our tax receivable agreement with Vantiv, which was $9 million. Going forward, Fifth Third will receive an annual payment corresponding with tax benefits incurring to Fifth Third associated with this agreement.","Fourth quarter fee results also included $18 million of charges associated with the Visa total return swap. These were $2 million in the third quarter. Excluding these items, fee income of $621 million declined $11 million, primarily due to lower corporate banking revenue and other noninterest income. Looking at each line item in detail. Corporate banking revenue of $94 million decreased $8 million from the third quarter and $20 million from record results a year ago.","Current quarter results included a $9 million charge to write down the equipment value on an operating lease, which resulted in lower lease remarketing fees. Our expanded product offering may result in relatively modest quarterly fluctuations in this line item, but overall, we feel very good about the contributions from our expanded capacity and platform.","Deposit service charges increased 1% sequentially and 6% from the prior year. The year-over-year increase reflected a 6% growth in both consumer deposit fees and commercial deposit fees. The growth in deposit fees has been consistently positive in 2013. As we have discussed previously, our new retail deposit platform, the continued increase in new customer accounts and higher treasury management fees should provide us very good support for growth in this line item.","Mortgage banking net revenue of $126 million increased 4% from the third quarter and decreased 51% from a year ago. Originations were $2.6 billion this quarter compared with $4.8 billion last quarter and $7 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012. Gain on sale revenue was $60 million versus $74 million in the prior quarter and $239 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. The sequential decline reflected lower originations, partially offset by higher gain on sale margins during the quarter while the year-over-year decline reflected both lower production and lower margins.","MSR valuation adjustments, including hedges, were a positive $26 million in the fourth quarter compared with positive $23 million last quarter and positive $7 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. Contrary to the gain on sale revenue, the current rate environment will provide a strong boost to servicing income this year as servicing asset amortization has declined to $23 million from $39 million last quarter and $52 million in the year ago quarter.","Purchase volume for the quarter was $1.3 billion and 51% origination versus $2 billion and 43% of originations in the third quarter. Investment advisory revenue of $98 million increased 2% from the third quarter and 6% from the prior year. The sequential and year-over-year increase was driven by higher brokerage fees and private client services revenue, reflecting strong production and market performance.","Card and processing revenue was $71 million, an increase of 3% from the third quarter, 8% from a year ago, reflecting higher transaction volumes and an increase in the number of purchase active accounts. The decline in mortgage revenue continues to impact our quarter-over-quarter comparisons, but our overall core business activity and noninterest income results display the underlying strength of our platform to transition through this and grow even in the absence of the very strong mortgage results that our shareholders benefited from over the last few years.","Turning next to other income within fees. Other income was $170 million this quarter versus $185 million last quarter, and included the Vantiv-related income and Visa charges that I discussed earlier. Excluding these items in both quarters, other noninterest income of $88 million in the fourth quarter declined $8 million sequentially. Credit costs recorded in noninterest income were $5 million in the fourth quarter compared with $5 million last quarter and $13 million a year ago.","Turning to expenses on Slide 9. Noninterest expense was $989 million this quarter compared with $959 million in the third quarter. Expense results this quarter included $69 million in charges to increase litigation reserves compared with $30 million last quarter. Current quarter expenses also included $8 million in debt extinguishment costs associated with the TruPS redemption, $8 million in severance expense and $8 million contribution to the Fifth Third Foundation.","Expenses included a benefit to mortgage repurchase provision of $26 million, primarily associated with our Freddie Mac settlements in the fourth quarter. That compared with a $4 million benefit in the third quarter. Prior quarter results also included $5 million severance expense and the annual large bank supervisory assessment fee of $5 million. Excluding these items from both quarters, noninterest expense of $922 million was generally consistent with the third quarter.","Current quarter results included a decline in mortgage production related expenses of approximately $19 million, mostly in compensation expenses. We will continue to manage expenses in our mortgage business efficiently in 2014. Credit-related costs were a benefit of $12 million compared with expense of $16 million last quarter. This decline was primarily driven by a $26 million benefit to mortgage repurchase provision as a result of the settlement with Freddie Mac and the corresponding expectation for lower future repurchase requests and file claims.","Realized mortgage repurchase losses were $33 million, reflecting the $25 million settlement payments to Freddie Mac versus $13 million in the prior quarter. Expenses overall were $119 million lower in 2013 than in 2012, a decline of 3%. We achieved core operating leverage despite a difficult year for mortgage with growth in PPNR and a reduced efficiency ratio. These results were indicative of our ability to manage expenses in a disciplined way while continuing to invest in strategic business growth initiatives. We expect more of that to come in 2014.","Moving on to Slide 10 and PPNR. Pre-provision net revenue was $614 million in the fourth quarter compared with $655 million in the third quarter. Excluding the items noted on this Slide, adjusted PPNR in the fourth quarter was $623 million, up 3% from the prior quarter reflecting growth in NII and improvement in other core fee lines, down 3% from a year ago primarily due to lower mortgage revenue.","Now turning to credit results. As Kevin mentioned, fundamental credit trends remained favorable in the fourth quarter. Starting with charge-offs on Slide 11. Total net charge-offs of $148 million increased $39 million or 36% from the third quarter and were flat from a year ago. The net charge-off ratio was 67 basis points this quarter. During the fourth quarter, we restructured a large loan resulting in a charge-off of $43 million or 19 basis points of loans, which was absorbed by existing reserves for this credit, so there was no overall P&L impact. Excluding this credit, net charge-offs were $105 million or 48 basis points of loans.","Additionally, we changed our policy regarding the timing of when home equity loans are placed on nonaccrual and the treatment of second lien mortgages behind nonperforming first liens. This resulted in additional home equity net charge-offs of $6 million or 3 basis points of loans. Commercial net charge-offs of $78 million increased $34 million sequentially and $22 million from a year ago, driven by the restructured loan that I just mentioned. Excluding this impact, commercial net charge-offs were down $9 million from the prior quarter and C&I net charge-offs were down $21 million.","Commercial real estate net charge-offs were $12 million versus $0 in the previous quarter, and were down $9 million from a year ago. Total consumer net charge-offs was $70 million, up $5 million sequentially and down $21 million from a year ago. Home equity net charge-offs were $26 million, an increase of $7 million from the third quarter primarily due to the change in non-accrual accounting policy that I mentioned.","Given our underwriting standards today, combined with the credit profile of our loan portfolios, we expect our credit performance will remain strong and continue to improve in 2014. NPAs of $980 million at quarter-end were down $34 million or 3% from the third quarter with commercial NPAs down 11% and consumer NPAs up 12%. The change in our home equity nonaccrual policy increased consumer NPAs by $46 million. Excluding the impact of this policy change, consumer NPAs were down 2% sequentially.","The overall NPA ratio was 1.1%, down 6 basis points from the third quarter and 39 basis points from a year ago. Commercial portfolio NPAs were $607 million and declined $73 million or 11% sequentially. The decrease was driven by a $47 million decline in commercial real estate NPAs and a $31 million decline in C&I NPAs. Commercial TDRs on nonaccrual status included in NPAs were $228 million, down $13 million on a sequential basis. Commercial accrual in TDRs were $869 million, up $370 million which includes the impact of the restructured credit that I mentioned earlier.","In the consumer portfolio, NPAs of $373 million increased $39 million as a result of the change in home equity nonaccrual policy. Excluding this change in policy, consumer NPAs were down $7 million from the prior quarter. Non-accruing consumer TDRs included in these results were $136 million, relatively consistent with last quarter. Accruing consumer TDRs were $1.7 billion consistent with last quarter. As you know, performing TDRs which include an interest rate modification below market rates cannot be reclassified out of TDR until they are refinanced on market terms. $1.3 billion of these loans are current and $1.1 billion of them are current and have seasoned for more than a year. We would expect this portfolio to slowly attrite over time as the opportunity and need for new restructurings has declined with improving residential real estate conditions.","Total delinquencies of $379 million were down $35 million or 8% from the third quarter. Loans 30 to 89 days past due were up $18 million from the previous quarter, and loans over 90 days past due were down $53 million from the third quarter primarily due to the change in placing home equity loans over 90 days past due on nonaccrual status.","Commercial criticized asset levels continued to improve, down $390 million or 9% sequentially, and represented the 11th consecutive quarter of decline. Provision expense of $53 million for the quarter was up $2 million from the third quarter and included a reduction in the loan loss allowance of $95 million. Allowance coverage remains strong at 211% of nonperforming loans and 161% of nonperforming assets.","Slide 12 includes a roll-forward of nonperforming loans. Commercial inflows in the fourth quarter were $107 million, up $36 million from the third quarter, due to $43 million in inflows from the restructured credit that I've mentioned. The inflow of this portion of the credit was charged off, as I mentioned, and therefore, there was no impact to our ending NPL balance. Consumer inflows for the quarter were $165 million, up $70 million from last quarter primarily due to $46 million in inflows resulting from the change in the home equity nonaccrual policy.","Slide 13 outlines our recent mortgage repurchase experience. We saw a sequential decrease in GSC claims, which are down 30% from a year ago as well. As previously announced, during the quarter we entered into a settlement for $25 million with Freddie Mac to resolve repurchase claims associated with mortgage loans originated and sold prior to January 1, 2009. As a result, we expect a decline in future claims and repurchase requests.","Turning to capital on Slide 14. Capital levels continue to be very strong. The Tier 1 common equity ratio was 9.4%, down 50 basis points from last quarter. As you may recall, we had somewhat elevated levels of capital at the end of the third quarter due to the timing difference between issuances related to our Series G conversion and subsequent buybacks that occurred during the fourth quarter.","The Tier 1 capital ratio was 10.4% and total risk-based capital was 14.1%. Changes in capital ratios included the impact of the redemption of TruPS during the quarter, as well as the issuance of preferred stock, payment of preferred dividends and share repurchase activity. Tangible equity ratios also continued to be strong with an 8.7% TCE ratio, including unrealized after-tax gains of $82 million, an 8.6% TCE ratio excluding those gains.","Our current pro forma estimate for the Tier 1 common equity ratio under the final Basel III capital rules is 9%. That calculation assumes an exclusion of certain AOCI components from capital, which is subject to an election on our part in early 2015. That pro forma estimate would be about 9.1% including AOCI. As a result, our capital position is well in excess of the minimum required ratios including capital conservation buffers. Just a reminder, our May preferred stock issuance carries a semiannual dividend, which would normally be about $15 million every other quarter. This dividend was $19 million in the fourth quarter as a result of the payment for this top [ph] period.","Our December preferred stock issuance will pay a quarterly dividend, which will be $9 million in the first quarter of 2014 and $7.5 million for each subsequent quarter. So the pattern would be $9 million first quarter, $23 million second quarter, $7.5 million third quarter, and so on. These are after-tax amounts and so they can move EPS a bit from quarter-to-quarter. We will aim to smooth this out with any future preferred stock issuances.","Capital management has been a highlight for us in 2013. We are maintaining very strong levels of capital to support our balance sheet in all environments and returning significant amounts of capital to our shareholders. Our fully diluted share count this year declined by about 50 million shares or 5%, and we will continue to be very disciplined in the way we manage our shareholders' capital.","Turning to the full year 2014 outlook on Slide 15. Consistent with last year, we will provide an update to our annual outlook with each quarter's earnings announcements. As in the past, comparisons with 2013 exclude the impact of Vantiv-related items in 2014 and 2013 as noted in the footnote to this Slide, but otherwise, these are based on reported numbers for simplicity.","I'll start with net interest income. We currently expect full year 2014 NII to increase modestly from full year 2013 NII of $3.6 billion, maybe 2% to 3%. The key drivers of the 2014 growth are loan growth and higher investment securities balances, partially offset by increased funding costs and some additional loan spread compression. We expect NII in the first quarter to decline due to the $12 million negative impact from lower day count, but should be up otherwise and trend up in subsequent quarters throughout 2014.","We anticipate a full year NIM in the 315-basis-point range, plus or minus compared with a 3.21% we reported this past quarter, and that would be due to the effect of lower margin, LCR-friendly portfolio investments and loan spread compression. Our LCR compliance actions should be neutral to positive to NII, but will dilute the NIM. The first quarter NIM should be relatively stable with the benefits of our TruPS redemption and lower day count offset by full quarter impact of debt issuances last quarter, loan spread compression and higher securities balances.","Turning to loan growth, we expect mid-single-digit growth from the 2013 full year average, primarily driven by continued growth in C&I, as well as growth in commercial real estate. These increases will be partially offset by declines in residential mortgage balances and continued runoff in the home equity portfolio. We expect both commercial and consumer deposits to increase.","Now moving onto overall fee income and expense expectations for 2014. As I noted, these comparisons exclude $534 million in 2013 fee income related to Vantiv gains, and our 2014 guidance, likewise, excludes effect from Vantiv events other than our normal equity method income. Overall, we currently expect a mid-single-digit decline in total fee income in 2014 compared with adjusted fee income in 2013, reflecting a forecast reduction in mortgage banking revenue of about $275 million. Excluding mortgage, we expect fees to grow in the mid-single-digits in aggregate versus 2013 with growth in all fee categories other than mortgage.","Looking at the details of our overall fee expectations. We'd expect to see mid-to-high single-digit percentage growth in deposit fees with the majority of that coming from commercial. This expectation reflects a continuation of recent momentum in treasury management as we continue to focus on product penetration and building new accounts. Deposit fees will likely be slightly lower in the first quarter due to seasonality, but continue to trend up throughout the year. We expect low double-digit growth in investment advisory revenue driven primarily by ongoing momentum in both private banking and brokerage. We expect mid-teens growth in corporate banking revenue driven by higher institutional sales revenue, business lending fees and FX fees. We expect mid-to-high single-digit growth in card and processing revenue, driven by continued growth in sales and transaction volumes, although this line item would likely decline in the first quarter due to seasonality.","Turning to mortgage. As I mentioned, we currently expect mortgage banking revenue to decline about $275 million from 2013 based on year-over-year decline in production. We currently expect originations and mortgage revenue to be fairly consistent quarter-to-quarter during 2014, slightly a bit lower during the first quarter of 2014 due to seasonality. Turning to expenses. We currently expect 2014 expenses to decline in the mid-single-digits relative to reported 2013 expenses.","The expected decline is primarily due to lower legal costs and lower personnel cost, primarily mortgage-related. Expenses to billed litigation reserves in 2013 were $159 million in 2013 and while the legal and regulatory environment remains challenging, we certainly hope these costs will be lower in 2014. These expected reductions in expense will be partially offset by increased technology, communications and equipment expense as we continue to invest in our businesses.","In terms of the first quarter of 2014, expenses will include a seasonal increase of about $27 million for FICA and unemployment, but otherwise, we expect expenses to be largely consistent with the $922 million level I discussed earlier, after the investment [ph] this quarter. We will continue to manage expenses carefully and aggressively, in line with revenue results and the economic environment.","Overall, we expect to achieve positive core operating leverage in 2014, excluding Vantiv. We currently expect PPNR growth in the mid-single-digits or a little better in 2014, compared with strong adjusted results in 2013. That's despite comparisons to a strong year for mortgage revenue. We currently expect the efficiency ratio to move below 60% in the second half of 2014. We expect the full year 2014 effective tax rate to be about 28% range, consistent with the 2013 adjusted rate.","Turning to credit. We look for continued improvement in credit trends with full year net charge-offs currently expect -- expected to be down another $100 million or so, and the improvement fairly evenly distributed between commercial and consumer. We expect the full year net charge-off ratio to be in the 40 to 45 basis point range compared with the 58 basis points we reported this year. NPAs should decline another 20% or so in 2014, which would push the NPA ratio solidly below 1% during the year.","For the loan loss allowance, we expect continued reductions in 2014. The ongoing benefit of improvement in credit results is expected to be partially offset by new reserves related to loan growth. Finally, we recently submitted our 2014 capital plan. As Kevin remarked, our expectation is that we would aim to continue to hold common equity capital ratios at approximately current levels. In 2013, net of the share issuances associated with the Series G conversion, that goal required the repurchase of about 40% to 45% of earnings. Something similar will hold true for this year as well given our asset growth expectations.","Consistent with prior plans, we would generally intend to repurchase any equity created through Vantiv-related gains. In terms of dividends, we would expect to continue to target a dividend payout ratio consistent with the Federal Reserve's 30% payout ratio guidance. Obviously any of these plans would be contingent on both a non-objection to our plan from the Federal Reserve and on our board's future decisions.","In summary, 2013 was a strong year for us. We posted solid results and executed on our capital plans. Although the environment remains challenging, we have strong momentum in a number of our core businesses that should support our ability to generate core PPNR growth and improved efficiency while continuing to invest in our business. Overall, we believe we are well-positioned for future success as we head into 2014. That wraps up my remarks. Tanisha, can you open up the line for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just following up on the NIM outlook of 315 plus or minus for the year. I guess if it's relatively stable in 1Q, should we think about have a steady progression down throughout the year?","Daniel T. Poston","Matt, this is Dan. I do believe you're right. You have a few moving parts in the first quarter that drive stability. You have -- all the liability actions we had in the fourth quarter, really paying dividends in the first quarter and holding NIM up, and then what you have in second, third quarter is this loan repricing effect that's pretty consistently been 3, 4 basis points a quarter. And then we see that dissipating just as new production yields reach their inflection point in total portfolio yields. And then the other moving piece to the NIM outlook is just the additional portfolio leverage that will be coming on the sheet as we into a more LCR-friendly balance sheet.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","As we just think about like what part of the interest rate curve you're most sensitive to, short end, mid-part, long end, what should we be focused on in terms of the rate environment, and what needs to happen to stabilize the NIM?","Kevin T. Kabat","Well, clearly the very short end of the curve is very important. The LIBOR indices are very important to C&I yields as we have predominantly LIBOR-based floating loans there. In terms of the consumer loans, the auto yield typically get priced around the 2 to 3 year range and their portfolio is probably more in the 4 plus -- 4, 5, year range, and the 10 year is obviously is very important from a mortgage MBS pricing perspective. So we don't really have anything longer than that and that would impact us.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, in terms of how asset-sensitive you are, if short rates do rise?","Kevin T. Kabat","I mean, short rates clearly are extremely helpful for NII growth, but our guidance for this year does not assume any increases in the underlying LIBOR indices as we expected that to be on hold. But we are very positive we leverage to the short end of the curve.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with SunTrust Robinson.","Eric Edmund Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just to follow up on the tail end of Matt's question, has your move to become more LCR-friendly, has that reduced your asset sensitivity at all?","Kevin T. Kabat","No, we've been able to manage the asset sensitivity fairly consistently and slightly asset-sensitive. We wrapped up the year in a up 100 ramp at about positive 1%, and up 200 ramp at about 2% in year 1, and I think we've consistently been in that space all year.","Daniel T. Poston","What we have to keep in mind is that we have to look at both the asset and the liability sides and look at the duration on both ends and clearly, long-term debt issuances on the liability side tend to increase the duration of the liabilities as some of the investment portfolio numbers may lengthen the investment portfolios ratios a little bit. There is somewhat of a balance on the liability side to that.","Eric Edmund Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And just on the asset growth, I have a few questions. It looks like your GAAP assets went up about 4% sequentially, but the Basel I risk-weighted went up only about 2% and the Basel III actually went up even less than that at about 1.7%. So I'm just wondering what would explain that progression?","Daniel T. Poston","You do have a little bit of the benefit in the RWA calculation as we migrated the investment portfolio out of less LCR-friendly instruments into U.S. Government backed, which carries 0 risk-weighting. So we finished the year a little bit north of $4 billion in Ginnie, which carry a 0 risk-weighted whereas couple of quarters ago, that allocation would have been near 0. So frees up a little bit of capital in the process.","Kevin T. Kabat","And one other [ph] thing really in particular that would distinguish Basel I from Basel III, I mean, other than just the denominator is different.","Eric Edmund Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","And was there any growth in your off balance sheet loan commitments in the period?","Daniel T. Poston","Yes. I mean, there is continued growth there. That's probably, this quarter would have been commensurate with our interest total loan growth, I would assume.","Eric Edmund Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And -- but the Basel III sounds like it did not reflect to any kind of operating risk charge related to your growth in litigation reserves.","Kevin T. Kabat","No.","Tayfun Tuzun","No.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","You've given us some complete guidance in terms of the mortgage side of things. I guess, I'm just curious, in terms of the cost reductions within the mortgage business. I believe you said last quarter you took out about $25 million in cost from that business. I'm curious what the cost -- the incremental cost reduction was in the fourth quarter, and how you're thinking about cost reductions, specifically within the mortgage business over the course of 2014.","Tayfun Tuzun","I think the cost reductions this quarter was about $19 million in the high teens relative to the $25 million. We will continue, obviously, to manage expenses in the mortgage business throughout the year in 2014. We are still making moves there even this quarter as we expect production numbers to come down. And we clearly are expecting some uptick in Q2 and Q3 related to purchase volumes and that business will remain strong and will maintain enough capacity to address any borrowing needs. But outside that, you will see that -- and we reflected, obviously, the impact of our 2014 plans on our guidance. But if production numbers change in actual, we will be very quick to respond either way.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A question on capital and specifically, you're thinking about including -- or excluding the AOCI from capital numbers. You noted in the release that they would benefit today from the inclusion of AOCI. How are you thinking about that going forward, given the rising rate environment would be likely to create some additional volatility in that number that might be less welcome?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes. I mean absolutely. I mean, we clearly are very focused on the impact of higher rates and on mark-to-markets and that will be a very big factor in our decision as we approach year-end. We would expect to opt out at this point.","Kevin T. Kabat","I mean, we would expect opt out even if we were in a gain position.","Daniel T. Poston","Right. It doesn't -- really it will not necessarily reflect where we are at the end of this year, whether we are in a gain position or in a loss position. I just don't think that it pays to take that volatility in our capital ratios.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then just finally, a quick administrative question. You noted at the end of the third quarter, your [ph] reasonable possible losses -- litigation losses would be about $177 million. Does that number come down by the amount that you provided for this quarter?","Kevin T. Kabat","We will disclose that in the K, but I don't think there's any reason to expect any big move in that.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just a question on mortgage related to -- when you talk about a decline of 275 off of the 700 this year, was that decline -- would the '14 outlook for mortgage include any MSR gains in your outlook?","Daniel T. Poston","We don't typically include MSR gains in our outlook, Ken, I mean because that's clearly a very volatile number.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Right. So that would be gravy to that number. Okay, and then secondly, do you have any incremental plans to do additional preferred issuances and\/or debt financing? That clearly -- that were big benefits to the size of the balance sheet. I'm just wondering what you're funding plans are you look ahead?","Daniel T. Poston","Yes. We are about 2\/3 in our preferred bucket today, so we do have another $500 million or so left, and we do continue to believe that the way to manage the capital account efficiently would require us to fulfill that bucket. So we may include that in our 2014 fund. In addition, on an ongoing basis, we do have additional debt issuance plans in 2014.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And that -- is that -- okay, that's fine. So in terms of earning asset growth, can you talk about the mid-single digit loan growth, and I understand the basis of earning asset growth more than offsetting the NIM growth. But how would you compare your view of mid-single-digit loan growth, to what -- how big you expect the overall earning asset base to go next year?","Daniel T. Poston","I think our earning assets will likely to be north of that, and I would say, there's going to be probably 5%-plus. But as we have always said, there is an LCR component to our investment portfolio balance strategy, but there is also a risk\/return component. And during the year we will make that determination as we see the market developing. So it's hard to tell exactly how much over 5% we may get to, but that's our current plan.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And then last quarter question, just on the deposit growth of Kevin, you mentioned how strong it was and especially in commercial. Was any of that kind of fleeting that came in the fourth and was gone by the end of the quarter from a yearend perspective or do you believe that this kind of pace of deposit growth is core and sustainable?","Kevin T. Kabat","Ken, we did not see it fleet and so it's sticky and we expect that to continue obviously as we've talked and try to bake into the guidance that we gave you for '14, our anticipation is that we're continuing to have a platform with which to be able to grow, attract and keep our clients from that standpoint. We would expect some utilization of those deposit before they come to us for loans which we haven't seen yet, but no, those were sticky and safe.","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes, the other thing I would add to that is, maybe 2 or 3 years ago, obviously, we were -- sort of [ph] passive receiver of large amounts of liquidity, but today, we're very active and the deposit growth numbers reflect true business strategies, both on the commercial side, as well as the consumer side. So that's part of the reason why these fluctuations are likely to stick because again, we're not passively receiving these funds.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","You talked about how your line usage, it went down, but you're also, at the same time, talking about -- and other banks have said this, that you feel that loan growth is -- that it's going to be very solid or not solid relative to where we used to be but pretty good 3% or 5% range. Can you just talk about, is this conversations that you're having out there, I mean, what are you seeing out there to give you self confidence that even though usage is down loan growth is going to pick up?","Kevin T. Kabat","Yes, Paul, this is Kevin. I would tell you that, that is accurate in terms of kind of what we're seeing as a barometer. Our conversations directly with clients and prospects. The tonality I would tell you, has changed. So there's a little bit more positiveness in it. There is a bit more outlook and upbeat in terms of their view. How fast that comes, how fast the change comes, we're not sure, but we've seen fairly good production. Continued strong pipelines from that standpoint which will be consistent with some of that outlook and some of that optimism that we're really beginning to feel or see with our clients. And that definitely is a total change in the last 90, 120 days.","Unknown Executive","And we saw -- we had solid loan growth in 2013 while we saw line usage go down as well. So it's...","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And what areas, I mean what are some of the areas that you really -- I guess where you're excited about, like some of the loan growth areas?","Kevin T. Kabat","We continue to see good strength in manufacturing. We continue to see it in our mid corporate and large corporate. We continue to see it in our verticals, both in our healthcare and in our energy verticals. So pretty broad-based, Paul, from that standpoint. And as Tayfun mentioned in detailing some of the specifics for the quarter, we're beginning to see now some good demand showing up in the commercial real estate side. Our construction average balances were up, as you can see, substantially for us. Building, we think in terms of some momentum for commercial real estate. That will be positive for us and we're seeing some good projects to be able to continue that growth. So that's where we see it, so a broader focus from our standpoint still feels right [ph] from our standpoint.","Operator","And your next question will be from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just wanted to go back to the comment that you're not passively receiving your deposits. Obviously, really strong deposit growth this quarter. How much of that was actually not related to your strategy so much, but because you chose to aggressively pull in deposits this quarter, whether through it's better pricing versus your strategy. I mean, if that make sense, because what I'm trying to figure out is, are you bolstering liquidity intentionally by bringing in deposits to bear pricing?","Tayfun Tuzun","Actually that's a very good question. We have not done any significant pricing changes in either commercial or retail deposit space. I think what we are seeing is on the consumer side, the deposit simplification project that we finished earlier this year truly had a fairly significant impact on average balances. As depositors with higher average balances pay less fees, we've seen that impact fairly clearly during the year. On the commercial side, it truly is a function of our turnkey management activities. Overall, we talked about this, I think, in other earnings conference calls. The relationship-based approach, away from single credit relationships and commercial tends to have very good impact on deposits. Clearly, we like it. It's, from an LCR perspective, a large majority of deposits are LCR-friendly. So we are encouraging our sales force to focus on deposit growth, but we have not done anything from a pricing perspective. Now, looking into 2014 and beyond, obviously, we will -- reactive -- the competitive environment changes significantly from where we see today.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Keith Murray with ISI.","Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Could you just touch on deposit events, changes and you talked about service charges, revenue increasing. Is that baked into your guidance for '14?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes, and you've seen our announcement, it's a phase-out plan and it is baked into our forecast for the upcoming year.","Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then you talked about growth assumptions for '14. What you assume risk weighted assets, either Basel I or Basel III will grow by in 2014?","Tayfun Tuzun","It's probably going to below our true earnings asset growth as a portion of that earning asset growth is going to not put much pressure on that. We would expect that to be probably under 5% at this point.","Keith Murray - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then finally on expenses, you mentioned potential in the mortgage business. Are there opportunities outside of mortgage that could be meaningful, and what kind of pension expense savings do you have baked in for '14?","Tayfun Tuzun","There is nothing on the pension expense side. Yes, I mean, there clearly, we've talked in December in one of the conferences about the changes that are occurring on the retail side of the business. As we reconfigure our retail delivery channel, you will see some savings there. In addition to that, you need to look at this guidance in its entirety. Clearly, if the expense side goes together with the revenue side and if we see changes on the revenue side, we will react and there is going to be more expense savings. Across the board, we do truly -- many people talk about their ongoing focus on expenses, but I think we've proven to you guys that, that truly happens here and mortgage will not be the only business where we will see expense savings this year.","Frank R. Forrest","I just want to jump in and clarify on the last question. I think RWI growth is likely to be closer to the mid-single digits range that [ph] the about mid-single digits that earning assets growth will have -- I don't know may be little bit low but I'm not sure with respect to the growth opportunity [ph] .","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Owen Lau with Janney Capital Market.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Actually this is Sameer Gokhale from Janney Capital. A couple of questions I wanted to ask. Firstly, in terms of the credit metrics, if you adjust for some of the charges that were taken this quarter in your commercial loan portfolio and then also the change in accounting policy for home equity loans and you back those out, it looks like there's some improvement in the credit metrics, but they seem more or less relatively stable, at least sequentially. And I was trying to look at those metrics and kind of reconcile those with your forward guidance for charge-offs to be down $100 million. I mean, it seems like certainly we're in a very good or benign charge-off environment. But what gives you increased confidence or confidence that the magnitude of the improvement in charge-offs should maybe accelerate a little bit just based again on the sequential trends between Q3 and Q4? It seems like that the metrics is somewhat stable. So could you talk about that a little bit?","Frank R. Forrest","This is a Frank Forrest, good question. The guidance we gave a year around charge-offs was $200 million down and our guidance this year is $100 million down, and when you look across our portfolio, it was rather granular, we're making substantial progress, we have intense focus on continuing to see improvement and both on the charge-off metrics, consumer and commercial, and also on the nonperforming portfolio, which our guidance is down 20% for 2014. We're confident that we'll continue to see progress. So we don't think we're at the inflection point yet at Fifth Third. We see substantial additional opportunity for progress. Might have slowed a little bit in the fourth quarter, but it's not necessarily reflective of our outlook for the entire year of 2014. Good question, though.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And then just in terms of your reserve ratio, your allowance to loan and leases, the guidance says that you expect it to be lower compared to the end of the year number of 1.79%. And clearly, where that allowance ratio goes, the reserve ratio goes, is going to be the only kind of missing piece from the guidance that will help us get to the provision number. So have you talked about where you expect that reserve ratio to go by the end of 2014? Should we anticipate going down as far as 1.5%? Does that seem aggressive? Could you help us size that?","Jeff Richardson","This is Jeff. We have talked in the past about obviously, there are a lot of moving parts to where the allowance ratio ends up, including new rules. And we've indicated that it felt like maybe 1.5% would be the sort of place that the ratio may go. It obviously could end up being higher than that or lower. We can't really predict that and we do understand that, that may be the missing piece for our guidance. Our guidance is pretty clear, but we cannot predict with certainty what our allowance ratio will be at the end of the year and we're not going to provide guidance as if we can. That allowance is set at the end of the each quarter based on our models. So I don't know if [ph] you want to add anything there? Obviously, we expect it to go down, but we can't really sort of give you a good prediction as to where it will end.","Sameer Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And just on an unrelated note related to the deposit advances which you said you'll stop offering. Are you planning to replace that with any sort of other secured product as some of your competitors have indicated they might do? Or are you just completely stopping that and not replacing that with [ph] anything else?","Kevin T. Kabat","No. Clearly, I think as we announced last week, our expectation, we see, with our consumers and our customers a high demand in this area, simply changing this doesn't change the demand perspective. We have been dealing [ph] and working with all of our stakeholders and trying to come up with solutions that we think would benefit everyone, from that standpoint. So we're committed to that. We got a lot of work to do. We'll continue that work and so I don't have anything that I would say to you today that is at hand for us in terms of replacing that. Our expectation is we'll continue to look to see if we can find a good solution, keep our clients in a regulated banking system, which we think is best for all.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the allotted time for the Q&A portion for today's call.

My name is Kenya and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bank Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Richardson, you may begin your conference.","Jeff Richardson","Thanks, Kenya. Good morning. Today we'll be talking with you about our first quarter 2012 results. This call may contain certain forward-looking statements about Fifth Third pertaining to our financial condition, results of operations, plans and objectives. These statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. There are a number of factors that could cause results to differ materially from historical performance in these statements. We've identified some of these factors in our forward-looking cautionary statement at the end of our earnings release and in other materials, and we encourage you to review them. Fifth Third undertakes no obligation and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call.","I'm joined on the call by several people: Kevin Kabat, our President and CEO; Chief Financial Officer, Dan Poston; Chief Credit Officer, Bruce Lee; Treasurer, Tayfun Tuzun; and Jim Eglseder of Investor Relations.","During the question and answer period, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator. ","With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin Kabat. Kevin?","Kevin T. Kabat","Thanks, Jeff. First quarter was a very strong start to the year for Fifth Third. We reported first-quarter net income to common shareholders of $421 million and earnings per diluted common share of $0.45. Excluding net gains related to Vantiv which were itemized in the release, earnings would have been $0.36. That would be a 9% sequential increase from the $0.33 we reported in the fourth quarter of 2011. Revenue results were better than we expected back in January driven by continued strong mortgage revenue, corporate banking revenue and in investment advisory fees. Mortgage business has been a great business for us over the last couple of years. We've picked up significant market share and that provided significant cross sell value to us as well. We expect that to continue in the second quarter. Corporate banking also came in strong with an 18% sequential increase and investment advisory revenue was up 7% from the fourth quarter. We again posted very solid loan growth for the quarter, particularly in C&I loans, which were up 5% sequentially on an average basis. Credit trends also continued to improve. Net charge-offs declined for the fourth consecutive quarter to $220 million or 1.08% of loans while nonperforming assets declined $143 million down 8% on a sequential basis. Delinquencies dropped 11% and our criticized asset levels continue to decline as well. So we're seeing ongoing conversions towards historical levels across the board.","Deposit generation continues to be a strength for us with average transaction deposit growth of 2% sequentially and $7.7 billion or 10% from last year. We're adding new customers and growing balances with current customers with our value based approach to products and services. Capital levels also continue to be very strong, including under the rules proposed by Basel III. Our Tier 1 common ratio was 9.6% and we estimate our pro forma Tier 1 common ratio would be about 10% on a fully phased-in Basel III basis. We believe that would place us among the highest Basel III capital positions of the top 20 U.S. banks. As you know, we submitted our annual capital plan last quarter to the Federal Reserve, which included, among other plans, increasing our quarterly dividend in initiating common share repurchases including using any after-tax gains related to share offerings and Vantiv. And as announcement of CCAR results, the Fed's independent analysis with the 19 banks results indicated that our expected capital levels and profitability levels under stress were among the strongest of the banks tested. The Fed did not object to our continuation of the current common dividend or repurchasing shares with any Vantiv gains. They did, however, object to the planned dividend increase and other share repurchases. As you know, we're not permitted by Fed rules to comment on the reasons for their objection. The resubmission will be based on March 31, 2012 results, using new macroeconomic scenarios. We believe we'll be able to address their concerns in our resubmission, which we expect in late May or early June. Capital plans rules provide that the Federal respond no later than 75 days after a resubmission, so most likely sometime in August. We would currently expect to include similar plans for the dividend and share repurchases as originally submitted, subject to our evaluation of the scenarios and results and board consideration in approval of the plan. We have substantial capital and earnings capacity, including under stressed assumptions to distribute a significantly higher percentage of our earnings to shareholders while maintaining capital above targeted and required levels. ","Now turning to the economy. The overall economic picture remains about where it's been for more than a year. We're seeing slow improvement in a number of areas but the pace of the recovery is noticeably weaker than any post recession period in memory. Companies we call on remain, to a large extent, in a wait-and-see mode; not on defense, but not yet fully committed to offense either. As the year progresses, we expect to see continued improvement in the economy and in the business environment, but the pace of the recovery is very likely to remain slower than what we would like. ","Before I turn it over to Dan, I want to mention the strategic transactions that were announced in late March and early April. This is Vantiv's -- the first is Vantiv's initial public offering. This was part of a several year process that we started back in 2008. When we made the decision to sell an interest in Fifth Third processing solution, we believed that the growth of the business would be accelerated by enabling it to operate independently and that's exactly what's happened. Vantiv nearly doubled its revenue between 2008 and '11, which also included the benefit of several acquisitions. Those acquisitions would have been difficult to accomplish and had -- had the processing business remained a fully consolidated subsidiary of the bank. We continue to own a 39% interest in the company, whose stock was valued at $4.2 billion at the end of the first quarter. That represents about $1.6 billion of pretax value to Fifth Third, which is carried on our books at only $600 million. That's after recognizing about $2 billion pretax through gains to date. We feel very good about the way we've executed on our strategy and think we and Vantiv are in a good position as we move forward. ","The second, we announced in early April that we were selling our money market mutual funds to Federated Investors, and our retail stock and bond funds to Touchtone. These transactions will allow us to focus on areas of strength for Fifth Third, versus mutual fund product manufacturing. The transactions aren't expected to have a material impact in the results, but they are expected to have a small positive earnings effect for us on an ongoing basis. Both of these transactions have been a priority for us for some time now and it's great to see our strategies bearing fruit. They've strengthened our company by increasing our focus and core strength in sales and service distribution and providing our customers with advice that they can trust. ","So it was a good start to the year and reflected good momentum as we look forward to the second quarter and second half of the year. Pipelines are strong and we're seeing solid loan growth. The rate environment is challenging, but manageable. Credit continues to improve overall and across virtually all portfolios. We've already felt most of the negative impact from Regulatory Reform as applicable to Fifth Third, and we do expect further mitigation in coming quarters. And our capital position is very strong, well above Basel III requirements already and we have substantial capacity to increase distributions. ","At this point, I'll ask Dan to discuss operating results and give some comments about our outlook. Dan?","Daniel T. Poston","Okay, thanks, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. I'll start with Slide 4 of the presentation and move into some of the details of the results for the quarter. ","In the first quarter, we reported net income of $430 million and recorded preferred dividends of $9 million. Therefore, net income to common shareholders was $421 million resulting in diluted earnings per share of $0.45, which was up 36% or $0.12 from the fourth quarter level. There were a number of unusual items during the quarter, although it was probably not as noisy as it might seem. As outlined in the release, first quarter results included several income items related to Vantiv that together contributed a total of $125 million in fee income for the quarter, which is about $0.09 per share after tax. Those items were $115 million in gains related to Vantiv's IPO. An estimated $36 million in charges that were recorded through equity method earnings related to Vantiv's refinancing of its bank debt, and $46 million in gains on Vantiv warrants. ","The first 2 items are clearly unusual in nature. As far as the warrant gains go, we do frequently have gains or losses there but the size of the gains this quarter was unusual and related to the sizable increase in Vantiv's valuation in connection with its initial public offering. Other than the Vantiv impact, there were several other unusual items affecting results that largely offset one another. ","In fee income, we recorded $19 million in charges on the Visa total return swap and $9 million in investment securities gains. In expenses, we recorded a $23 million benefit from the resolution of certain non-income tax related assessments. And recorded expenses of $28 million related to additions to litigation reserves, debt termination and severance. ","Taking a look at Slide 5. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis decreased $17 million sequentially to $903 million, and the net interest margin decreased 6 basis points to 3.61%. The decline in net interest income was primarily driven by asset yield compression in loans and securities, which was partially offset by balance growth in C&I, commercial lease, residential mortgage and auto loans. Interest expense increased $1 million as lower deposit costs were offset by a $5 million increase in hedging effectiveness. And then overall, NII was reduced by about $6 million due to day count. As for the margin, the decline was largely attributable to lower loan yields. Otherwise, lower securities yields, hedging effectiveness each reduced margin by 2 basis points, while deposit mix shift and day count each contributed about 2 basis points. To give a little more color on loan yields, on the C&I side, the portfolio average yield was down 8 basis points compared with last quarter. Yields on new originations have remained relatively stable, so the portfolio yield compression is largely the effect of portfolio repricing as well as the origination of higher quality loans, which naturally will carry a lower rate. In the indirect auto portfolio, the portfolio average yield has continued to decline, reflecting both increased competition in this space, as well as the portfolio effect of replacing older higher yielding loans with newer lower yielding loans. We will continue to closely manage pricing in loan volumes in the coming quarters to ensure that our returns remain appropriate. We currently expect NII in the second quarter to be down about $5 million to $10 million to the $895 million range, which is consistent with previous expectations. That's despite the impact of our debt issuance in March, which will cost us about $3 million for the full quarter and the impact of the Vantiv refinancing, which is about a $2 million income reduction. Otherwise, we'd expect loan growth and lower hedging effectiveness to more or less offset the impact of the rate environment on loans and security yields. ","In terms of the margin, we currently expect NIM to decline about 5 or 6 basis points due to the same factors outlined above. We generally expect the margin to stabilize in the second half of the year and for continued loan growth to produce NII growth in the second half. We continue to expect growth in full-year 2012 NII compared to 2011 with the full-year margin at the lower end of our outlook. ","Turning to the balance sheet in Slide 6. Average earning assets increased $971 million sequentially driven by a $1.5 billion increase in total loan balances partially offset by $508 million decrease in investment securities and other short-term investments. The securities portfolio trends reflect lower cash balances at the Fed, which are included in short-term investment balances. We expect the securities portfolio to be relatively stable over the next few quarters. Average portfolio loans and leases increased $1.6 billion sequentially, driven by positive trends in C&I, commercial lease, residential mortgage and auto loans. Those were partially offset by continued run-off in the commercial real estate and home equity books. Average loans held-for-sale were down $107 million during the quarter. ","Looking at each loan portfolio. Average commercial loans held for investment increased $1.3 billion sequentially or 3%, and $2.5 billion year-over-year or 6%. Average C&I loans increased $1.5 billion sequentially, that's a 5% increase from last quarter and a 15% increase from a year ago. Our C&I production continues to be strong and has been broad-based across industries and sectors. We're seeing continued demand in the large corporate and mid corporate space. Given our strong levels of production and our current pipelines, I expect we'll continue to see solid growth in the second quarter, even in the current environment. ","Commercial line utilization remained at 32% this quarter, which is consistent with last quarter. Commercial mortgage and commercial construction balances declined in the aggregate by $395 million sequentially or about 3%. We expect runoff in these portfolios to continue to slow, and I would expect that the size of this portfolio will generally plateau in the second half of the year. ","Commercial lease balances were up 6% sequentially after remaining relatively stable for the past several quarters. This represents increased seasonal activity that occurred in December of last year, and I would expect these balances to remain relatively stable in the coming quarters. Average consumer loans in the portfolio increased $309 million sequentially or 1%, and $1.4 billion compared with a year ago, which is about 4%. Average residential mortgage loans in the portfolio were up 3% sequentially. The sequential growth reflected strong originations during the quarter due to the current rate environment as well as the continued retention of certain shorter-term higher-quality residential mortgages originated through our branch retail system. These mortgages increased $286 million on an end-of-period basis during the first quarter. Average auto loan balances increased 2% sequentially. We continue to see a significant amount of competitive yield pressure in this space and as a result, origination volumes came down some this quarter, as we managed our volumes with an eye on profitability. ","Home equity loan balances were down 2% sequentially and average credit card balances were up 1% sequentially. ","Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect to see growth in C&I and mortgage loans, partially offset by continued declines in commercial real estate and home equity balances. Overall, that should result in continued solid overall loan portfolio growth in the second quarter. ","Moving on to deposits. Deposit growth remained exceptionally strong. Average core deposits were up $1.1 billion or 1% compared with last quarter. Average transaction deposits, which exclude consumer CDs, were up $1.5 billion or 2% on a sequential basis, and up $7 billion or 10% from a year ago. Growth in transaction deposits was largely driven by interest checking balances, which were up 16% from the prior quarter and 20% from a year ago. Consumer CDs declined $409 million in the quarter driven by our continued disciplined approach to CD pricing. Average consumer transaction deposits increased 1% sequentially and 7% year-over-year, with growth across most categories. Our relationship savings products has now attracted over $14 billion of balances since its inception nearly 3 years ago. Given the current rate environment, we expect to continue to see customers moving funds into liquid savings products when CDs mature. ","Average commercial transaction deposits increased 3% from last quarter and 14% from a year ago. Customers continue to use balances in order to offset fees due to the lack of a better investment opportunity for their excess cash and I expect that tendency will continue given the current rate environment. For the second quarter, we currently expect transaction deposits to be relatively stable compared to first quarter and for consumer CD balances to continue to decline. ","Now turning to fees, which are outlined on Slide 7. First quarter noninterest income was $769 million, an increase of $219 million from last quarter and that includes the $125 million in net benefits related to Vantiv that I discussed earlier. Excluding that, noninterest income was up $94 million driven by strong mortgage banking, corporate banking revenue and investment advisory results, as well as the effect of the Visa total return swap. As I mentioned earlier, we recorded $19 million in negative valuation adjustments related to that Visa total return swap this quarter, while in the fourth quarter, we recorded a $54 million negative valuation adjustment on the swap due to Visa's funding of their litigation reserve. So while a negative for this quarter, the positive delta there was $35 million in terms of our fee growth sequentially. As you'll recall, this swap -- with this swap we essentially sold the economics of our Visa shares to a counter party while retaining the litigation risk that Visa member banks have. ","Now looking at each line item in detail. Deposit service charges declined 5% sequentially, but increased 4% from the prior year. Consumer deposit fees decreased 10% sequentially and 1% year-over-year. The sequential decline was driven by seasonally lower overdraft occurrences in the first quarter. Commercial deposit fees declined 1% from last quarter, but increased 7% year-over-year driven by new customer account growth. For the second quarter, we expect to see a solid increase in deposit fees, about $5 million or so, driven by growth in the commercial deposit fees. Investment advisory revenue increased 7% from last quarter and decreased 1% on a year-over-year basis. The sequential increase is largely due to seasonal trust tax preparation fees, increased brokerage revenue and higher market values. We currently expect to see a modest further increase in investment advisory revenue in the second quarter driven by brokerage revenue. ","Corporate banking revenue of $97 million increased 18% from the fourth quarter and 13% from last year. The sequential increase was primarily due to higher syndication fee revenue as well as increased lease related fees, institutional sales and business lending fees. We expect second quarter corporate banking revenue of about $100 million up moderately from the solid results in the first quarter. Card and processing revenue was $59 million, down $1 million from the fourth quarter and $21 million from a year ago. The sequential decline was driven by seasonally strong fourth quarter volumes while a year-over-year decline represents the impact of the new debit interchange rules, which cost us about $30 million on a quarterly basis. We've mitigated a little less than half of that thus far through various revenue and expense categories. ","Our current expectation for second quarter total card and processing revenue is for growth of about $10 million from the first quarter levels due to higher volumes and seasonality. Mortgage banking revenue of $204 million increased $48 million from the fourth quarter and $102 million from a year ago. Originations were $6.4 billion this quarter compared with $7.1 billion in the fourth quarter. ","Gains on deliveries of $174 million increased $22 million from the previous quarter. Servicing fees were $61 million compared with $58 million last quarter, and net servicing asset valuation adjustments were negative $31 million this quarter with MSR amortization of $46 million and net MSR valuation adjustments, including hedges, of a positive $15 million. In the fourth quarter, net servicing asset valuation adjustments were a negative $54 million. Currently, we would expect mortgage banking revenue to be down about $50 million from the first quarter with volumes at similar levels, but we would expect lower MSR results and the gain on sale margin to decline from the relatively high levels we saw during the first quarter. ","Net gains on the sale of investment securities were $9 million in the first quarter compared with net gains of $5 million in the prior quarter. ","Turning to other income within fees. Other income was $175 million, compared with $24 million last quarter. All of the Vantiv related effects are recorded in this line item. Additionally, as I mentioned, we had a charge on the Visa total return swap of $19 million this quarter versus $54 million last quarter. Other significant items in other income include equity method earnings from our interest in Vantiv. And that included the estimated $36 million charge related to Vantiv's debt termination and refinancing charges that were disclosed in March. Now that Vantiv is a public company, we expect to have additional information to provide related to our equity method earnings results in our quarterly filings after Vantiv reports its earnings. But we won't be explicit about that contribution in our earnings releases and related calls. ","Credit costs recorded in other noninterest income were $14 million in the first quarter compared with $33 million last quarter. That decline was largely due to decreased fair value charges on commercial loans held-for-sale, which were $1 million in the first quarter compared with $18 million last quarter. Otherwise, these costs were $13 million in the first quarter compared with $15 million in the fourth quarter. We expect second quarter credit cost in revenue to be in that $15 million range. ","Looking at overall fee income expectations for the second quarter, we currently expect fee income of about $625 million to $630 million in the second quarter or perhaps a bit better. That's better than we were expecting in January, but down about $15 million to $20 million from fee income resulting the first quarter, which were $644 million, exclusive of the Vantiv gains we've discussed. That decline would be driven by lower mortgage banking revenue that I've discussed, and partially offset by fee income growth that we currently expect in other business lines. ","Turning now to expenses there on Slide 8. Noninterest expense of $973 million was down $20 million or 2% sequentially. Current quarter expenses included the $23 million benefit from agreements reached on certain non-income tax related assessments, offset by $13 million in additions to litigation reserves, $9 million in debt extinguishment charges and $6 million in severance expense. You'll recall that the prior quarter expenses included $19 million in additions to litigation reserves. So if you exclude those items, noninterest expenses were down $6 million, and that's despite a $25 million seasonal increase in FICA and unemployment costs. That improvement was driven by lower credit related costs as well as careful management of expenses. Credit related costs within operating expense were $34 million, down $10 million from last quarter. That decline was driven by lower workout related expenses within other assets, other problem asset related expense, which was $19 million this quarter compared to $28 million last quarter. As well as a modest reduction in mortgage repurchase expense to $15 million. We saw a slight uptick in our claims inventory as we expected, but within the range of variability that we've seen historically. We haven't seen any significant increase in recognized losses associated with GSC activity. ","In terms of the second quarter, we currently expect total credit related cost recognized in expense to be stable to up modestly from the first quarter levels. Overall, we currently expect operating expense in the second quarter to be down about $15 million from the $973 million reported this past quarter. Key drivers of that decrease are the net $5 million in unusual first quarter items that I mentioned earlier, a reduction of about $15 million related to FICA and unemployment expense, as well as continued expense discipline. Partially offsetting those benefits, we'll see a temporary increase in marketing expense during the second and the third quarters of about $15 million above the first quarter levels. Those are related to our new branding campaign and the related advertising. Those expenses will come back down to first quarter levels on a run-rate basis in the fourth quarter. ","We continue to expect that our quarterly efficiency ratio will move back close to 60% or so by the end of the year, reflecting the trends that I just discussed. ","Moving on to Slide 9, and taking a look at PPNR. Pre-provision net revenue was $694 million in the first quarter compared with $473 million in the fourth quarter. This quarter's results included the $125 million in benefits related to Vantiv. If you exclude that, PPNR in the first quarter was $569 million, driven by strong fee income results and disciplined expense management, as most of the other unusual items that I mentioned largely offset one another. We expect PPNR to be the same ballpark in the second quarter and again, that's above the previous expectations that we had. ","The effective tax rate was 29% this quarter. Higher than we were initially expecting and that was due to the effect of the Vantiv IPO gains. For the second quarter, we expect the effective tax rate to be 32% or 33%, and that's due to the effect of stock options that are expiring. Those will cost us about $0.02 in the quarter, in the second quarter while in the third and fourth quarters, the effective tax rate should be at about the 28.5% range, which will result in a full-year tax rate of about 29%. ","Turning to capital on Slide 10. Capital levels continue to be very strong. Tier 1 common ratio increased about 30 basis points to 9.6%, reflecting higher retained earnings. Tier 1 capital was 12.2%, up 28 basis points from last quarter, while total capital ratio was 16.1% and consistent with the fourth quarter level. Tangible common equity was 9.0%. That's calculated excluding unrealized gains, which totaled $468 million on an after-tax basis. All in, TCE was 9.4% and that was up 33 basis points from last quarter. ","Our current estimate for our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio would be about 10.0%. These ratios are all significantly above our targets and the common ratios exceed targeted levels by well over 100 basis points. As Kevin mentioned, we plan to repurchase common shares in an amount equal to the after-tax gains realized from the Vantiv common shares, which were about $75 million this quarter. And we expect to enter into an accelerated share repurchase agreement shortly. Additionally, we entered into agreements in early April to sell certain mutual funds and money market funds from our asset management business. We expect these transactions to close in the third quarter, but they are not expected to have a material impact on our results. After the closing, our investment advisory fees will be reduced by about $5 million per quarter and we expect expenses will be reduced by a similar amount, but overall, it should be a net positive from a bottom-line perspective. ","That wraps up my remarks. I'll now turn it over to Bruce to discuss credit trends. Bruce?","Bruce K. Lee","Thanks, Dan. Starting with charge offs on Slide 11. Total net charge-offs of $220 million in the first quarter declined 8% sequentially, and were at their lowest level since the end of 2007. Commercial net charge-offs declined to $102 million or 89 basis points. That was also the first time since the fourth quarter of 2007 that commercial net charge offs fell below the 100 basis point level. We saw improvement in C&I charge-offs down $8 million sequentially to $54 million, and in commercial mortgage charge-offs down $17 million to $30 million. Commercial construction charge-offs increased to $18 million from a very low $4 million last quarter. Total consumer net charge offs of $118 million, down $8 million sequentially. Improvement was broad-based and reflects underlying trends in the overall consumer credit environment and the impact of our portfolio management actions. As a macro comment, we're at a point where we're seeing steady improvement across the loan portfolios and looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect net charge offs to be down another $25 million or so, with pretty significant reductions on both the commercial and consumer sides. ","Now moving to nonperforming assets on Slide 12. NPAs, including those held-for-sale, totaled $1.8 billion at quarter-end, down $164 million or 8% from the fourth quarter. Excluding held-for-sale, NPAs were $1.7 billion down $143 million or 8%. Commercial portfolio NPAs were $1.2 billion and declined $114 million or 9% sequentially. We saw improvement across all categories with commercial mortgage NPAs down $69 million, C&I NPAs down $35 million, commercial construction NPAs down $8 million and commercial lease NPAs down $2 million. Also, commercial OREO was down a pretty substantial $41 million to $236 million. ","Across the commercial portfolios, residential builder and developer NPAs of $123 million, were down $32 million sequentially and represent less than 10% of total commercial NPAs. Within portfolio NPAs, commercial TDRs on nonaccrual status were relatively flat on a sequential basis. Commercial accruing TDRs were up $91 million, although they remain fairly low at $481 million. We expect to continue to selectively restructure commercial loans where it makes economic sense for the bank. ","In the consumer portfolio, NPAs declined $29 million to $449 million or 1.26% of loans, with NPLs down about $20 million and OREO down $9 million. Non-accruing consumer TDRs were down $19 million and accruing consumer TDRs were up $12 million in the quarter. The total portfolio actually declined $7 million, which marks the first decline since we began our restructuring program in 2007. The portfolio has generally peaked as opportunities for new restructurings have become more limited due to our past proactive practices and more stable residential real estate credit conditions. Overall, our TDR portfolio is performing in line with our expectations and significantly outperforms non-accruing consumer loans. ","Overall, NPA trends were solidly improved during the quarter. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we currently expect NPAs to continue to decline, primarily in the commercial portfolio, with the reduction of perhaps $75 million to $100 million being the current expectation. ","The next slide, Slide 13, includes a roll forward of nonperforming loans. Commercial inflows at a $168 million were down $21 million in the first quarter. Consumer inflows for the quarter were $183 million, down $22 million. Total inflows of $352 million were down 11% sequentially, consistent with the trend we've experienced for the past 2 years. ","Moving to Slide 14, which outlines delinquency trends. Loans 30 to 89 days past due totaled $365 million, down $87 million from last quarter, with consumer down $61 million and commercial down $26 million from last quarter. Loans 90-plus days past due were $216 million, up $16 million from the fourth quarter with a single credit in the commercial book accounting for more than the increase. We have no loss exposure to this credit to speak of. Total delinquencies of $581 million were down $71 million from last quarter and remain at precrisis levels. I'd also mention that our commercial criticized asset levels continue to improve in the first quarter, down about $320 million or 4% sequentially. ","On to provision and the allowance, which is outlined on Slide 15. Provision expense for the quarter was $91 million and included a reduction in the loan loss allowance of $129 million. Our coverage of nonperforming assets remained strong at 127% and we'd expect to see continued declines in the reserve as we forward, although the pace is likely to continue to slow over time. ","Slide 16 outlines our recent mortgage repurchase experience. The vast majority of our activity has been with the GSEs and as Dan mentioned earlier, those claims in losses associated with them have remained fairly stable in the $20 million range per quarter. Our results clearly show continued improvement in our credit metrics and reflect the hard work of a large number of employees across the company. We still have some work to do, but clearly we're on the right track. ","That concludes my remarks. One housekeeping item before I turn it over to Kevin, there were some errors on Slides 12, 32 and 33 of the presentation we published early this morning in the geographic distribution of NPAs. We corrected those at about 8:30 this morning, and the corrected version will show Florida with 41% of residential NPAs, not 30% on Slide 12. So if you pulled a copy of the presentation before that, you might want to reprint those slides. Sorry about that. ","I'll turn it back over to Kevin now for any closing remarks.","Kevin T. Kabat","Thanks, Bruce. As Dan and Bruce outlined, it was a strong quarter for Fifth Third, both on a headline basis including the benefits from Vantiv and on a core basis excluding those gains. PPNR results were about $40 million better than we expected back in January, excluding Vantiv. That reflects significantly stronger fee results, lower expenses and consistent NII. Our outlook for the second quarter is also stronger than we conveyed at the beginning of the year. So we're feeling good and probably a little better now than earlier in the year, with generally stronger PPNR expectations for the second quarter and second half, as well as generally better expectations for credit. All told, we believe Fifth Third is set up pretty well for the remainder of 2012. We intend and expect to address the Fed's objections in our resubmission and expect to implement a capital plan in the third quarter that delivers more value to shareholders while maintaining a very strong capital position. ","That wraps up our remarks. So Kenya, can you open the line up for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] You have a question from the line of Ken Zerbe.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","It's Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley. First question I had, just on CCAR, I understand you can't say why, but can you just address that -- let's call it the delay, and when you plan to resubmit, I was under the impression it would be a 30-day resubmission process. Seems like it's taking a little bit longer now. And then just as a follow-up on that one, if you do get approved for what you're asking for in 2012, should we just expect almost an acceleration of buybacks in the second half?","Daniel T. Poston","Yes. Relative to timing, I think, while the rules provide for a 30 -- a minimum of a 30-day requirement, that's not necessarily required, and I think, as we look at our resubmission, there's a few things that are driving the timing. One is the fact that we're going to use 3, 31 data to update the capital plans. So obviously, we couldn't start on that until we have the 3, 31 data. We're also using economic scenarios that are reflective of the 3, 31 environment and throughout the expectations for the future as of 3, 31. And as we get that information, then we have to prepare or we have to execute our stress test and then use those stress testing results to kind of build our capital plan to demonstrate the impact of our proposed capital actions on our capital. So that process takes some time and as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, our current expectation is that we would submit that plan in late May or early June. From that point forward of course, the Fed has to get through its review process, which I think the rules allow for a maximum review period of 75 days. So our current expectation is that we will receive a response from them likely in the month of August. So relative to the capital actions, as we said, we expect to submit a plan that has very similar capital actions to those proposed earlier. We think there is a lot of support for us doing that from a quantitative basis. You've seen the results of the prior submission and we fared very well from a capital perspective, even with those proposed capital actions. And we've indicated that the Fed's objection was not related to quantitative matters so that the prior plan in those capital actions were acceptable on a quantitative basis. If anything, the economic environment's probably gotten a little better. So as we -- while we have prepared our stress test and prepared our capital forecasts, we would fully expect that the updated capital plan will easily support the capital actions that we proposed last time. And in that those are largely driven by capital levels and not necessarily related to time periods, I think that would result in capital actions that occur in a somewhat compressed time frame given that we would be starting a little later than we would have otherwise been starting.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","All right, that helps. Just one other question I had, in terms of the mortgage banking outlook, the lower expectations for revenues there, is that because you've already started to see lower gain on sale margins or is that just your expectation for the quarter? Just curious on trends so far this quarter.","Daniel T. Poston","I think it's a little bit of both. I think we have started to see the margins come down a little bit. I think that the guidance that we've given would reflect an expectation that they may come down a bit more from where they are now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could give us an update on consumer deposit product redesign and update us on your thoughts for mitigation and how that should show through the deposit fees?","Kevin T. Kabat","Yes, Ken. I, what I can tell you at this point is we are really comfortable in terms of the approach that we've taken. As we've talked about publicly, and as we've talked about in some of the conferences, our orientation has been to redesign toward a value-added -- and so our expectation is that, that will be well received in the marketplace and that we're really progressing well. So nothing new to report on that at this point, but certainly later in the year, we'll be able to talk more deeply about marketplace reaction and acceptance.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And I don't want to make this so much a follow-up on CCAR, but is there any updated thoughts as it relates to just capital usage and management around M&A and the potential for M&A, and does anything change with regards to that vis-\u00e0-vis this whole CCAR process resubmission?","Daniel T. Poston","If your question is does the qualitative objection we received to CCAR change anything with respect to our M&A expectations, I think the answer to that is no. I think if you look at the CCAR rules, any significant M&A activity would require a submitted capital plan anyway. So I don't see the CCAR process presenting anything different now than we might have expected 90 days ago.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And last, a real quick one, you mentioned the comments about stabilizing the margin in the back of the year after the expected step down in the second quarter. Can you just talk us through the ins and outs, what gets better, what gets worse in terms of keeping it stable in the back half?","Daniel T. Poston","Yes. I'll make a couple of comments and then Tayfun Tuzun can add any comments that he might have. I mean, in general I think we're in a rate environment now that is creating some asset yield compression. I think as those lower rates get reflected in our portfolio, to a larger degree, as those rates stabilize, which is what the expectation is from here forward, we're not expecting significant changes in rates from here out. The impact on the portfolio becomes less and less as more and more of that lower rate environment is already baked into the portfolio. So the asset yield compression will tend to decrease somewhat over time. The other thing I would point out is that relative to like this quarter's performance, we didn't see a significant change or any change really in our overall funding cost. And that's despite the fact that our average deposit costs considering kind of rate reductions as well as mix changes within our deposit portfolio actually produce a 4 or 5 basis point decline in deposit costs, but that was completely offset by increases in wholesale funding cost. And while wholesale funding is not a significant component of our -- or not as significant a component of our funding as it has been in the past, it still didn't have a pretty significant impact this quarter and that was driven largely by the hedging effectiveness that we talked about, which we wouldn't expect to continue and will ultimately reverse as well as the impact of the debt offering that we did during the quarter which, while it increases the average cost a bit, we were very, very pleased with the result of that offering and believe that represents very, very favorable long-term funding for us. So the impact of those things, we would expect to be muted as we move into the latter part of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Penala with BOA Merrill Lynch.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My first question is a follow-up to Ken Usdin's question on the margin. You mentioned that the asset yield compression will certainly start to taper off in the second half of the year. But could you specifically point to what the potential repricing opportunities could be on the right-hand side of your balance sheet in the second half?","Tayfun Tuzun","This is Tayfun. I mean we clearly, last year, you've watched us manage our deposit costs fairly aggressively and we continue to do that on an incremental basis. We -- our eyes are still on deposit growth and opportunities, both on the consumer side as well as commercial side to manage those rates down, but the opportunities obviously are not as large as they were last year. And it's going to be a function of inflows and outflows and how comfortable we feel at managing those rates down. So there are opportunities left on our balance sheet, and we will continue to utilize them as much as we can.","Daniel T. Poston","Another thing I would add to that is we've talked in the past about the potential for the calling of TRUPs securities and if that were to occur, that would also provide some benefit in terms of overall funding costs.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And could you size that opportunity in terms of what the effective rate is on your balance sheet that you're recognizing on the TRUPs?","Tayfun Tuzun","I don't think we've disclosed those numbers separately. I think our TRUPs -- the information is public, and we currently have about $2.2 billion, $2.3 billion in outstandings and some of those are priced attractively so that they wouldn't necessarily be subject to cause even if we could do them, but a large portion of them obviously have call dates this year, natural call dates and some of them are also subject to an NPI ruling that may come out this year, we've been waiting for it, but we're not quite certain as to the timing of it. So there are clearly opportunities. There are large numbers that would impact our liability costs and unfortunately at this point, timing is uncertain because we don't know when the regulators will be publishing those rulings.","Jeff Richardson","The coupon on the -- we've indicated that we would submit on our capital plan the redemption of $1.4 billion and the Fed has not objected to that.","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes.","Jeff Richardson","The coupons on those are north of 7%. We haven't disclosed the swap rates because we have traditionally never disclosed the swapped costs of our funding, but wholesale funding relative to the swap cost is lower so it would be a net benefit to our NII.","Leanne Erika Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just my last question is just taking a step back, it's clear that the loan growth momentum at this company is very much positive and you're approaching a loan-to-deposit ratio of about 100% as we go several quarters out. I'm just wondering is that going to be, since acquisitions has always been a core competency in the past, is that something that could behoove you to look at deals more aggressively in terms of looking forward deposit funding in that way? Or you'd rather wait for the right opportunities and fund incremental loan growth wholesale?","Daniel T. Poston","Well, I think there would be a number of ways to address those funding needs. And I'm not sure we would look to M&A transactions to meet those needs. I think both from -- some of that could come from incremental wholesale funding. I think we would also, when that time comes, adjust our posture with respect to deposits. As you know, there's not a lot of competition for deposits at this particular point in time. So I think the opportunity needs to grow the deposit book, to look at our CD pricing strategies and a variety of other things would probably come ahead of looking to M&A activity to provide that funding. Through M&A it provides some funding, I think that would be a byproduct of M&A rather than the objective of it.","Jeff Richardson","Yes, I mean we would always wait for the right opportunity and obviously deposit funding, the value of that funding is lower today than it probably it has been in our careers. So we would take that into account in any transaction that we looked at. Erika, I'm sorry, we, I guess we do actually disclose in our K the swapped cost of our TRUPs. It's on Page 116 of our annual report.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin St. Pierre with Sanford Bernstein.","Kevin J. St. Pierre - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I was just wondering if you could provide a little more color on the loss provision which was up sequentially in the quarter despite what would be seen as an improvement in underlying credit. How should we think about the pace at which you draw down the reserves going forward?","Daniel T. Poston","Kevin, as you point out the allowance, the decrease in the allowance was smaller than it had been in the prior quarter by $50-some million this quarter, and the allowance is a complicated area, obviously. It's largely model driven. And part of the difficulty in trying to relate the change in the allowance to earn credit trends is not just the current quarter's results, it's the change in expectations about the future and you don't necessarily know with a lot of clarity what our future expectations were last quarter versus this quarter. So as charge offs occur, I mean one of the reasons for higher levels of reserves are the expectation of future charge-offs. As those charge offs occur, it allows you to reduce the allowance. So while you might think of it as charge offs are coming down we need fewer reserves, another way to look at it may be that to the extent that your reserve was higher because of charge-off expectations, if those charge-offs have occurred and are declining, then the reserve release is associated with those charge-offs having already been provided for will decline as well. So it's a complicated analysis for the reserves. I think we have indicated previously that in general, we expect the trends to be for declining adjustments in reserve balances as we go forward. So I think that's all part of it. The other thing is that in addition to credit trends, loan growth has an impact. So the reserve may have downward leanings because of improving credit, but some of that can be offset by the growth in the portfolios and obviously, as we've been talking, our loan growth has been pretty strong over the last few quarters and that has an impact on the allowance as well. So from here, I think, while we expect that the reserve will continue to come down, we think kind of the longer-term trends will be that the amount of those adjustments will likely decline as we go forward.","Kevin J. St. Pierre - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","In the past you've, Kevin, you've talked about a potentials range where the reserve-to-loan ratio might settle in. Has there been any change to your thinking on that?","Kevin T. Kabat","No, Kevin. We still feel that the 1.50% to probably 2% range is going to be the settle out range. We haven't changed our view from that perspective, 1.50% probably is the most likely, but still within that range, it feels like it's the right thing, at least in the kind of our vision at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran from Nomura.","Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Just on maybe Vantiv, to start, I mean, I guess one option over time, given the ability to buy back stock as you realize gains would be to sell the stake, but that wouldn't accomplish a whole lot, it feels like because you'd lose the equity method earnings. But how does like -- to understand the accounting interplay with the Fed approval right to the extent Vantiv does M&A, M&A stock-based and it's accretive, is that really the kind of good scenario for you because then, the stock it's put in place so you revalue part of your stake on the equity method earnings and to the extent the M&A's accretive, you still get the same earnings contribution or a little higher so you can do both buybacks and keep your earnings if that plays out?","Daniel T. Poston","I'm not sure I understand all the mechanics of your question. I mean, clearly, if Vantiv does accretive M&A transactions, 40% of that accretion will accrue to us under the equity benefit accounting. To the extent that share buybacks or other kinds of returns of capital are tied to the level of earnings, then those distributions will be allowed to increase.","Jeff Richardson","It sounded like you were suggesting that if Vantiv issue shares in M&A that we mark our position to market, and I don't think that's the way it works. That...","Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","And then just on the mortgage business, I mean, I guess a little bit of a disconnect with some of your, for lack of a better word, kind of mid-major peers were PNC, USB Wells, BB&T, in general volume was flat to up this quarter, given some of the market share being put in play, and in general it sounded like guidance for most of them was for better still results in 2Q, so obviously the mortgage business is doing phenomenally so it's hard to complain, but is there something obvious in terms of geography or mix that would make you different than that peer group?","Daniel T. Poston","Brian, phenomenon is a tough pedestal. And so we feel very good about how well we're positioned in terms of our mortgage space, we good feel about the activity that we're seeing. Obviously in this environment, with the interest rate environment out there and the predominance of the activity being related to refi, any movement in that arena can really change the trajectory from that perspective. And I think that what we're trying to do is present a most likely scenario for you. Obviously if it stays good, we've demonstrated in the past 1.5 years that we're going to get our fair share and we can do very well in that space. So could be an opportunity for us, but that's our best vantage and our best look at where we are in terms of the environment today, so.","Brian Foran - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","If I could sneak one last one in, I mean, you're starting to get some questions about the loan and deposit ratio, my guess is incremental auto originations, while profitable, are actually hurting the NIM and it seems like the capital markets are pricing auto securitizations at like 1.5 to 2-point gains. Have you, is an auto securitization program something that would be attractive, or could be a possibility? I mean, it seems like it could be a nice compromise, in your term accretive and actually help the NIM and also provide a cheap source of funding, but I don't know if there other offsets I'm not considering?","Tayfun Tuzun","Well from a loan-to-deposit perspective, we feel very comfortable with liquidity on our balance sheet. So there's really no urgency to look for transactions to inject liquidity beyond what we have today. A number of our peers have done off-balance-sheet auto securitizations. It's a product that clearly lends itself to liquidity. We have $11 billion, $12 billion of that on our balance sheet. The credit quality is very high, which makes securitizations profitable. But at this point, we are looking at it from a marginal perspective. When it makes sense to do it, to bring in additional liquidity relative to our marginal cost going forward, we will do that. I don't think the driver of that transaction will be merely just making our NIM look better. And, but we obviously, continuously review the possibility and we'll pull that trigger when we're ready to do that.","Jeff Richardson","Hey Brian, this is Jeff. Somebody here in the room with a better accounting background than I have pointed out that dilution in our ownership with Vantiv would trigger gains and losses. I think probably when you work that through, it probably wouldn't amount to a whole lot unless the transaction Vantiv did was very large. But yes, that is -- that was kind of a third order version of the future and haven't thought that through, so there's your answer.","Operator","Your next questions come from the line of Todd Hagerman with Sterne Agee.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of questions related to loans. Kevin, I think you mentioned or Dan, about as respect to the loans, both the repricing effect as well as some of the yield pressure on some of the new fundings, but I'm wishing or hoping you could give a little bit more color on the repricing effect itself. You mentioned that a lot of work had been done, I think last quarter and this quarter. I'm just wondering how that might be affecting, again, kind of the second half outlook with respect to the margin and what specifically you're doing within the portfolio?","Tayfun Tuzun","This is Tayfun. Dan mentioned the fact that as we continue to reprice fixed-rate loan portfolios and our fixed rate securities portfolio, the difference between the average portfolio yield and the marginal yields that we are putting on our books continues to shrink. The more newer loans you have in the portfolio, the next dollar of loan has a lesser impact in terms of moving the spreads down. In addition to that we also obviously, both on the consumer and commercial side adding loans at very high credit quality, which is having an impact on average spreads. So as we look to the second half of the year, we see the impact that we have seen over the last 2, 3 quarters lessening as marginal pricing catches up with average pricing, we should see stability in our margin and that's what Dan talked about earlier.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, and again, with that fixed rate product, for example, is there anything structurally you're doing different than in the past, and I'm thinking in terms of just how you may hedge that portfolio or in terms of like 4's, if you will, is any of the structure itself or how you may hedge that product changed from the past?","Tayfun Tuzun","Structurally loans are no different, I mean there are no meaningful differences in the way we structure loans and the way we look at term funding, et cetera. We look at obviously, interest rate risk management opportunities, but the environment has not been very good to overlay derivative rate activity on our books so we have not done a lot of that, but obviously that's a topic of continuous discussion and if we see opportunities, we'll do that.","Jeff Richardson","This is Jeff. I would just add in terms of our expectations for the second half. It's really being, I think you're comparing and we're comparing to what we saw in the first and what we expect in the second quarter, which are things that affected the margin that are kind of not as sustained sequential changes. So things like the hedging effectiveness this quarter, which was a sequential change of $5 million, there's no balance associated with that. So it's straight to the margin. Second quarter versus the first, we have the Vantiv refinancing which, you know, is an event that will take effect and then it won't sequentially keep taking effect. And there's one other item.","Tayfun Tuzun","Debt issuance, fixed-rate debt issuance in March will clearly be fully baked into our quarterly run rate.","Jeff Richardson","So those 2 things by themselves were about half of our sequential margin decline in the first quarter. Sorry, each -- the margin decline in each of the first and second quarters is about half explained by things that won't be sustained in terms of their sequential change.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, and then just a related question, in terms of the loan yields themselves, we heard from a competitor that Ohio in particular, the pricing was particularly intense and they've kind of stepped back from that market. Again, as we've seen for the most part, the midwest banks showing pretty good growth overall, with Ohio itself kind of being singled out as being perhaps a little bit more competitive on the pricing side. Could you give just a little bit more color in terms of, again, just the market share that you're taking and kind of how that translates into some of that pressure on the asset yields?","Kevin T. Kabat","First of all, Todd, I want to thank you for the question, and we'd like you to repeat that consistently throughout the season from that standpoint. So welcome to the home turf. Well from our standpoint, and I think you can see it relative to our yields, and our ability to continue to grow, take share from the businesses is, while it's competitive and yes, while we've seen some compression as we've talked about, a lot of that is our continuing to go to even stronger credits who deserve better pricing from that standpoint. So from a competitive standpoint while it is that way, it always has been that way and hasn't really significantly changed for us, at least from our vantage point from that perspective. It's kind of game on and steady as she goes from that standpoint. So I really don't have a lot of other insight relative to those comments, or what others are feeling on that basis, but we feel pretty good about how well we're positioned, what we're doing and the disciplines we're applying to the business that we're putting on. So keep asking those questions, okay?","Jeff Richardson","He's come back from Ohio. It should help pricing in Ohio.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Now I don't know if you answered this question already, but I believe you made a comment that you expect your mortgage banking production to be relatively flat for the first quarter to the second quarter, but you expect the earnings to go down. Does that mean you expect or you've already seeing your gain on sale margins decline? Or is there something else in there?","Daniel T. Poston","Yes, I think there was a question earlier. We do expect the gain on sale margins to be lower the second quarter than the first. The first, the margins in the first quarter were very, very strong. So we are expecting that to decline somewhat in the first quarter, excuse me, in the second quarter and in response to an earlier question, I think we already indicated that we've begun to see some of that already in terms of activity early in the quarter.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay, you got the guys, right [ph]?","Kevin T. Kabat","The only other thing I would mention is that our expectations with respect to the overall results of mortgage servicing right valuations and hedging activity is also a component of the decline that we expect in mortgage banking revenue from first quarter to second. In the first quarter, that was a net positive of about $14 million or $15 million and we wouldn't expect that to continue.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay, and then also going to the resident, the resi portfolio that you retain, I think it was it was even, it's gone from 12% to 13% of your balance sheet, I think it's up in double-digits year-over-year. Can you talk a little bit about what type of loans that you're retaining on the balance sheet, are they jumbo loans, any 5\/1s and what type of yield are you getting on them?","Tayfun Tuzun","So it's a combination, Paul. We clearly continue to originate jumbo loans. But we're talking about this small amount of activity, it may be around $50 million a month type of activity. Those are sort of a combination of 5\/1 ARMs; some fixed-rates, but predominantly probably on the ARMs side. The other product that probably, which is a larger origination volume, is our branch originated mortgage product and that product we originate anywhere between $120 million and $140 million a month of depending on the rate environment. It's basically a product to very high credit borrowers, very similar to an agency mortgage but from a process perfected in order to speed up the process. It doesn't necessarily mirror all features of an agency product. And they tend to be shorter in duration, predominantly sort of 10, 15-year maturity mortgages. And some of our competitors have talked about the same product, it's a product that is a very good balance sheet mortgage product, and it's priced anywhere between sort of 50 to 75 basis points above an agency mortgage product. So it is an attractive risk return trade-off that we choose to keep on balance sheet today.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And going back to the mortgage-bank part of it, the stuff that you're selling, are you seeing a lot of HARP volume?","Daniel T. Poston","We have seen an increase in HARP-related volumes I think probably a couple of quarters ago, that was probably 20% of our originations that has come up a bit to perhaps 30% or so of origination volume now. And the expectation is, is that might even increase a bit further as we see another surge in refi volumes here if rates stay where they are now, we expect that to maybe inch up a little higher than that. So we have seen some impact of that, although it hasn't been dramatic.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And just a quick follow-up on the last question about how competitive the Ohio market at Midwest has been. Can you compare that to what's going on in the South, because we're hearing in the South it's a really nice time to be out there hiring in teams and whatnot because it's not competitive? Can you just compare to Midwest with the South, Georgia and Florida?","Kevin T. Kabat","Sure, Paul. I would not categorize anything in our business these days as not competitive. Just that clarification. But clearly, there is a differentiation from the geographies in the Southeast. We are seeing, again, very attractive business opportunities, we are seeing the opportunities and have been lifting up teams and bankers and folks that really like our operating model. There's a lot of, there's a lot more disruption earlier and longer in the Southeast still, so there's a lot of reshuffling, rethinking about what's happening from that standpoint. So we're seeing a lot of good opportunities, pipelines are strong. We're seeing attractive business on a relative basis, and we're seeing a great way to grow the business through acquiring talent as we move forward. So all that is true for us and our vantage point as well, Paul.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just looking at the liability side of the balance sheet, looking at the decline in the band deposits at 1Q, and then the guidance were kind of flattish transaction deposits in 2Q. What is your outlook for both, I guess longer-term deposit growth? Do you expect it to match loan growth here? Do you expect loan growth to exceed it? And then also for deposit costs, because your average interest-bearing liability yield also was kind of flattish in the fourth quarter. So I wonder if we're really near the end of this.","Tayfun Tuzun","I think the interest-bearing liability, Dan discussed it related to one of the other questions, is more related to the wholesale funding and the hedging effectiveness and the impacts of long-term debt expense. On the deposit side, quarter-over-quarter we have seen reduction in our sort of core deposit rates, and again, as I mentioned before, we continue to evaluate our pricing very frequently. In terms of growth expectations, obviously, over the past couple of years, we've seen significant growth inflows, both into our non-interest-bearing as well as interest-bearing commercial and consumer accounts. And we still continue to maintain those deposits and grow those deposits. The outlook depends on really how companies and consumers do in a sort of a slightly growing economy. We just expect stability. We don't expect to see similar growth rates that we've seen over the past year or 2, but we expect those deposits to remain stable. And we predominantly use deposit growth to fund loan growth. I mean, that's sort of from a liquidity perspective the prudent thing to do, and we will continue to do that.","Jeff Richardson","This is Jeff. I would just only add that in terms of the change in our deposit rates, I mean, as I think we've talked about the last 2 years, a significant amount of our CD funding or the cost of our CD funding was originated in the second half of '08. And so, we saw step downs in our CD rates in, at the end of '09, '10, '11. So 1, 2 and 3-year CDs. I don't think we originated many 4-year CDs in the end of '08. We did originate some 5-year CDs, and so there's a modest amount of some of the benefit coming at the end of next year, but that was a significant driver in our reduced deposit costs last year, and that's largely behind us other than a bit that we'd see next year.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Then if we think about your NIM guidance of down 5 to 6 and then kind of stable in the second half, I heard the earlier kind of question, but I wasn't sure exactly if that second half kind of a flattish trend is really driven by anything on the TRUP side in terms of refinancing? Or does that exclude what you may do in terms of repaying the TRUPs?","Jeff Richardson","It's generally -- includes everything.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then just one additional, I'm sorry if you filmed this earlier [ph], but if we look at both salaries and employee benefits, and kind of the increase there, I'm just wondering if we back out severance and we also back out the seasonality, what is a good run rate in terms of those 2 items to look about as we walk forward?","Jeff Richardson","I think we've given guidance on expenses overall. I don't want to give guidance on line items within expenses.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","But can you just identify what the unusual impact was from those 2, those 2 items?","Jeff Richardson","The severance was $6 million, and the FICA and unemployment seasonal increase was $25 million?","Daniel T. Poston","$25 million. Yes, and that's in the employee benefits line.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, so $31 million between the 2 is kind of a good number to back out?","Daniel T. Poston","Yes. Those 2 items were $31 million this quarter. Now I will point out that not all of that $25 million and FICA and unemployment increase comes out in the second quarter. I think that our prepared comments I think estimated that, that was about a $15 million decline in that item in the second quarter, and more of that will come out as we go through the year and more and more people are over the maximum thresholds there.","Kevin T. Kabat","Craig, can I just circle back to one thing? You alluded to declining demand deposits and I guess if you look at it on a period end to period end basis, it's down about $1 billion, but those balances fluctuate pretty significantly on a day-to-day basis, and I think a more useful measure of what's happening with deposits is, demand deposits especially, is average balances and on an average balance basis, our demand deposits are dead-on in the first quarter where they were in the fourth.","Operator","At this time, there are no questions.","Jeff Richardson","Well, I think we're done. We appreciate your time this morning and feel free to give us a call and IR if you have any other questions. Thanks.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

My name is Alicia, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Banc Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn today's call over to Mr. Richardson, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Jeff Richardson","Thanks, Alicia. Good morning. Today we'll be talking with you about our second quarter 2013 results.","This call may contain certain forward-looking statements about Fifth Third pertaining to our financial condition, results of operations, plans and objectives. These statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. There are a number of factors that could cause results to differ materially from historical performance in these statements. We've identified some of these factors in our forward-looking cautionary statement at the end of our earnings release and in other materials, and we encourage you to review them. Fifth Third undertakes no obligation and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call.","I'm joined on the call by several people: our CEO, Kevin Kabat; CFO, Dan Poston; as well as Greg Schroeck from Credit; Tayfun Tuzun from Treasury; and Jim Eglseder of Investor Relations.","During the question-and-answer period, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin Kabat. Kevin?","Kevin T. Kabat","Thanks, Jeff. Fifth Third reported second quarter net income to common shareholders of $594 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.66. Earnings this quarter included a benefit from gains on the sale of a portion of our Vantiv stake and a higher valuation on the Vantiv warrant, which, together, contributed about $0.22 of benefit. There were a few smaller items during the quarter that were modestly detrimental on a net basis, which Dan will discuss in more detail.","Year-over-year, earnings per share increased 22% excluding the impact of Vantiv in both quarters. Return on assets and equity were strong with and without the Vantiv benefit, and tangible book value per share increased 1% sequentially and 7% from a year ago despite the fairly significant impact of share repurchases.","Now turning to the business activity. Average sequential portfolio loan growth was 1%, with C&I loans up $1.2 billion. Average portfolio loan growth from a year ago was 5% with average C&I and Residential Mortgage portfolio loans up 15% and 9%, respectively.","Period-end loans increased 2% sequentially and 6% from last year. These comparisons include the impact of a $500 million auto loan securitization during the first quarter. Average core deposits continued to grow and were up 4% from a year ago. Transaction deposits increased $4 billion or 5% including a very strong 13% growth in demand deposits, primarily in consumer, but with good growth in commercial as well.","Fee income results reflected solid loan growth -- or solid growth from seasonal softness in the first quarter and we produced strong performance in nearly every line item. Corporate banking revenue, mortgage banking net revenue, deposit service charges and card and processing revenue were up mid single-digits. Certainly, things have changed in the mortgage business, but the second quarter for mortgage was still quite strong. And our other fee businesses continued to perform strongly. Dan will cover our expectations in the second half of the year in his remarks.","Although there was noise during the quarter, expenses remain well controlled. We expect second half expenses to decline including the impact of lower mortgage origination costs.","Credit trends continue to show steady improvement, with net charge-offs down another 16% sequentially and nonperforming assets down 5% to 132 basis points of loans. The charge-off ratio was 51 basis points for the quarter. It's the lowest since mid-2007.","Total delinquencies continue to be at historically low levels, particularly on the commercial side, with 80 -- 30- to 89-day delinquencies of only $7 million and 90 days past due less than $1 million. Hard to improve on those numbers.","Capital levels remained very strong with Tier 1 common of 9.4% and a leverage ratio of 10.4%. The updated pro forma estimate for Basel III Tier 1 common equity is 9.1%. Our ability to generate capital and our strong capital levels under Basel I and Basel III perspectives gives us the ability to retain the capital we need to support business -- our balance sheet growth while continuing to return capital to shareholders in a prudent manner.","During the quarter, we announced the increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.12 and the repurchase of $539 million of common stock. We have approximately $600 million in remaining capacity left under our 2013 CCAR plan.","Our continued ability to generate a relatively high level of profitability from loan growth and solid revenue results, ongoing expense discipline and credit improvement give us confidence that our strategies are working. We feel very good about how we are positioned going forward.","Before turning it over to Dan, I'd like to thank our employees for their continued focus and drive and our customers for their continued business and partnership with Fifth Third.","With that, I'll ask Dan to discuss operating results and give some comments about our outlook. Dan?","Daniel T. Poston","Thanks, Kevin. I'll start with Slide 4 of the presentation, and I'll discuss results for the second quarter before turning to the outlook toward the end of my remarks.","Overall, we posted strong results this quarter. Earnings per share were $0.66, up $0.20 from last quarter. There were a number of items affecting second quarter results, including a $242 million gain on the sale of Vantiv shares and the $76 million positive valuation adjustment on the Vantiv warrant, which, in aggregate, benefited earnings per share by $0.22 for the second quarter. Vantiv warrant gains were $0.02 benefit in the first quarter. There were several other smaller items that affected earnings in the quarter, which are all outlined in our release, and I'll note those throughout my comments.","Turning to Slide 5. Tax equivalent net interest income decreased $8 million sequentially to $885 million, in line with our expectations, and the net interest margin was 333 basis points versus 342 basis points last quarter. The decline in net interest income included a $12 million negative impact from maturities of interest rate floors and a $6 million benefit from higher quarterly day count. Otherwise, the remaining $2 million decline was driven by loan repricing, partially offset by the benefit of net loan growth, higher yields on investment securities and lower long-term debt expense. The 9 basis point decline in the net interest margin included a 5 basis point reduction due to the maturity of interest rate floors and a 1 basis point reduction from the day count effect.","On the loan side, yields declined primarily in the C&I and auto portfolios. Reported C&I portfolio yields were sequentially lower, although 13 basis points of the decline was the result of the maturity in the interest rate floors previously discussed. The remaining decline was driven by repricing within the portfolio, combined with a continued mix shift toward higher quality loans.","In the indirect auto portfolio, the average yield declined 13 basis points in the quarter, largely reflecting the portfolio effect of replacing older higher-yielding loans with new lower-yielding loans.","In the taxable securities portfolio, yields increased 11 basis points, reflecting lower premium amortization, given the rise in rates, as well as the benefit from reinvestment in higher-yielding securities.","Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 6. Average earning assets increased $709 million sequentially driven by an $804 million increase in average portfolio loans and leases and $116 million increase in securities and short-term investment balances. These increases were partially offset by a $211 million decline in average loans held-for-sale, largely reflecting the impact on sequential averages in the auto loans that were in held-for-sale before their securitization in sale at the end of March.","Looking at each loan portfolio. Average commercial loans held for investment increased $902 million or 2% from the first quarter and increased $3.6 billion or 8% from last year. C&I loans of $37.6 billion increased $1.2 billion or 3% from last quarter and increased $4.9 billion or 15% from a year ago. C&I production remains broad-based across industries with strong production in the large and mid-corporate space. We continue to see contributions from our investments in the health care and energy verticals as well as in the manufacturing industry.","Commercial mortgage balances declined $347 million sequentially or 4%. Commercial construction balances increased modestly, the first increase in 5 years. As a result, these portfolios are beginning to stabilize, and we may begin to see net commercial real estate loan growth by the end of this year.","Average consumer portfolio loans of $36.2 billion were relatively flat sequentially, but increased $494 million or 1% from a year ago. The average comparisons include the impact of the $500 million securitization of auto loans that took place in the first quarter. The full quarter impact of this securitization reduced this quarter's average portfolio loans by $338 million compared with the first quarter.","Residential Mortgage loans held for investment were up 1% from the first quarter, reflecting continued retention of shorter-term, high-quality residential mortgages originated through our retail branch system.","Average auto loans were down 1% sequentially, reflecting the impact of the auto securitization in March, but were up 1% from the prior year. Average home equity loan balances were down 3% sequentially, and average credit card balances were flat sequentially.","Moving on to deposits. We continue to see solid deposit trends with the average core deposits up $617 million or 1% from the first quarter. Transaction deposits, which exclude consumer CDs, increased $740 million or 1% sequentially and $4.1 billion or 5% from a year ago. As Kevin mentioned, we've seen strength, particularly in demand deposits, up 4% sequentially and 13% from a year ago. Both commercial and consumer deposits have grown nicely with particular strength on the consumer side. Consumer CDs declined 3% in the quarter.","Turning to fees, which are outlined on Slide 7. Second quarter noninterest income was $1.1 billion compared with $743 million last quarter. As I mentioned earlier, current quarter fee income results included a $242 million gain on the sale of Vantiv shares and a $76 million positive valuation adjustment on the Vantiv warrant. In addition, second quarter results included a $10 million benefit from the settlement of one of our BOLI policies that we've previously surrendered, a $5 million -- and a $5 million charge related to the valuation of the Visa total return swap.","You'll recall that first quarter fee income included about $50 million of noteworthy items, with the Vantiv warrant and investment securities gains being the largest, all of which are detailed in the release.","Excluding all of these items, fee income of $737 million increased $45 million or 7% sequentially, reflecting higher mortgage banking revenue, corporate banking revenue and deposit service charges.","Looking at each line item in detail. Deposit service charges increased 4% sequentially and 4% from the prior year. The sequential increase was primarily driven by increased retail service charges, which were up 10% sequentially and 4% from the prior year as a result of the completion of our conversion to the new deposit product offerings. This transition has gone well and we believe that it provides a solid foundation for our retail business going forward.","Corporate banking revenue of $106 million increased 7% from the first quarter and 4% from a year ago. The sequential increase was driven by higher syndication, derivatives and foreign exchange fees, partially offset by lower institutional sales revenue.","Mortgage banking net revenue of $233 million increased 6% from the first quarter and 28% from a year ago. Originations were a record $7.5 billion this quarter compared with $7.4 billion last quarter. Purchase volume was $1.8 billion, up significantly from the $1.0 billion in the first quarter.","Gain on sale revenue was $150 million, down $19 million from the prior quarter, reflecting lower gain on sale margins during the quarter, partially offset by stronger HARP volumes with higher margins. MSR valuation adjustments, including hedges, were a positive $72 million in the second quarter compared with a positive $43 million last quarter.","Investment advisory revenue of $98 million was down 2% from record first quarter levels and increased 6% from the prior year. The sequential decline was primarily due to seasonal tax-related fees that were recognized in the first quarter. The year-over-year increase reflects strong wealth management and record brokerage revenue as well as the benefit of higher market values.","Card and processing revenue was $67 million, a 4% increase from the first quarter and a 6% increase from a year ago, reflecting higher sale in transaction volumes. This business continues to produce strong, steady growth.","The net investment portfolio securities gains were 0 this quarter compared with $17 million in the first quarter and $3 million a year ago. We also realized $6 million in net securities gains that were related to nonqualified MSR hedges. Those were $2 million last quarter and 0 in the second quarter of 2012.","Turning next to other income within fees. Other income was $414 million this quarter versus $109 million last quarter and included the Vantiv-related gains that I've discussed earlier. Excluding Vantiv gains in both quarters, other noninterest income of $96 million in the second quarter increased $21 million sequentially.","Credit costs recorded in other noninterest income were $6 million in the second quarter compared with $10 million last quarter and $17 million a year ago.","Turning to expenses which are on Slide 8. Noninterest expense was $1.0 billion compared with $978 million last quarter. Expense results this quarter included $33 million in charges to increase litigation reserves and a $2 million benefit from the sale of affordable housing investments.","You'll recall that prior quarter results included a $9 million benefit from the sale of affordable housing investments and $9 million in charges to increase litigation reserves. Excluding these items from both quarters, noninterest expense of $986 million increased $8 million or 1% from the first quarter.","Current quarter results reflected a seasonal decline in FICA and unemployment benefits expense, partially offset by increased compensation-related expenses.","Credit costs -- credit-related costs were $35 million this quarter versus $24 million last quarter. Included within credit-related costs were a net $6 million increase to the mortgage representation of warranty reserve. That was driven by a $9 million increase to the reserve, resulting from additional information obtained from Freddie Mac regarding changes to its selection criteria for future mortgage repurchases and file requests.","Realized mortgage repurchase losses were $14 million versus $20 million in the prior quarter. Additionally, second quarter credit-related costs included a $2 million release from reserves for unfunded commitments versus an $11 million release last quarter.","Moving on to Slide 9 and PPNR. Pre-provision net revenue was $923 million in the second quarter compared with $653 million in the first quarter. Excluding the items noted on this slide, adjusted PPNR in the second quarter was $631 million, up 5% from the prior quarter and up 6% from a year ago.","Now turning to credit results. As Kevin mentioned, our credit trends continue to perform very well, as we saw solid credit improvement across every category in the second quarter.","Starting with charge-offs, which are on Slide 10, total net charge-offs of $112 million declined $21 million or 16% from the first quarter and $69 million or 38% from a year ago. The net charge-off ratio was 51 basis points this quarter and is the lowest we reported in more than 5 years.","Commercial net charge-offs of $45 million declined 17% sequentially and 42% from a year ago. At 36 basis points, this was the lowest level reported since the third quarter of 2007. The decrease was driven by commercial mortgage net charge-offs, which were down $16 million from last quarter, partially offset by an $8 million increase in C&I net charge-offs.","Total consumer net charge-offs were $67 million or 73 basis points, down 15% sequentially and 35% from a year ago. This was the lowest net charge-off ratio for consumers since the second quarter of 2007. Improvement continues to be driven by lower home equity and residential mortgage losses, with improvements across most geographies. Auto loan net charge-offs were $5 million or just 16 basis points of loans.","Moving to nonperforming assets on Slide 11. NPAs of $1.2 billion at quarter-end were down $60 million or 5% from the first quarter, with commercial NPAs down 4% and consumer NPAs down 7%.","Commercial portfolio NPAs were $794 million and declined $34 million sequentially. The decrease was driven by a $63 million decline in commercial real estate NPAs, partially offset by a $29 million increase in C&I NPAs.","Commercial TDRs on nonaccrual status included in NPAs were $140 million, down $19 million on a sequential basis. Commercial-accruing TDRs were up $34 million but remained fairly low at $475 million. In the consumer portfolio, NPAs of $356 million declined $26 million, driven by improvement in the residential mortgage portfolio.","Non-accruing consumer TDRs included in these results were $162 million, down $12 million from last quarter. Accruing consumer TDRs were $1.7 billion, relatively consistent with last quarter. To date, Fifth Third has worked with over 10,000 borrowers to modify their loans to help them stay in their homes.","Aggregate 12-month re-default rates are just over 25% and improves considerably as the modification program evolved following its inception in 2008.","As you know, performing TDRs that included an interest rate modification cannot be reclassified out of TDR status unless they are refinanced on market terms.","$1.4 billion of these loans are current, and $1 billion of them are current and have season for more than a year. We would expect that this portfolio will slowly decline over time as the opportunity and need to introduce new restructurings has declined, with improving residential real estate credit conditions.","Before moving on, I did want to touch on our delinquency levels. Total delinquencies of $410 million were down $60 million or 13% from the first quarter.","Loans 30 to 89 days past due were down $48 million, driven by a $30 million decline in commercial delinquencies and an $18 million decline in consumer delinquencies. Loans over 90 days past due were down $12 million from the first quarter, driven by improvement in consumer. And as Kevin noted, commercial 90-day-plus balances were less than $1 million.","Commercial criticized asset levels also continue to improve, down about $200 million or 4% sequentially, and represented the ninth consecutive quarter of decline.","The next slide, Slide 12, concludes a roll-forward of nonperforming loans. Commercial inflows in the second quarter were $151 million, a bit higher than the first quarter, but down $52 million or 26% from a year ago.","Consumer inflows for the quarter were $116 million, down 36% from last year. Total inflows of $267 million remained at relatively low levels. We generally expect continued improvement in both the commercial and consumer portfolios.","The provision and the allowance are outlined on Slide 13. Provision expense of $64 million in the quarter was up $2 million from the first quarter and included a reduction in the loan loss allowance of $48 million. Allowance coverage remains strong at 191% of nonperforming loans and 3.9x annualized net charge-offs.","Slide 14 outlines our recent mortgage repurchase experience. As expected, we saw a slight uptick in claims associated with GSEs as Freddie Mac is now reviewing all nonperforming loans for potential putback. However, claims are still 45% below levels we were experiencing a year ago. As I mentioned earlier, we increased the reserve for these loans during the quarter based on additional Freddie Mac guidance received.","We've provided a detailed breakout of loans sold by vintage and remaining balance. Repurchase request and losses have been concentrated in the 2004-2008 vintages, about 84% of the total. Those vintages represent just 9% of the total remaining balances on sold loans.","Turning to capital on Slide 15. Capital levels continue to be very strong and included the impact of the $600 million preferred stock issuance and approximately $539 million in common share repurchases that were announced during the quarter.","The Tier 1 common equity ratio was 9.4%, down 26 basis points from last quarter. The Tier 1 capital ratio increased 24 basis points and total risk-based capital was consistent with last quarter.","Tangible equity ratios also continue to be strong, with a 9.0% TCE ratio, including unrealized after-tax gains of $149 million and an 8.8% TCE ratio, if you exclude those gains.","As you are aware, the U.S. banking regulators have approved final Basel III capital rules. Our current pro forma estimate for the Tier 1 common equity ratio is 9.1%. That calculation assumes an exclusion of AOCI components from capital, which is subject to an election on our part, in early 2015. That pro forma estimate would be about 9.2% if we included AOCI. As a result, our capital position is well in excess of the minimum required ratios, including capital conservation buffers, and the additional clarity on the rules will hopefully make the CCAR process a bit more transparent going forward.","A couple of reminders. We have about $600 million of repurchase capacity remaining under our 2013 CCAR plan that runs through March 31 of 2014. Also, you'll need to take note of the timing of preferred dividends going forward. First, the Series G convertible preferred stock has been redeemed, so that dividend has been eliminated, and we will have no scheduled preferred dividend in the third quarter of 2013.","Our May preferred stock issuance carries a semiannual dividend, which will not be payable until the fourth quarter. That dividend would normally be about $15 million every other quarter. The fourth quarter dividend will actually be a bit larger, about $19 million, because it will include the stub period from May and June.","Turning to updated full year 2013 outlook, which is summarized on Slide 16. We've made a number of modest adjustments to our full year outlook, with the primary changes in the mortgage banking revenue as you might expect.","I'll start with net interest income and net interest margin. We continue to expect full year 2013 NII to be relatively consistent with 2012 NII of $3.6 billion, and we expect full year NIM to be in the 335 basis point range. We expect third quarter NII to increase by about $5 million to $10 million. That reflects the benefit to the higher rate environment on the securities portfolio and securities yields, as well as loan growth and higher day count, offset by loan repricing and the full quarter effect of the interest rate floors that matured during the second quarter. Day count adds about $6 million, and the floor maturities will cost us about $5 million.","As we've previously discussed, we expect NIM compression to subside in the second half of the year and to begin stabilizing. We currently expect third quarter net interest margin to decline a few basis points, with 1 basis point of detriment from day count and 2 basis points from the full effect of the matured floors. And we'd expect fourth quarter NII and margin to improve, and that will include the benefit of $800 million in maturing CDs from 2008 that mature over the second half of the year.","We expect full year loan growth versus 2012 full year averages in the mid single-digits or a little better, which reflects the $500 million in loans we securitized last quarter and the ongoing sale of 30-year jumbo mortgages. We expect transaction deposits and core deposits to grow in the mid single-digits range compared with 2012 averages.","Now moving onto overall fee income and expense expectations for 2013. Just as a reminder, we've adjusted 2012 comparative results on this slide to exclude all Vantiv-related impacts as well as debt termination charges, which were the largest unusual items last year.","In the first half of 2013, Vantiv transactions contributed $352 million to fee income, which are also excluded. Those adjustments are listed in the footnote on this slide.","Overall, we currently expect fee income to be relatively consistent with 2012 adjusted fee income. That would reflect mid or high single-digit growth across all major fee categories other than mortgage which, of course, is being compared to record 2012 levels.","So looking at the details of our overall fee expectations, we expect to see mid single-digit growth in deposit fees. That's a bit lower than we previously expected as many consumers continue to maintain higher deposit balances that defray fees. We're obviously seeing that benefit in our deposit trends. For the third quarter, we're looking for mid single-digit sequential deposit fee growth.","We expect mid to high single-digit annual growth in the investment advisory revenue, corporate banking revenue and card and processing revenue. Corporate banking results in the third quarter should be quite strong.","Turning to mortgage banking revenue. Obviously, the change in the rate environment this quarter has resulted in changes to our expectations for mortgage revenue and its makeup. As I discussed earlier, second quarter mortgage banking revenue was $233 million or $161 million, excluding the MSR gains of $72 million.","Relative to that $161 million base level, for the third quarter, we currently expect mortgage banking revenue to decline about 20% to 25% sequentially, reflecting lower volumes and some margin compression, which will be partially offset by lower servicing asset amortization. That outlook does not include any MSR valuation adjustments, which will depend on the rate environment at the end of the quarter.","For the full year, our current forecasts for total mortgage banking revenue is in the $700 million range, which would be down about 18% from record levels in 2012.","Our quarterly base expectation for other income caption would continue to be in the $75 million range, plus or minus, absent significant unusual items, which will occur from time to time.","If we turn to our overall expectations for third quarter fee income, we currently expect fee income in the $630 million to $640 million range, with the sequential reduction reflecting second quarter Vantiv gains of $72 million in MSR gains this quarter and lower mortgage production revenues, with increases across most other fee lines otherwise.","Turning to expenses. We currently expect third quarter noninterest expense of $940 million, plus or minus, reflecting lower mortgage-related expenses and the impact of elevated litigation-related costs in the second quarter.","We expect an efficiency ratio in the 61% to 62% range, a bit higher than we were previously forecasting due to the change in the expected mortgage environment. We continue to expect full year noninterest expense to be relatively consistent with adjusted 2012 expenses. We will continue to manage our expenses carefully and aggressively, in line with the revenue results and the economic environment.","In terms of PPNR, as reflected in my remarks to this point, our overall expectation for the year is consistent with 2012 levels. And that's despite a rate environment that remains challenging and comparisons for the record year for mortgage revenue.","Turning to the credit outlook, we expect overall credit trends to remain favorable in the second half, with full year net charge-offs currently expected to be down about $200 million to $225 million. We currently expect the net charge-off ratio for 2013 to be in the 55 basis point range compared with the 85 basis points that we reported in 2012.","We continue to anticipate lower NPAs, down about 20% during 2013, with continued resolution of commercial NPAs being the largest driver of the reduction.","On the loan loss allowance, we expect continued reductions in 2013 with the ongoing benefit of improvement in credit results, partially offset by new reserves related to loan growth.","In summary, we have good momentum in many of our core businesses that we expect to help us generate continued solid results.","That wraps up our remarks. Operator, could you open up the line for questions, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I guess, I'm just curious, first of all, in terms of what you're seeing in terms of demand for commercial loans. Obviously, C&I loans were growing a little bit faster than the rest of the portfolio. I guess, as you look across your geographic footprint, are there any particular markets that are seeing a stronger growth or have you seen any effect from some of the currency fluctuations that might have dampened demand across your footprint over the quarter?","Kevin T. Kabat","Thanks, Matt, this is Kevin. Let me kind of address that and Dan, if you got any additional comments, you can make them. But what I would tell you is that we've seen demand pretty broad-based. I wouldn't tell you that it was specific in terms of any geography. We're also seeing it broad across industry types. And so we're relatively pleased given the environment. We did see a little bit of increase in pay downs in the first -- or in the second quarter. I think -- and in reaction to kind of the Fed's announcements, I think CFOs were really kind of looking at their debt and trying to lock in or pay down some of the low cost that they had. But for the most part, pipelines continue to be robust and, again, broad-based across both geography and industry type from our standpoint. So I don't know if there's anything else Dan, that you'd add to that commentary.","Daniel T. Poston","No. I guess, the only comment, I agree the growth has been pretty broad-based. But I think we have seen particular success in the southern regions where we continue to capture market share, so I think we've probably got a little bit of bias to growth to some of the markets in the South but, in general, making good progress and seeing growth across our geographies.","Kevin T. Kabat","And the only other thing I'd add, too, Matt, is we -- the investments that we made and have continued to make in our verticals continues to pay dividend for us. Whether it's the energy vertical, the health care vertical, those continue to be good opportunities for us. And we still are winning fairly well in that space. So we feel good about those investments and our outlook there.","Daniel T. Poston","Yes. I think to follow up on that, in the areas where we've made investments specifically in mid-corporate capabilities, the health care vertical, the energy vertical, we're seeing growth rates in those areas significantly in excess of the overall growth rates in C&I. So those investments continue to pay pretty good dividends for us.","Kevin T. Kabat","And then the last comment I would make is, as we mentioned in our scripting upfront, we saw -- although it's a much smaller portfolio than it has been historically for us, we saw a growth in our construction space that, obviously, will mature. And to our commercial mortgage, we've been quite deliberate in our focus around that space. And our expectation is that, that will no longer -- by the end of the year or first part of next year, that it will no longer kind of drain assets from the balance sheet, but we think that we can -- are finding attractive enough projects and beginning to invest in that, that we can be either be the end of its decline and hopefully, again, be an opportunity for us to increase a little bit of our exposure as we look out.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","That's very helpful. And if I can just shift the gears a little bit to the mortgage side of things. I appreciate the detail you provided in your outlook relative to mortgage banking revenues. But I guess I'm just curious if you could provide a little more color in terms of how you're thinking about taking the cost out of that business, as the refi boom comes -- slows back down. Is it -- are you thinking more in terms of sort of a 1- to 2-quarter lag or is it potentially a little bit longer than that?","Daniel T. Poston","Well, we've talked a bit about this in the past, and there's a fair amount of expense within the mortgage business that is variable with respect to, in particular, the compensation-related pieces that vary with originations and with revenue. Beyond that, there are some fulfillment expenses that are variable that -- but that do require actions on the part of management to actively manage those expenses, and do involve or require some time in order to make those adjustments. So as mortgage revenues and expectations for mortgage revenues have declined, we have begun actively managing those expenses. We have plans to take out temporary labor, contract labor, reduce our FTE through reductions of those kind of third-party headcount as well as reductions in overtime. And we will be working over the quarter to bring down overall expense levels in the mortgage environment to be consistent with the revenue expectations. As we sit here right now, if you look at our revenue guidance, we've talked about a 20 to 25 basis -- or excuse me, 20% to 25% decline from the $162 million in non-MSR related mortgage revenue in the second quarter. That's about $40 million in round numbers. Our expense revenue or our expense expectations for the third quarter would be that we can take expenses down equal to about 2\/3 of that revenue, which is pretty much in line with the overall kind of efficiency levels in that business. So that's about $25 million in the third quarter. And we will continue to evaluate other opportunities to make further changes in the mortgage business that are consistent with our kind of the intermediate and longer-term expectations for what that business contributes.","Kevin T. Kabat","Yes, Matt, I'd kind of put a finer point in terms of your question. I think Dan has given you kind of a good overview. I'd just make a couple of comments there. One, this isn't a surprise to us. It shouldn't be to you either in terms of the mortgage refi business changing. So obviously, we've been anticipating the turn and when that was going to happen. We'll be aggressive in managing our business and we expect to get, as Dan kind of highlighted to you, most of that expense out quickly and no more than 2 quarters in terms of addressing that business, dependent upon the sustained level of demand. That's what we'll size the business to from that perspective. So you'll see us all over that.","Jeff Richardson","This is Jeff. I would just -- one thing I would add, I think we've discussed this kind of 60-day lag between taking expenses out and revenue. That 60 days has kind of happened because this started in early May. And so we are acting in the third quarter just as you would expect, given that, that's happening.","Matthew H. Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful detail. And I guess one final question. We've started to see a little bit of M&A occur in smaller size banks within the Midwest and within a couple of specific markets within the Midwest where you have some operations. I guess I'm just curious, given your relatively strong capital position, if there is increased interest at this point heading into 2014, with the capital rules now sort of relatively well understood to increase your footprint penetration within the Western part of the Midwest.","Kevin T. Kabat","Yes. I would tell you, Matt, clarity is helpful. And so getting that -- getting our arms around that is helpful as we look at it. As we've indicated and as we've talked about in the past, we grew up as an acquirer, we know that there'll be a time for consolidation that we'll be at the table for. We look at these things, obviously, in terms of use of capital and all of the other metrics we've outlined for you in the past relative to where we'd have to pass our hurdle rates. And obviously, if it's within footprint, we're both aware of it, understanding what's going on and look at that as opportunity to have greater density within our footprint. And we think that strategically makes the most sense to us as we look out. And so, again, I think that all of that fits within our purview, all of that fits within our strategic orientation and we'll continue to monitor what that looks like. If there's something that we think really is interesting and is -- fits within those parameters, yes, we would -- we'd take a real hard look at it.","Jeff Richardson","And the one thing, you started this with our high capital levels, and I think we would not look at our high capital levels as increasing our desire to do M&A. I think we would look at M&A as something that we would do when the deals are right in the right time. But we can also buy back our own stock with that capital. And we have to look at the value of that trade versus buying somebody else's stock. So we'll -- we don't view that capital as something that we've got to get rid of.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor of Deutsche.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I've got a few just nuance questions here, so apologize in advance. But first on the share count, what share count should we be using whether it's 3Q or 4Q? You've got some forward settlements that -- there's a full impact that needs to come from that. I don't know if that includes the Vantiv gain. There's just a few different pieces in the buybacks so maybe give us some insight in terms of what's already been announced or already planned for, as we think about the share count on a diluted basis.","Jeff Richardson","Well, so that's a tough one to answer because the third quarter share count is going to include things that we do in the third quarter. And we haven't just given -- we haven't given guidance on that, and we haven't acted on it. I think I would hesitate to give you a share count for the third quarter.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. I mean, maybe putting some of the moving pieces out there.","Jeff Richardson","You can take our CCAR plan and then kind of assume what you're going to assume for the timing of the remaining $600 million in repurchases, and then you'll come up with a share count that hopefully will be in the ballpark.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Right. So there's the $600 million remaining, there's still a $15 million benefit, I think, from what still needs to be settled that's in the period end, but not the average or something?","Jeff Richardson","Yes, there's still a small settlement amount that -- $15 million, is that right?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes, it's always the stub amounts at the end of the completion period, that would create that. I mean, that's sort of related to how we execute our accelerated share buybacks.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then the Vantiv gain that you realized this quarter, the $150 million in change, you would be allowed to buy back stock with that, in addition to the $600 million and the forward settlement that's still out there, right?","Jeff Richardson","No. The $600 million incorporates the fact that we already have approval for Vantiv. So the share repurchase that we did in May, plus the $600 million equals the total for CCAR plus Vantiv.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, all right, that's helpful. And then just separately, I know the tax rate's been coming in a little bit higher the first couple of quarters this year, but you're still sticking to the outlook of, I think, 28.5% for the full year, which obviously implies a decent decline in the rest of the year. I mean, I'm just trying to figure out kind of what's going on with the tax rate overall. And as we think out longer term, is that 28.5% kind of a good run rate to use?","Jeff Richardson","I mean, the tax rate is -- we kind of reset it this year. It's been fairly stable in that 28.5% range. I think we were -- because we have seasonality in the first quarter, the tax rate's a little high. So second half of the year, 28.5%, 29%, somewhere in there seems about right.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just separately, actually one other small thing, so the preferred dividend is $15 million every other quarter. So we should just pencil -- that's the only piece that's out there once this other one is converted. So we just pencil in $30 million per year starting next year?","Daniel T. Poston","Yes. But it will be $15 million every other quarter, not $7.5 million per quarter.","Matthew D. O'Connor - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, got it. Okay. And then separately, if I may, just kind of a bigger picture question. You've talked about how you have one of the smaller securities books of there and that you've got a lot of capacity to add to it over time if rates rose, and you chose to -- I did notice the period end securities was about $1 billion higher than last quarter and the average. So just thoughts on where rates are right now, both your capacity and interest in adding more securities to your period-end levels?","Tayfun Tuzun","We don't view the current rate environment as the end game environment. The reason why balances have increased this quarter is really more due to our decision to reinvest some of the expected cash flows that are coming back to us from the portfolio. Our anticipation is that rates will continue to inch up as we get closer to the end of QE as well as sort of the eventual, whether it's end of '14 or in '15, starting increasing short-term rates. So we have not fundamentally changed our investment strategy. This is probably somewhat of a temporary increase in investment balances. But clearly, we evaluate our opportunities and options and we will make the right decisions. But this particular quarter's increase in balances is not a permanent change in our investment approach.","Daniel T. Poston","Said it another way, Matt, the $1 billion increase in the end of period balances that you see is an acceleration of assumed investments in the NIM and NII guidance that we gave reflects that as an acceleration of investment of cash flows and not as a permanent increase in the level of portfolio at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","First question, just on capital. With, I guess, the positive changes that we've seen to Basel III capital ratios, when you look ahead to 2014 and your Basel III number is higher than where you previously thought it was going to be, do you think that gives you any more flexibility under the 2014 CCAR process to ask for more capital return than you may have otherwise, under different Basel III rules?","Daniel T. Poston","Well, we're certainly hopeful that having some final rules creates some clarity that allows the CCAR process to be a little more transparent and for both us and the regulators to have a little more certainty with respect to what capital levels need to be going forward and how we should manage those. So I think net-net it's a positive in terms of removing an additional uncertainty, which might allow us to do things in our CCAR plan that otherwise we might have been a little hesitant to do because of that uncertainty. So I think on the margin, the impact that you're talking about may be there, yes.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then just one final question. On Page 5, you had a chart showing C&I loan yields. I guess it's down another 32 basis points this quarter to 3.58%. When we think about where you're putting on new loans including any fees that might be in there as well, what's the right or what's the current level of C&I yields? Just to have a base of where that might bottom out.","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes. I think as we stated, Ken, this quarter, we had the impact of expiring floor maturities on our C&I portfolio yields, so that was a large impact on yields. As we think about yields and spends going forward in that business segment, there are several factors that impact that line item. One is just the fact that incoming loans clearly are of different credit nature, better credit nature compared to outgoing loans. That is fairly clear from the activity that we see. The other one is the impact of the overall credit spreads, both in capital markets as well as bank loan markets. Credit spreads continue to tighten during the first half of the year. And that activity impacts our bank loan spreads and impacts the prepayment behavior in that portfolio. The other one that we have to keep in mind is that as a company, we have and we continue to approach that business from a relationship perspective. So the credit spreads are just a portion of the relative returns in that business and we are clearly seeing increased fee activity. And our internal return targets and profitability ratios take into account noncredit segments in that business. Now having said all of that, I think when you go through a change in the rate environment that we've experienced over the last sort of 6 to 8 weeks, that tends to sort of, hopefully, create some changes in spread trends, and we may see some of that going forward. In general, we expect the credit spreads to stabilize, but we are cautious because that necessarily is a little bit dependent upon what happens in capital markets, what happens with competition, how they price loans. So in our guidance with respect to NIM or NII, we tend to be cautious in how we think about commercial yields. But clearly, this quarter's particular drop in yields has been outsized and largely impacted by an expiration of floors. So I wouldn't extrapolate what happened this quarter into future quarters.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller of FBR.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","On -- coming back to the mortgage side, correct me if I'm wrong, but you're mostly a refi shop. What type of things are you doing to try to increase your purchase market or are you just comfortable with the mix shift you got right now?","Daniel T. Poston","Yes. I think in the quarter, in the second quarter, about 1\/4 of our volume was related to purchase mortgages. So I think we do have a fairly sizable portion of our business that's purchased business. That increased significantly during the quarter. Purchase volume was $1.8 billion of the $7-plus billion in originations. In the quarter, that was up 80% from $1 billion in the first quarter. So I think we're seeing increased purchase volume. That's the result of a number of things. One is we've given more attention and focus, obviously, to purchase volume as the environment has started to shift. You get the seasonal benefit of the selling season that starts in the second quarter and continues into the third. And continued stabilization and improvement in real estate valuations, and the real estate market is helping there as well. So we have a sizable portion of our business, in the second quarter, it was from purchase volume that will be a greater percentage, obviously, as we go forward and the refi portion of the business wanes. But were confident in our ability to capture our share of purchase volume and think we're doing the right things to increase purchase volumes as we go forward.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Can I be -- correct me if I'm wrong, I don't believe that you guys have a lot of eligible loans in your portfolio because you weren't -- your portfolio's relatively clean. Am I correct or are you doing HARP?","Tayfun Tuzun","Depends on who you compare us to. But in general, we would say that our portfolio is much cleaner relative to a large number of our peers.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","But are you doing HARP? Is there HARP originations in that $7 billion number?","Kevin T. Kabat","Yes, absolutely.","Daniel T. Poston","Yes. We had about $1.4 billion. It was about 22% of our second quarter volume.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And with that, is the HARP -- with higher rates, is the HARP gain on sale margins relative to the overall gain on sale margins? Are they coming in or are they still holding pretty strong?","Daniel T. Poston","They've come in significantly. In the second quarter, they were still probably 100 basis points or so wider than non-HARP. We're expecting that, that differential will continue to shrink as we go forward.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","First question, I just wanted to ask you to update us on your strategy around hedging the MSR. You guys have had really nice MSR gains over the last couple of quarters, and I know you did say that they would be down from here. But can you just talk as how, to the extent that you are hedging the MSR, or are you more just apt to kind of let it ride with rates at this point?","Tayfun Tuzun","We absolutely hedge our MSR. Our risk management approach and sort of the underlying policy and limits require us to manage MSR volatility within fairly prudent guidelines. Now having said that, the same risk management approach, in general, applies to the overall mortgage banking revenues. And as you know, up until the end of the second quarter, we've operated under very unprecedented rate and margin environment. And during the second half of 2012 and most of the first half of 2013, primary 30-year mortgage rates have fluctuated between 3.5 and 3 7\/8, and gain on sale margins at that time approached 4 or 5 points. Now operating in that environment for 3 full quarters in a row creates significant risk exposures in the underlying revenue streams, and we're cognizant of that. Now at that point, a 25 basis point move up or down in rates has created significant changes. We spend a lot of time studying our MSR asset and its convexity, and we use a lot of third-party opinions along those lines. We're also very cognizant on how MSR assets are valued. As you know, largely valuations depend on what happens at the end of the quarter. So it's very difficult for us not to hedge the position. And it's not -- the hedge position is not a position that you put on at the beginning of the quarter and go away because it's a very dynamic position. Having said all of that, I mean, having said all of that, we are now in a different rate environment. We moved away from that 3.5% to 3.75% zone into more of a 4.5% mortgage rate zone. And in this environment, clearly, our approach to hedging MSR values is going to be different than the strategies that we have used over the past sort of 3 or 4 quarters. So we've never given any guidance in terms of our MSR because, truly, as a hedge management philosophy, we don't anticipate gains and losses, and our goal is to neutralize the volatility in that asset. But having moved from that cusp-y nature of mortgage rates, we're clearly much more focused on making sure that we preserve the stability and the value of our MSR. So basically, cut it short, yes, we do hedge our MSR value. We will continue to hedge the MSR value. Our tactics may change from one quarter to another but, in general, we do not take market risk when it comes to the mortgage revenue streams in our business.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. And then my second question is regarding just preferred issuance, when you did the press release back in the spring about the conversion. Now that conversion has happened. That press release also mentioned the possibility of issuing another $500 million of preferred. So I wanted to ask you, a, are you planning on doing that? And then b, you're still very low as a percentage of Basel III in terms of that total preferred bucket, so I just wanted to ask you to your thoughts on just, do you intend to continue to fill up that bucket? And where would you expect to take that to over time?","Tayfun Tuzun","We plan to follow our CCAR plan and issuing another $450 million in preferred securities is in that plan, so we plan to execute that strategy. Going forward, I think, we believe that we achieve better capital efficiency by utilizing preferred securities in our capital accounts. And over time, we would like to utilize the room that we have in that line item.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just last quick thing. So that $450 million is going to -- well, we don't know exact timing, but that's something that we need to contemplate as far as the preferred expense run rate, the preferred dividend run rate as well.","Tayfun Tuzun","Correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Scinicariello of UBS.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just want to talk about life after mortgage for a second here. Just given some of the strong underlying trends and some of the -- your other fee income areas like deposit charges, card, corporate, investment, management, what not. Just kind of wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of the opportunities you have to kind of ramp those up as kind of the economy continues to get better and the ability of that to maybe offset some of the kind of net effect from kind of the mortgage tailing off.","Kevin T. Kabat","Yes. Steve, a couple of things I'd say. One is, if you look at it, I think we're a little bit ahead of the game because you can see the progress being made even today in today's results in our other fee areas. So whether you're talking about commercial fees, whether you're talking about deposit fees, whether you're talking about card fees, whether you're talking about record brokerage fees contributing to the IA -- our IA business, we feel really good about the momentum that we've built and investments we've made in those businesses that will continue. And I think that is true in terms of the guidance that we've given you and in the progress that we've made from that standpoint. And even in terms of life after mortgage, as you say, there will be a mortgage business that will continue to refer consumer product through. Our deposit products with cross-sells will continue to be a strength of ours. Our sales culture continues to be a strength. So those are opportunities. And we're also, really, just now beginning to see, I think, some better health in our business banking space. And so that end of the spectrum, I think, is beginning. And that has, I think, a better outlook over the next few quarters and into next year as well. So again, we feel like we're really well positioned, and our businesses are operating and working well. We think we're ahead of the game in terms of some of the product offerings that we've put out. We've talked about our deposit simplification, that's complete now. And we have a platform that we can build on. And as I mentioned earlier in one of the questions, we're also beginning to see a lessening of drag on our assets and balances in our -- in the CRE space. So again, we think that we'll show you and we'll be able to demonstrate the transition to the core bank strength that Fifth Third, I think, shows in the numbers today that you'll look for us in the future. I don't know, Dan, if there's anything you'd add.","Daniel T. Poston","No. That says it pretty well.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Jack Micenko of SIG.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","On the mortgage side, you've grown your mortgage portfolio nicely over the past several years. At the same time, historically, when rates have gone up, we've seen a migration on the purchase side from 30-year fixed into maybe some 7\/1s, 10\/1s. I think that's generally the kind of product you've been looking to put on balance sheet. So I guess the question is, in the mortgage business on the purchase side, have you seen that transition yet in terms of a migration to lower -- shorter duration purchase mortgage? And would that potentially be a driver of additional mortgage growth in the future on balance sheet as the structure is more sort of consistent with the duration you're looking for in the mortgage book?","Tayfun Tuzun","I don't have the statistics as to what percentage of our ARM originations are purchase versus refi. But in general, our preference, as you stated, is for shorter duration mortgage assets. We do not currently, and for a number of quarters now, have not been retaining longer-term mortgages whether it's conforming jumbos or our retail mortgage product. If we do see an uptick in shorter duration mortgage originations, yes, that would benefit our overall mortgage portfolio growth because I suspect that we will not make any changes in terms of duration preferences in our retained mortgage portfolios. Yes, if we do see that uptick, we may be able to retain a little bit more of those shorter duration mortgages.","Jack Micenko - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay, great. And then on the commercial real estate side, the run off has been, I don't know, net, maybe call it $300 million a quarter. Can you give us some granularity around what some of the growth looks like and try to do the math and net out what -- when we see the trough, I think you'd said, maybe by the end of the year? And then what kind of sort of net new growth we could potentially forecast going forward?","Kevin T. Kabat","Yes. I think the color that we've given you is really kind of pertaining to this year. And our expectation is that we could begin to see some growth in the CRE assets, so that gives you the number there. We really haven't given guidance in terms of -- next year we will when we get closer to the end of the year. But obviously, when we hit that inflection point, that could become -- as you can see, as a percentage of our total assets and book, we're probably one of the lowest, if not the lowest, in all of the regionals with that asset classification. So there's a good opportunity out there. We've got good focus and strong infrastructure against that to take a look at it. But we'll give you more clarity as we get further out in the year on that.

Together we\u2019ve navigated some of the most challenging times the industry has ever faced.

So, with that, let\u2019s talk about the quarter.","Today, we reported second quarter net income to common shareholders of $292 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.36 including $0.07 of items that Tayfun will go over shortly. We\u2019re very pleased with our core business trends although the environment continues to challenge banks.","We\u2019re very focused on our businesses and continue to demonstrate our willingness to take decisive action when necessary as you saw with our branch announcement in June. Ultimately we\u2019re building a franchise that meets the needs of our customers by enabling them to conduct business in the manner they wish while also building a company that is well positioned to compete effectively today and be well positioned with the appropriate strategies in place to succeed in the future.","For the second quarter, excellent balance sheet trends continued with loan growth led by C&I which was up 3% both sequentially and year-over-year. Strong deposit growth continued with core deposits of $2.3 billion from the first quarter driven primarily by demand deposits with those balances up 5% sequentially and up 13% over last year.","Fee income was led by very good results in corporate banking which were up $50 million sequentially on strength and capital markets and higher syndication fees, which were up from soft market activity levels in the first quarter.","Mortgage banking was up $31 million from the last quarter as originations were up 39% to $2.5 billion. Expenses were up compared with last year as expected, second quarter expenses were highly - were higher largely due to long-term incentive payouts that occurred in the quarter and several other puts and takes that Tayfun will discuss. We remain very focused on our current operating results as we continue to invest in our company with a long-term strategic view.","Credit metrics continued to be excellent. And our net charge-off ratio was 37 basis points in the quarter, the lowest level I\u2019ve seen in our tenure as CEO.","Non-performing assets were down 25% from the year ago. And our NPA ratio ended the quarter at 67 basis points down 12% sequentially. We\u2019ve seen significant and sustained improvement in our credit results over the past several years and we feel very good about the people and the infrastructure that we have in place right now.","This quarter marks another in a long line that includes actions undertaken in order to proactively adapt to the changing marketplace. We\u2019ve maintained our sites and our prudent approach to lending, the focus on appropriate risk adjusted returns. We\u2019ve actively managed the retail franchise over the last several - over the last few years and we\u2019ve been very proactive in adapting to the changing demographics and our customers\u2019 usage of new technologies.","We\u2019ve talked about the investments we\u2019re making to strengthen our risk and compliance infrastructure. And we expect to see a competitive benefit from them. Ultimately we\u2019re managing the company for the long-term, that\u2019s our focus. And we do expect it to be beneficial to shareholders through time.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our second quarter operating results and our outlook for the second half of the year. Tayfun?","Tayfun Tuzun","Thanks, Kevin. Good morning and thanks for joining us. I will start with the financial summary on page 3 of the presentation. We reported net income to common shareholders of $292 million or $0.36 per diluted share. There were several items that affected earnings in the quarter, as Kevin mentioned. The largest was the $97 million non-cash impairment charge related to the changes in our branch network that we announced in June. We also had a positive Vantiv warrant valuation mark of $14 million this quarter. These two items had a net negative impact of $0.07 per share.","I will comment on the branch announcement at the end of the discussion of our operating trends and metrics.","With that, let\u2019s move to the average balance sheet and page 4 of the presentation. The stronger loan activity we had in the second half of first quarter carried throughout the second quarter. Average portfolio loan balances increased $1.7 billion from the first quarter driven by increases in C&I, commercial construction and residential mortgage balances. Specifically, our C&I balances were up 3% on an average basis.","Loan growth metrics reflect the results of our team\u2019s focus on growing our existing relationships as well as selecting new clients that meet our return profile within our risk tolerance levels.","Although our payouts were higher than the first quarter, our loan production this quarter was very strong across all industries except energy. In total, our second quarter production was the highest in the last five quarters.","The average credit rating for this quarter\u2019s production pool was the highest of the last five quarters as well. There is no let down in competition but we are confident that our client retention and selection efforts are supportive of loan growth.","New production coupons are lower, to a certain extent in line with better credit quality. At the same time, our payoff coupons were also lower than the first quarter indicative of events-related rather than refi-related balance. Line utilization was flat.","Average commercial mortgage balances were down 1% as we continue to see refinancing activity of our legacy book. Commercial construction lending remained strong. Growth in multifamily and industrial commercial construction remained strong with 75% of production coming from within our footprint.","Our new commitments, net of prepayment activity should support second half loan growth in this portfolio.","In the second quarter, average investment securities increased by $4.2 billion or 18% sequentially reflecting the full quarter impact of our first quarter purchases and $2 billion of additional securities during the second quarter. On an end-of-period basis, we added $1.5 billion of securities.","We saw very strong deposit growth throughout 2014. And as we expected, that continued in the first half of 2015. Average core deposits increased $2.3 billion from the first quarter driven by growth in demand deposit and money market accounts.","Moving to NII on page 5 of the presentation, taxable equivalent net interest income increased $40 million sequentially to $892 million, primarily driven by the faster than anticipated deployment of cash into earning asset growth and lower deposit costs. NII has also positively impacted by $7 million due to an extra day in the quarter.","The net interest margin was 290 basis points, up 4 basis points from the first quarter driven by a 6-basis point benefit due to the faster than anticipated deployment of cash that I mentioned, 3 basis points due to better funding rates including the continued rationalization of deposit rates, partially offset by 4 basis points of loan yield compression and 1-basis point decrease primarily due to day-count.","Shifting to fees on page 6 of the presentation. Second quarter non-interest income was $556 million compared with $630 million in the first quarter. Results included the $97 million impairment charge related to the changes in the branch network and the $14 million positive mark on the Vantiv warrant that I mentioned earlier.","First quarter results included a $70 million positive mark on the Vantiv warrant, a $37 million gain on the sale of the residential TDRs and a $30 million-impairment associated with aircraft leases.","Quarterly results also included charges on the Visa total return swap of $2 million in the current quarter and $17 million last quarter. Excluding these items in both quarters, fee income of $641 million increased $71 million or 12% sequentially with broad-based increases in almost all categories led by increases in corporate banking revenue and mortgage banking net revenue. Adjusted fee income was 42% of revenue in the second quarter.","Excluding the impact of the $30 million aircraft lease residual impairment in the first quarter, corporate banking fees increased $20 million sequentially due to improvement in institutional sales revenue and higher syndication fees. Syndication activity was better this quarter than last and we had a strong quarter in corporate bond fees.","Total risk management fees which include our interest rates, foreign exchange and derivative businesses were stable.","Card and processing revenue increased 8% sequentially and 1% from the second quarter of 2014 as we continue to benefit from an increase in the number of actively used cards. Mortgage banking net revenue of $117 million was up 36% sequentially. Originations increased to $2.5 billion from $1.8 billion in the first quarter.","Gain on sale margins were down 39 basis points to 288 basis points. We had a good quarter in mortgage servicing revenues. Net servicing asset valuation adjustments which include amortization and valuation adjustments were positive $18 million this quarter versus negative $17 million last quarter.","Deposit service charges increased 3% from the first quarter and were flat relative to the second quarter of 2014. Total investment advisory revenue of $105 million decreased 3% sequentially due to higher tax related private client service revenue in the first quarter partially offset by an increase in securities and brokerage fees and increased 3% from the second quarter last year.","Within investment advisory revenue, personal asset management fees were up 5% while brokerage fees were up 8% from the second quarter of 2014.","We show non-interest expense on page 7 of the presentation. Expenses were higher in the quarter in-line with our expectations and came in at $947 million compared with $923 million in the first quarter. The sequential increase was impacted by higher revenue base incentive compensation and long-term incentives in the second quarter as well as an increase of $2 million in severance.","Overall, our first half comp related expenses were 2.3% higher than the comp related expenses for the first half of 2014. Included in our expense total, is also a $6-million sequential quarter change in the provision expense related to unfunded commitments in-line with the broader directional move in provision.","The sequential comparison also exaggerates the expense growth as the first quarter benefited from a settlement of a tax liability related to prior years. These were partially offset by a decrease in FICA and unemployment tax expense recorded in quarterly benefits which are seasonally high in the first quarter. I will spend more time on expenses in our outlook section.","Turning to credit results on page 8. Total net charge-offs of $86 million or 37 basis points as a percentage of average loans decreased $5 million sequentially. Non-performing assets excluding loans held for sale were $626 million at quarter end, down $65 million from the first quarter bringing the NPL ratio to 51 basis points and the NPA ratio to 67 basis points.","Commercial NPAs decreased $45 million sequentially primarily due to a $23 million decline in C&I and $20 million decline in commercial mortgage. Consumer NPAs decreased $20 million from the first quarter driven by $12 million decline in residential mortgage and $5 million decline in home equity NPAs.","Our energy portfolio declined to $1.7 billion and the quality of the firms we have relationships with remains very good. The portfolio was reduced by $155 million from the first quarter, of which approximately 50% relates to reserve based lending.","Utilization in the portfolio declined 3% as companies continue to access capital markets to bolster their balance sheets. There were some negative ratings migration but not material in the context of the overall portfolio. We continue to be comfortable with our portfolio from a loss given the full perspective, with appropriate collateral, liquidity, cash flow and reserve coverage levels.","In our RBL portfolio, we are a senior secured lender with in many cases significant levels of subordinated risks ahead of the bank\u2019s position. Of this $66 million in NPA in-flows only $11 million related to the energy portfolio.","Also, SNC results were communicated to banks in the second quarter and while I won\u2019t get further into specifics or material impacts from the exam are included in our results in the second quarter.","Wrapping up on credit, the allowance for loan and lease losses declined $7 million compared with $22 million decline last quarter. Provision coverage of net charge-offs increased to 92% from 76% last quarter and reserve coverage decreased to 1.39% of loans and leases. Virtually, all of our credit metrics continue to improve as we move into the second half of 2015.","Looking at capital on slide 9. Capital levels continue to be strong and well above regulatory requirements. The common equity tier-1 ratio was 9.4%. At the end of the second quarter, the average diluted share count was down another 1% sequentially. During the quarter, we announced common stock repurchases of $155 million. The ASR settlement is expected to occur on or before July 28 and reduced the second quarter share count by 6.7 million shares.","Now, a few comments about our announced retail branch actions and our perspectives on the current environment before we move to our outlook section. As we\u2019ve been discussing with you for the last couple of years, our retail franchise has performed very well in this challenging environment, and we\u2019ve been very proactive in adapting to the changing demographics, and our customers\u2019 usage of new technologies.","After executing a successful deposit simplification strategy in 2012 and 2013, we have been optimizing our branch FTE count by both reducing service employees as well as reinvesting in sales associates. These changes not only enabled us to optimize our expenses but also help improve our customer service levels and align our service channels with our customers\u2019 preferences.","Up until this quarter, our branch count has been fairly stable. But given these changes a deeper review of our branch network was conducted during the second quarter which led to the planned reduction of our branch count by 105. We use the scorecard with over 50 variables in accessing our network, including production volumes and trends, transaction volumes and trends and overlaps among others. We will be executing this strategy over the next 12 months.","We\u2019ve taken $97 million impairment charge related to the owned branches and land which is $12 million higher than our June announcement. The incremental impairment charge we booked was due to the addition of a handful of additional locations and the receipt of actual appraisals.","Our annualized expense benefit is also greater given the higher number of branches than originally announced. We will identify the expense impact related to the lease branches for you as they flow through our numbers over the next six months based on the closing date of those branches.","We expect to fully execute this strategy by mid-2016 and thus expect the reduction to impact our expense totals on a run-rate basis during the second half of the next year.","Between now and then, we will continue to update you as to the progress of the project. But at this time, I\u2019m not ready to share more details with you regarding geographies and timing as I know you\u2019ll understand, I would like to preserve our ability to execute the plan as efficiently as possible. On a fully annualized basis, we expect to lower our expenses by $65 million once the entire action is executed which is $5 million better than originally announced.","Our management team is keenly focused on capturing a significant portion of these expense savings in our bottom line, but we are also anticipating a portion of the savings to be reinvested in the business to continue to build our digital channel platforms not only for retail but for our entire company. These investments are designed to provide further opportunities to improve our cost efficiencies and improve our customer service as well as support revenue growth.","We will be sharing our reinvestment plans with you as we finalize our strategic studies. I want to reemphasize our management team\u2019s focus on expense management especially as the expense carry of the risk and compliance structures in our sector continues to ramp up.","The types of strategic actions that we are currently evaluating are long-term oriented actions, very clearly focused on building our company to achieve our revenue growth and operational excellence objectives in recognition of the evolution and technology, demographic changes and required infrastructure designs in the current regulatory environments.","Turning to the outlook and a few comments on the third quarter. Thus far we\u2019ve maintained and communicated a realistic perspective on the economy and the overall market conditions and shared our outlook with you on that basis. This perspective enabled us to react appropriately to market driven opportunities to support our asset growth and earnings. Our updated outlook is not materially different than what we provided in January and again in April.","We continue to feel comfortable with our full-year NII expectations. As a reminder, we have one rate increase assumption in the fourth quarter as we have discussed in April. We have and will continue to actively manage our balance sheet to adapt to changing macroeconomic and Fed policy expectations. We don\u2019t have any underlying assumptions related to swap activity built into our NII outlook and we have fairly modest levels of swaps relative to peers.","We do still expect our NII to grow year-over-year excluding the deposit advance impact. And for the third quarter we expect NII to be slightly higher than the second driven primarily by loan growth and day-count. At this time, we also expect NII to growth in Q4 over the third quarter levels.","As we discussed in April, we expect our NIM to be stable during the year from the first quarter levels. We\u2019ve outperformed our NIM expectations this quarter so we don\u2019t expect our NIM to widen further from here in the third quarter. And our overall NIM during the second half should be stable with our first half NIM which is 2.88%.","Third quarter corporate banking fees tend to be seasonally low with a stronger fourth quarter, which should elevate the second half totals in corporate fees over the first half totals.","Our current expectation is that mortgage banking production net revenue will be somewhat below the second quarter levels but above last year\u2019s third quarter. The servicing revenues will be a function of the rate environment. Excluding the mortgage servicing revenues we expect a strong second half in total fee income but following seasonal trends with a stable third quarter and a strong fourth quarter. Overall, fee trends look positive for the second half.","On the expense side, as we discussed, we are continuing to invest in our businesses and infrastructure. And those investments will further increase our employee expenses primarily in our risk and compliance functions. In addition, our investments in cyber security and fraud areas will build a safer environment for us as well as for our customers.","For the second half, I expect that our total compensation expenses will be relatively flat including employee benefits and incentive comp for business activity. In addition, during this phase, third party expenses tend to be more elevated. Some of these expenses are clearly not permanent. You have seen these types of increases from other banks depending upon where they are in the cycle.","We expect higher payment processing expenses as a good portion of those are directly tied to payment activity. In addition, as we discussed with you earlier in the year, we will see an up-tick in EMV related expenditures which will reduce risks going forward.","Technology investments will continue to increase. We expect our IT expenses during the second half to be about 10% higher than the first half. As I discussed earlier, we are making long-term strategic decisions and investing in our franchise. We also want to make sure that we allocate the priorities smartly between IT projects that are targeted for risk and compliance infrastructure and those that are targeted for direct business related purposes such as digital technology.","We believe that we cannot approach these investments in a sequential manner and therefore investing on these two-paths simultaneously. Simply stated, we cannot afford to delay our technology investments in our businesses as the environment is changing fast.","Overall, our core expenses will increase next quarter relative to the second quarter. The predominant driver will be marketing as we expect a seasonal up-tick in the third quarter related to our planned campaign, excluding any one-time items in the second half such as the lease termination expenses related to the branch optimization announcement or other one-time expenses. Our total expenses during the next two quarters should be approximately 2.5% higher than our first half expenses.","As we discussed, our expense adjustments related to the branch strategy shows we are very focused on long-term expense drivers and will take decisive strategic actions to maximize the performance of our company both in terms of revenues and expenses.","Turning to credit, we still expect minimal benefit from ALLL releases due to loan growth and the associated higher levels of provisioning. Our fundamental credit performance should remain at historically low levels given the current environment.","We also would like to remind you that the revenue expectations that we shared with you total do not include potential and currently un-forecasted items such as Vantiv warrant marks or gains on share sales.","With that, let\u2019s open the line for questions. Angel?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from Bank of America. Your line is open.","Erika Najarian","Yes, good morning.","Kevin Kabat","Good morning.","Tayfun Tuzun","Good morning.","Erika Najarian","I just wanted to make sure I understood the message on expenses. I know you\u2019re not going to give us the 2016 outlook, but as we think about what\u2019s a reasonable expectation for next year, should we take that second half run rate that\u2019s up 2.5% more than the first half? I understand that you mentioned that there are some seasonally high expenses in there, but it sounded like you were communicating a strong message on your need to re-invest in technology.","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes, I mean, when you think about our strategies here Erika, we are clearly continuing to save and optimize our expenses. On the retail side for example we\u2019ve been doing that for a while. And the announcement clearly adds another layer on top of that $65 million run rate expenses. But at the same time we are clearly going to continue our investments in building the risk and compliance infrastructure and also reinvesting back in the business especially on the digital side.","Having said that, at this point we\u2019re not giving guidance for 2016 and we would like to spend a little bit more time in evaluating our strategies going forward with respect to cost efficiencies. As we said, these $65 million will, not in its entirety will fall to the bottom line. But a significant portion of that should fall. And we will detail that for you going forward. Greg, do you want to comment your thoughts on that?","Greg Carmichael","Once again, thanks Tayfun. And Erika, as you look at our businesses and the changing needs of our customers as they move to wanting to bank anywhere anytime. Our ability to invest from a technology perspective on opportunities to improve revenue, improve the customer experience and obviously drive efficiencies. We\u2019re going to stay focused on that. And we\u2019ll also continue to look at our investments that we have today in our infrastructure in better ways of reengineering our infrastructure to serve our customers going forward.","Erika Najarian","And, Greg, just as a follow-up to that. Because I noticed in the press release that there was some language from you about looking for further opportunities to improve operational efficiency. And I know that clearly it\u2019s too early to ask what those are, but should we expect, when you take over in November, a deeper dive into the expense base in Fifth Third. And that we may hear about perhaps more efficiencies at some point next year?","Greg Carmichael","Fifth Third has always been focused on prudent expense management. We\u2019re going to continue that going forward. And technology is a great opportunity for us especially with some of the recent advancements. Mobile check deposit, we have over 15% of our deposits now coming through remote deposit capture. That drives efficiencies in our bank operations. We\u2019ll continue to look for ways to accelerate that pace of play around those investments where it makes good sense for our customer and our shareholders.","Erika Najarian","Got it. And, Kevin, good luck with your retirement.","Kevin Kabat","Thanks Erika, appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers from Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners. Your line is open.","Scott Siefers","Good morning, guys.","Kevin Kabat","Good morning, Scott.","Tayfun Tuzun","Good morning.","Scott Siefers","Tayfun, first of all, Kevin and Greg, congratulations to both of you.","Kevin Kabat","Thanks Scott.","Scott Siefers","Tayfun, I was hoping you could expand upon some of the comments about loan growth you made in your early prepared remarks, where I think you just noted kind of the client retention and selection efforts you guys have made would suggest loan growth. Just given that the dynamic, in other words the acceleration, has changed over what has been the last three quarters or so I was just hoping you could expand a little on those comments. In other words, despite the competitive dynamic what is it that kind of makes you feel better about growing the loan book more robustly?","Tayfun Tuzun","Sure. So Scott, I think what\u2019s very encouraging is when I look at the last sort of two quarters of trends, despite the fact that pay-offs remained at healthy levels, our production numbers are coming in strongly above those to drive net loan growth.","When we go back to the second half of last year, I think as a company, we have done a very good job in understanding the impact of the competitive dynamics in the market and have been able to between sort of the sales groups, the credit group as well as my finance group to organize ourselves in a much more efficient manner to respond to the market and to respond to our clients. And I think that\u2019s really driving the healthy increase in production levels.","And when you look at the credit profile of these new loans coming on balance sheet, as I mentioned, the credit profile this quarter of this new production was the highest in five quarters. So, it\u2019s clear that we\u2019re not stretching or sacrificing on credit as we increase the number of our relationships. And also, we\u2019ve been obviously focused in deepening the existing relationships and that\u2019s working well as well.","And this is also, I have to say that during the last three or four quarters, we\u2019ve added great talent both in originations as well as on the credit side. I think that\u2019s working very well for us. And we\u2019ve identified the right areas whether it\u2019s our specialization in healthcare, our continued focused on mid-core, our new retail vertical. I think this is really a broad-based support for loan growth that we are seeing today.","Scott Siefers","Okay, perfect. Thank you. And then maybe if you could spend a quick second just touching on overall earning asset growth beyond just the loan portfolio, I guess you\u2019re maybe call it roughly two quarters into being a little more comfortable investing in the securities portfolio - in other words that mix from cash to securities and you still get a pretty robust deposit growth. So how do you see I guess the securities portfolio in particular playing out in terms of growth as we look ahead?","Jamie Leonard","Yes, Scott, it\u2019s Jamie. As we said on our first quarter call, we would expect during the course of 2015 to add another $1 billion to $2 billion of leverage during the course of the year. During the quarter, we made the decision to accelerate that additional leverage as you saw in our results. So, our portfolio as we exit the second quarter is where we would like it to be. And we\u2019re pretty pleased with the execution and continue to be mindful of the rate risk. So going forward, you can expect our portfolio to be fairly stable and to grow in-line with earning asset growth.","Scott Siefers","Okay, all right, perfect. Thanks a lot, guys.","Tayfun Tuzun","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ken Zerbe","Hi, guy, thank you. Just a couple of quick questions. The first, in terms of the branch restructuring, I know obviously you took the charge now, but I may have missed the prepared comments. Did you say you were going to take additional charges during the next couple quarters but just tell us as you take them or?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes, the second piece Ken, we - actually it was in our 8-K that we filed in June. There are some leased branches and the expense impact on those will flow through our numbers as we close those branches and reflect the impact of those leases on a going forward basis. That number had to be disclosed between $6 million and $10 million.","Ken Zerbe","Got it, okay. And then second question, in terms of the loan growth, obviously a lot of growth coming from the construction portfolio. How much, some of the banks that have also reported have talked about like high volatility CRE. Can you just talk a little bit about the construction piece? Like is any of that high volatility? Does it have a higher risk weighting? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of the types of construction that you are putting on. Thanks.","Frank Forrest","Hi, this is Frank, good morning. Good question. As Tayfun mentioned though, when you look at our loan growth, it\u2019s not heavily concentrated in construction activity. It\u2019s across all sectors. And again the risk profile is very strong. The construction activity we\u2019re seeing is quite frankly a non-speculative office building, apartment buildings, some retail it\u2019s a national builders that we\u2019ve had a long-time relationship with.","And again, I\u2019ll emphasize, we\u2019re taking nominal risk in managing that book as we go forward. We\u2019ve learned as other institutions have our lessons. This book is small relative to I believe our peers. And we\u2019re being very prudent in client selection. So, it\u2019s - we\u2019re happy to see the growth. But again, they\u2019re the client we feel very good about it. These are again loans that I think I have a very solid risk profile. And we\u2019ll continue to manage it prudently as we go forward.","Ken Zerbe","All right. Thank you.","Frank Forrest","Thank you.","Kevin Kabat","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Good morning. Can you talk about what is going on in the consumer auto lending space? I know it\u2019s an area that you pulled back a little bit several quarters ago given tight pricing there. But obviously there is good loan sales and or auto sales and the average price of autos has gone up. So overall the industry seems to be doing pretty well, but talk about the lending environment and your approach right now, please.","Tayfun Tuzun","Matt, our color there is no different than the same message that we\u2019ve been giving over the last two years. Now, yes, car sales are at healthy levels. But when we look at the pricing and profitability of that business within the credit profile that we are comfortable with, we are comfortable with the origination levels that we have. And they\u2019ve been very stable.","And a number of our competitors obviously are operating at credit profiles below ours. The immediate profit metrics look reasonable but it just doesn\u2019t fit our risk profile and risk tolerance levels. So, I don\u2019t really have any new news for you in that area. I think the next few quarters, the numbers will look very similar to what you\u2019ve seen from us over the last two, three quarters.","Matt O\u2019Connor","And then maybe just stepping back bigger picture for consumer lending overall, most of the categories have been relatively stable for you guys. Are there pockets of opportunity to balance sheet growth or still mostly focused on the commercial side in terms of on balance sheet growth?","Tayfun Tuzun","Unfortunately - the development of our balance sheet is really an extension of what we\u2019re seeing in the broad economy. Home equities continued their soft decline. At one point that\u2019s going to turn and clearly, in our branch network we\u2019re very focused in making sure that when that happens in our footprint that we are ready to experience that growth.","Credit cards, I think that still continues to be a good business for us to support ongoing growth. That business as you know is a very branch focused direct retail portfolio for us and has great credit profile and we\u2019re happy to grow that portfolio. And we will grow that portfolio. We\u2019ve added some management talent over the past couple of quarters there. And as we focus on the MV project and the credit card business at the same time, we are focusing on business growth opportunities. So, you will see continued growth in credit cards.","And then we also will obviously maintain our mortgage presence and as we see opportunities there, we will support that. So, at this point the trends are going to look fairly similar but as the consumer continues to improve and it\u2019s how balance sheet helps, we\u2019re here to observe obviously more growth in that area. But right now C&I will dominate loan growth.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Ken Usdin","Thanks, good morning. Tayfun, just a summary question on the outlook, if I heard you right about expecting growth in NII, a better back half for fees, and then this expense guidance, am I correct in assuming that the PPNR outlook would be better than the 578 adjusted-number that you posted for the second quarter?","Tayfun Tuzun","Ken, I\u2019ll leave my outlook structure as I laid out without sort of adding more to that. I mean, clearly the fundamental drivers continue to be healthy. And it\u2019s no different than what we thought was going to happen in January, what we thought was going to happen in April. We just maintain a very similar perspective. We are confident in the health of, the fundamental driver that being earning asset growth which now going forward for this year will really reflect loan growth rather than securities growth.","NIM is at good levels, the momentum there is helpful. We believe that the second half should show good sort of fee income level. So, I will just leave it there and we gave you a little bit more detailed expense guidance. Beyond that I would be careful in not projecting Q2\u2019s PPNR levels for the rest of the year. We clearly have outperformed in the second quarter. But things look good.","And as we move into the third quarter, we are confident in the fundamental drivers. But I just want to point out that in Q2 we outperformed significantly.","Ken Usdin","Understood. And then secondly, just on your outlook for credit where clearly there were some adjustments made inside, sounds like a little bit for the energy side. Underlying that and whatever you may have adjusted for the SNC specifically, I was just wondering if you could further tease out what was core credit performance, what might have been SNC related. And then you\u2019re just kind of underlying outlook for any further charge-off improvement and reserve release.","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes, I mean, first of all, I did not make any statements related to the energy being part of the underlying credit trends. So I\u2019m going to turn that over to Frank and then I\u2019ll come back with comments on provision.","Frank Forrest","Thanks. As we\u2019ve said before, the synergy book is relatively small in context of both commercial and the Bancorp as a whole. It\u2019s less than 2% of our Bancorp loans, its $1.67 billion, so it\u2019s a small book. We have the highly experienced team of lenders, who\u2019ve been with us over 20 years on average. It\u2019s predominantly a mid-to-large corporate focus that\u2019s consistent with our other Fifth Third National Alliance.","Now we exercise what we believe is conservative underwriting. It\u2019s a diversified book as Tayfun has talked about. Upstream represents 50% of all energy related exposures and that tends to be a well-structured book. It\u2019s under a traditional secured reserve base borrowing base. The balance of that book is predominantly to investment rate credit.","So, when you look - as we went through this Shared National Credit exam, effectively for us it was a wash. The numbers that Tayfun said are in our second quarter results, there were no material adverse changes as a result of the exam across the broad portfolio or in the energy sector. So, the sector itself we talked about the fact that we had a slight migration on non-performing assets.","But the non-performing assets in the energy book are less than 1%. And we don\u2019t expect any material change there. We don\u2019t expect any material changes in the outlook for the second quarter as a result of our energy book. So, we feel good about the book as a whole, again it\u2019s small, well managed and performing to date, we\u2019ve seen some risk rating migration as have others. But again, it\u2019s just not a material number in terms of Bancorp.","Tayfun Tuzun","And on the provision, Ken, I think we signaled at the end of last year very clearly that we would expect this year to cross the threshold at some point. Our coverage level provision to charge-off coverage level moved up now above 90% this quarter. So, our outlook basically is for that trend to continue into full coverage. But that\u2019s just a natural progress with respect to our existing credit profile, our loan growth statistics. And I think despite the fact that we feel very confident that just as a natural progression at this point that we\u2019re expecting.","Ken Usdin","Understood, thanks. Sorry for that misstatement on the energy comment earlier.","Tayfun Tuzun","No problem.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo from CLSA. Your line is open.","Mike Mayo","Hi, what was the tipping point for this branch reduction, 105 branches over the next 12 months? I\u2019m not saying it doesn\u2019t make sense - it just seems, why now?","Tayfun Tuzun","Look Mike, I think we discussed with you as well as with the broader investor community that we have been aggressively taking actions in our branch network to adapt to new technologies. We\u2019ve been observing what\u2019s been happening in the underlying demographics and usage patterns.","And this is just basically an accumulation of those trends over the last number of quarters. And we had, we analyzed this second quarter of last year. And this quarter was a good time to take another look. Because as you know, technology is moving very fast, there are opportunities. And we hadn\u2019t made significant changes in our branch network over the past number of years.","So, this was the right time to do it. We felt comfortable with what was available to us. And we have a better look into the future as to how our customers are utilizing our branches to them than we did before.","Mike Mayo","And then just one other question, Fifth Third has had two CEOs for the last 25 years. Kevin, you\u2019ve been there for a while. And I guess, Greg, you take over late this year. So can you give us some color as to why the CEO-change? I think it was a little bit of a surprise.","Clearly it wasn\u2019t due to an earnings shortfall or anything. But what was the motivation behind the CEO change? What was the Board\u2019s thinking? And Greg, how might, how is your style perhaps a little bit different than Kevin\u2019s?","Kevin Kabat","Hi Mike, let me start, give you my perspective. We try to be as transparent as possible relative to orientation. But as you know, when I was working with the board relative to looking at kind of CEO transition and particularly in terms of looking at about a decade of timeframe it\u2019s not the, as I told, the board it\u2019s not the years, it\u2019s the miles.","And so, from my perspective, given that the bank is in really good shape, whether you look at the balance sheet as you just mentioned our earnings. And then as you also look at in terms of the succession and the talent that we have internally from that perspective, it really to me ties together very well for a very normal, very thoughtful transition for a Fortune 500 company. And I think I\u2019m really comfortable, I think the board was really comfortable in our approach.","And in the perspective that we put together as you said, long-serving CEOs and our expectation is that Greg will do that same as we go forward from that standpoint.","And the other thing I would mention is, Greg has been, as I highlighted, Greg\u2019s been Chief Operating Officer since \u201806, he\u2019s been President and Chief Operating Officer since \u201812, so he has a long history. He understands the culture he understands both the challenges and the opportunities.","And he\u2019ll get a chance in the coming months to really kind of layout his thoughts and his perspective in terms of where Fifth Third will be going from that standpoint. And I think you\u2019ll be pleased with what he brings to the table from that standpoint. So, I don\u2019t know Greg, if you wanted to add anything.","Greg Carmichael","Thanks, Kevin. First-off, Kevin and I have a great relationship. As Kevin mentioned, I\u2019ve been the COO since 2006 and President since 2012, it\u2019s been a great partnership. And this has been a very thoughtful transition. We\u2019ve worked hard to get this right. We\u2019ll work hard to continue to get it right going forward.","Leadership style, Mike, what I can tell you about myself and what you could expect from me is a couple of things. One is, I believe in clarity, making sure organization has crystal clarity as to our mission of objectives, we\u2019re trying to accomplish as an organization. Being very transparent about where we stand, what need to get accomplished.","Being very, very proactive and decisive on moving forward and making sure we hold the organization accountable for our overall mission of objective to serve our customers. So that\u2019s my style, I\u2019ll continue that going forward in the organization.","I look forward to once again focus on how we can leverage my background on my experience prior to Fifth Third. And when I first came into Fifth Third in the technology, we\u2019re living a technology evolution. And all was changing. And my experience in that sector and the pace of playing that sector will continue to be an opportunity for us to get it right. So I\u2019m looking forward to the opportunity.","Tayfun Tuzun","I think Mike, the bottom line is we would hope, the board, myself, Greg, the leadership team here would hope that the streak and you all see that we\u2019re going to continue the momentum that we\u2019ve talked about, we\u2019re going to continue the effective approach to rapidly changing and challenging environment. And I think you can expect the whole as accountable to that standard now and in the future with Greg, so.","Greg Carmichael","And the only thing I would add Mike is we got great leadership in this organization with the moves we recently made. Made and we look at the market, and the talent we have in our markets, we\u2019ve got great people running our markets, we\u2019ve got great leaders running our lines of businesses. And I\u2019m very proud of the performance of this organization. As Tayfun said, as Kevin just said, we\u2019re in a very solid position right now with a lot of upside opportunities going forward.","Mike Mayo","Thank you.","Kevin Kabat","Thank you, Mike.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Mutascio from KBW. Your line is open.","Chris Mutascio","Good morning, thanks for taking my question.","Kevin Kabat","Good morning, Chris.","Chris Mutascio","Tayfun, I just had a quick question for you if you can help me out. On slide 14 you go through your interest rate risk management and how you\u2019re positioned today. And I looked at a couple of things of those. And for example, the investment securities portfolio duration is now what, 4.9 years. I looked back last presentation and it was 4.3 years. That makes sense because you\u2019re I guess with the investment securities purchases.","The short-term wholesale funding is now 3.5% to 4% of total funding it was only 1.5% at last quarter. And securities, hasn\u2019t moved a great deal because most of the building of the portfolio was first quarter but securities as a percent of assets is now over 20%, it was just over 19% last quarter. So it would seem to me looking at some of those characteristics your asset sensitivity would have been reduced a fair amount.","But when I compare some of the numbers on this quarter\u2019s the estimated sensitivities and those tables when I compare them this quarter to last year, there really isn\u2019t a lot of movement. Somewhat downward, but so can you kind of reconcile the buildup of the securities portfolio, the duration extension and yet not really deteriorating much of your asset sensitivity going forward?","Jamie Leonard","Yes, it\u2019s Jamie. The biggest portion of the answer to your question is, if you look back another presentation prior and you look at year-end, we\u2019re actually the duration of the portfolio was 5 years.","Chris Mutascio","Okay.","Jamie Leonard","So, what happened is, rate rallied in the first quarter which drove the portfolio duration to shorten and then rates have sold off in the second quarter. So, we\u2019ve not really changed the mix or composition of the portfolio. It\u2019s merely a function of the rates that are impacting the disclosed duration.","But then when you look, what we\u2019ve added in the portfolio both in the first quarter growth and then the second quarter activity, you really see that driving the change in the EVE where we did decline from a minus 3.8% down to minus 4.6%. But in terms of the disclosed asset sensitivity, you can see the biggest drivers of your rate risk are the beta, the pricing lags and then the DDA disintermediation and we\u2019ve not changed those assumptions.","The only change that occurred to our interest rate risk update was we did an annual deposit live attrition study. And that resulted in a small increase in average deposit life of 0.2 years. And that\u2019s driven by the continued success from our deposit simplification program and our ability to service our customers. And we\u2019re seeing less attrition in our deposit base. So really there were no large changes in our rate risk assumptions.","Tayfun Tuzun","Chris, I mean, your question is precisely the reason why we have this slide in our presentation because we wanted to make sure that we were very transparent in terms of the numbers, in terms of the assumptions that support those numbers. We keep seeing references to historical data ranges from our peers. And we were hoping for this discussion to be based more on factual data which we are intending to do.","Your reference to the short-term wholesale funding it\u2019s [indiscernible] it\u2019s not sort of a meaningful change in terms of the overall trends which clearly will rely on core funding.","Chris Mutascio","I appreciate it and I do, the disclosure is fantastic relative to what I see from others, so I do appreciate that.","Kevin Kabat","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","John Pancari","Good morning.","Kevin Kabat","Hi, John.","John Pancari","Hi, just one question really on the credit side. On the Shared National Credit book on slide 16, I know you indicate that the size of the book is $25 billion, so that\u2019s about 27% of loans now. What was the size of the book about a year ago? What are the businesses that are really driving that growth? Is there any specific one that is really driving the growth of that book? And then also what is the, do you have the average yield of that portfolio by chance just to get an idea of where these types of loans are coming in at?","Frank Forrest","Hi, this is Frank, let me take it. To begin with, we\u2019re looking on the yield question for you. The books up from about 39% to 44% over the past year as it relates to the Shared National Credit exam. Again, we have a large corporate book and that\u2019s predominantly what this is, mid-Corp and large corporate, very high risk rated overall book, the overall risk profile is strong.","And as I\u2019ve said before, when you think about the SNC exam, and you think about this portfolio, we underwrite everyone into our own account. So it doesn\u2019t matter whether we participate in the syndication, we lead the syndication or we do a standalone one-off to a corporate. We structured, we underwrite to our own account, to our own risk appetite into our own standards which we believe are high.","So, relative to whether it\u2019s 39% or 44%, I don\u2019t necessarily think it\u2019s that meaningful because again we underwrite to our own account and this is a portfolio that\u2019s performed very well. And our portfolio performed very well in the most recent SNC exam.","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes, the SNC portfolio John, as Frank mentioned, with respect to all the variables, credit variables is actually a better portfolio than our overall commercial portfolio. So, I will get you, but I don\u2019t have the yield specific to the SNC portfolio but in one of our presentations we can share that with you.","John Pancari","Okay, all right. And then my second thing is on that same topic actually, but how much of that portfolio are you lead on? And then lastly, I know you indicated you didn\u2019t have any issues in the SNC exam from it, is there, the risk of any lingering impact like next quarter for any of the stuff that you were not agent on or not lead agent on?","Kevin Kabat","I\u2019ll answer the first part then I\u2019ll turn it over to Frank. The agent portion of that portfolio is about 6% to 7%, so it\u2019s a small percentage of that total. Frank?","Frank Forrest","Again, the only piece of that that could be lingering as we talked about likely be in the energy sector. But the energy book for us is 2% of the SNC book, I mean it\u2019s small. So, it\u2019s a small piece of the overall pie. And again, we\u2019ve booked all of the results from the SNC exam, all the ratings, adjustments, were all in the second quarter. So, we don\u2019t expect any material changes going forward from that exam.","John Pancari","Okay, great. All right, thank you.","Frank Forrest","Thank you.","Kevin Kabat","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Eads from UBS. Your line is open.","David Eads","Hello, maybe just one for me. Can you guys talk a little bit about what you are seeing when it comes to deposit pricing? It seems like some people are starting to get a little bit more aggressive there and I\u2019m just curious if you are seeing much in your footprint.","Kevin Kabat","Yes. Well, we\u2019ve discussed over the past couple of earnings calls is we felt there were some opportunities to rationalize deposit pricing especially in light of the LCR. So, our focus has been on reducing deposit rates especially in those buckets that are less LCR friendly.","And you see that in our results this quarter on the NIM as Tayfun talked about the benefit from over-funding actions was roughly 3 basis points. And that should stabilize us as we head into what potentially is a rising rate environment at the end of this year. So, I think we\u2019ve accomplished what we wanted to accomplish and you can expect that to be fairly stable going forward until the Fed begins to take action.","David Eads","Great, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller from FBR. Your line is open.","Kevin Kabat","Hi, Paul.","Thomas LeTrent","Hi, good morning, is actually Thomas LeTrent on behalf of Paul. Most have been asked and answered, but a quick question on prepayment speeds. We have heard from a few regional peers that prepayment speeds in some of their portfolios were a little elevated in second quarter. Did you guys see any elevated TDRs on any of your books or in resi or term CRE specifically?","Kevin Kabat","Are you referring broadly for the entire loan book or?","Thomas LeTrent","Yes, broadly the whole portfolio, were there any books that saw high prepayment speeds?","Tayfun Tuzun","The resi stuff clearly, the second quarter was impacted by all the refi activity that took place in the first quarter which then shows up in our MSR amortization lines. The investment portfolio really was nothing beyond our expectations, just reflective of the market trends.","As I mentioned, the commercial book showed little bit elevated pay-off levels but when we sort of looked at the details of those pay-offs, they appear to be more event related rather than refi related. There was some activity in the commercial construction book. There was some prepayment ahead of the project finalization dates. This quarter more than last quarters, nothing sort of outside a reasonable range. So that\u2019s my color on prepay activity.","Thomas LeTrent","Okay. And one quick question on expenses. I believe you mentioned something about lease termination expenses. That\u2019s an additional line, that is it additional expense that was not included in this quarter\u2019s impairment charge, correct? That could come over the next 6 to 12 months?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes, exactly. Yes, that specifically related to those branches that we are going to consolidate where we have a lease rather than owning the property. And that\u2019s going to flow through our expenses over the next couple of quarters.","Thomas LeTrent","And you did not size that correctly?","Tayfun Tuzun","Well, we sized it in our 8-K, we said it\u2019s going to be between $6 million to $10 million. But I did not include that, I exclusively stated that my expense guidance of 2.5% does not include that number.","Thomas LeTrent","Okay, perfect. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby from Vining Sparks. Your line is open.","Kevin Kabat","Hi Marty.","Marty Mosby","Hi, thanks. Tayfun, I wanted to ask you a little bit about the growth that you\u2019ve done in the securities portfolio and your choice to almost 100% utilize available-for-sale versus held to maturity. I think this quarter you actually had some negative impact on your tangible book value as OCI came in a little bit. I was just curious what your strategy or tactic is there?","Jamie Leonard","Yes, this is Jamie. The strategy on the available for sale is really just to maintain flexibility as we manage interest rate risk and see opportunities in the market. I know a lot of our peers have used HTM but given that our asset size were below $250 billion, we did elect AOCI opt-out, so that use of the AFS and the resulting marks don\u2019t impact our capital ratios.","Yes, there will be an impact on some of the screens that you all use on tangible book. But we\u2019d also hope you just would fair-value the HTM portfolios from peers as well when screening across that metric.","Marty Mosby","And would you consider. Yes, go ahead, I\u2019m sorry.","Tayfun Tuzun","The flexibility of managing an AFS book outweighs the benefits of not marking a healthy maturity book, so that\u2019s been our long subscribe philosophy here.","Marty Mosby","And what I was trying to add to that was given the excess capital that you have, would you think about having that flexibility so when rates start to move up you can utilize that excess capital in a short-term loss that gets recaptured very quickly, but yet improves your earnings pretty rapidly because you can continue to kind of churn the portfolio up as rates move higher? Have you kind of thought about that?","Tayfun Tuzun","I mean, that clearly is a reasonable statement. We\u2019ll see how the environment moves. But that type of flexibility is what we value.","Marty Mosby","And then just lastly, if you looked at the mortgage kind of detail back in the appendix, it looks like maybe with the gain you had in the servicing side you actually, looks like you held more mortgage originations versus securitizing. I didn\u2019t know if you were kind of substituting origination for servicing income and creating some longer-term impact with having more in the portfolio versus securitizing this particular quarter?","Kevin Kabat","Yes, a couple of comments on that one. One on MSR, we\u2019ve been actually, when you look at our MSR management over the last three, four years, we have a very comprehensive approach to how we manage our MSR position with respect to production trends, interest rate environment and also the up and down trends in our servicing book, so the decision when and how much to portfolio or what portion of our mortgage production to portfolio really depends on environmental factors.","We did have in the first couple of quarters a little bit more elevated balance sheet positions in mortgage production but that does not necessarily indicate what we will do going forward. That\u2019s really a quarter-to-quarter determination in terms of where we see pricing in the market, what our portfolio characteristics look like. Right now we\u2019re just holding the arm portion of our originations, we\u2019re not holding on to, on the conforming side, we\u2019re not holding on to longer-term fixed rate mortgages.","We\u2019ve always portfolio, the jumbo production because that just is more of a relationship business. But in general, the mortgage servicing asset risk management is a very comprehensive approach. And whether what we balance sheet from production is a little bit separate than that.","Marty Mosby","Understood. It just seems like there was an incremental leg up this particular quarter. So I was just curious about that. Thanks.","Kevin Kabat","Quarter yes, you are correct. Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Elliott","Hello there, good morning.","Kevin Kabat","Good morning.","Geoffrey Elliott","I\u2019ve got a question on Vantiv. Can you give an update on your thinking about the stake there given that it\u2019s now been over a year since you last sold some shares and the Vantiv share price has clearly moved up quite a lot over that time period?","Kevin Kabat","Our long-stated strategic approach to our Vantiv ownership is that over the long-term we will not remain a majority or a large owner of Vantiv. And that decision really we look at it on a quarterly basis, we look at where we are, we look at where the stock price. It\u2019s a barely complex ownership structure as we have the warrant position as well as the CRA as well as the direct ownership.","So, at this time, our position has not changed, we still intend to reduce our ownership. But we want to make sure that we execute that in the best interest of our shareholders. And we will continue to monitor that situation.","Geoffrey Elliott","And would that selling another slug of shares here, would that mean you have to deconsolidate the lost fee stream? Is that part of the thinking behind not selling over the last year or so?","Tayfun Tuzun","No, I mean, we own currently nearly 23% of the company directly. So, we are not close to having that concern. And there is really no bright line as we have board memberships as we have the warrant position and a significant operating partnership with the company. So, that\u2019s not the reason why we currently are still holding 23% of the shares.","Geoffrey Elliott","Great, thank you very much.","Tayfun Tuzun","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Sameer Gokhale from Janney Montgomery. Your line is open.","Sameer Gokhale","Hi, good morning.","Kevin Kabat","Good morning.","Sameer Gokhale","Firstly, Greg, I\u2019d like to congratulate you on your new appointment and, Kevin, I was surprised by the announcement that you were retiring because 59 is now the new 49, but best of luck to you on that as well.","Kevin Kabat","Thank you.","Sameer Gokhale","We covered quite a few of the questions I was going to ask, but just a couple of them just to flesh them out a little further. The first one was really for Greg. In your role as COO one would assume that perhaps you were more internally focused into the operations of the company. But now as the CEO I think the expectation would be that you might need to be more outwardly focused.","So as you\u2019ve taken on or will be fully officially taking on this responsibility later this year, what would you say are your top three priorities looking outwardly, mobile banking clearly is one of the things that have been focused on, but are there any other two or three things that at this point you have communicated to the Board or are ready to share with us?","Greg Carmichael","First off, thanks for the question. And I have been focused on the organization obviously as Chief Operating Officer and President, spent a lot of time in the market, a lot of time with our businesses. So, one of the first things I want to do is make sure I touch base with all key constituents, our stakeholders out there, shareholders, key customers, employees and maintain their focus on our market.","In addition to that, we\u2019re going to continue to look for ways to take advantage of some of the dynamic changes that occur in our industries such as our investments and technologies accelerate our pace of change with respect to how we serve our customers and efficiencies.","And also continue to look at our businesses making sure we\u2019re aligned and we\u2019re in the right businesses to get the right focus on those businesses, we have the right parties in place, we have enough resources decked against those opportunities. You can expect I\u2019ll continue to focus on that and make sure that we\u2019re aligned to capitalize on the market opportunities.","Kevin Kabat","Sameer, I\u2019m also trying to get him to pay attention to retirees because I\u2019ll still be a significant shareholder and more aligned with you than ever, so.","Greg Carmichael","I told him, my plate is full.","Sameer Gokhale","Terrific. Well, and then the other question I had was actually in terms of your appetite for M&A, I mean this ties into some of maybe your strategic actions you might look at over the next two years or three years. As you look at the portfolio of businesses you have today and the loan types, and one of the things I want to hone on is, or zone in on, is commercial and industrial loans. It\u2019s a pretty broad-based asset category, many subcategories in there. Are there any specific areas that maybe you have earmarked as being of interest from an A standpoint and things you might want to acquire?","Greg Carmichael","Yes. First off, we don\u2019t typically comment on M&A activity Sameer, but I will state this. Anytime there was an opportunity to create value for our shareholders over a long-term horizon, we\u2019re going to look at that very closely. And we\u2019re not going to do a deal, just to do a deal, in order to do something as positive in a short term that doesn\u2019t create long-term shareholder value.","So, I think as we look at those opportunities in our business or a geography, we\u2019ll always be mindful of, does it create value for our shareholders and net-net, our ability to be able to execute. And we\u2019ll execute those opportunities at the end of the day when the time is right and when those opportunities emerge.","Kevin Kabat","And Sameer, we\u2019ve been very successful inorganically actually starting and growing sub-businesses inside the commercial corporate banking area. So that success gives us confidence that if we were to venture into a new area that we could actually do it with the right talent.","And in this environment it almost is better to do that as the regulatory environment is very difficult for a non-bank to operate inside a bank. So, our success so far gives us confidence that we can do it internally if there are opportunities outside, we don\u2019t mind looking at them but we\u2019ll have to evaluate them as they come along.","Sameer Gokhale","Okay, that\u2019s great. Thank you very much.","Kevin Kabat","Thank you, Sameer.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Matt Burnell from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Matt Burnell","Great, thanks for taking my question. First of all maybe Greg, a question for you, just following-up on the immediately prior question. We\u2019ve been hearing for some time that increasing regulation has been a bigger challenge for smaller - much smaller banks than Fifth Third. I guess I\u2019m curious within the context of your comments about you would be willing to consider longer-term accretive acquisitions, are you seeing a greater flow of those type of opportunities over the last 6 to 12 months than you saw maybe 2 to 3 years ago or has that stream been pretty steady?","Greg Carmichael","No Matt, we really haven\u2019t seen anything of significance or opportunities that we think that fit inside our wheelhouse. So not so significant and Tayfun, do you want to add anything to that?","Tayfun Tuzun","No, Matt, I think as you know today when you look at M&A opportunities, you don\u2019t only look at the next 10 years of that optimization but you look at the past 10 years. And the really attractive opportunities are few and far between and so, nothing really to report on that that commencement.","Matt Burnell","Fair enough. And, Tayfun, maybe just a follow-up for you, and I appreciate this might be a little bit sensitive. But in terms of the branch reductions, in terms of the full-time equivalent employees, those are down about over - on a year-over-year basis about the same rate as the banking centers. And given all the investment that you\u2019re making in technology should there be an outsized reduction potentially in staffing levels within the branches given all the investment that you are clearly making in terms of delivering digital products to your customers? A number of other banks have been talking about that as an intermediate to longer-term benefit.","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes, so, by definition this branch action will clearly impact the overall employment levels in our retail business. But it\u2019s been now, I think it\u2019s a good sort of two and half years since we have reduced our FTE counts in our branches. And that continued even into this quarter.","I suspect that as we sort of continue to grow technology inside of our branches and reconfigure, redesign our existing branches that trend will continue. But on the other hand, I have to tell you that revenue growth continues to be of utmost importance in our retail business.

My name is Joana and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bank's Q2 2016 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].","Thank you. Sameer Gokhale, you may begin your conference.","Sameer Shripad Gokhale","Thank you, Joana. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Today, we'll be discussing our financial results for the second quarter of 2016. This discussion may contain certain forward-looking statements about Fifth Third pertaining to our financial condition, results of operations, plans, and objectives. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from historical performance and these statements.","We've identified some of these factors in our forward-looking cautionary statement at the end of our earnings release and in other materials, and we encourage you to review them. Fifth Third undertakes no obligation and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call.","This morning, I'm joined on the call by our CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Chief Operating Officer, Lars Anderson; Chief Risk Officer, Frank Forrest; and Treasurer, Jamie Leonard.","Following prepared remarks by Greg and Tayfun, we will open the call up to questions. Let me turn the call over now to Greg for his comments.","Greg Carmichael","Thanks, Sameer, and thanks all of you for joining us this morning. As you can see on Page 3 of the presentation, we reported second quarter net income to common shareholders of $310 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.40. Some offsetting non-core items resulted in $0.01 negative impact to earnings per share in the quarter.","Since I became CEO in November of 2015, I have reaffirmed the bank's key strategic priorities. These include growing fee revenue, streamlining processes to reduce expenses, and improving our customer experience, and investing for the future in order to deliver strong results through business cycles. I believe we have the right strategies in place, our second quarter financial results reflect the progress we are making towards those goals.","Our Q2 results were solid especially considering the market volatility we experienced during the quarter. In addition, we were very pleased with the credit results. Fee income levels including corporate banking fees were also strong. As you know, we have been building out our capital markets capabilities for the last few years. We recently hired a team to further expand our M&A and strategic advisory services. Our investments are paying off as we continue to gain market share with our expanded set of differentiated products and services. Also our mortgage volume of $2.7 billion was up 53% sequentially. This represent the highest level since the third quarter of 2013.","Net interest income was relatively stable in Q2 which was in line with our expectations and guidance and our results reflect growth in commercial loans of 2% and 1% growth in security balances along with disciplined loan pricing in targeted relationship management. Origination yields in our auto loan business improved compared to Q1 reflecting our decision to originate loans more expectedly in that business. Also as we had mentioned previously, we have been managing deposit rates tightly and we expect that to continue in this environment. We have planned on managing through the extended period of low interest rates with the follow-up from Brexit we are even more confident that that was the right approach.","We have been very deliberate about growing fee revenue in order to mitigate the impact of lower interest rates. We have continued to maintain a steady and cautious strategy with respect to rate risk. Given our focus on outperformers in the cycle, we are better positioned to address market volatility and economic uncertainty at any point to bank's recent history.","We remain focused on executing our strategies and continue to make significant progress. We recently closed on the sale to branches in Pennsylvania which resulted in $11 million pre-tax gain. As the consumer landscape evolves, we will continue to look for more opportunities to optimize our branch network. We are also making investments to enhance our digital and operational capabilities. For example, we recently hired Melissa Stevens as our Chief Digital Officer and Head of Omni-channel Banking and Steve D'Amico as Head of Innovation.","Our investments in digital channel are paying off. In the second quarter approximately 20% of consumer deposits were made via our mobile app compared to 60% a year ago. In general, we have seen a 20% increase in mobile usage year-over-year. We also saw a 135% increase in year-over-year in checking and savings accounts opened online. We expect our investments to drive higher digital adoption and create a more integrated customer experience.","Also in the quarter, we sold a small non-strategic agented credit card portfolio at a 12% premium. This allows us to continue focus our energies on our core credit card business.","As you may have seen, we recently signed an agreement with a third- party to help consolidate our residential mortgage loan systems under one platform. This initiative will help streamline our mortgage processes and operations and improve customer closure times and significantly improve the overall customer experience. As we previously disclosed, we expect this investment to generate a full run rate benefit of $12 million annually.","The strategic initiatives we shared with you in April are on track. We are actually implementing them in a more cost effective manner than we had initially projected. As a result of our strong execution and focus on expense management, we now expect year-over-year expense growth of 4% in 2016 compared to our guidance of 4.5% to 5% at the start of this year.","Over time, as we realize the benefits of implementing these initiatives, we would expect annual expense growth to be well below 4%. The continued execution of our key initiatives will also support our longer range targets including a 12% to 14% core ROTCE ratio and a 1.1% to 1.3% ROA ratio.","Finally, we recently entered into a couple of significant transactions with Vantiv. First we extend our process agreement with Vantiv through 2024. This agreement was previously set to expire in June of 2019. We are pleased with our new agreement as it would generate a meaningful level of revenue benefits and cost savings from the second half of 2016 onward.","In addition, we entered into another agreement with Vantiv related to our roughly $800 million of existing TRA cash flows. We terminated and settled certain cash flows totaling $331 million over 18 years for an upfront payment of $116 million. We also have the option to terminate and settle another $394 million of future cash flows at pre-specified amounts through the end of 2018. I am pleased that we have reached this agreement that reduces future risk and enables us to monetize and redeploy that capital.","Tayfun will provide further detail in his commentary. We have discussed our efforts to reduce our risk exposures as a necessary aspect of delivering consistent returns through the cycle.","As of June 30, our exposure to companies in the UK and other European countries represent less than 2% of our total loans. It consisted mostly of exposure to large global businesses that are well diversified. Leading up to the Brexit vote, we engaged with our clients to assess any potential impact on our business. As a result, we reduced our direct exposure in advance to the vote. Therefore we believe our exposure to any fall from Brexit should be limited.","In terms of our exposure to the energy sector, we continue to believe that our risk is well contained. Oil prices in Q2 increased relative to Q1 and our energy NPLs remain essentially flat. We are comfortable with our credit loss exposure in this portfolio.","We also know there has been an increased concern about growth in commercial real estate loans. As we have mentioned on prior calls, we had a lower mix of CRE relative to peers. Additionally our growth in absolute dollars is lower compared to many of our peers. Our disciplined client selection in centralized loan underwriting process is designed to ensure that we have a consistent and conservative approach to making CRE loans.","Moving on to capital, I'm very pleased that the Federal Reserve did not object for our 2016 CCAR plan. The 2016 plan allows us to invest realized gains from Vantiv share sales and realized gains from the monetization of the Vantiv TRA into share repurchases. We believe the economics of doing so are favorable. We will continue to be able to use the cash proceeds with share repurchases. The CCAR plan demonstrates our ability to generate and return a significant amount of capital to our shareholders. Additionally, it demonstrates our ability to withstand severely stressful economical conditions for remaining well capitalized. Our capital levels remain strong. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio reached 9.94% an improvement from 9.81% at the end of the first quarter.","With that, I will turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our second quarter operating results and our current outlook.","Tayfun Tuzun","Thanks, Greg. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Let's start with the financials summary on page four of the presentation. Overall we are pleased with our core results despite the challenging environment. Our corporate banking revenues were solid and mortgage originations have outpaced peers as well as the overall industry in the second quarter. We are deploying capital in businesses where return targets meet our long-term goals and are making good progress in executing on our strategic plans.","As we shared with you previously, these projects were carefully vetted to minimize reliance on an improved economic environment. Operating leverage is the top priority with a strong emphasis on sustainable expense control without weakening our businesses strength and growing revenues.","For the second quarter, there was a net negative impact of $0.01 per share resulting from several items. The most significant item was a charge related to the valuation of the Visa total return swap which was due to the rejection of the merchant litigation settlement.","So with that let's move to Page 5 for the balance sheet discussion. Average commercial loan balances increased 2% sequentially and about 4% year-over-year. We achieved this growth with stabilizing spreads while repositioning the balance sheet for better risk adjusted returns. C&I loans contributed nearly 80% of the total sequential growth and average commercial balances.","CRE growth of $199 million made up the majority of the remaining quarterly balance increase. Our CRE portfolio as a percentage of total commercial loans is one of the lowest among our regional peers. In construction, as well as in term lending, our teams are cognizant of valuations and supply demand dynamics created by the lack of attractive investment alternatives.","As Greg mentioned, our disciplined client selection and credit underwriting in CRE will continue to rely on stringent standards. Average consumer loans were down 1% from last quarter and down 1% year-over-year. Residential mortgage loans grew by 2% sequentially and 9% year-over-year as we kept Jumbo mortgages and ARMs on our balance sheet during the quarter. Our residential mortgage originations were up 53% from last quarter and 7% year-over-year. During the quarter, 54% of our originations consisted of purchase volumes.","Indirect auto loans were down 4% from last quarter and 9% year-over-year in line with our lower origination targets and focus on improving risk adjusted returns in this business. The profile of our second quarter production was consistent with the first quarter.","Our home equity loan portfolio decreased 2% sequentially and 7% year-over-year as loan paid outs continue to exceed originations.","Average investment securities increased by $390 million in the second quarter or 1% sequentially. Average core deposits increased $258 million from the first quarter. This increase was driven by seasonally higher demand deposit in money market account balances partially offset by lower interest checking balances.","Average core deposit balances were negatively impacted by approximately $201 million due to the previously disclosed sale of branches in Pennsylvania and $219 million due to the full quarter impact of the sale of branches in St. Louis last quarter. Excluding these deposits sold in the branch transactions over the last two quarters, average core deposits were up 1% on a sequential basis. Our liquidity coverage ratio was very strong at 110% at the end of the quarter.","Moving to NII on Page 6 of the presentation. Taxable equivalent net interest income decreased by $1 million sequentially to $908 million. The decrease was primarily driven by the full quarter impact of $1.5 billion of unsecured debt issued in the first quarter of 2016 and from lower auto and home equity loan balances. The decrease was partially offset by growth in commercial loans and securities.","The NIM decreased three basis points to 2.88% quarter-over-quarter driven by the full quarter impact of the debt issuance in the first quarter. We had previously guided to a decrease of three to four basis points in the net interest margin in the second quarter and guided to relative stability of those levels in the latter half of the year assuming a June Fed rate increase which did not occur. With no Fed moves during the remainder of the year, we now expect a two to four basis point NIM contraction in the third quarter which includes the full quarter impact of our second quarter debt issuance as well as one basis point impact due to day count.","We will continue to execute a balanced interest rate risk management strategy as we have over the last three years. We will be able to mitigate some of the negative impact of the flatter yield curve with lockout cash flow in both securities that now constitute approximately 50% of our investment portfolio. Despite the NIM contraction, we are forecasting a stable NII for the second half of the year. For the full year, our balanced management approach will enable us to grow NII 2% despite the ongoing challenges with the low rate environment.","Shifting to fees, on Page 7 of the presentation. Second quarter non-interest income was $599 million compared with $637 million in the first quarter. Our fee income adjusted for items I had previously mentioned was $602 million, an increase of $24 million or 4% sequentially. Despite challenging market conditions our results were strong. Corporate banking fees up $117 million were up $15 million or 15% sequentially reflecting increases in loan syndication revenue and institutional sales revenue.","The growth in corporate revenues is indicative of the scope and scale of our product offerings and relationship driven target operating model that we are executing.","Mortgage originations were $2.7 billion in the second quarter with 54% of the mix consisting of purchase volumes. About 75% of the originations came from the retail and direct channels and the remainder from the corresponding channel. Gains on sale were up 29% quarter-over-quarter with robust origination volume as the gain on sale margins was down 85 basis points.","Mortgage banking net revenue of $75 million was down $3 million sequentially primarily due to servicing asset amortization as a result of higher refis in the servicing portfolio. The net servicing asset valuation adjustments were negative $29 million compared to negative $16 million last quarter.","Deposit service charges increased 1% from the first quarter reflecting seasonal trends in consumer deposit fees and decreased 1% relative to the second quarter of 2015.","Total wealth and asset management revenue of $101 million decreased 1% sequentially reflecting seasonally lower trust tax preparation fees from the first quarter.","As you may recall, our prior guidance calls for 4% to 5% annual fee growth over reported 2015 fees excluding the impacts from Vantiv share sales and warrant valuation adjustments which was approximately $2.3 billion. Excluding Vantiv related items and the Visa total return swap adjustment this quarter and any other potential Vantiv related gains we expect to grow our fees 5% as a result of a strong first half and the expectation of continued strength during the next two quarters.","Next I would like to discuss non-interest expense in page 8 of the presentation. Expenses of $983 million were $3 million lower than in the first quarter reflecting a seasonal decrease in FICA and unemployment expense, partially offset by a $9 million expense due to retirement eligibility changes. First quarter's results were also impacted by a $14 million expense related to the voluntary early retirement program.","As Greg said earlier, we are making good progress in executing on key strategic initiatives and managing our expenses. We now expect expenses to grow at 4% level slightly below our April guidance. This guidance includes the impact of the higher FDIC assessment.","I also would like to remind you that our guidance includes the impact of the increased amortization of our low income housing investments which most of our peers reflect in their tax line, the increase in the provision for unfunded commitments, and the impact of one-time benefits related to the settlement of legal cases in 2015. These three items make up roughly 2% of the forecasted 4% increase in expenses.","As I mentioned earlier, operating leverage is our top priority going into 2017. Although we are taking a cautious approach to maintain our franchises strength in growing revenues, there are a number of identified areas that we are focusing on that I would like to review with you. We plan to engage third parties in some areas to optimize our savings.","The first is the end to end commercial loan origination, underwriting, and servicing process. This is a natural area of attention given the size of our commercial business. In addition to cost efficiencies, we also believe that our work here will have significant positive impact on client service quality.","Similarly we are looking at opportunities in central operations. With new senior management in place, we have identified consolidation opportunities in our facilities and believe that we will be able to extract more savings going forward.","This morning we announced a 5.5 year extension to our operating agreement with Vantiv. The new agreement will reflect reduced expenses for Fifth Third and enhance revenue opportunities that both companies enjoy in this mutually beneficial partnership. We will continue to look for opportunities across the board in all of our vendor relationships. We also believe that our significant offshore presence will continue to be a source of savings in all of our business operations including our risk and compliance areas.","The long-term performance targets that Greg reviewed require a focus and disciplined approach to expense management and we are confident we can execute.","Turning to credit results on Slide 9. Net charge-offs were $87 million or 37 basis points in the second quarter compared to $96 million and 42 basis points in the first quarter of 2016 and $86 million and 37 basis points in the second quarter a year ago. The sequential decrease was primarily due to a $7 million decline in C&I net charge-offs. Of the total net charge-offs less than $2 million were in energy.","Non-performing loans excluding loans held-for-sale were $693 million down $8 million from the previous quarter resulting in an NPL ratio of 74 basis points.","Overall credit metrics remain strong. While there may be volatility in credit metrics periodically, our portfolio is performing in line with our expectations. Our provision was $4 million higher than total charge-offs and our reserve coverage as a percent of loans and leases was unchanged at 1.38%. Relative to our peer group, our NPA net charge-off and reserve ratios compare favorably.","Our previous guidance that net charge-offs would be range bound with some quarterly variability's unchanged. Also we continue to believe that our provision expense will be primarily reflective of loan growth.","On Slide 10, given the recent events overseas we have provided a breakdown of our UK and European exposure. As Greg already mentioned in his earlier remarks, our second quarter UK exposure is minimal at less than 2% of total loans. We do not anticipate any significant issues from our portfolio which is diversified and consist primarily of loans to large corporate customers.","Moving on to capital on Slide 11, our capital levels remain strong. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 9.9%, an increase of 52 basis points year-over-year. At the end of the second quarter, common shares outstanding were down approximately 4 million. During the quarter, we executed open market share repurchases of $26 million which reduced the share count by 1.44 million shares. This completed our previous CCAR repurchase activity.","On Slide 12, as Greg mentioned earlier, we recently entered into another agreement with Vantiv related to a roughly $800 million of expected TRA cash flows. This transaction mitigates future risk related to these cash flows and enables us to reinvest the realized gains into share buybacks.","As we discussed with you many times in the past, our ability to realize these cash flows over to next 15 plus years, depends on factors such as U.S. corporate tax rate and Vantiv's taxable income levels.","With that in mind, at the end of last year, we terminated and settled a portion of these future cash flows and this week we executed another agreement for a termination and settlement of $331 million in cash flows for an upfront payment of $116 million. In addition, under a quarterly put call structure owned by Fifth Third and Vantiv respectively, we will have the ability to terminate and settle another $394 million of future cash flows for a total of $171 million payable to Fifth Third in 2017 and in 2018 in eight separate quarterly optional executions.","We have essentially locked in the ability to receive a minimum of approximately $15 million per quarter in 2017 and $26 million per quarter in 2018. This transaction will require an upfront asset booked on our balance sheet this quarter as it essentially removes the contingencies associated with these future cash flows.","I would like to remind you that we will also receive our annual normal payments this year and next year. These TRA flows are related to all share sales executed up to this point. There is roughly an additional $1 billion in future TRA flows related to future potential sales of our current ownership at the current Vantiv share price. We believe that our actions around the Vantiv relationship are in the best interest of our shareholders.","Relative to CCAR 2016, the Federal Reserve's review is complete and we received a non-objective to our capital plan. Our capital plan includes the ability to increase the quarterly common stock dividends to $0.14 in the fourth quarter of 2016, the repurchase of common shares an amount up to $660 million, and the ability to repurchase shares in the amount of any realized after-tax gains from the sale of Vantiv stocks. Additionally, this year, our capital plan now also includes the ability to repurchase shares in the amount of any realized after-tax gains from the termination of any portion of the Vantiv tax receivable agreement we just discussed.","We believe our results demonstrate the relative strength of both our capital positions and our internal capital generation capacity. We have included the overall outlook on Slide 13 for your reference and with that let me turn it over to Sameer to open the call up for Q&A.","Sameer Shripad Gokhale","Thanks, Tayfun. Before we start the Q&A as a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourselves to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. We will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have this morning. During the question-and-answer period, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator. Joana, please open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions].","Your first question comes from Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ken Zerbe","Just to be really clear on the TRA. So I get that you executed on the $116 million that seems to be a locked in gain. Just the way the pressure it reads about the additional what the $394 million, I guess you get $171 million coming in, I just want to make sure that is -- is that a locked in gain in third quarter such that if you go on Slide 12, you get $279 million gain in third quarter?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes, Ken. So these are basically put and call structures. We own a put option and Vantiv owns a call option on a quarterly basis on predetermined cash flows. And both of these options basically removes the contingent fee associated with the TRA cash flows and therefore we are required to book an upfront asset for the present value of these assets which will basically result in $163 million pre-tax gain in Q3.","So we will book an asset of $163 million on the pre-tax basis. And then we have basically the cash payment of $116 million that we will be receiving for the $331 million in gross cash flows, so that's the combination of the two.","Jamie Leonard","And Ken, this is Jamie. One nuance to the CCAR approval and Tayfun's reference to realized after-tax gains, when it comes to capital deployment of these gains the $116 million because it is recognizing and realized would result in our ability to deploy that capital on an after-tax basis in the $76 million or so range this quarter. And the reason we broke out Slide 12 the way we did was to show you that the capital deployment related to the recognition of the asset for the receivable, the $163 million would be deployable as those puts and calls are exercised and cash is exchanged in the quarterly installments you see in 2017 and 2018.","Ken Zerbe","Got it. So the right-hand chart basically so the left-hand chart as you book an asset of $163 million, the right-hand chart says as the cash comes in you don't recognize the gain, you simply isn't offsetting asset.","Jamie Leonard","Correct.","Ken Zerbe","So capital goes up and asset goes down.","Jamie Leonard","Correct.","Operator","The next question comes from David Eads with UBS. Your line is open.","David Eads","I wanted to talk about the NII outlook. It looks like there was on a ending -- end of period that basis there was a pretty big ramp up in securities. Was there anything unusual with that strategy there and I guess should that benefit the NII outlook in next quarter, was there anything unusual positioning on the securities there?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes, good question, one item related to the end of period balance sheet versus the average is that the end of period includes the unrealized gains and the average balances do not. So good news is we had a $1.335 billion unrealized gain in the portfolio that makes it looks like on an end of point basis we had added some leverage.","But to your question in terms of the outlook on the portfolio, the one assumption in our NII outlook is that given the low rate environment, the flatter curve, and the tight spreads, we don't expect to reinvest portfolio cash flows in the third quarter of roughly a $1 billion or so during the quarter so that you should expect on the securities portfolio that average balances would be stable to down slightly from second quarter to third quarter.","David Eads","All right, that's very helpful. Thanks a lot. And maybe you talked about the two to four basis points NIM pressure in 3Q, if we assume no rate hike just simplicity, should we expect more pressure on NIM going forward or what's the kind of headwinds around the loan, the debt issuances come through, can NIM be a little bit more stable from there?","Tayfun Tuzun","David, I think the NIM contraction looking forward, we gave you some guidance for Q3 and there may be a little bit more left in contraction if rates do not go up and obviously these comments depend on the shape of the yield curve. But over the long-term if we all see an environment like todays in the next year or two, our expectation is that our NIM will be fairly stable. I mean there may be some contraction from here but it's not going to be a continuous bleed out of the NIM. We expect that given our risk exposures and interest rate risk management approach we will be able to stabilizing them.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Greg Carmichael","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Usdin","Hey good morning. Guys just wanted to ask you a question on the fee outlook. So this quarter seems like you had the servicing hedge was a bit of a delta and you mentioned the good pipelines you have on mortgage. So I just wondered if you could help us understand this, the drivers of core income, its impact is just mostly related to kind of getting that back on the mortgage side or do you also continue to expect good growth in some of the core fee line items?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes so let me make a couple of comments on fee seasonality. Obviously given the rate movements, we do expect a good quarter in mortgage. I think our pipeline look strong at the end of the second quarter which should play well for the third quarter and also we had a very strong corporate fee performance in Q2. Typically we would see some weakness just general seasonal weakness in the summer, in corporate fees but we expect a healthy environment in Q4 and so good corporate growth in Q4 and we would expect the other fee lines in general to be stable.","So our expectation of a second half sort of strength in fee income relates to continued strength in mortgage here in the near-term and then good corporate strength as we approach the end of the year.","Ken Usdin","Okay, great. And if I could follow-up on the TRA comments, so the $163 million that is in asset, when you get the cash flows back next year, are you able to buyback the amount of the cash flows that are laid out on the right side of Page 12?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes but on an after-tax basis. So the TRA payments from Vantiv to Fifth Third will need to be tax affected for capital deployment.","Ken Usdin","Right. I just want to, I think there is some confusion so the $116 million you're very clear on that you can do right away, the $163 million --","Tayfun Tuzun","In the tune of $76 million, yes.","Ken Usdin","Right on after-tax basis. And then the $163 million comes through and the cash was received on the right side but on an after-tax basis you could then buy those back but only as they recognize along that schedule of 2017 and 2018?","Tayfun Tuzun","That is exactly right.","Ken Usdin","Okay. And you didn't sell any shares this quarter, so that still is an open-ended question to about what's the thought process behind when and your decision tree is behind incremental actual share sales?","Greg Carmichael","Ken, this is Greg. This discussion comes up quite a bit. We've been very, very disciplined on how we monetize our equity position at Vantiv. I would say we continue to look at what's the right thing for our shareholders. I want to continue to do that as we move forward in the remaining of this year. But we have been disciplined as rewarded our shareholders very well, it's something we always consider and we will continue to consider and evaluate as we move forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Miller with FBR & Company. Your line is open.","Tim Wood","Good morning.","Greg Carmichael","Good morning.","Tim Wood","Hey guys. This is Tim for Paul. Touching on the average loan growth outlook that 2% how does that stack up your expectations from last quarter. I believe you guys have mentioned 3% growth on the commercial side on the last call and so should commercial loans still grow at a faster pace than the rest of the portfolio?","Greg Carmichael","Yes so what I think, what we shared in the past is that we would expect to outpace GDP and that's exactly what we delivered. For this quarter particularly in commercial loans, you saw good growth, very diversified across our markets, across a number of businesses that we continue to emphasize, invest in, and we would expect that we would have that same type of performance throughout the balance of the year as Tayfun has previously guided.","Tim Wood","Okay. Understood and then just kind of that end, the dropdown of provisions was that solely due to an improvement in credit and outlook for credit or do reflect a change in loan growth assumptions that $91 million that you guys did this quarter; is that a good base for provisions that grow off or should we see further improvement?","Greg Carmichael","Yes first of all we -- I just want to make sure that everybody understands our coverage ratio remained at 1.38%. So we did not drop the coverage ratio, it's just reflective of the loan growth and it's a quarterly analysis and you went through our analysis that credit trends look good and we just provided $4 million. Going forward, as I commented, I think provision will reflect loan growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Matt O'Connor","A couple of follow-ups on topics that have already been covered a little bit. But just on the commercial loan growth, I guess why haven't we seen more growth there, I know there have been some de-risking going on and you have been very focused on pricing but I guess when do those factors run its course and you get back to may be kind of more industry commercial loan growth levels?","Lars Anderson","Well first of all, I would tell you, we feel good about our commercial loan growth for this quarter, it was largely in line with our peers. I mean we've had some headwinds as we have repositioned our portfolio as we've decreased exposures to non-strategic relationships in industries such as commodity sector of it. This is really about not overreaching and focusing on client selection and thus we're going to focus on what we can control.","And frankly we're doing that, if you look across all of our business, all of our verticals we are seeing some excellent growth, we are continuing to expand those, we're seeing growth across our core middle market franchise that's very promising for us. So when we would expect to see any significant change in us relative to say H8 data, very difficult to tell. We are going to focus on what we can control and that is building deep client relationships with attractive returns for our clients very deliberately so that we prudently use our capital and our liquidity and frankly we would build long-term relationships with our clients.","Greg Carmichael","And this is Greg, the only thing I would add to Lars comment, this is one of our core strategies, building our balance sheet could be good for the cycle but we've been very selective on the relationships, the geography, asset diversification extremely important. We're very pleased with the commercial loan growth that we saw in this quarter, it's consistent with our strategies as we move forward.","Matt O'Connor","Okay. And then may be a follow-up on NIM for Tayfun or Jamie, I think the comment was beyond the third quarter, I think you can keep the NIM relatively stable even in this rate environment and which is helping to get a little more color on that. That's obviously better than peers and will be an accomplishment in a difficult rate environment. So you mentioned some hedging and swaps for tax but just elaborate a little bit on how you keep NIM stable beyond 3Q?","Jamie Leonard","Yes, Matt, I think on NIM and what you've seen from us the past couple of quarters is that most if not all of our contraction are from things we've intentionally done whether that's debt issuance or the sale of some of the non-strategic assets that we've completed. And going forward the NIM compression whether it's the third quarter or perhaps even after the third quarter again would if we were to have compression, it would be based on things we're intentionally doing if we were to have more debt issuances that could be factor to drive a little bit more compression but overall we're pleased with how we position the securities portfolio, as Tayfun mentioned the bullet and locked out cash flows and we're not susceptible to this low rate environment over the next few quarters. But if this environment were to continued for an extended period of time then it would be more challenging to have stable NIM, but at least over the foreseeable future, we feel like we positioned the book as well as if we could for this lower from longer environment, we've talked you guys about that over the past two years as we built the securities portfolio.","And then but one factor you haven't heard from us over the past four quarters is the fact that loan yield compression just really hasn't been a factor in our NIM and given the pricing strategies and success that we've had executing on the loan side, we think we can continue to deliver stable NIM as the loans come on the sheet as yields were comfortable.","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes, Jamie just may be tag on to that we are being very deliberate in terms of our disciplined credit pricing, and as Greg had mentioned our client selection. We are very focused on businesses in markets in which we believe that we can outperform and frankly that has really helped us to stabilize those loans spreads. In a couple of areas we've seen some slight improvement. We're going to continue that that strategy. I would tell you that post-Brexit, we have seen a little bit more competitive environment but we're going to continued to stay focused on this strategy it's producing the right kinds of outcomes specifically consistent with what Greg has shared previously.","Greg Carmichael","Yes and I also want to clarify that I did say that, we may see just a few more basis points in Q4 based upon what Jamie just mentioned about some capital market activities but beyond that I think for looking out another two, three quarters I think we expect stability.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Matt Burnell","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to follow-up on the comment you just made in terms of your how deliberate you are, you've been in terms of client selection and pricing. I'm curious either in terms of other markets where there is greater pricing pressure and therefore more pressure to try to get clients to drive fee income within your footprint or those more in the lending offices that may not be in the middle of your branch footprint.","Jamie Leonard","Yes so, I mean we do see variation geographically from quarter-to-quarter, year-to-year and clearly we have some markets that are more competitive than others. But I'll tell you our value proposition what we're delivering is being very well received.","I'll give you an example, Chicago. This is a very competitive marketplace. We've seen and in fact that's been our fastest growing regional market that we have in our footprint, every day we are having to earn it client by client, but also I would tell you across the industry verticals, we continue to focus on put stacking our resources against those opportunities where we can get the best returns. But it's not just about the balance sheet; I'll remind you it's about the total client relationship.","And it's one of the reasons that as Greg shared, earlier we continue to invest another fee sources and solutions to build out an advisory based relationship with our clients and frankly that's helping to drive the P&L also for us. So I think that this is all coming together nicely for us.","Matt Burnell","Okay and for my follow-up with Tayfun may be if I could follow-up in terms of the 5% fee growth guidance. I just want to make sure that we understand the basis of that that excludes any Vantiv related gains, but it includes other sale gains or all of those excluded the way you would exclude them for core fee income?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes, so first of all the base compares in 2015 is about a $2.3 billion number. So our report number was I think $2.4 billion.","Matt Burnell","Right.","Tayfun Tuzun","So you just exclude -- I'm sorry $3 billion so you exclude all the Vantiv related gains in 2015 you get to a point $2.3 billion. The 5% is relative to that number excludes any Vantiv gains. The only gain really that -- it also excludes obviously the branch gains as well. So it would be from our perspective a core performance this year.","Matt Burnell","Okay. That implies a relatively greater growth in the second half in fees roughly about 9% by my calculation, in the second half versus the second half of last year. I appreciate that you expect to rebound in the fourth quarter in corporate fees. But that seems a bit stronger than then you've had previously?","Tayfun Tuzun","I think our numbers may not necessarily compare, well I wouldn't get to a 9% type number. I think you already know our first quarter and second quarter numbers if you exclude the gains that were booked against the branch sales. So I would basically advise you to follow that 5% growth off of $2.3 billion take out the first half and then look at the remaining two quarters. Again with some weakness incorporated in the summer, but they pick up in the fourth quarter and strengthen mortgage in the third quarter. So those are how we are getting to our 5% number.","Matt Burnell","Okay I'll circle back with Sameer to get my numbers right, thank you.","Sameer Shripad Gokhale","Okay.","Greg Carmichael","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore. Your line is open.","Steve Moss","Good morning it's Steve Moss for John Pancari.","Greg Carmichael","Good morning, Steve.","Steve Moss","I wanted to touch base on the European exposure that you have. Do you plan to grow it further or reduce it further?","Jamie Leonard","Yes, so I think as we've underscored previously and is in the earnings that that we have relatively light exposure in Europe. Let me just reinforce what our strategy is. Our focus is on developing relationships with European and in some cases Asian based very typically large strong corporate parents that are focused on expanding into the U.S. where we can deliver domestic services to them that that's our key strategy.","So are -- do we plan to grow that in the future, I would say yes. However consistent with our Brexit and EU plans and processes and market risk review, we're going to continue to be very cautious about that. But I would see this as an opportunity for us to continue to grow our domestic franchise and build some attractive relationships while we do see some disruption in the marketplace.","Greg Carmichael","Steve this is Greg. And it's important once again that we stick to the strategy that we put forth in support of our international relationships. You've watched us also over the last couple quarters simply reduce our exposure same relationship it doesn't meet our strategic objective.","Steve Moss","Okay. And then also on the CRE downgrade that you guys disclosed earlier in the month just wondering if there's any incremental work related to that or and\/or if there's any restriction on M&A activity?","Greg Carmichael","This is Greg. First off we're very disappointed in that downgrade. Let me remind everybody that was poor period of 2011 to 2013. It was not reflective of CRE activity with respect to lending investing in our service commitments. Actually we scored satisfactory outstanding in all those areas. It really is reflective in other agencies issues with respect to some lending activities that were all closed out recently. So that was disappointing. Also look that the Group know that the Fed will be in later this year to perform the next exam that will go up through mid-2016 and we're very confident that rating will be changed very shortly so that's kind of state of the environment.","With respect M&A and there is still opportunities, if you go in to bank M&A it's been very, very low on our priority, bank M&A I mean it's at the lowest level of our priorities for how we deploy our capital. We still think in this environment that we trade today the buying back our equity is the best use of deploying our capital. So we don't see this impeding our ability to deliver on our strategies and once again will be back in later this year, perform the next exam.","Operator","Your next question comes from Christopher Marinac with FIG Partners. Your line is open.","Christopher Marinac","Thanks, good morning. I just wanted to reinforce the NII conversation of earlier, how do you feel about growing NII in 2017?","Tayfun Tuzun","It's going to be a function of earning asset growth. Again depending upon obviously rates moves but assuming that there are no more rate moves over the next 18 months then NII growth will be a function of earning asset growth. I mean beyond that I think it's tough to necessarily predict what happens to credit spreads et cetera. But assuming some stability reflective of the current market conditions it will depend upon our ability to go earning assets.","Christopher Marinac","Okay, great thank you for that. And then just a follow-up on the energy book. Is there any way to handicap how the snag example go this fall for the next round should that be less owners would been earlier this year.","Frank Forrest","Good question. This is Frank, thanks for the question. And as you know, the first quarter that exam was focused very heavily on energy type of what we know those follow back up they'll go back and look at the same portfolio and the same credits that they evaluated in the first quarter what's changed obviously the price of oil per barrel has stabilized down a little bit last week or two but far higher than where it was before.","We are -- when you look at our price tax and when you look at our all of our scenarios that we run from base to stress the price of oil is well above, well above that. So I don't think this is going to be near as much noise depending on where price moves between now and then. We moved eight credits over in the first quarter that were all but one reserve base credits the non-accrual but we have very little if any loss forecast from those credits.","Our portfolio is stable at this point and as you know our portfolio was only 2% of our total book its small, it's certainly nominal. We manage it very well, we manage it through our vertical and our outlook for the rest of the year is really unchanged based on what we know today.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Mayo with CLSA. Your line is open.","Mike Mayo","Hi, what inning are you in for the ramp up in investment spending and what inning are you in for the savings from all of your initiatives. I can elaborate a little more, the investment spending you mentioned digital regulatory back office on investment side and on the saving side you mentioned vendors, facilities, offshore, mortgage loans system, commercial loan system, and the branch closings.","GregCarmichael","Right, those first up where are we as I mentioned before Mike we're at this will be the high watermark we believe for investments and technology and from a regulatory perspective investments we have to make. We've been focused on, very focused on as how to implement those opportunities of strategic investments in a most provable way and you've seen us accomplished that's why we brought our guidance down expenses for the remainder of this year and total for the year.","So we feel pretty good about what we are at on from an expense position on our investment. This will be the high watermark so we're in the later endings of that. We're also starting to realize some of the value created by the focus we put on reducing our infrastructure, also the branch reengineering, personnel reengineering, investments we made to renegotiate our contracts such as Vantiv, MasterCard, and I go down the list. We're starting to see those benefits hit us actually in the second half of this year you'll see more that as move into 2017.","So once again I know as you are we are we're very focused on positive operating leverage and we fully expect, there are plans and our actions will get us there in 2017.","Mike Mayo","May be just a follow-up on the savings, where do you stand with the closing of the 100 branches?","GregCarmichael","Yes we've completed the closing of 100 branches with the sale of Pennsylvania for a $11 million gain last quarter. So, we'll had a full year, full year run rate established by the end of this year that $60 million will be full run rate going into 2017. Once again we will remind you Mike that's an annual exercise as our consumer preferences evolved we will continue to assess our opportunities and then may be more opportunities as we think about 2017.","Mike Mayo","And last follow-up just if you add in all the savings from the other initiatives too I guess you haven't really given a number of that but your goal is for positive operating leverage when starting in 2017 and do you have a number for all of those?","Tayfun Tuzun","Mike we are not giving 2017 guidance but clearly going into the planning period that's our target for all of our businesses and staff functions.","GregCarmichael","And Mike everything we do we put to the lens doesn't meet those objectives that I step forward with ROTCE and ROA and our ability to execute. But thank you for the question.","Mike Mayo","All right, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Elliott","Hello, thank you for taking the question. On the Vantiv transaction, I think I understand the economics, but what was the rationale for the second stage of the transaction being this so-called option structure?","Tayfun Tuzun","So clearly the goal of the CRE transactions both from last year as well as this year was to ensure that from a risk management perspective and this is risk related to corporate tax rates that taxable income et cetera, to make sure that we have visibility to the value of those cash flows. And clearly this is an agreement between us and Vantiv; it's a function of their ability to engage in cash transactions upfront versus using cash availability in future periods.","Geoffrey Elliott","Thanks. And then just one more quick one. There was this news earlier in the week about the Chief Legal Officers leaving because of a conflict, I wondered if you could elaborate on that little?","Greg Carmichael","First that's always a difficult situation. So comment I've ever made and we've made as a bank is there was a personal matter that's been brought to our attention if their belief represents a conflict of interest. So to resolve those we've determined the best course of action was a separation. And it was a very qualified lawyer in this manner has nothing to do with any of the legal work done by Heather doing the tenure in her time to fit their naturally all I can say.","Operator","Your last question comes from Kevin Barker with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","Kevin Barker","Thank you. During this quarter I mean obviously position that mortgage banking may be better in the third quarter, but you also experienced quite a bit of decline in gain on sale margins versus the previous quarter and the first quarter was obviously higher than what we saw from a run rate. Was there any particular hedging losses or something that caused the severe decline?","Tayfun Tuzun","No, there isn't. I think the gain on sale margins are a function of channel production also the realization of the revenues during the quarter into the quarter. So it's not necessarily reflective of anything specific going into the third quarter we would expect more of a stability if margins are looking good for them.","Kevin Barker","Okay. And then in reference to the MSR valuation adjustment of a positive $6 million. The rate movement in the second quarter was less severe than we saw in the first quarter. Was there less hedging gains this quarter as well in regards?","Greg Carmichael","In which part are you talking about MSR hedging or are you talking about in the production side pipeline hedging?","Kevin Barker","The MSR asset.","Greg Carmichael","No, I mean on the MSR side our valuation, net valuation last quarter was $11 million and $6 million this quarter. And it really ultimately and it would have been fairly tight in terms of our hedge coverage. So it really comes down to the last day of every quarter where we stand in the valuation of those.","Operator","There are further questions in the queue at this time. I'll turn the call back to the presenters.","Sameer Shripad Gokhale","Thank you, Joanna, and thank you all for your interest in Fifth Third Bank.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bank Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Jeff Richardson, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Jeff Richardson","Thanks, Pamela. Good morning. Today, we'll be talking with you about our full year and fourth quarter 2012 results.","This call may contain certain forward-looking statements about Fifth Third pertaining to our financial condition, results of operations, plans and objectives. These statements involve certain risks and uncertainties.","There are a number of factors that could cause results to differ materially from historical performance in these statements. We've identified some of these factors in our forward-looking cautionary statement at the end of our earnings release and in other materials, and we encourage you to review them. Fifth Third undertakes no obligation and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statement after the date of this call.","I'm joined on the call by several people: Our CEO, Kevin Kabat; and CFO, Dan Poston; as well as Greg Schroeck from Credit; Tayfun Tuzun from Treasury; and Jim Eglseder from Investor Relations. During the question-and-answer period, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin Kabat. Kevin?","Kevin T. Kabat","Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. We know it's a busy morning for you.","Before we go through the quarter, I want to make some comments about 2012 as a whole. While the interest rate and regulatory environment certainly were not favorable, Fifth Third results demonstrated the many core strengths of our company. We worked hard to position ourselves to take advantage of opportunities when they returned and had the infrastructure in place to execute. We focused on the long term when it was difficult to do so. Those results show up in some areas very clearly, such as mortgage banking, where revenue was up 41%, and corporate banking revenue, up 18% this year. Less obvious is the important work we've done in areas where year-over-year revenue is down, but where quarterly results are trending up, such as deposit service charges and card processing revenue.","Overall, net income of $1.6 billion, the second highest in the company's history, and net income to common shareholders increased 41% over last year. Earnings per diluted share were $1.66, also up 41% from a year ago. For the year, we posted a return on assets of 1.34% and a return on average top -- tangible common equity of 14.3%, up from 11.4% in 2011. I'm pleased with our ability to produce these results in the midst of a relatively weak economic recovery and significant regulatory changes.","We remain committed to our markets, which is demonstrated through our strong deposit and loan growth results. For the full year, average","transaction deposits increased 8% and loans grew 6%, including a very strong fourth quarter. Credit quality metrics showed continued and significant improvement, with charge-offs for the year down 40% and nonperforming assets down nearly 30%. And we returned nearly $1 billion in capital to shareholders while maintaining, and actually growing, already very strong equity capital levels. We've posted a very good year on nearly all fronts, considering the environment, and we believe that provides the solid foundation to build on as we enter a new year.","Let me talk a little bit about then some highlights of the fourth quarter. Fifth Third reported fourth quarter net income to common shareholders of $390 million and earnings per diluted common share of $0.43, which is up 30% over last year. Earnings results included the impacts of the charges related to the FHLB prepayment and the gain on the Vantiv share sale and a couple of other items, which Dan will discuss in more detail. Those items net to about a $0.02 negative impact on the quarter. Return on assets was 1.33%, and return on tangible common equity was 14.1%. In addition, tangible book value per share was $12.33, increased 2% sequentially and 10% from a year ago, despite the impact of repurchases and capital returned to shareholders.","Loan growth continue to be solid, with particular strength in C&I loans, up 4% sequentially. Total loan growth from a year ago was 5% despite modest runoff in the commercial real estate and home equity portfolios. C&I and residential mortgage loans increased year-over-year by 15% and 13%, respectively. We feel that our success in growing loans organically is due in large part to the investments we've made in those businesses over the past several years and is a core strength of Fifth Third.","Every caption in fee come -- fee income increased sequentially. Corporate banking revenue of $114 million was up 38% over the fourth quarter last year, this was the strongest quarterly result in our history for that group and is reflective of their efforts and our investments over the past few years. Mortgage banking revenue continued to be very strong at $258 million, also a record of 65% over last year and 29% sequentially.","Credit trends continue to improve, with net charge-offs down another 6% sequentially and nonperforming assets down $174 million or 12% sequentially. Total delinquencies were at their lowest level since the second quarter of 2004. Capital levels are very strong and well in excess of target levels and regulatory requirements. Tier 1 common was 9.5% under current capital rules, and under the proposed Basel III capital standards, we would estimate a fully phased-in Tier 1 common ratio of 8.8%.","During the quarter, we initiated 2 share repurchase transactions for a total of approximately $225 million of common stock. Most of the impact of those transactions is in the fourth -- is in our fourth quarter capital ratios, while just 1\/3 of the impact is reflected in our average share count. Our period-end share count was reduced by 38 million shares or 4% during the year. Our capital plan also included the possibility of an additional $125 million in common share repurchases through the end of March 2013. Our ability to generate capital and our strong capital level under Basel I or Basel III give us the ability to retain the capital we need to support balance sheet growth while continuing to return capital to shareholders in a prudent manner.","As you know, we recently submitted our capital plan under the CCAR or Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review process. That plan includes potential dividend increases consistent with the Federal Reserve's 30% payout ratio guidance, as well as potential common share repurchases, that would maintain capital levels similar to current levels and support asset growth. This would be consistent with our recent levels of repurchase activity. Similar to 2012, we would also aim to distribute any future after-tax gains on the sale of Vantiv stock, if realized. Dan will discuss this more in his remarks.","The environment remains challenging from a growth perspective, but we continue to demonstrate our ability to generate strong loan growth and a relatively high level of profitability from solid revenue results, continued expense discipline and continued credit improvement. Now before I turn it over to Dan, I'd just like to thank our employees for their continued focus and drive and our customers for their continued business and partnership with Fifth Third.","With that, let me ask Dan to discuss operating results and give some comments about our outlook. Dan?","Daniel T. Poston","Thanks, Kevin. I'll start with Slide 4 of the presentation. For the quarter, we reported net income of $399 million. Net income to common shareholders was $390 million and diluted earnings per share of $0.43 increased 13% from last quarter's $0.38. Fourth quarter results included $157 million gain on the sale of Vantiv shares and $134 million charge on the termination of FHLB debt. Quarterly results also included $19 million in unrealized losses on Vantiv warrants, $15 million in charges associated with the Visa total return swap and an additional $29 million of pretax charges related to the increase in our mortgage repurchase reserve. Finally, we recognized a $10 million benefit in the tax line during the quarter related to the termination of leases. I'll touch on each of these later in my remarks, but in total, the items I just outlined reduced after-tax earnings by $16 million or about $0.02 per share after tax. All in all, it was a strong quarter for Fifth Third and that gives us a solid foundation as we enter 2013. I'll discuss our outlook toward the end of my remarks.","Turning to Slide 5. Tax equivalent net interest income decreased $4 million sequentially to $903 million, and the net interest margin was 3.49% versus 3.56% last quarter. You'll recall that in the fourth quarter, net interest income benefited from several nonrecurring items that, in total, contributed $10 million to NII and 4 basis points to the margin. Excluding the impact of these items on the sequential comparisons, net interest income increased $6 million and the net interest margin declined 3 basis points. Net interest income benefited from lower interest expense due to the full quarter effect of the redemption of trust preferred securities that occurred in the third quarter and also from the termination of the FHLB debt in the fourth quarter. These provided a benefit of $7 million from a sequential comparison standpoint.","The additional benefit of loan growth and lower deposit costs was offset by the effects of repricing on loans and investment securities. As I just mentioned, the net interest margin declined 3 basis points, excluding the 4 basis point impact of third quarter items. This reflected 3 basis points of benefit from the full quarter effect of the TruPs redemption in the third quarter and the termination of FHLB debt in the fourth quarter. The remaining decline of about 6 basis points was primarily due to lower loan and securities yields.","On the loan side, we've seen continued compression in yields, primarily driven by loan repricing, mainly in the C&I and auto portfolios. On the C&I side, the portfolio average yield was down 7 basis points compared with last quarter as a result of repricing and mix shift toward higher quality loans. In the indirect auto portfolio, the average yield also continued to decline, largely reflecting the portfolio effect of replacing older higher-yielding loans with new lower-yielding loans.","Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 6. Average earning assets increased $1.5 billion sequentially, driven by growth in average portfolio loans and leases up $1.1 billion or 1% sequentially. End-of-period loans increased $2.7 billion or 3% sequentially.","Looking at each of the portfolios, average commercial loans held for investment increased $788 million or 2% from the third quarter and increased $3.1 billion or 7% year-over-year. C&I loans of $34 billion grew $1.2 billion or 4% from last quarter and increased $4.4 billion or 15% from a year ago. Notably, C&I loans on an end-of-period basis were up $2.7 billion or 8% from last quarter, with strong growth in December reflecting success in our corporate banking business and tax planning actions by businesses in advance of year end. C&I production remains broad based across industries and sectors, with particular strength in the manufacturing and healthcare industries.","We continue to see the benefit of our investments over the past several years. For example, we recently added a number of experienced bankers in the energy group, and that group contributed about 10% of our new C&I production this quarter. Commercial mortgage and commercial construction balances declined in the aggregate by $430 million sequentially or 4%. While our originations continue to increase modestly in this area, we've also seen increased payoffs driven by market activity.","Average consumer loans in the portfolio increased $267 million or 1% sequentially and $976 million or 3% from a year ago. Residential mortgage loans held for investment were up 2% sequentially, reflecting strong originations and continued retention of jumbo loans, as well as shorter-term, high-quality residential mortgages originated through our retail branch system. Average auto loan balances increased 1% compared with the third quarter. We remain focused on managing volume and pricing in this business given the competitive environment. Home-equity loan balances were down 2% sequentially, and average credit card balances were up 3% sequentially, benefiting from seasonal purchase volume.","Moving on to deposits. Average core deposits increased $2.6 billion or 3% from the third quarter. Transaction deposits, which exclude consumer CDs, increased $2.7 billion or 3% sequentially and $4.6 billion or 6% from a year ago, with growth driven by demand deposits. Consumer CDs declined $130 million in the quarter due to our continued disciplined approach to CD pricing.","Turning to fees, which are outlined on Slide 7. Fourth quarter noninterest income was $880 million, an increase of $209 million from last quarter. Current quarter fee results included $157 million gain on the sale of Vantiv shares that we announced in December, also a $19 million loss on Vantiv warrants and $15 million in charges on the Visa total return swap. Excluding these items and similar items last quarter, fee income of $757 million was up $82 million or 12% sequentially, which was driven by strong mortgage banking and corporate banking revenue results.","Looking at each line item in detail. Deposit service charges increased 5% sequentially and declined 1% from the prior year. The sequential increase was driven by consumer deposit fees, which were up 10% due to seasonality, as well as the initial benefit of transitioning to our new simplified deposit product offerings. Commercial deposit fees increased 2% sequentially and 6% over the prior year, due to account growth and increased treasury management sales revenue.","Corporate banking revenue of $114 million was the highest in company history, as Kevin noted, which increased $13 million from a strong third quarter level and $32 million from last year. The growth was primarily driven by higher syndication and business lending fees. As I mentioned, year-end tax law changes drove a number of corporate transactions or accelerated their timing. More significantly, investments in our capital markets and treasury management capabilities are creating more lead opportunities and increased production, and we led or co-led over half of our syndicated transactions during the fourth quarter.","Mortgage banking net revenue of $258 million increased 29% from the third quarter and 65% from a year ago. Originations were $7 billion this quarter, matching our highest quarter ever and compared with $5.8 billion last quarter. Gain on sale revenue was a record $239 million, up $13 million from strong third quarter levels on higher volumes, partially offset by lower gain on sale margins. MSR valuation adjustments, including hedges, were a positive $7 million in the fourth quarter compared with a negative $40 million last quarter.","Investment advisory revenue increased 1% from last quarter and 3% from the prior year, largely due to higher private client services revenue and institutional trust fees. This was partially offset by lower mutual fund fee revenue, which resulted from the sale of certain mutual funds which closed in the third quarter. Card and processing revenue was $66 million, up 2% from the third quarter and 10% from a year ago, reflecting higher sales and transaction volumes.","Turning next to other income within fees. Other income was $215 million this quarter versus $78 million last quarter. Excluding unusual items I outlined a moment ago, other income was $92 million and was consistent with the prior quarter's levels. Credit costs recorded in other noninterest income were $13 million in the fourth quarter compared with $14 million last quarter and $33 million a year ago.","Now turning to expenses, which are on Slide 8. Noninterest expense of $1.2 billion increased $157 million sequentially or 16%. There was a lot of noise in expenses both this quarter and last. In the fourth quarter, expenses included $134 million charge on FHLB debt termination, $26 million in additional expense resulting from the increase in mortgage repurchase reserves and $13 million from increases to litigation reserves. Prior quarter results included $26 million of costs associated with the TruPs redemption and $22 million from an increase in mortgage repurchase reserves. Excluding these items from both quarters, noninterest expense was $990 million and increased $32 million or 3% from the third quarter. That increase was driven by higher compensation-related expenses, primarily due to very strong mortgage and commercial loan production during the quarter. Additionally, we reported $6 million in annual pension curtailment expense during the fourth quarter.","Credit-related costs and operating expense were $68 million, up $9 million from last quarter, due to higher mortgage repurchase expense. Mortgage repurchase expense was $44 million this quarter compared with $36 million last quarter. Realized losses were $15 million this quarter, which was consistent with last quarter.","As we previously announced, Freddie Mac informed us that they were planning to request files beginning in the fourth quarter, and on an ongoing basis, for any loan that was nonperforming. In December, we received additional information from Freddie Mac regarding changes they've made to their selection criteria, as well as the timeframe for requesting files, which now includes the years 2004 through 2006. Previously, they were using a 2007 and forward timeframe. As a result, we further increased our reserves to incorporate estimates of probable losses on repurchases from the 2004 through 2006 timeframe. We do not have the same type of information from Fannie Mae, which represented approximately 23% of our servicing portfolio and roughly 20% of the loans sold to GSEs over the past 10 years.","Moving on to Slide 9 and PPNR. Pre-provision net revenue was $616 million in the fourth quarter compared with $568 million in the third quarter. Excluding the items noted on this slide, PPNR in the fourth quarter was $638 million, up 7% from the results in the third quarter similarly adjusted and among the strongest results we've ever reported. Adjusted PPNR to risk-weighted assets was 2.3% versus 2.0% in the third quarter. The effective tax rate was 26.8% this quarter compared with 27.7% last quarter. The fourth quarter included a $10 million benefit from the termination of leases that we settled during the quarter.","Now turning to credit results. Credit results showed substantial and continued improvement during the fourth quarter, and absolute levels of virtually every credit metric were the best we've reported since 2007 prior to the crisis.","Starting with charge-offs on Slide 10. Total net charge-offs of $147 million declined $9 million or 6% from the third quarter and $92 million or 38% from a year ago. The net charge-off ratio was 70 basis points this quarter. That compares with 119 basis points a year ago and is the lowest we reported in more than 5 years. Commercial net charge-offs of $56 million declined 10% sequentially and 50% from a year ago. At 46 basis points, this was the lowest level reported since the third quarter of 2007. The biggest improvement was in commercial mortgage charge-offs, which were down $11 million or 39% from last quarter, partially offset by a $7 million increase in C&I losses. Total consumer net charge-offs were $91 million, down 3% sequentially and down 28% from a year ago. The improvement continues to be driven by lower residential mortgage and home equity losses.","Moving on to nonperforming assets on Slide 11. NPAs, including held-for-sale, totaled $1.3 billion at quarter end, down $174 million or 12% from the third quarter. Excluding held-for-sale, NPAs were $1.3 billion or 1.49% of loans and were down $160 million from the third quarter, driven by improvement in commercial NPAs.","Commercial portfolio NPAs of $883 million, or 1.78% of loans, declined $134 million sequentially and are at their lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2007. Most portfolio categories improved, with commercial real estate NPAs down $77 million and C&I NPAs down $55 million. Commercial TDRs on nonaccrual status, which are included in portfolio NPAs, were down $177 million -- or were $177 million, up $24 million on a sequential basis. Commercial accruing TDRs were down $11 million and also remained fairly low at $431 million.","In the consumer portfolio, NPAs declined $26 million to $403 million or 110 basis points, with NPLs down $15 million, driven by improvement in residential mortgage. Non-accruing consumer TDRs were $187 million, down $5 million from last quarter. Accruing consumer TDRs were $1.66 billion, consistent with last quarter. The TDR book continues to perform as expected and has stabilized as opportunities for new restructuring become more limited with stabilizing residential real estate credit conditions.","The next slide, Slide 12, includes a roll-forward of nonperforming loans. Commercial inflows in the fourth quarter were $68 million, down 44% from the third quarter. Consumer inflows for the quarter were $145 million, down 10%. These were the lowest inflows we've seen for both commercial and consumer NPLs since prior to the crisis.","Moving to Slide 13, which outlines delinquency trends. Loans 30 to 89 days past due totaled $330 million, down $15 million, and loans over 90 days past due were $195 million, down $6 million from the third quarter. Total delinquencies of $525 million decreased $21 million or 4% from the third quarter and remain at precrisis levels. Commercial-criticized asset levels also continued to improve in the fourth quarter, with the seventh consecutive quarter of decline, down $800 million or 14% sequentially.","The provision and allowance are outlined on Slide 14. Provision expense of $76 million for the quarter was up $11 million and included a reduction in the loan loss allowance of $71 million. Allowance coverage remained strong at 180% of nonperforming loans and 3.2x annualized net charge-offs.","Slide 15 outlines our recent mortgage repurchase experience. Claims and losses associated with GSEs have remained fairly stable over the past several quarters. But we expect this will likely increase as Freddie Mac reviews all nonperforming loans for potential put-back and will now do so back to 2004. We've provided a detailed breakout of loans sold by vintage and remaining balance. Repurchase requests and losses have been concentrated in the 2005 to 2008 vintages, about 78% of the total. Those loans represent just 11% of the remaining balances.","One last topic on credit. As you're aware, last quarter, the OCC issued guidance related to consumer loans to borrowers that have been through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not reaffirmed their loan. This guidance included classifying such loans as TDRs, writing them down to their collateral value and classifying them as nonperforming. We are not an OCC bank and the Federal Reserve and FDIC have not issued similar guidance. We currently estimate that we have approximately $175 million of loans that would fall into this category, about 1\/3 of which have already been through the TDR process and 87% of which are current. From a charge-off perspective, our exposure to a change in the guidance, similar to the OCC guidance, would be a requirement to write these loans down to appraised value despite the fact that they continue to make contractual payments. If that guidance were adopted by our regulators, we estimate that this would result in charge-offs of about $70 million, which would be offset by currently existing reserves of about $10 million. Clearly, this would be manageable for us and we continue to monitor those developments closely, but we have no basis for taking these charges at this time until and unless there is a change in regulatory guidance on this topic.","Turning to capital, which is on Slide 16. Capital levels continue to be very strong and included the repurchase of approximately $225 million in common shares this quarter. Tier 1 common ratio at the end of the quarter was 9.5% compared with 9.7% last quarter, due to the impact of share repurchases in the quarter. Other regulatory capital ratios showed similar trends. The tangible common equity ratio was 9.1%, including unrealized gains of $375 million after tax and 8.8% excluding those.","Our capital position would also be strong from a Basel III perspective with a current estimated Tier 1 common ratio of about 8.8%, assuming no changes to the proposed rules and before any mitigation activity on our part. That reflects about 40 basis points of benefit on the numerator side, offset by the detriment from an increase in risk-weighted assets. As you know, regulators are currently considering public comments on these proposals.","During the quarter, we entered into 2 share repurchase transactions. The first, in November, was part of our normal capital management and involved the repurchase of approximately $125 million in common shares. The second, in December, followed an after-tax gain on the sale of Vantiv shares and resulted in a repurchase of approximately $100 million of common shares. These share repurchase transactions were conducted through counterparty arrangements, and they're expected to settle in the first quarter.","As Kevin noted, we reduced our period-end share count by 38 million shares or 4% in 2012, while our common equity capital ratios actually grew modestly. Our 2012 capital plan also included an additional $125 million of possible repurchases through the first quarter of 2013, which we will likely consider shortly.","Turning to the full year 2013 outlook in comparison to 2012, which is on Slide 17. You'll notice this quarter that we have shifted to an annual outlook as we head into 2013. This is consistent with our practice prior to the crisis. The effects of that period and the numerous uncertainties that followed made it difficult to confidently provide longer-term expectations. We believe that while the environment continues to be challenging, those uncertainties have lessened and we believe it is a better practice to provide a longer-term view of where we think the company is headed, hence the change. Our plan would be to provide an update to our annual outlook with each quarter's earnings announcement. We also expect our outlook commentary to continue to include additional quarterly information, where there are expected departures from the overall trends, particularly sequential impacts, such as the effects of seasonality, and I'll start with a few such comments before turning to full year results.","The strength of our fourth quarter 2012 results and momentum provide us with a good foundation for 2013. Ending loan balances were significantly higher than fourth quarter average balances, which will benefit NII. Mortgage pipelines and corporate banking pipelines are strong. We have carefully managed headcount throughout the year. It was down 3% from year-end 2011 levels, and we will continue to do so. As a result, we're expecting a solid first quarter, given the strength of the quarter that we just reported, although, as usual, we will experience negative first quarter seasonal effects. These include: seasonally higher FICA and unemployment expense, about $28 million higher than fourth quarter levels; the impact of 2 fewer days in the quarter, which will reduce NII by $12 million; and the impact of stock option expirations in the first quarter, which will raise the effective tax rate from its normal 28% rate to about 30% and reduce net income by about $10 million. I'll include additional comments about the first quarter as I discuss each line item.","Turning to our 2013 overall outlook, I would note that we have not assumed the benefit of any capital actions beyond the first quarter. We've assumed no meaningful improvement in the forward yield curve, and we have not incorporated any unusual items, such as any potential Vantiv gains or the Chapter 7 bankruptcy guidance issue that I just outlined.","I'll start with net interest income and net interest margin. We currently expect full year 2013 NII to be consistent with full year 2012 NII of $3.6 billion. We anticipate the full year NIM to fall to the 335 to 340 basis point range. The key drivers of 2013 full year trends are loan growth, particularly C&I loans, which we expect to offset the effect of margin compression. We expect margin compression will be higher in the first 2 quarters of 2013 as the portfolio reprices to prevailing rates and then for it to begin to stabilize in the second half as those effects wear off. For the first quarter, we expect NII to be in the $885 million range, reflecting $12 million of seasonal impact to day count, as well as repricing of securities and loans, partially offset by loan growth and a full quarter benefit of the fourth quarter FHLB debt termination. We currently expect NII to grow during the year after the first quarter, strengthening in the second half as margin compression subsides, with some benefit of 2008 CDs maturing in the third and fourth quarters. We will continue to look for opportunities to mitigate the effects of the interest rate environment, including liability management, as we move through the year.","Turning to loan growth. We expect mid to high single-digit growth from the full -- from the 2012 full year average, driven by continued growth in C&I, residential mortgage and auto lending, stabilization in commercial real estate and continued runoff in the home equity portfolio. We assume we will continue to retain only jumbo and branch-originated mortgage product. We expect deposits to remain relatively stable or to grow modestly with growth in transaction deposit balances and continued runoff in consumer CD balance.","Now moving on to overall fee income and expense expectations for 2013. First, in order to provide clearer perspective on core trends, we've adjusted 2012 comparative results on this slide to exclude Vantiv-related impacts, as well as debt termination charges, which were the largest unusual items in 2012. Vantiv transactions contributed net $305 million to fee income for 2012, while debt termination charges increased expenses by a total of $169 million. The net benefit to PPNR of these items was $136 million. Those adjustments are listed in the footnote. Overall, we currently expect low single-digit total fee income growth in 2013 compared with adjusted fee income in 2012. That would reflect growth across most fee categories, with the exception of mortgage, where we look for strong results during 2013, particularly in the first quarter, but not as strong as 2012.","Looking at the details of our overall fee expectations. We expect to see low double-digit percentage growth in deposit fees, with about 2\/3 of that coming from commercial and 1\/3 from consumer. This expectation reflects a continuation of recent momentum and treasury management and the full rollout of our simplified consumer deposit set. First quarter deposit fees will likely be consistent with the fourth quarter levels due to seasonality. We expect mid-single-digit growth in investment advisory revenue with solid growth in the first quarter as well.","We're looking for high single-digit growth in corporate banking revenue, driven by higher FX fees, institutional sales revenue and business lending fees. Corporate banking should be strong again in the first quarter of 2013, but perhaps $5 million below the fourth quarter's record levels. We anticipate about 10% annual growth in card and processing revenue, driven by continued growth in sales and transaction volumes. This line item will likely be flat in the first quarter due to seasonality.","Turning to mortgage. 2012 mortgage banking revenue was $845 million, reflecting record volumes, the impact of the HARP program and unusually high margins. In 2013, we expect production in margins to decline due to lower HARP refinance volume, some competitive pressure on margins and a waning in the refinance boom. That said, first quarter looks to be quite strong, and we're looking for mortgage revenue in the $230 million range, down about $15 million to $20 million. It's obviously more difficult to forecast further out, but our current expectation for the full year assumes that mortgage revenue declines to the $175 million a quarter range in the middle of the year and then drifts down slowly thereafter.","Our quarterly base expectation for the other income caption would be in the $75 million range, plus or minus, absent significant unusual items, which we will have from time to time. We would expect lower credit costs in this line item to be a contributor here.","To return to our overall expectations for fee income, while we expect a declining contribution from our mortgage banking revenue, we expect growth in other fee income categories to generally pick up the slack from a trend perspective. In terms of the first quarter, we look for fees to be in the $700 million range or perhaps a little better.","Turning to expenses. We currently expect total noninterest expenses to be relatively consistent with 2012 expenses, excluding the $169 million in debt termination charges on the FHLB debt and TruPs I noted earlier. Personnel costs are expected to be stable to down slightly versus 2012, with lower mortgage repurchase expense and very modest growth in other operating expenses. The other expense caption should average about $300 million a quarter, with lower credit costs, absent any significant unusual transactions we may experience.","First quarter expenses are currently expected to be in the $995 million range, consistent with fourth quarter core expenses. As I noted earlier, that will include a seasonal increase of about $28 million for FICA and unemployment. Those same expenses should go back down by about $20 million in the second quarter. We expect expenses otherwise to be relatively stable through the year, and our current expectation is for an efficiency ratio of about 60% in the second half of the year. We'll continue to manage expenses carefully and aggressively and in line with revenue results and the economic environment.","In terms of PPNR, we've adjusted the 2012 column on the slide for the $136 million net benefit of the impact of Vantiv and debt termination. As I outlined in my remarks to this point, our overall expectation is for moderate growth in PPNR in 2013 compared with the strong results in 2012. That's despite a rate environment that is not conducive to normalized NII results and comparisons to a record year for mortgage revenue. As I noted earlier, first quarter PPNR results will include the seasonal negative impact of $40 million in NII and expense lines.","We expect full year 2013 effective tax rate to be in the 28% to 28.5% range, which is consistent with 2012. We anticipate a higher effective tax rate in the first quarter, about 30%, as a result of the tax effect of stock options expirations. That represents about $10 million in the tax line in the first quarter. As a reminder, last year, this impact occurred in the second quarter.","Turning to credit. We look for continued improvement in credit trends, with full year net charge-offs currently expected to be down about $200 million or so and the improvement fairly evenly distributed between commercial and consumer. We expect the full year net charge-off ratio to be in the 55 to 60 basis point range, compared with the 85 basis points we reported this year. We currently expect NPAs to decline about 20% to 25% during 2013, with continued resolution of commercial NPAs being the largest driver of the reduction. First quarter charge-offs should be down about $5 million to $10 million, and NPAs should be down about $50 million to $75 million. For the loan loss allowance, we expect continued reductions during 2013, with the ongoing benefit of improvement in credit results being partially offset by new reserves related to loan growth.","Finally, as I noted in my earlier discussion, our 2013 capital plan submission included potential share repurchases. Our 2012 capital plan included $600 million of repurchases over a 5-quarter period. The 2013 CCAR process covers 4 quarters, but otherwise, our plan is generally consistent from the perspective of the pace of proposed repurchase activity. Obviously, those plans would be contingent on both a non-objection to our plan from the Federal Reserve and on our board's future decisions regarding the actual implementation of share repurchases. Overall, our capital plan submission would remain -- maintain common equity capital ratios in the same general ballpark as current levels. As a result, our plan is probably somewhat more conservative than our capital and earnings would support, but we think that is the right place to be with respect to CCAR process at this stage.","In summary, we are very pleased to close out 2012 on a strong note and that gives us confidence as we move into 2013. The environment is challenging, but we've had momentum in a number of core businesses that should support our ability to generate core PPNR growth and we expect ongoing improvement in credit trends. These trends would drive continued strong return measures. Added to those strengths is our capacity for continued prudent capital actions that would further contribute to earnings per share.","That wraps up my remarks. Pamela, can you open up the line for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ian Foley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","It's actually Ian Foley for Ken. First question on the commercial loan growth, obviously, huge growth towards the end of the quarter. Was wondering if you could provide any details on just timing and how that could impact 1Q growth rates.","Kevin T. Kabat","Let me just start and then Dan can finish in terms of talking about forward perspective. It was strong in the end of -- and you noticed in terms of our end of period loans. We got -- it was very broad, came from a wide swathe across our geographies. It was strong, particularly in terms of healthcare, energy, manufacturing. We feel very good about that. Pipeline was good, and we were able to really work hard through year end to accommodate our clients and our client needs. That, as Dan mentioned, really does give us a good foundation and a good jump-off point relative to starting the quarter. So that feels pretty good. I don't know if there's anything else, Dan, you'd like to say in terms of that point.","Daniel T. Poston","No, not a lot more. As Kevin said, fourth quarter was very strong, some of that may have been some acceleration of some transactions. But overall, we expect that we will continue to post quarterly loan growth that's consistent with what we've seen over the past several quarters. And you can see our annual expectations for loan growth are for mid to high single-digit growth for the year, and I'm not sure we're necessarily expecting there to be significant variations during the year. So I think we would expect continued consistent solid loan growth throughout 2013.","Kevin T. Kabat","And the only other thing I would just conclude with in terms of that point, look, we've made a lot of investment in this space. Our folks are doing a very good job. We've brought in some real talent to supplement the strategic focuses that we've had. We've talked about the energy vertical, for example. Healthcare continues to be a very, very strong and very good line of business for us and vertical for us as well, and we feel good about the manufacturing business going on around us. So again, I think that we're well positioned to take advantage of where we're seeing some strength in this modest but continuing slow recovery. So I think we're well positioned to take advantage of that.","Ian Foley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","All right. And my second question is a follow-up to the loan growth guidance. Just wondering if you could put that in context of overall earning assets and how you expect loans to earning assets to shift over the next year?","Unknown Executive","We continue to favor loan growth over growth in the investment portfolio. We don't believe that the current environment provides good risk return trades-offs for our shareholders to grow the investment portfolio. So earning asset growth almost exclusively will reflect loan growth looking forward.","Ian Foley - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","But do you think you would actually pull down the securities portfolio as a result of the loan growth, given that deposit growth is stable to up modestly?","Unknown Executive","No, I expect the investment portfolio size to remain stable.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous.","Brian Foran","I think the fee growth guidance is clearly better than most people have baked in, and you give good color and helpful detail on -- by line item. I guess, maybe if you could just -- if I could ask as a follow-up where the main points of uncertainty are? Mortgage, you feel pretty confident about the first quarter. And I guess a sub-question would be if you could just remind us how you book revenue and if it's mostly at funding or rate lock that's feeding into that confidence. And then just more broadly, I mean, with all the moving parts in fees, what are the 1 or 2 things we should watch for deltas as we move through the year?","Daniel T. Poston","Yes. Clearly, there's probably more uncertainty with respect to mortgage results than any of the other line items, and we've booked the majority of revenue at rate lock, but there is some revenue that is booked upon the sale of those loans. I think in the other fee categories, we are expecting growth uniformly through all of our line items. And I think as Kevin mentioned, that growth is primarily driven by investments and actions that we've taken over the past several years. So we continue to see very solid results in corporate banking. We changed our focus or increased our focus on mid-corporate lending, and we've had concerted efforts to be in a position to be in the lead position on transactions. That has resulted in a greater fee income contribution and more opportunities for corporate banking revenues. You're seeing that in our results, and I think our expectation is you will continue to see that into 2013. On the consumer side, obviously, the fees over the last several years have been impacted by a number of regulatory headwinds. I think we've turned the corner there. We talked about that in the third quarter, that we thought consumer deposit fees have bottomed out. I think that's been proven out by our fourth quarter results, where deposit fees were up 5%. We're expecting continued growth there. We've got our -- the full implementation of our new set of deposit products is coming online in 2013. Obviously, there's some uncertainty with respect to that program. But we've been piloting that for some 6 months now, and we have a high degree of confidence in our ability to produce the kind of results that are embedded in our guidance, given the results of those pilots. So overall, we're feeling pretty good.","Brian Foran","As a follow-up, I was wondering if I could ask about auto lending. And I know you focus on prime industry statistics we look at, I mean, to suggest underwriting standards are easing quite a bit across that market, but it's harder to get a broad perspective, I guess, or 10 kind of years of perspective of whether the market just kind of rebased to a more normal level or whether people are getting over their skis a little bit. So I guess just what are you seeing on the ground from a competitive standpoint? Is the market just normalizing, or is it getting a little bit looser than you'd like in auto?","Unknown Executive","I think credit conditions in auto, in the market, are easing up a little bit because the competition at the very high-end level of FICO spectrum is very, very strong. So the risk return trade-off's of, in the sort of 775, 780-plus type FICO scores is driving margins down. And the other thing to keep in mind is that this product behaved very well from a credit perspective through the credit crisis. I think originators have some confidence as to the expected credit behavior. On our side, we have not changed our underwriting standards much. I mean, we continue -- we have a platform that is probably capable to originate more loans, but we've kept the discipline in the business to make sure that we don't compromise credit standards and we book loans that provide a good risk return trade-off. So the overall profile of our originations has not changed. We are aware of some of the market trends that you are pointing to, but I'm confident that going, moving forward in 2013, we'll keep the same type of discipline in the business.","Brian Foran","If I could sneak in a very quick last one, the NIM doing worse in the first half of the year than the second, is that just the timing of CD repricing and deposit repricing more broadly? Or is there some kind of expected inflection in asset yields as well?","Unknown Executive","So if you look, historically, you will see that first quarter -- Q4 to Q1 change is most likely going to be similar this year compared to last year. There is some support in the second half from CD -- consumer CD repricing in Q3 and Q4. In general, Q1 tends to be a bit weaker from a fee perspective, that goes into the margin line, and we would expect that to stabilize in the second half, based -- and we're not currently assuming any meaningful -- as Dan stated, any meaningful improvement in the rate environment. So with ongoing current conditions, we don't see anything unusual than what we typically see in Q1 this year.","Daniel T. Poston","The only thing I would add to that is we saw the impact on the rate environment from QE3 in the third quarter of 2012. That has had an impact on margins over the latter part of 2012, and that's not fully baked into our portfolios at this point, but that will become more and more baked into the portfolios as we move through the first half of 2013. And absent any other kind of event that has a large impact on rates, we would expect that the impact of that would begin to subside as we move into the latter part of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a question on the rep and warranty expense that you took this quarter on the earlier vintages. How well do you feel that you're able to capture the potential charges associated with that? Meaning, are we -- do you feel that we are basically done with those earlier vintage charges at this point, or is this just the first step among several, potentially?","Daniel T. Poston","Well, the -- I think it's important to recognize that our reserving methodology is not to attempt to estimate the total losses from repurchase activity over the entire life of the portfolio. Our reserving methodology is to reserve for those losses that we can estimate based on the current conditions. So we've moved to a point over the last couple of quarters where we have far more insight into what Freddie Mac is going to do with respect to requesting files [indiscernible] postulate whether to put a loan back to us and what decisions they will be making in that regard. So we've increased our reserves to the extent that we can now estimate put-back activity into the future, which we were unable to do before. But that doesn't mean that we have made those estimates for the entire life of the portfolio. We're making those estimates based upon which loans we think have currently exhibited behavior and are currently nonperforming in Freddie Mac's eyes and that they will ultimately put back to us. So it's a look into the next several quarters or years in terms of what they might do with loans that have nonperforming characteristics today, but it's not trying to project how that portfolio will perform years into the future. So hopefully, that's answers your question.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, no, it does, actually. It helps a lot. Just as a follow-up question, maybe a little more broad. It seems that you were fairly optimistic when it comes to C&I growth in 2013. Obviously, auto is just as competitive. When you think about the potential categories where we could see growth, is C&I the best in terms of, sort of the, I'd say I guess, risk reward or in terms of the yield versus the risk that you're taking on that, where you see more opportunity to grow versus other categories?","Kevin T. Kabat","Yes. Ken, this is Kevin. I would tell you that, that statement or that assumption is true. We do feel very good about the risk reward and the value that we're seeing, particularly as you see, and as we were able to report this quarter, some of the commercial fee revenue that we had. That should give you comfort and an indication of our confidence of driving the right business and the right value for the risks that we're taking. It certainly does for me, so...","Daniel T. Poston","The only other thing I would point out from a risk reward perspective is that I think that what Kevin just said is probably all the more true when you consider the fee income opportunities. So a lot of our C&I growth is a result of our mid-corporate strategy, and I think you have the dynamic that I alluded to earlier with respect to the fee income opportunities on that business being far greater than they are in many other categories of our loan portfolios.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jefferson Harralson with KBW.","Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","My question is a follow-up to the last one and maybe it's too similar, so feel free to pass it by if it's too similar. But in just listening to all the conference calls this quarter on loan growth, it feels like we've had a lot of small and midsized businesses sell to, either family members or whatever, and get a lot of -- and we had a lot of leveraged financed volume that's driving a nice kind of a late quarter C&I growth. Is that kind of what you're seeing here? And is -- and I just want to make -- as you guys are guiding to a much higher nice loan growth, I just want to know what the drivers are to that loan growth in your guidance, because it seems like a big piece of this quarter might be fairly temporary, or am I thinking about that incorrectly?","Kevin T. Kabat","Yes. Certainly, we did see some activity that was M&A transactions and the like that may have had some tax motivation in terms of tax changes. But I would say that while that was a contributor to our growth, I think it was not the key driver to our growth. So I wouldn't anticipate that the absence of those kinds of transactions going forward would have any risk of impacting our guidance. So if you look at our guidance, certainly, our guidance is not that we will replicate the fourth quarter every quarter going forward. Fourth quarter was strong. That was one of the reasons it was strong. But the absence of those kinds of transactions is fully baked into our guidance as we go forward.","Jefferson Harralson - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then for the '13 guidance, I guess, what has to go right for that to -- for the guidance to come true?","Kevin T. Kabat","From our standpoint, the assumptions that we've made relative to our guidance, I think, we articulated, which is really kind of the continued modest recovery that we're having. That has to go through. From our standpoint, we have to execute well. We've made the right investments. I think we're well positioned. We're scoring in the areas where we've specifically put investment against. To be able to do that, we've got to continue that momentum and that execution, and I think that's entirely within our strength and control. So it feels really good, and we've got to also continue to be very disciplined relative to credit quality. We know there will be continued competitive pressure from that standpoint, and I think we're very mindful of all the factors of success in being able to do that. We wouldn't have given the guidance if we didn't feel confident at this stage that these are the things that we're dealing with in this environment and have been able to demonstrate in the past year as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR Capital Markets.","Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","This is Jessica Ribner for Paul. Just taking a look at your gain-on-sale margins, it looks like it fell about 50 basis points quarter-over-quarter. That was just a rough back of the envelope calculation. We were wondering what that was a result of?","Daniel T. Poston","You are right. I think it probably did decline somewhere in that range. I think the dynamic there is that third quarter margins were at record highs. Some of those margins were driven by the level of HARP refinance activity and the margins on that business. I think margins were also driven in the third quarter by the fact that you had a pretty significant rate impact as a result of some of the QE3 announcements during the third quarter. So as those became -- as that rate environment became more baked into all of the market rates and the rate offerings, I think those margins lowered a bit. So I think that's the dynamic there.","Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And do you foresee another drop like that between fourth quarter and the first quarter, or do you think it's going to level off a little bit?","Daniel T. Poston","I think it's going to level off a little bit. I think, in general, our guidance for mortgage for 2013 reflects both the fact that volumes and gain-on-sale margins will come in a little bit.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kevin St. Pierre with Sanford Bernstein.","Kevin J. St. Pierre - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","I appreciate the color on the capital plan submission. I was just wondering if you could help us understand the conservatism with Tier 1 common, Basel I, 9.5%, Basel III 8.8% presumably well above where you need to be in 2019. Is your conservatism rooted in your experience from 2012, or is it keeping some dry powder on hand in case strategic opportunities arise? What's driving the conservatism?","Daniel T. Poston","Well, I don't think it's related to our experience in 2012. That was more of a qualitative issue, as we've discussed, and I think we're talking about conservative -- conservatism here in terms of kind of quantitative measures. And I think the largest driver of that conservatism are things that others have talked about as well, and that's just simply the way the process is constructed. There is a considerable amount of uncertainty as banks submit their plans with respect to what the models that the regulators will be using look like and what kind of results they will produce. I think it's safe to say that everyone in 2012 experienced the situation, or nearly everyone, the situation where the capital plan that they submitted and the capital ratios that, that produced were adjusted downward by the regulators once the regulators ran their models. So we don't know what those models look like. We don't know how big those adjustments may be, and therefore, we're required to bake a fair amount of conservatism into what we submit in order to allow for the potential for those kinds of adjustments as we go forward. We would anticipate that over time, that either those adjustments will get smaller or that we will be better able to predict them, or both. But as we sit here today, there's a significant amount of uncertainty, and therefore, we can't take the risk that what we submit kind of is inconsistent with the result that they're going to have.","Kevin J. St. Pierre - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","All right, that's helpful. And then just quickly on the reserves. You pointed out you're 3.2x annualized charge-offs, peer median closer to 2x. Should we expect you to main that kind of -- maintain that kind of coverage over annualized charge-offs, or do you find -- do you think you'll drift closer to where the peers are?","Daniel T. Poston","I suspect we may drift closer to where peers are. Our reserve methodology is not driven off of achieving a multiple -- a certain multiple of charge-offs. It's more a result of the models that we run in order to establish our reserves. So that ratio is largely determined by kind of the different pace, perhaps, of improvements in levels of charge-off versus levels of nonperforming loans. So we may still have allowances that are elevated by the fact that we have higher levels of nonperforming loans that we still need to resolve, yet charge-off performance has improved more quickly, and therefore, that ratio changes a bit over time. So I suspect, over time, it may be closer to peers than it is right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jennifer Demba with SunTrust Robinson.","Jennifer H. Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","It sounds like you've had a fair amount of success off the bat with the energy team. I'm wondering if you're contemplating hiring any other specialty lending teams. And then my second question revolves around M&A. I'm wondering, Kevin, what you're seeing out there in the landscape right now and if you think there maybe could be some opportunities for Fifth Third to participate in that market in 2013.","Kevin T. Kabat","Yes. Jennifer, a couple of quick items. One is, right now, we're very pleased with the investments made and focused on making sure we drive the full benefit of those investments. And so there isn't anything imminent relative to an expansion of our verticals and the concentrations that we've done in those specialties. So we feel good about that, so nothing that I'm here to announce or talk about today. On the M&A front, what I would tell you is, look, it's -- it is a challenging time. I think those that can demonstrate that they can return and make a good return in this challenging environment should see some opportunities begin to emerge. I don't know how soon that happens. Our expectation, what we've talked about, is that we think that's more likely to be an end of the year, maybe even into next year kind of orientation, as people really kind of evaluate what levers they have to pull and what strengths they get to play within this environment. So we're going to be mindful. We're going to be disciplined. We're going to be watchful relative to that, but we're not certainly anticipating something imminently on that front either.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Scinicariello with UBS.","Stephen Scinicariello - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just curious, from a big-picture perspective, as you look at 2013 and all of the many opportunities that Fifth Third has, I was just kind of curious how you would potentially rank order some of them in terms of whether it's just continuing to take market share on the C&I side or the enhancements that you've made on the retail side to drive further fee income and -- or continue to play capital. I mean, as you kind of look at the opportunity set for 2013, how would you rank order those kind of benefits that could flow to you over the course of this year?","Kevin T. Kabat","Yes, this is Kevin. What I would tell you is, look, our orientation is to make sure that we continue to look at those opportunities and leverage them appropriately. I'd -- I would tell you that we feel good about a number of them that you just mentioned. And that certainly, as we look at the business itself and our operating model, investments, the changes and the opportunities before us, we still feel good about in that perspective. Clearly, you're seeing the results of some of those investments begin to materialize, strong C&I, strong commercial growth, strong commercial fee income. In terms of that, we think that's going to be a continued opportunity for us. Mortgage, we will ride and continue to do well in for as long as the refi opportunity continues. But we also like the purchase component of what we drive in that business. It's a good contributor and we double that relative to -- in footprint deposit products and cross-sell that we do from that standpoint. We feel good strategically about how we've positioned our deposit simplification program and the benefits there. Dan talked a little bit about that, and I think that's something further out that we should continue to benefit. And we have a good solid platform design for the environment that we're in today that we can grow and move forward with. And we still think that the repositioning that we've done relative to the other businesses are opportunities for us, as well as our geographies and what our affiliates are doing and our operating model from that perspective. So there are a lot of strengths that we focused on, that we've continued to hone from that standpoint, but I don't feel the luxury of necessarily segregating some out. We're pulling the levers on all of them, and I think it really comes down to our ability to continue to execute, which we feel good about it and plays to a strength of this organization. So that's how I would sum it up for you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Penala with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ebrahim H. Poonawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Ebrahim Poonawala on behalf of Erika. Quick question, just going back to your Vantiv stake. If you can -- I guess, Dan, just talk through the thought process in terms of retaining that stake. Obviously, Vantiv's trading at a much higher PE and relative to the PE assigned to the Fifth Third stock. If you can talk through, in terms of rationale of holding onto that stake versus monetizing that and buying back the stock at current levels, where it's still relatively cheaper in tangible book value basis versus waiting it out much longer.","Daniel T. Poston","Yes. I think we've talked about this a number of times before. Looking at our Vantiv stake from a big-picture perspective over time, we would -- we believe and continue to believe that holding a significant minority stake in another public company is probably not the strategy that we would like to follow longer term. I think the need for us to monetize that or the desire for us to monetize that quickly is moderated or mitigated pretty significantly by the fact that we know that company very, very well. So we have a lot of ties with that company. They were a part of Fifth Third for a long time. We created the company. And therefore, our comfort level that we really know and understand that company and understand its current operations and its current prospects, is very high, and therefore, it gives us the flexibility to accomplish our longer-term objective over time and in a very considered, kind of over a longer timeframe. So we would expect that we would continue to monetize that investment over time as we deem appropriate, but it's not something that we would expect to accomplish quickly or to do in an undisciplined, unthoughtful kind of way.","Ebrahim H. Poonawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Understood. And I guess just one question, following up on your net charge-off guidance of 55 to 60 basis points. I guess just looking forward, where do you think net charge-offs bottom out, given obviously, the marks you've taken over the last few years. Are we close to a bottom in 2013, or can you see charge-offs grind lower into '14, below 50 basis points?","Daniel T. Poston","Yes. I think from an -- there's really 2 different questions, one of which is the question that you ask is the kind of where they bottom out, the other question is where do they normalize, and I think those are 2 different numbers. From a normalization perspective, based on historical results and based on our knowledge of the portfolio and how our underwriting has changed over the last several years, we would expect that kind of normalized charge-offs are probably in the 40-basis-point range, plus or minus. In terms of where charge-off rates bottom out, they're likely to go below that normalized level at some point and then kind of come back up to a normalized level ultimately. So we think on a longer-term basis, 40 basis points, plus or minus, may be a normalized level, we may well hit levels that are somewhat below that ultimately, and I wouldn't -- obviously, we don't expect that this year. We're talking 55 to 60 basis points for this year. So I would expect charge-off rates to continue to come down into '14 or perhaps even '15.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom with RBC Capital Markets.","Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Sorry to belabor this, but just one clarification, Dan, for you, on the word conservatism or conservative on the CCAR request. Just want to understand what that means. Does that mean not -- does conservative mean not trying to touch some of your excess capital, or does conservative mean not reaching for the high end of that targeted payout range that you've held pretty consistently?","Daniel T. Poston","Yes. I think conservative means that if you look at where our capital ratios are, you look at where regulatory minimums are, look at where our internal targets are, we're not trying to get from point A to point B in all 1 year. So we recognize we have excess capital. There are many uses for that excess capital as we go forward. One of which would be to return that to our shareholders. But we've said that our expectation is that the capital plan that we put together will result in our capital ratios remaining fairly stable. So in that respect, we're not drawing down that excess capital by virtue of this capital plan in any kind of significant way, rather, we are seeking to prevent the continued buildup of excess capital at this point in time. And part of that is because we may well have uses for excess capital in the future, but frankly, probably the more immediate reason is we don't believe that the process and the regulatory environment now is conducive to us kind of draining that capital out of the balance sheet at this point in time.","Operator","At this time, we have reached out the allotted time for questions.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Jim Eglseder, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.","Jim Eglseder - Director, Investor Relations","Thank you, Jessica. Good morning. Today, we will be talking with you about our second quarter 2014 results.","This discussion may contain certain forward-looking statements about Fifth Third pertaining to our financial condition, results of operations, plans and objectives. These statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. There are a number of factors that could cause results to differ materially from historical performance in these statements. We have identified some of these factors in our forward-looking cautionary statement at the end of our earnings release and in other materials and we encourage you to review them. Fifth Third undertakes no obligation and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call.","I am joined on the call today by several people; our CEO, Kevin Kabat and CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Frank Forrest, Chief Risk and Credit Officer; and Treasurer, Jamie Leonard. During the question-and-answer period, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator.","With that, I will turn the call over to Kevin Kabat. Kevin?","Kevin Kabat - Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. We reported second net income to common shareholders of $416 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.49. Results included a $125 million gain in the sale of Vantiv shares, a $63 million positive valuation on the Vantiv warrant, litigation reserve charges of $61 million and a few other items that Tayfun will cover. In total, these items benefited EPS in the quarter by approximately $0.06.","Economic data has improved throughout the quarter and the economy appears to be moving in a positive direction after a weak first quarter. Although housing activity was slower than expected, new job formation should continue to help households increase their spending, while they further improve their balance sheets. We are also at a point in this cycle, where we would expect to see capital expenditures pickup after a lengthy period, where business investment has not been strong.","Our overall financials are in line with and reflect the current state of the markets, regulatory environment and economic activity. Given this background, I am pleased with our results and believe that we will continue to grow our company profitably as conditions continue to improve. The strategies that we have executed including our deposit simplification project and diversified investments in corporate banking as well as ongoing activities such as the enhancements to our retail banking approach are together producing very good results in this environment and will be a differentiating factor for Fifth Third now and in the future.","Loan growth remains solid despite relatively cautious customer demand. Average portfolio loans grew $1 billion sequentially and $3.8 billion from last year. Growth was driven by C&I, which was up 2% sequentially and 10% compared with last year. The sequential increase in commercial line utilization from 30% to 32% is an encouraging sign indicative of the relative improvement in the economic environment.","Commercial real estate balances continue to trend up increasing 2% from last quarter as a result of growth in construction balances. NII was up 1% sequentially and 2% from the prior year as asset growth continues to offset the negative effect of loan re-pricing. I am pleased with our ability to grow net interest income during this prolonged low interest rate environment.","We continue to generate solid core deposit growth, which was up 1% compared with last quarter driven by 5% growth in consumer savings and money market balances. Year-over-year core deposits were up 9% driven by 16% growth in commercial core deposit balances. Continued growth in core deposits is a sign of the strength of our retail deposit franchise and the growing scale and scope of our commercial relationships.","Operating results were highlighted by card and processing revenue, up 11% sequentially and 12% from a year ago driven by increased transaction volume and card utilization. Additionally, service charges on deposits were up 5% sequentially and corporate banking revenue was up 3% sequentially. Our results this quarter benefited from the sale of a portion of our ownership stake in Vantiv as well as a positive mark on the warrant that we hold. Our combined stake in Vantiv is uniquely valuable with significant remaining capacity. As we have said before strategically, we will continue to reduce our ownership in the best interest of our shareholders.","Quarterly expenses were flat sequentially and were down 8% from the prior year. Elevated litigation-related expenses prevented a larger decline this quarter. If you exclude the litigation charges in all periods, non-interest expense was down 1% sequentially and 9% from the prior year. Going forward we will maintain our focus on expense management as you would expect from us, while we continue to invest in our infrastructure and business lines to support long-term sustainable growth.","Credit results were stronger during the quarter as expected with net charge-offs of 45 basis points. These charge-off levels are in line with what we would expect at this point in the credit cycle and with our overall credit metrics. Non-performing asset levels were down 12% sequentially and 28% from last year and our non-performing asset ratio declined below 100 basis points for the first time since the third quarter 2007. Capital levels remained very strong. Our Tier 1 common ratio was 9.6% on a Basel I basis and 9.3% pro forma for U.S. Basel III rules. And our Tier 1 capital ratio increased 35 basis points to 10.8%.","During the quarter we conducted several actions under our 2014 capital plan including raising our quarterly common dividend by 8% and entering into an agreement to repurchase $150 million of common stock. Additionally, we issued 300 million of perpetual preferred stock during the quarter. Our tangible book value grew 9% year-over-year. Our capital generation and our overall capital position give us the ability to support balance sheet growth while continuing to return capital to shareholders in a prudent manner.","Along with very good financial results I want to highlight the positive impact we are having in our communities. We were recently recognized by Gallup Organization for our commitment to employee engagement, diversity and inclusion. Gallup noted the consistent investment we have made in these areas and the benefit it\u2019s had for employees and customers. Our innovative partnerships with NextJob and Stand Up To Cancer have been a success story recognized publicly. We were the first in the industry to partner with NextJob to offer job coaching services to our unemployed mortgage borrowers. We are now running a reemployment marketing campaign which leverages the power of social media to help job seekers reach perspective employers.","Our partnership with Stand Up To Cancer led to the introduction of branded credit and debit cards that direct donations to the organization for every qualifying purchase made with those cards. We are the only card issuer to offer these affinity products and we are seeing real benefits from the relationship including better retention and higher cross sell with these customers. In addition, we surpassed the $2 million mark for donations to Stand Up To Cancer since this partnership began last year. Efforts like these make a real difference to our customers and the communities where we live and work and you can expect to see more innovative approaches from us in line with our focus on growing relationships with value added offerings. We have a role in enhancing the lives of our employees and customers and we take that responsibility seriously as we make our business decisions.","Overall, I am pleased with our results this quarter. We remain focused on the things we can control to differentiate results lending and deposit generation, business execution and disciplined expense management. With that let me turn it over to Tayfun now to discuss operating results in more detail and give some comments about our outlook. Tayfun?","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer","Thanks Kevin. Good morning and thank you for joining us. The financial summary on Page 4 of the presentation notes some highlights from the quarter. We reported net income to common shareholders of $416 million or $0.49 per diluted share. Second quarter earnings included the following items that in total benefited results by approximately $0.06. The $125 million pretax gain on the sale of Vantiv shares and $63 million positive valuation on the Vantiv warrant were partially offset by $61 million in litigation reserve charges and $17 million impairment charge on bank premises and $16 million in negative valuation adjustment under Visa total return swap and a $12 million negative impact to equity method earnings from our interest in Vantiv related to the one-time impact of their acquisition of Mercury Payment Systems during the quarter. Earnings per share adjusted for these items were $0.43 a share, consistent with a similarly adjusted $0.43 in the first quarter.","Our operating results were solid reflecting the modest rebound in the economy following the weakness in the first quarter and some pickup in spending activity by businesses and consumers. Housing activity has been weaker than anticipated at the beginning of the year and consumers are maintaining their conservative perspective on new leverage. The environment is challenging, but we remain committed to achieving positive operating leverage and prudently growing leverage.","I will start the detailed review with the average balance sheet and Page 5 of the presentation. Average earning assets increased 2% sequentially driven by higher investments and lower balances. In the second quarter, average investment securities increased by $1.3 billion or 6% from the first quarter reflecting $3.3 billion of purchases partially offset by sales of lower yielding assets as we continue to optimize our liquidity position. Notably, since the second quarter of 2013, we have added $6.7 billion to the securities portfolio, increasing our investment portfolio as a percent of total assets from 13.5% a year ago to 17.6% at the end of the second quarter. With respect to our securities portfolio, the absolute level of rates creates an environment that is only marginally attractive beyond the LCR driven activity. For the remainder of 2014, we expect total interest earning assets to grow more in line with average loan growth.","Shifting to loans, average portfolio loans increased $1 billion or 1% from the first quarter. Sequential growth was driven by a $1.1 billion increase in commercial loan balances, with 2% growth each in C&I and commercial real estate. C&I balances reflected line utilization of 32%, up from 30% in the first quarter, which was partially offset by run-off and pay-down activities. Higher average CRE balances were driven by growth in commercial construction balances for the sixth consecutive quarter partially offset by lower commercial mortgage balances.","New commercial loan production was up 29% from the first quarter. Slightly more than half of the new production was through our large corporate, mid-corporate and structured finance segments. Commensurate with our strong presence in Midwestern states, a little more than 20% of new production represented loans to the manufacturing industry. Average consumer loans were flat on a linked quarter basis as run-off in home equity balances continues to offset modest growth in other consumer loan categories.","On the deposit side, average core deposits increased $1.3 billion in the second quarter primarily driven by consumer money market account growth. Importantly, we continue to grow net new accounts and our customers are holding higher average balances. Our current cross-sell ratio in retail is about 5.5 products for consumer checking households, which is up from before our deposit simplification changes and we believe that we can improve this already strong household penetration level going forward. It\u2019s been a full year since we completed the final leg of the conversion of our consumer deposit account offerings to a more simplified platform and it\u2019s clearly having the intended results both in terms of consumer deposit behavior as well as fee income, which I will touch on in a minute.","But first taking a look at NII on Page 6 of the presentation, taxable equivalent net interest income increased $7 million sequentially to $905 million driven by interest earning asset growth, including loan growth and a $1.3 billion increase in average investment securities balances as well as an additional day in the second quarter. These benefits offset the negative effects of loan re-pricing and higher interest expense associated with debt issuances over the last two quarters. The net interest margin was 315 basis points, down 7 basis points from the first quarter as expected. The effects of loan re-pricing, debt issuances and day count were partially offset by higher yields on investment securities.","Shifting to fees on Page 7 of the presentation, second quarter non-interest income was $736 million compared with $564 million last quarter. Vantiv again provided the most significant sequential impact with a $125 million gain on the sale of shares and a $63 million positive warrant valuation partially offset by a $12 million negative impact to equity method of income from our interest in Vantiv that\u2019s related to certain charges they recognized as a result of the acquisition of Mercury Payment Systems in June. Excluding the Vantiv items in both quarters, the decline in fee income was due to lower mortgage banking net revenue, a $17 million negative valuation adjustment for land upon which we no longer expect to build branches and a $16 million negative valuation adjustment on the Visa total return swap.","We have previously described what was going in the retail bank around our distribution network and the impact of changing consumer preferences. As part of our ongoing effort to optimize our retail distribution strategy, we continually evaluate the composition of our branch network and land parcels. In the second quarter, we determined that a number of properties we have originally intended for future banking centers no longer meet our targets. Based on the appraisals we have received we booked $17 million impairment charge in the quarter reduced their carrying value to estimated fair value.","Moving on to line item results within fee income starting with mortgage banking revenue. Residential mortgage originations increased to $2 billion with 70% purchase volume as we benefited from the uptick from the spring buying season partially offset by the impact of our decision to exit the broker origination business in March. If we exclude broker originations from the first and second quarter number originations increased 36% in each quarter. Despite higher origination mortgage banking net revenue declined sequentially due entirely to $32 million swing on net servicing asset valuation adjustments which were a negative $26 million this quarter compared with positive $6 million in the first quarter.","Other components of mortgage banking revenue were more stable with gains on mortgages sold, up 3% reflecting the higher origination volume. Gain on sale margins declined 4 basis points sequentially to 238 basis points and servicing fees were flat sequentially at $62 million. Investment advisory fees were also strong this quarter. You will see that sequentially as the first quarter is seasonally strong but the business showed 4% growth year-over-year benefiting from a 10% increase in personal assets under management as well as higher market values.","Card and processing revenue and service charges on deposits rebounded from a seasonally light first quarter, up $8 million and $6 million respectively but also showed growth compared with last year. 12% growth in card and processing revenue from a year ago reflected progress on our goal to increase the number of cards our customers have and the utilization of those cards as well as higher consumer purchase volume. Year-over-year growth in deposit service charges of 2% was driven by a 7% increase in commercial deposit fees as we are continuing to drive deeper relationships on that side of the business.","Our results demonstrate the progress we have made in forming new customer relationships as well as selling new products and services to existing customers. The positive results in our deposit fees show that our fee revenue growth strategies in both consumer and business segments based on innovative value added products and services are achieving the intended outcome.","Corporate banking revenue increased 3% sequentially with a pickup in syndication fees and foreign exchange fees. Growth of 1% from a year ago is driven by higher syndication fees and institutional sales revenue given our focus on increasing (lead) left relationships to better position ourselves to earn a greater share of our customers\u2019 non-credit business. In sum, our core fee income performance held strong despite the challenging revenue environment. We have done a good job of driving long-term profitability in our core businesses, while overcoming the impact of businesses that we have exited like the brokerage mortgages.","The other side of the equation is our commitment to expense discipline. Non-interest expense shown on Page 8 of the presentation was $954 million this quarter compared with $950 million in the first quarter. Expense results included $61 million in litigation reserve charges higher than the expected as regulatory and litigation costs to remain a headwind which you can see in the recent announcements from other peers. We would expect these charges to decline from these levels although it\u2019s hard to predict when that will happen.","Excluding litigation charges adjusted expenses were well controlled and were $892 million which was down $6 million sequentially when normalized for the first quarter litigation charge as well. This sequential decline reflected lower benefits expense from seasonally higher first quarter levels and was partially offset by higher long-term incentives that were paid in the quarter. Our FTE count declined a percent from the first quarter. We did see higher card and processing expense sequentially in line with the higher revenue earned in that business during the quarter. All other lines were good and we remain pleased with our ability to manage our core expense levels.","PPNR shown on Page 9 of the presentation was $682 million. When adjusted for the items noted on the slide, PPNR was $593 million, up slightly from the first quarter adjusted PPNR, the result of NII performance and the core expense discipline I just mentioned. The efficiency ratio adjusted on the same basis was approximately 60% for the quarter.","Turning to credit results on Page 10, total net charge-offs of $105 million decreased $67 million sequentially, with a $57 million decline in commercial net charge-offs and a $10 million decline in consumer net charge-offs. As we expected, net charge-offs of 45 basis points of average loans and leases returned to trend. Total delinquencies remained low at $337 million. Non-performing assets of $832 million at quarter end were down $114 million from the first quarter bringing the NPA ratio to 92 basis points, its lowest level in seven years.","Commercial NPLs of $396 million declined 15% sequentially and reflects overall improved financial results in several large relationships as well as the lower level of inflows. As you know, the snick exam has been a topic of interest given the public discussion during the quarter. Results are generally communicated to banks in the second quarter. While I can\u2019t get further into specifics, the results we received were very much in line with our own internal assessments and we don\u2019t currently expect any material impacts next quarter related to the exam.","Wrapping up on credit, the allowance for loan and lease losses declined $25 million sequentially and reserve coverage remains solid at 1.61% of loan and leases. I would reiterate that future changes in our reserves will increasingly reflect loan growth more than the changing credit profile of the overall portfolio. The pace of reserve releases slowed this quarter and I anticipate that trend to continue.","Turning to capital on Slide 11, capital levels continue to be strong and well above regulatory requirements. The Tier 1 common equity ratio was 9.6%, up 10 basis points from last quarter and the Tier 1 capital ratio increased \u2013 Tier 1 capital ratio increased 35 basis points to 10.8%. During the quarter, we announced an 8% increase in the quarterly common dividend to $0.13 per share as well as common stock repurchases of $150 million. The average diluted share count is down another 1% sequentially and is the lowest we have seen since the end of 2010.","We also issued $300 million of preferred Series J, which means the total amount of preferred stock in Tier 1 capital to $1.3 billion or 111 basis points of risk-weighted assets. Just so you have it for your models, the Series J issuance carries a semi-annual dividend, which would normally be about $7 million every quarter starting in September. However, this will be about $5 million in third quarter as a result of the shorter first dividend. Similarly, our Series H issuance carries a semi-annual dividend which would be about $15 million every other quarter paid in June and December. And the Series I issuance carries a $7.5 million quarterly dividend. Therefore, our third quarter preferred dividend should be $12 million and then it should resume its normal alternating pattern of $22.5 million in the fourth quarter, $15 million in the first quarter and so on.","Now, turning to the outlook on Page 12, we have updated parts of the slide to reflect any changes to our full year expectations. As in the past, comparisons exclude the impact of any gains on Vantiv share sales and changes in warrant value in 2014 and 2013 as indicated in the footnote on the slide. Our NII, NIM and balance sheet expectations are unchanged. I will start with net interest income. We expect full year 2014 NII to increase from full year 2013 NII of $3.6 billion in the 2% growth range. The key drivers of the 2014 growth are loan growth and higher investment securities balances partially offset by increased funding costs and some additional loan spread comparison. We still expect NII to trend up throughout the year. We anticipate a full year NIM in the 315 basis points range plus or minus again unchanged from prior guidance as we continue to evaluate our LCR position and see continued effects of re-pricing.","Our NII guidance includes the impact of the decision we made earlier this year to limit the availability of our deposit advance product to existing customers. We continue to evaluate possible banking solutions that would be appropriate for a potentially wider segment of customers. We are reviewing alternative options to offer products and services to these customers taking into account their needs and preferences.","We would also aim for any transition plans to minimize disruption for our customers. It is critical that we get this right utilizing the time we have to do so. We will inform you of our plans as we conclude these reviews. Although the outcome will depend on the final product design and customer usage, the revenues will be considerably lower than our existing deposit advance product, but the outcome will depend on the final product design and customer usage.","Turning to loan growth, we still expect mid single-digit growth for the full year primarily driven by growth in C&I and commercial real estate. These increases will be partially offset by declines in residential mortgage balances and continued run-off in the home equity portfolio. We continue to expect a mid single-digit increase in deposits driven by both commercial and consumer.","Moving on to overall fee income and expense expectations for 2014. As a reminder, these comparisons exclude $534 million in 2013 fee income related to gains on Vantiv sales and changes in the warrant value. Our 2014 guidance likewise excludes any effect from these Vantiv items. Largely reflecting the current mortgage environment and our exit from the broker channel, we currently expect a low double-digit decline in total fee income in 2014 compared with adjusted fee income in 2013, which includes negative impact from the charges to Vantiv equity method income and bank-owned land we discussed earlier totaling $29 million. We would expect mortgage banking to remain relatively flat versus the second quarter for the remainder of the year. Excluding mortgage, we expect fees to grow in the mid single-digits range in aggregate versus 2013 with growth in all other major fee categories. Within this guidance, based on the timing of some categories, we expect fee income trends to accelerate in the fourth quarter, which also revamped from the TRA payment that we expect to receive from Vantiv.","Looking at the details within fees, we would expect to see low single-digit percentage growth in deposit fees although commercial service charges are growing at a mid single-digit pace. We expect investment advisory revenue growth in the mid single-digits range with strong growth in our asset management fees and more moderate growth in brokerage income. And we expect corporate banking revenue growth in the 10% range with the bulk of the growth in the fourth quarter. This is slightly below our previous guidance driven by low volatility in the markets, which is having a negative impact on dividend and foreign exchange volumes. We are increasing our expectations for card and processing revenue growth to be in the high single-digits range.","Turning to expenses, we expect full year non-interest expense to be down in the mid single-digits range perhaps about 5% relative to reported 2013 expenses. We currently expect expenses in the third quarter to be up slightly from the $893 million core expenses we reported in the second quarter, excluding any unforeseen one-time items. As always, we remain committed to managing our expenses in line with revenue trends while maintaining appropriate investments in the company to build future revenue streams and risk infrastructure in light of the changing business and regulatory environment.","Overall, we still expect to achieve positive core operating leverage in 2014, excluding Vantiv. We expect PPNR to be relatively stable for the year compared with 2013 and we still expect the efficiency ratio to move below 60% in the second half of the year. As for taxes, we expect the full year 2014 effective tax rate to be in the 27% to 27.5% range.","Turning to credit, our outlook for full year net charge-offs is relatively unchanged and remains around 50 basis points for the year. We still expect a significant decline in NPAs, down about 15% from last year\u2019s levels further reducing the NPA ratio. With respect to loan loss reserves, we continued to expect the benefit of improvement in credit results to be partially offset by new reserves related to loan growth.","All in, we produced another solid quarter. This is a tough competitive environment where the focus is clearly on execution and we will continue to drive towards improving performance where we feel we can do better. That wraps up my remarks. Jessica can you open the line for questions please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley","And just in terms of the deposit advance products, looking at yields, it looks like they are down about four percentage points this quarter to about 35, has anything changed in terms of your expectation for how quickly that does run off and just to be super clear all that run off is already or is it already included in your current guidance? Thanks.","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes, the progress on EAX this year is included in our guidance. I would say that the behavior, customer behavior is relatively in the range of our expectations. It is not a whole lot different from where expected when we made the announcement earlier this year.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley","Understood and you guys have not \u2013 do you have an estimate in terms of timing of when you might come up with an alternative product?","Tayfun Tuzun","We are working on it Ken. Clearly it\u2019s a pretty complex process. We know obviously that some agencies have provided guidance, others are working on it. There is no full clarity. And I think we have obviously a group of people working on it and we will be working on it for the remainder of the year. And we will share the upgrades with you as soon as we have more clarity. But I think it will take number of months before we can clarify where we are going.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley","Alright. And then last question just in terms of the litigation charges I guess Fifth Third is not one of the banks that normally think about having of \u2013 having high litigation expense, but can you give us anymore color in terms of what\u2019s driving those expenses and whether there is any kind of resolution and insight on that? Thanks.","Tayfun Tuzun","I am afraid I am not going to be able to give you more details than what is in our filings and you can go to our latest 10-Q filing and look at the items that we discussed. Its environmental, we are dealing similar issues that other banks are dealing with. And we expect these litigation charges obviously to end. And we don\u2019t necessarily have a clear path to calendar time and will end, but the issues that we are dealing with are not a lot different from the issues that other peer banks are dealing with.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley","Alright. Thank you very much.","Tayfun Tuzun","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Miller from FBR Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets","Hi, this is Jessica Ribner for Paul, how are you?","Kevin Kabat","How are you?","Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets","Good, thank you. We have one question just on the mortgage banking side of the business, how are you addressing the segment as a whole and what\u2019s going in the market that we are looking probably a sub-trillion market weighted towards purchase, but the purchase market hasn\u2019t come back like we thought, how are you thinking about that going forward?","Tayfun Tuzun","Right and we agree with you that our expectations coming to this year with respect to the spring and summer season were higher than what the actuals are coming out at. The volumes are lower. From our perspective the other added element is we decided to exit the brokerage channel in \u2013 during the first quarter that clearly is impacting our volumes. In terms of the remainder of this season and remainder of the year we are not expecting significant changes to our origination volumes. Our origination volumes when you exclude the brokerage channel are up at a very healthy level. Our pipeline when you exclude again the impact of the brokerage channel is actually up at a very healthy level 30 plus percent as well. So we have lowered our expectations given the housing activity that we have seen over the past two, three months. And our guidance for the remainder of the year reflects that sort of more of a flat performance on the top line revenue in that business.","Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets","Okay. And then just in terms of July, have you seen any upward trends from the second quarter?","Tayfun Tuzun","In terms of just mortgage or overall?","Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets","In terms of mortgage.","Tayfun Tuzun","Similar trends, once you get it late into the season, these trends don\u2019t necessarily change much month-over-month. So, I would say that what you are seeing out with respect to housing data is probably reflective of what we are seeing.","Jessica Ribner - FBR Capital Markets","Okay, great. Thank you so much.","Tayfun Tuzun","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Erika Najarian from Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Yes, good morning. Thank you.","Tayfun Tuzun","Good morning.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","My first question is in terms of your progress or if you prefer what inning you are in terms of reaping potential savings from your retail distribution resizing sort of where are you on your progress? And as we think about 2015, we appreciate certainly the guidance for the efficiency ratio in the second half, but if the interest rate environment doesn\u2019t change, is there enough potential savings left in the till to continue to drive the efficiency ratio down further next year?","Tayfun Tuzun","I believe that there is more room in our expenses. Clearly, we have been very focused in looking at the revenue trends, in looking at the future of our businesses with and without an increase in the interest rate environment and our efforts so far have produced very good results. Now, in terms of the retail business, the demographic trends and the customer usage trends are changing very rapidly. So, we end up adjusting our expectations continuously as every month data comes in with respect to how heavily customers are using the digital channels. We are up over 30% now in terms of the total deposit transactions that are coming through the ATMs and the mobile app. So \u2013 and also our pilot projects with respect to the design of our branches, with respect to the type of employment that we have in those branches are producing good results as well. So, there it is going to the more room as we continue to invest in technology and as the customers are also likely to exceed our expectations as to how they interact with us.","Going back to what that means for efficiency ratio just even sort of beyond 2015, we have always said that where we are as a company 55% efficiency ratio with somehow from the interest rate environment is very achievable. We continue to believe that. And we will do our best to time the movement and the efficiency ratio along with the revenue patterns that we see. But for now, I think the fact that we are guiding to a sub 60% level for the second half of the year is pretty good given the rather subdued economic environment that we are seeing and sort of the challenges that we are facing for example with respect to mortgage revenues. I mean, that\u2019s we are pleased I believe that there is more room and we will do our best to continue to produce those results.","Erika Najarian - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay, thank you for answering my questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from Keith Murray from ISI. Your line is now open.","Keith Murray - ISI","Thank you. Just touching on litigation expense and I appreciate you can\u2019t give too much specific information, but just curious if the increase is related to new items or changes in existing items based on what you have seen in other settlements etcetera?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes, I am afraid I am not going to be able to give you more detail really than what we have in the Q. I mean, we will be updating obviously our 10-Q filing here shortly. If there is any update, we are going to communicate that via Q.","Keith Murray - ISI","Okay. And then just back on the deposit advance products, can you just explain the revenue dynamic for \u201814, so let\u2019s assume for augment sake, you don\u2019t have a replacement product in place by the beginning of \u201815? Would there be like a cliff decline in revenue in the first quarter of \u201815 as you phase out at the end of \u201814 just how does that work?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes. In my discussion at the beginning of this call, I mentioned that we are working both on what the product or the set of products and services is going to look like as well as how we are going to manage the transition period as we tend to \u2013 as we intend to avoid an abrupt disruption to the delivery to our customers, so more to come on that as we get closer to the end of the year.","Keith Murray - ISI","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, guys. Good morning. This is Dan (indiscernible) from Matt\u2019s team.","Tayfun Tuzun","Good morning.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. If you could just comment on the commercial pricing trends that you are seeing and your expectations for that going forward, it seems like utilization was up a little bit this quarter on the commercial side and what do you think that means for C&I growth?","Tayfun Tuzun","We typically \u2013 let me answer the second part of your question. We typically don\u2019t have aggressive assumptions on utilization rates, because we don\u2019t really see an abrupt increase in the economic activity. So, our guidance really does not rely much on continuing pickups in utilization rates. In terms of pricing, it continues to be competitive. The segments that we are growing mid corp and large corp are very attractive segments for all banks and we expect that environment to continue. It likely is not going to change much. The other part from our perspective is we are continuously booking commercial loans on better credit profile compared to previous periods. And so from a new yield perspective, what you are seeing in our overall portfolio yield progress is impacted by that improving credit profile of new loans that are coming on the sheet.","So, in general, we have no expectations that this pricing environment is going to change much. We don\u2019t really and we have not built in any utilization rate increases into our outlook. Our production continues to be very strong. I looked at our production \u2013 new production patterns going back to the beginning of 2011 and if you take out Q4, because Q4 is always a very high origination volume quarter. This quarter\u2019s production beat 8 of the 11 quarters. So, production patterns continue to be well, just the refi and payoff activity is producing more subdued results from a just portfolio outstanding perspective, but we are pleased with the activity levels.","Unidentified Analyst","Alright, thank you. Just lastly, can you just remind us of the pace of the contingent tax liability going forward?","Tayfun Tuzun","In terms of dollars, dollar payment?","Unidentified Analyst","Dollars and timing.","Tayfun Tuzun","The timing is you are talking about Vantiv I am assuming.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes.","Tayfun Tuzun","Okay. So, the timing is going to be Q4 and as we have discussed this is a very long series of contingent cash flows upwards of 15 years. And our \u2013 when you look at Vantiv\u2019s filings based on what they disclosed, the Q4 amount is about $23 million.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thank you very much.","Tayfun Tuzun","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Foran from Autonomous. Your line is now open.","Brian Foran - Autonomous","Hi. So, I guess not to beat a dead horse on this deposit advance, but is it fair to say if I hear you right, it\u2019s in the \u201814 outlook, but it\u2019s also kind of slowly starting to bleed down. And as we look to \u201815, you have to do the review on the replacement products, but you kind of referenced any replacement product maybe fewer customers that will qualify in the ability to repay, maybe there would be a little bit higher underwriting expense going along with it. So, is it right to think it\u2019s annualizing maybe $125 million I think of revenue right now? And maybe as we look to \u201815 for those would kind of have to put something in the model maybe haircut it by half or something? I mean is that clearly that half is my estimate, not yours, but is it right to think that \u201815 has a step down kind of regardless of what the outcome of the review is and it\u2019s just a question of how much that step down is?","Tayfun Tuzun","Look, I mean, I think we have not provided guidance with respect to \u201815 on specific percentage terms. The other thing that I want to clarify is we believe that ultimately the solution needs to be evaluated as more of a different nature of products and services rather than just one-for-one product substitution, because the nature of the offer is going to be broader. We are looking at a package of different products and services that this segment is going to need and we are designing our offer relative to that type of demand. What\u2019s difficult is ultimately it is the new offer or bundle of products and services is going to address a most likely a wider segment of customers than the set of customers who are using our existing EAX product. So, part of the change in the revenues and profits tied to this is going to depend on that widening up in customer base. Whether the number is 50%, 60% lower, I don\u2019t have enough information, if I had I would have given you that guidance today. But in terms of there is going to be at the end of 2014, we will update you guys on that progress, but clearly the change in the revenue line item in \u201815 is going to be reflective of a more discreet change on revenue that are coming through that line.","Brian Foran - Autonomous","It\u2019s very helpful. On the commercial side, I guess two numbers that I was grappling with, one on the NPL inflows. Clearly, there is kind of a walk back in most credit metric this quarter, which is good news. The NPL inflows have been a little higher kind of as a run rate if I smooth out over the past couple of quarters. So, I wonder if you could just talk broadly about the commercial credit cycle and whether do you think we are bouncing along the trough or whether you think we are starting kind of a process of normalization fully realizing that there were some unusual credits last quarter, let\u2019s call them? And then secondly, I think you mentioned the commercial core deposit growth was up 16% year-over-year, I guess regardless of whether that number is right more broadly as you think about commercial deposits, any ability you had to parse apart, how much of it is core customer growth, new accounts, things like that versus how much of it you feel like might be excess liquidity sitting around because of the low rate cycle?","Frank Forrest","This is Frank Forrest. Let me take the first part of your question and I will let Tayfun answer the second part. On the NPL question, we are certainly making very good progress and continuing to move both NPAs and NPLs down. We did have a slight pushup in the second quarter on NPLs. Quite frankly, that came from a very thorough review of our portfolio, specifically our leverage book. So, we had a few credits that we moved into the NPL category as a result of that review. We are very pleased overall however with the review and the quality of the book once we went back and reconfirmed it. But the overall trend and the guidance we have given both on NPAs and NPLs projects that we continue to see opportunity for further decline through the end of this year into next year. We are working that very carefully. We are very pleased with the results today than especially with the decline in NPAs in the second quarter. So, there is still room for improvement.","Tayfun Tuzun","On the commercial deposit side, I would say that the increase that we have seen is related to core growth, our existing customers and relationships. It\u2019s difficult to judge how much of that core increase is related to the excess liquidity that they have, but clearly in this LCR environment, our focus is on LCR friendly core commercial deposit growth, but there is clearly a segment of that increase that is related to excess liquidity. Jamie, I don\u2019t know if you have any additional comments on that?","Jamie Leonard","Yes. I think the nature of your question is just getting in how are we modeling deposit behavior for what potentially could be a rising rate environment. And one of the things we continue to do is reevaluate what occurred in 2004 which was the last time we entered a Fed tightening cycle. And for us, three significant differences with how we model the deposit behavior going forward versus what we actually experienced back then, one is we currently assume no lag in increasing deposit rates whereas back then you certainly had a lag and how the industry responded to raising rates in order to restore historical deposit spreads. Second, we have a higher level of absolute betas assumed today than we did actually experienced back then. But then finally, to your point we do assume significant run off in certain deposit classes and wholesale DDAs is one of them. So we do model fairly significant run off and yet after all of these conservative and prudent modeling we still are asset sensitive and pretty comfortable with our position.","Brian Foran - Autonomous","That is very helpful. Thank you.","Kevin Kabat","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Kevin Kabat","Good morning Ken.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Tayfun to your comments earlier about expenses understanding that you are anticipating a sub-60 efficiency ratio, is the second quarter where you guys have done really well and relatively well compared to expectations on core expenses, yet we see a reduction in the fee guidance and no further reduction in the expense guidance, so I am just wondering what those moving dynamics are between revenues and expenses in terms of the delta in pre-pre and what are the drivers of incremental expense growth that you wouldn\u2019t be able to adjust against the changes you are making on the fee outlook side?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes, just to reiterate the outlook. The outlook is for the entire year and is reflective of sort of the realized changes in mortgage. And in corporate mortgages clearly it\u2019s been affected by a little bit higher amortization in the MSI itself. As we look forward to the remainder of the year, we still believe that we are going to do a good job of non-interest income and different fee categories we had very expectations as we updated payment processing, IA continues to be strong. And corporate banking activity is going to be strong as well. It\u2019s currently being impacted by low volatility in certain sensitive line items.","The expenses, there are some seasonal changes from Q2 to Q3. The market specifically picks up in Q3. There are some \u2013 the impact of known amortizations from previous capital investments in IT etcetera. Remember we are continuing to invest in the company. We are not stopping it. But clearly what I would tell you is whether we achieve it in a given quarter, if we do see significant changes to revenue we do actually act and we make sure that our expense line does not necessarily cross the revenue growth line. So what I can tell you is so far we have done a good job in adjusting our expenses based on revenue trends and some of it obviously has been impacted by important decisions exiting brokerage channel was an important event that impacted the mortgage line of revenues. But I can guarantee you that the focus on expenses is very much high on our priority list. We believe that when you see our numbers going forward we will continue to prove that it\u2019s a high priority item.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Okay and my second question is the automobile loans line has been now flat line for a several quarters and understanding the competition and the spreads that are out there flushed out against the fact that SAAR industry sales are continuing to go up every quarter, can you just talk about originations versus pay downs and where you stand on desire to grow that business?","Tayfun Tuzun","So let me give you a couple of data points with respect to production. Last year\u2019s Q2 2013 production was $1.6 billion I think first quarter was $1.3 billion that\u2019s down from $1.4 billion in Q1. We are being very careful in putting to work our shareholders equity in that business line and we are trying to find the best balance as we get into right profitability and the right product profile. The business continues to be very competitive, good pay off performance is really not much different, so with the impact of the outstanding volumes is really more due to changing production patterns. Our first goal is to book profitable loans. We are not going after volume and we will not change that approach. We have done a better job the last six months compared to the previous six months in achieving a better spread in that business and we kept the credit profile, duration profile of that business fairly stable. So, we are pleased. We are not complaining that origination volumes are slightly down, but we will continue to look for opportunities and when it\u2019s time to increase production, we will do so, but it has to be done on a profitable basis. We are not going to just do it to show higher loan growth.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Tayfun Tuzun","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Mayo from CLSA. Your line is now open.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Hi. Your lower guidance for fees and pre-provision net revenue, is that solely due to the reduction in mortgage that we have seen so far year-to-date?","Tayfun Tuzun","Largely, yes. I mean, there is some drop in corporate revenues that are more against sensitive item interest rate derivative volume was a little bit less than we expected. Our investment advisory business is doing well, bit below because we are moving that business from a transactional focus to a stable growth in asset management, but in general, Mike, it\u2019s more reflective of what\u2019s happening in mortgage than anything else.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","And is the forward guidance indicative of everything you have seen so far year-to-date, whether it\u2019s the investment advisory, the mortgage broker channel, or the MSR write-down or is that also more subdued expectations when you look ahead?","Tayfun Tuzun","It\u2019s more reflective of what we have seen.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Okay. So, there is no real change in the forward outlook, except that it starts for a little lower base?","Tayfun Tuzun","That\u2019s about right, yes.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Okay. But if a lot of this is due to the mortgage broker channel, why wouldn\u2019t you have known about this guidance after first quarter earnings, I mean, what\u2019s the new information here?","Tayfun Tuzun","I think what\u2019s happened was that the change was a bit more abrupt than what we expected. The MSR performance clearly when you compare just when you look at Q1 numbers, our hedge gains were a little bit higher in Q1 moving production away from broker mortgage also impacted the amortization of the asset itself as new originations were a bit lower than we expected. So, it\u2019s a combined effect between what\u2019s happening to the servicing asset as well as the origination volumes.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Sure. But wouldn\u2019t you have known about that amortization change since you knew in advance you were moving product away from the broker channel or was there something that was missed or the rates changed or something changed, right?","Tayfun Tuzun","Just remember going back to the earlier part of the discussion, somebody asked what we thought about the housing activity on origination levels, even excluding the broker channel we put on less in our servicing portfolio than we originally anticipated due to the subdued housing activity. So, we thought that the purchase activity would be higher even just based on our retail channels.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Okay. But as it relates to mortgage really the damage has been done as reflected by this quarter\u2019s results?","Tayfun Tuzun","We believe that we will have a fairly flat performance in mortgage for the remainder of the year, yes.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Okay. Switching gears, so what were second quarter revenues from the deposit advance product?","Tayfun Tuzun","About $30 million.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","$30 million, okay.","Tayfun Tuzun","That\u2019s a gross number.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","And what was the net?","Tayfun Tuzun","I don\u2019t have the credit numbers in front of me, Mike, we can\u2026","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Or even ballpark, I mean, I will take is it bigger than a breadbox sort of answer here, just trying to size this.","Tayfun Tuzun","It\u2019s just about a breadbox probably.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","You can buy lot of breadboxes for $30 million. So, I mean, what sort of loss rates do you have on this product?","Tayfun Tuzun","Mike, I don\u2019t have those numbers with me, but it\u2019s a small number, it\u2019s not a very big number.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Okay. So, this is a big nut to swallow here, I mean either you mitigate this or per the prior question, lose $120 million in revenues per year, is that too draconian simply to take $120 million off the top starting day one of 2015?","Tayfun Tuzun","I believe that is too draconian, ultimately the outcome will depend on the transition period and also the replacement of this revenue stream. But as we said in our opening lines revenues will be considerably lower, but taking the entire amount out I think\u2026","","Mike Mayo - CLSA","And what sort of efficiency ratio does that business line have?","Tayfun Tuzun","A very low efficiency ratio.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Okay. So it\u2019s pretty low. As far as your buybacks, shares were reduced by 1%, but you didn\u2019t redeploy the Vantiv gain, so should we assume maybe the pace of buybacks picking up here in the next quarter?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes. I mean they should, it\u2019s more of a really calendar issue Mike, it\u2019s we will obviously resume our activities as we get out of blackout period. So it\u2019s not indicative of a change in pattern. And we should \u2013 we should see a pick up here in the activity this quarter.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","When does your blackout period end?","Jamie Leonard","Look, Mike its Jamie. The more important thing is the current ASR expires at the end of July.","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes. So it\u2019s difficult to have two ASRs at the same time in the market you can do it but, our blackout there is started with our Board meeting in mid-June and its now is over with this earnings release.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","And just a follow up on that, at what price level does it make sense to buyback your stock I mean up to what price or what sort of parameters do you use for that?","Tayfun Tuzun","So far we have focused on share buybacks as a systemic return of capital to our shareholders and we have refrained from necessarily acting based on day-to-day, month-to-month stock awards. We always believe that our stock is a good buy. And so far when we look at the IRR in the last two years of aspiring stock the performance has been very good. We will continue that approach. We still believe that our stock is a very good investment. And at this point we are not necessarily being guided by the stock prices today.","Mike Mayo - CLSA","Sure. Alright, thank you.","Tayfun Tuzun","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Terry McEvoy from Sterne, Agee. Your line is now open.","Terry McEvoy - Sterne, Agee","Hi, thanks. Just one question left on my list. Do you have the Vantiv gain in the second quarter and I am not connecting any dots, but you also had the land valuation adjustment, so you made a decision to look at the value of the land, I am just thinking about the litigation reserve, was that something that could have been taken in future quarters much like the land valuation adjustment or was there something specific in terms of conversations or something that is event driven that was behind that charge?","Tayfun Tuzun","Terry these are totally independent events. The litigation reserves are tied to activity that we see during the quarter and what we have in front of us the land valuation that\u2019s we look at every quarter, so none of these are tied together. These are all independent decisions that we have made based on the facts that we know as of today.","Terry McEvoy - Sterne, Agee","Great, thank you.","Tayfun Tuzun","Thank you.","Operator","And this does conclude today\u2019s conference call. As we have reached our allotted time, you may now disconnect. Thank you."],"9303":["Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ:FITB) Q1 2013 Earnings Call April 18, 2013  9:30 AM ET","Executives","Jeff Richardson - Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Analysis","Kevin T.

My name is Bradley and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bancorp Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Jeff Richardson, Director of Investor Relations, you may begin.","Jeff Richardson","Thanks, Bradley. Good morning. Today, we'll be talking with you about our first quarter 2013 results.","This call may contain certain forward-looking statements about Fifth Third pertaining to our financial condition, results of operations, plans and objectives. These statements involve certain risks and uncertainties.","There are a number of factors that could cause results to differ materially from historical performance in these statements. We've identified some of these factors in our forward-looking cautionary statement at the end of our earnings release and in other materials and we encourage you to review them. Fifth Third undertakes no obligation and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call.","I'm joined on the call by several people: Our CEO, Kevin Kabat; and CFO, Dan Poston; as well as President, Greg Carmichael; Greg Schroeck from Credit; Tayfun Tuzun from Treasury; and Jim Eglseder from Investor Relations. During the question-and-answer period, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin Kabat. Kevin?","Kevin T. Kabat","Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. Fifth Third reported first quarter net income to common shareholders of $413 million and earnings per share of $0.46, was up 7% over last quarter and 2% from a year ago, which included Vantiv IPO results. Earnings this quarter included a benefit from a higher valuation on the Vantiv warrant and net securities gains partially offset by a higher tax rate from the expiration of options and a couple of other smaller items. Dan will discuss these in more detail in his remarks.","Those items in total net to about $0.02, a positive impact on the quarter. Quarterly earnings a year ago included $0.09 in benefit from Vantiv's IPO. Excluding Vantiv in both quarter -- in both quarters, year-over-year earnings per share increased 22%. Return on assets was 1.41% and return on tangible common equity was 15.4%. In addition, tangible book value per share increased 2% sequentially and 8% from a year ago despite the impact of share repurchases. Average sequential loan growth was 2% with particular strength in C&I loans, which were up 6% versus last quarter. Total loan growth from a year ago was 5% despite continued modest runoff in commercial real estate and home equity. C&I and residential mortgage loans increased year-over-year by 16% and 12%, respectively.","Period-end loans were reduced by a $500 million auto securitization and a $60 million jumbo mortgage sale in March. Loan growth was less robust than last quarter as expected, given normal seasonality in the impact of tax law changes that drove some of the year-end activity. Nevertheless, we still produced solid loan growth in the quarter and it should stack up pretty well.","We continue to invest in our lending businesses over the past several years and to improve and leverage a core strength at Fifth Third. We feel very good about our ability to take advantage of opportunities and grow loans as we move forward.","Average core deposits continue to grow and were up 4% from a year ago. Transaction deposits are up almost $4 billion or 5% over last year, including 10% in growth and demand deposits and 7% in interest checking balances. Our fee income results reflect a typical seasonality where we have good momentum in a number of key businesses, which we expect to be more evident in the second quarter. Investment advisory fees of $100 million were a record for us. And mortgage revenue came in a bit better than we had expected after the rate moves in late January in terms of both mortgage gains and the MSR.","Heading into the second quarter, we feel pretty good about a continuation of solid mortgage gain results with the current market environment. Credit trends continue to show steady improvement with net charge-offs down another 10% sequentially and nonperforming assets down 7% or $86 million. Total delinquencies were at their lowest level since the first quarter of 2001.","Capital levels are very strong with Tier 1 common of 9.7% and a leverage ratio of 10%. We would expect that capital levels would continue to be strong under proposed Basel III capital standards as well.","During the quarter, we announced the repurchase of $125 million of common stock. That transaction completed the amount we had approved under the 2012 CCAR plan. In total, inclusive of shares repurchase with gains from Vantiv sales under the 2012 plan, we repurchased $775 million of common stock or approximately 51 million shares. This reduced our diluted share count by 5%, which I'll remind you includes shares issued for compensation. In spite of these repurchases as well as solid asset growth, our Tier 1 common ratio actually increased 6 basis points from a year ago. Our ability to generate capital and our strong capital levels under Basel I or Basel III give us the ability to retain the capital we need to support balance sheet growth while continuing to return capital to shareholders in a prudent manner.","In March, we announced our capital plan relating to the 2013 CCAR process. That plan included a potential dividend increase to $0.12 as well as a number of other actions including further share repurchases. We think our plan is prudent while still returning significant amounts of capital to shareholders and believe that our estimates, as well as the Federal Reserves, demonstrate our capacity to generate capital and to protect our capital base under stress. Our continued ability to generate a relatively high level of profitability from loan growth and solid revenue results, ongoing expense discipline and credit improvement give us confidence that our strategy's working. We feel very good about how we are positioned going forward.","Before turning it over to Dan, I'd like to thank our employees for their continued focus and drive and our customers for their continued business and partnership with Fifth Third.","With that, I'll ask Dan to discuss operating results and give some comments about our outlook. Dan?","Daniel T. Poston","Thanks, Kevin. I'll start with Slide 4 of the presentation and we'll discuss balance sheet, income and credit results for the first quarter before turning to the outlook for the end of my remarks.","Overall, it was a strong quarter for Fifth Third. Earnings per share were $0.46, up $0.03 from last quarter. First quarter results included a $34 million positive valuation adjustment on the Vantiv warrant, which was about $0.025 per share on an aftertax basis. There were a number of other items affecting results, including a seasonally high tax rate and investment securities gains, which essentially offset one another. Those items are outlined in our release and I'll note them where applicable in my comments. As Kevin noted in his remarks, earnings per share increased 22% from a year ago, excluding the $0.09 benefit from Vantiv in the first quarter of 2012 and the $0.02 benefit this quarter.","Turning to Slide 5. Tax equivalent net interest income decreased $10 million sequentially to $893 million and the net interest margin was 3.42% versus 3.49% last quarter. Those results were a bit better than expected, largely due to higher-than-expected mortgage warehouse balances and rates on those assets. The decline in net interest income was driven by a $12 million negative impact from 2 fewer days in the quarter. Additionally, repricing in the loan and securities portfolios contributed to the decline in NII, partially offset by the benefit from net loan growth during the quarter.","Lastly, the full quarter impact of the FHLB debt termination in December provided a $9 million benefit to the sequential comparison. The decrease in net interest margin was driven by lower loan and securities yields, which was partially offset by a 3 basis point benefit from the fourth quarter FHLB debt termination and a 2 basis point benefit from the effective lower day count in the quarter.","On the loan side, we've seen continued compression in yields, primarily driven by loan repricing and mainly in the C&I and auto portfolios. The C&I portfolio average yield was down 11 basis points compared with last quarter. The result of repricing within the portfolio as well as the impact of lower LIBOR rates combined with a continued mix shift toward higher quality loans.","In the indirect auto portfolio, the average yield also continued to decline, largely reflecting portfolio effect of replacing older higher yielding loans with new lower yielding loans. We saw similar yield compression in the securities and short-term investments portfolio, which reflected higher premium amortization than normal as well as continued repricing of cash flows at lower rates. Portfolio yield is now just below 3% and, thus, we'd expect these effects to slow in the second quarter relative to this quarter.","Turning to the balance sheet in Slide 6. Average earning assets increased $2.8 billion sequentially driven by a $2 billion increase in average portfolio loans and leases and a $740 million increase in loans held-for-sale. On an end-of-period basis, total loans were flat sequentially reflecting the impact of the auto loans that were securitized and sold during the quarter. Average securities and short-term investments of $16.8 billion were relatively stable compared with last year.","Looking at each loan portfolio. Average commercial loans held for investment increased $1.9 billion or 4% from the fourth quarter and increased $3.7 billion or 8% from last year. C&I loans of $36.4 billion increased $2.1 billion or 6% from last quarter and increased $5 billion or 16% from a year ago. On an end-of-period basis, C&I loans were up 2% from last quarter. C&I production remains broad based across industries with a large portion of the first quarter production in manufacturing, service, energy and health care sectors, which is reflective of the investments we've made in the capital market space.","Commercial mortgage and commercial construction balances declined in aggregate by $219 million sequentially or 2% as a result of continued runoff in these portfolios. We would expect these portfolios to stabilize in the near term and may see them begin to grow toward the end of the year.","Average consumer loans in the portfolio of $36 billion were relatively flat sequentially and increased $705 million or 2% from a year ago. Residential mortgage loans held for investment were up 2% from the fourth quarter reflecting continued retention of shorter term, high-quality residential mortgages, which are originated through our brand's retail systems.","In the first quarter, we began selling 30-year fixed jumbo mortgages, which we have been retaining and currently would expect to continue to sell such loans going forward. We are still retaining shorter term and variable-rate jumbo mortgage production.","Average auto loans were flat sequentially as originations offset the impact of the $500 million securitization in March. These loans were moved to held-for-sale in February resulting in $169 million increase to average portfolio loans for the quarter and we subsequently securitized and sold those at the end of March. The securitization represented high-quality loans with relatively thin spreads, which don't make much sense for us to continue to hold from a capital perspective. Securitization will reduce net interest income by about $1 million to $2 million per quarter largely offset by increases in other fee income and it has virtually no effect on the net interest margin. Finally, home equity loan balances were down 3% sequentially, while average credit card balances were up 2% sequentially.","Moving on to deposits. Average core deposits increased $631 million or 1% from the fourth quarter. Transaction deposits, which exclude consumer CDs, increased $743 million or 1% sequentially and $3.8 billion or 5% from a year ago. The sequential increase was driven by growth in consumer account balances, which reflected seasonality and higher average balances per account and were partially offset by seasonally lower commercial balances. Consumer CDs declined 3% in the quarter due to our continued disciplined approach to CD pricing.","Turning to fees, which are outlined on Slide 7. First quarter noninterest income was $743 million, compared with $880 million last quarter. Current quarter fee income results included a $34 million positive valuation adjustment on the Vantiv warrant, $17 million in securities gains, a $7 million gain on the sale of certain asset management contracts and $7 million in charges associated with the Visa total return swap.","You'll recall that prior quarter fee income included $138 million in net gains on Vantiv shares and the warrant, $2 million in securities gains and $15 million in charges on the Visa total return swap. Excluding all of these items, fee income was $692 million, was down $63 million or 8% sequentially primarily reflecting declines from record levels of both mortgage banking revenue and corporate banking revenue in the fourth quarter.","Looking at each line item in detail. Deposit service charges decreased 3% sequentially and increased 1% from the prior year. Sequential decrease was driven by seasonally lower consumer overdrafts. Corporate banking revenue of $99 million decreased $15 million from the record levels in the fourth quarter and increased $2 million from last year. The sequential decline was driven by seasonally lower revenues, primarily lower syndication, business lending and derivatives fee revenue. You'll recall that we saw higher than normal levels of activity last quarter ahead of year-end tax law changes, which drove some of the acceleration of revenue into the fourth quarter.","Mortgage banking net revenue of $220 million decreased 15% from the fourth quarter but increased 7% from a year ago. Originations were a record $7.4 billion this quarter compared with $7 billion last quarter. Gain on sale revenue was $169 million, down $70 million from record fourth quarter levels and reflected lower gain on sale margins during the quarter as well as changes in mix. Margins were particularly weak in January although they strengthened in February and March. MSR valuation adjustments, including hedges, were a positive $42 million in the first quarter versus a positive $7 million last quarter.","Investment advisory revenue of $100 million was the highest in company history, increasing 8% from last quarter and 4% from the prior year. The sequential increase was driven by higher brokerage production, seasonal trust tax-preparation fees, as well as higher market values. Card and processing revenue was $65 million, a 1% decrease from seasonally higher fourth quarter levels and an 11% increase from a year ago, reflecting higher sales and transaction volumes.","Turning next to Other income within fees. Other income was $109 million this quarter versus $215 million last quarter. The change is primarily due to Vantiv-related gains, which were a positive $34 million this quarter and a positive $138 million last quarter. First quarter results also included a $7 million gain on the sale of asset management contracts and $7 million in charges associated with the Visa total return swap. Credit costs recorded in other noninterest income were $10 million in the first quarter compared with $13 million last quarter and $14 million a year ago.","Turning to expenses on Slide 8. Noninterest expense of $978 million decreased $185 million sequentially, or 16%. The primary drivers of the decline were due to fourth quarter events, including $134 million charge on the FHLB debt termination, $26 million in additional expense to increase mortgage repurchase reserves and $13 million in litigation reserve charges. Expense results this quarter include a $9 million benefit from the sale of affordable housing investments and $9 million in charges to increase litigation reserves. Excluding these items from both quarters, noninterest expense of $978 million decreased $12 million or 1% from the fourth quarter. The remaining drivers of sequential expense trends were a $27 million seasonal increase in FICA and unemployment expense, which was more than offset by lower employee compensation expense and lower credit costs. Credit-related costs were $24 million this quarter versus $42 million last quarter, excluding the increase in the fourth quarter repurchase reserves that I already mentioned. Realized mortgage repurchase losses were $20 million versus $15 million in the prior quarter. Additionally, first quarter credit-related costs included an $11 million increase in reserves or unfunded commitments versus a $3 million expense last quarter.","Moving on to Slide 9 in PPNR. Pre-provision net revenue was $653 million in the first quarter, an increase from $616 million in the fourth quarter. Excluding the items noted on this slide, adjusted PPNR in the first quarter was $602 million down 6% from very strong fourth quarter levels and up 3% from a year ago. The effective tax rate was 30% this quarter compared with 27% last quarter. The first quarter included $12 million of tax expense due to the expiration of employee stock options, whereas the prior quarter included a $10 million benefit from the termination of leases that were settled in the quarter.","Now turning to credit results. As Kevin mentioned, we continue to see solid credit improvement and positive credit quality trends in the first quarter. Results represent the best overall level of credit performance for Fifth Third since 2007 prior to the financial crisis.","Starting with charge-offs, which are on Slide 10. Total net charge offs of $133 million declined $14 million or 10% from the fourth quarter and $87 million or 39% from a year ago. The net charge-off ratio was 63 basis points this quarter. That compares with 108 basis points a year ago and is the lowest that we've reported in more than 5 years.","Commercial net charge-offs of $54 million declined 4% sequentially and 47% from a year ago. At 44 basis points, this was the lowest level reported since the third quarter of 2007. The biggest improvement was in C&I charge-offs, which were down $11 million or 31% from last quarter, which was partially offset by a $9 million increase in commercial mortgage net charge-offs from an unusually low fourth quarter level. Total consumer net charge offs were $79 million or 89 basis points, down 13% sequentially and 33% from a year ago. Improvement continues to be driven by lower home equity and residential mortgage losses, particularly in Florida. Auto loan charge-offs were $4 million or just 16 basis points, but included recoveries of $2 million from a charge-off sale.","Moving to nonperforming assets on Slide 11. NPAs, including held-for-sale, totaled $1.2 billion at quarter end, down $86 million or 7% from the fourth quarter. Excluding held-for-sale, NPAs were 141 basis points of loans and declined $76 million. Both commercial and consumer NPAs were down about 5% sequentially. Commercial portfolio NPAs of $828 million or 166 basis points of loans declined $55 million sequentially and are at their lowest level since the fourth quarter of 2007. All portfolio categories improved with commercial real estate NPAs down $34 million and C&I NPAs down $20 million.","Commercial TDRs on nonaccrual status were $159 million, down $18 million on a sequential basis. Those are included in the portfolio NPA data that I just mentioned. Commercial accruing TDRs were up $10 million, but still remained fairly low at $441 million.","From the consumer portfolio, NPAs of $382 million or 106 basis points declined $21 million driven by improvement in residential mortgage and the home equity portfolios. Non-accruing consumer TDRs included in these results were $174 million, down $13 million from last quarter. Accruing consumer TDRs were $1.7 billion, relatively consistent with last quarter. The TDR book continues to perform as expected and has stabilized as restructurings have declined with improving residential credit conditions.","The next slide, Slide 12, includes a roll-forward of nonperforming loans. Commercial inflows in the first quarter were $80 million up slightly from the fourth quarter, but down 52% from a year ago. Consumer inflows for the quarter were $124 million, down 33% from last year. Total inflows of $204 million were the lowest we've seen since prior to the crisis.","Moving to Slide 13, which outlines delinquency and other long-term credit trends. Loans 30 to 89 days past due totaled $306 million and were down $24 million driven by improvement in consumer delinquencies. Loans over 90 days past due were $164 million, down $31 million from the fourth quarter driven by improvement in both commercial and consumer. In total, delinquencies decreased $55 million or 11% from the fourth quarter and are the lowest in 12 years. Commercial criticized asset levels also continue to improve, down about $250 million or 5% on a sequential basis and represented the eighth consecutive quarter of decline. As shown on this slide, on all key metrics, Fifth Third's current credit profile is in line with or better than peers overall.","The provision and the allowance are outlined on Slide 14. Provision expense was $62 million for the quarter was down $14 million and included a reduction on the loss, loan loss allowance of $71 million. Allowance coverage remains strong at 187% of nonperforming loans and 3.3x annualized net charge-offs.","Slide 15 reflects our recent mortgage repurchase experience. Claims associated with GSEs have remained fairly stable the past several quarters, but as we have said, we expect that this may increase as Freddie Mac reviews all nonperforming loans for potential put-back. And we've also already reserved for these loans. We've provided a detailed breakout of loans sold by vintage and by remaining balance. Repurchase requests and losses have been concentrated in the 2004 to 2008 vintages, about 84% of the total. Those vintages represent just 11% of the total remaining balances on loans sold.","Turning to capital on Slide 16. Capital levels continue to be very strong and included the impact of approximately $125 million in common share repurchases that was announced during the quarter. The Tier 1 common ratio was 9.7%, up 19 basis points from last quarter. The Tier 1 capital ratio increased 18 basis points and total risk-based capital increased 7 basis points relative to last quarter.","Our capital position would also be strong on a Basel III basis with the current estimated Tier 1 common ratio of about 8.9% assuming no changes to the proposed rules and before any mitigation activity on our part. That reflects about 36 basis points of benefit on the numerator side, offset by the effect of higher risk-weighted assets. As you know, regulators are currently considering public comments on these proposals. Tangible asset ratios are also exceptionally strong. With a 10% leverage ratio, a 9.3% tangible common equity ratio, including unrealized aftertax gains of $333 million and 9.0% TCE ratio, if you'll exclude those gains.","Turning to the updated full year 2013 outlook, which is on Slide 17. You'll recall that last quarter, we shifted to an annual outlook with the expectation that we would update it with each quarter's earnings. For our 2013 outlook, we have not included the benefit of capital actions beyond those taken in the first quarter and we've assumed no meaningful change in the forward-yield curve.","I'll start with net interest income and net interest margin. We continue to expect full year 2013 NII to be consistent with 2012 NII of $3.6 billion and for the full year NIM to be in the 335 to 340 basis point range, likely toward the lower end. The key drivers of 2013 full year trends are loan growth, particularly C&I loans, which we expect to offset the effect of margin compression. We expect second quarter NII to decline $5 million to $10 million. About $4 million of the change is due to the issuance of bank debt in February, the auto securitization in March and the sale of jumbo mortgages. These actions are expected to produce benefits exceeding the detriment to NII for lower FDIC insurance costs and higher fee income levels, in addition to the beneficial impact that they have on liquidity and capital efficiency. The remainder of the decline reflects a mix of loan repricing and maturities of interest rate floors, partially offset by loan growth and a $6 million benefit from an extra day in the quarter. We currently expect NII to grow in the second half of the year as margin compression subsides and with some benefit from the 2008 CDs that mature in the third and fourth quarters of the year.","We will continue to look for opportunities to mitigate the effects of interest rate environment, including liability management as we continue through the year. We continue to expect mid to high-single digit loan growth from the 2012 full year average, despite the $500 million in loans we sold or securitized this quarter. And the second quarter is off to a good start thus far in the commercial business. We expect transaction and core deposits to grow modestly over last year.","Now, moving on to overall fee income and expense expectations for 2013. Just as a reminder, we've adjusted 2012 comparative results on this slide to exclude all Vantiv-related impacts as well as debt termination charges, which were the largest unusual items in the 2012 numbers. Vantiv transactions contributed a net $305 million to fee income for 2012, while debt termination charges increased expenses by a total of $169 million. The net benefit to PPNR of these items was $136 million. First quarter 2013 Vantiv gains of $34 million have also been excluded. Those adjustments are listed in the footnote.","Overall, we currently expect low-single digit total fee income growth in 2013 compared with 2012 adjusted fee income. That would reflect growth across most fee categories with the exception of mortgage where we saw exceptionally strong results in 2012.","Looking at the details of our overall fee expectations. We would expect to see high-single digit growth in deposit fees with most of that growth coming from commercial. This is a bit lower than earlier expectations and many consumers are maintaining higher balances due to freight fees, which we are seeing in higher-than-expected deposit levels. We expect second quarter deposit fees to increase modestly from the first quarter, about 2\/3 from commercial and 1\/3 from consumer. We expect mid-single digit growth in the investment advisory revenue. The second quarter revenue down seasonally from the record first quarter levels. We expect mid to high-single digit growth in corporate banking revenue, a solid growth in the second quarter, although not likely to the record levels we saw in fourth quarter. We continue to anticipate about 10% annual growth in card and processing revenue driven by continued growth in sales and transaction volumes.","Turning to mortgage revenue. We continue to expect a strong year for mortgage revenue, although lower than the record 2012 levels. In terms of the second quarter, our current expectation is for strong gain on sale revenue, up $10 million to $15 million, more than offset by a likely decline from the $40 million MSR valuation benefit in the first quarter. Those results can obviously move around depending on the movement of rates during the quarter.","For the remainder of 2013, we expect production to decline due to a waning of the refinance boom, although we've been seeing strengthening purchase volume. Margins will likely reflect some continuing competitive pressure. Although in the near term, they should stay at or above first quarter average levels. The remainder of the year still looks pretty strong in terms of mortgage gain revenue. And if we see higher rates, we should see some offset to lower volume in the MSR valuation.","Our quarterly base expectations for other income, we continue to be in the $75 million range, plus or minus, absent any significant unusual items, which we will have from time to time. To return to our overall expectations for the second quarter for fee income, excluding the impact of first quarter Vantiv warrant gain, we expect fee income to be down about $20 million to $25 million from first quarter, primarily due to lower mortgage banking revenue.","Turning to expenses. We continue to expect total noninterest expense to be relatively consistent with adjusted 2012 expenses,  excluding the debt termination charges that I noted earlier. Compensation-related cost is expected to be stable to down slightly versus 2012 and other operating costs are expected to be up modestly.","Second quarter noninterest expense should be down about $10 million or so, driven primarily by FICA and unemployment expense, which should decline by about $20 million. We expect expenses otherwise to be relatively stable throughout the year and we will continue to manage expenses carefully and aggressively and in line with our revenue results in the macroeconomic environment. And we expect our efficiency ratio of about -- to approach 60% at the end of the year.","In terms of PPNR, as outlined in my remarks, to this point, our overall expectation is for moderate growth in PPNR in 2013 building on strong adjusted results in 2012. That's despite the rate environment that remains challenging and comparisons with a record year for mortgage revenue. We currently expect PPNR in the $600 million range in the second quarter, give or take, with the expected reduction coming in the mortgage business.","Turning to the credit outlook. We continue to look for momentum to continue for the first quarter with full year net charge-offs currently expected to be down about $200 million to $225 million with full year improvement fairly evenly distributed between commercial and consumer. We expect net charge-off ratio for 2013 to be in the 55 basis point range compared with the 85 basis points we reported in 2012.","We continue to anticipate lower NPAs down 20% to 25% during 2015 with continued resolution of commercial NPAs being the largest driver of that reduction. Second quarter net charge-off should be down about $10 million and NPA's down about $75 million give or take. For the loss allowance, we expect continued reductions in 2013 with the ongoing benefit of improvement in credit results, partially offset by new reserves related to loan growth.","Finally, as Kevin noted, during the quarter we announced the Fed's non-objection to our capital plans for the next 4 quarters. This plan consisted of a number of elements. Those included a possible increase in the quarterly common dividend to $0.12 per share as well as potential share repurchases of up to $984 million in common shares, including shares issued as a result of a potential Series G preferred stock conversion. We will plan to issue perpetual preferred if there were a conversion. We feel very good about the plan we put forward, which maintains a strong capital position, while also returning excess capital we generate to shareholders and moving our capital structure toward new Basel III standards.","In summary, despite first quarter seasonality, we reported a strong quarter and have good momentum in many of our core businesses that we expect to generate PPNR growth, ongoing improvement and credit trends and strong returns.","That wraps up my remarks. Jeff has a couple of other comments before we open for questions","Jeff Richardson","Thanks, Dan. I've been told that the webcast missed the first minute or 2 of our remarks. Just wanted to summarize that. During that time, Kevin summarized our overall results during the quarter, which I think Dan did a good job of addressing. I also observed that our forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and encourage listeners to refer to our cautionary statement in the release. I understand that the replay will capture what was missed. Sorry about that.","Bradley, could you open up the line for questions now?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","To start off, in terms of the loan growth, you had a fairly strong quarter in 1Q relative to peers. Can you just give us a sense where the growth is coming from? Is it more from turning commitments into new client relationships? It seems that utilization still remains low and I guess when you think about the broader loan growth outside of C&I, can you help us just understand where you feel the most comfortable in terms of your expectations for the rest of the year?","Kevin T. Kabat","Ryan, this is Kevin. I'll make a couple of comments in terms of where we saw it. I think we were explicit in terms of trying to tell you that the investments that we've made, particularly in energy, health care. We've seen it also in manufacturing as well as what we've continued to do in terms of some of the consumer space. All are continuing to add to our focus on loan growth, so we feel good about the investments made and seeing that. I would tell you that you're correct in that we haven't seen an increase in utilization. Our utilization rates are still relatively flat and have been for a long period of time. And so, it's coming from our taking more business as well as some additional extension within our clients. But really more in terms of the market share, we've been able to gather and gain through the investments that we've made of the focus on our strategic businesses. So that's where we see most of it. And again, we still feel good about while it was a little bit lighter than what we experienced in fourth quarter, fourth quarter was very, very strong. We still feel good about where our pipelines are and some of the activity that we see in the markets today. We started the quarter off a little bit light and we feel like it's been building a little bit from that standpoint. So we feel, still feel good about our year-long guidance. I don't know if, Dan, if there's anything you'd add to that?","Daniel T. Poston","No, I think the only other thing I would add is that Kevin mentioned some of the industries that showed some strength. You were asking, Ryan, kind of where we felt most comfortable, where we were seeing good results. I think it is pretty broad based, not only on an industry basis, but also on geography basis. I think virtually every one of our markets showed positive loan growth this quarter. So I think it's pretty broad based across markets and industries. The only other area I think where we have made investments and we've seen strength is in the mid-corporate area. We improved or invested in resources in that area in terms of RMs and also invested to increase our capital markets capabilities, which are important to customers in that size range. And we continue to see very strong results in the mid-corporate area, which is good for loan growth, but also good for generation of fee income.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And If I could just ask one question on the mortgage business. Just wanted to get a little bit more color on the outlook. It sounds like the near-term trend should be pretty consistent and we could potentially see it tapering off later in the year. Can you just give us a sense, I know you talked about mix shift as what's driving lower margins. But can you just give us a sense of how much of your mix shift played in to the decline in your margin and when you think about gain on sale, it looks like it's roughly 2.3%. Where do you see that eventually leveling off over the next couple of quarters?","Kevin T. Kabat","Yes, Ryan, we did see, like everyone, I think, margins contracts pretty significantly in the first quarter. Some of that was due to mix change. I think a much larger factor was the rate environment. I think, particularly early in the quarter as secondary rates increased, we saw margins contract pretty significantly. Contributing to that, we did see some mix shift. So the percentage of HARP originations, I think, dropped several basis or several percentage points this quarter. And that had a slight negative impact on margin. But I think the bigger picture from a margin perspective is just the rate environment and not so much mix. As we go forward, I think we saw or we've seen margins firm up a bit later in the quarter. So while we expect relatively stable results first quarter and the second, it probably reflects slightly better margins perhaps slightly lower volumes. Volumes were strong in the first quarter. We had about a 5% or 6% increase in volumes as we increase from about $7 billion to $7.4 billion and that mitigated some of that margin compression. So second quarter, we think, well you heard our guidance from an overall basis maybe slightly better in terms of gain on sale. The rest of the year, a lot will be determined by rates. But based on kind of the current rate expectations, we would expect that perhaps volumes would begin to tail off as we go through the second half of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Murray of Nomura.","Keith Murray - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Can I just ask you, in the mortgage business, obviously, there's a lot of competition, a lot of new entrants trying to gain share. Are you seeing anything yet that would be a concern on underwriting? Or do you feel like, overall, it's still very high quality?","Daniel T. Poston","Yes, I mean the environment is competitive. I think that competition, I don't think manifest itself in lessening underwriting. I think all participants in the mortgage market now are very focused on underwriting very closely to GSE standards. That's something that, obviously, has gotten a lot of focus with the magnitude of put-back exposures that everyone is dealing with. So I don't think we've seen that competitive pressure manifest itself in deteriorating underwriting in any fashion at all.","Keith Murray - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Okay. And then as we think about the eventual, hopefully, someday increase in interest rates, how do you guys assume your deposit mix would change? Or do you assume you'll get some outflow on some of the deposits?","Tayfun Tuzun","I think if the reason -- this is Tayfun. If the reason behind higher interest rates is economic growth, clearly, we would expect to see outflows on the commercial side as those depositors will find a better way to utilize their cash. On the other hand, I think we would expect the consumer space to be more stable. And as we move into that environment, I also would expect us to utilize our branch base very efficiently and maintain a good part of those deposits and if not, grow those deposits. That's our historical experience. We would expect that to play out the same way.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Penala of Bank of America.","Erika  Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My first question is on the expense side. We really appreciate the detailed outlook. I guess I'm wondering if the production revenues on mortgage for the balance of the year in the second half come in lighter than expected or normalize more quickly, how much flexibility do you have on the expense base to minimize the impact on the bottom line?","Daniel T. Poston","Erika, I think in terms of the guidance that we've given, I think our expense guidance incorporates into it the expected decline in mortgage activity that we refer to in our guidance as well. If mortgage volumes come off more than our guidance suggests, I think we do have a tremendous amount of flexibility to adjust the expense base. As we built the mortgage business, I think we have done so with the idea that someday we would have to take down some of those costs. So a lot of our capacity from a mortgage perspective to deal with the refi boom comes from things like temporary labor over time, outsourcing some functions that enables us to react pretty quickly to changes and volumes and adjust the expense base accordingly.","Erika  Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And my follow-up question is actually a follow on to Ryan's question about your C&I growth. Should we interpret from your response to him that the lion's share of what drove the increase in C&I this year came from middle market rather than large corporate?","Daniel T. Poston","Well, I think overall, we saw growth across the board. I think the concentration in growth, I think, is probably in that mid-corporate and up space. I talked a bit about the impact of the investments that we have made in the mid-corporate area. So we've seen outsized growth in the mid-corporate area in this quarter and that would be expected to be a contributor to our growth as we go forward.","Jeff Richardson","This is Jeff. Mid-corporate to us is -- middle market is kind of a big space and so this is the upper end of middle market that we're talking about when we say mid-corporate.","Erika  Penala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And what's the average loan size?","Jeff Richardson","Mid-corporate's probably in the several tens of millions. 10 million-ish, kind of?","Daniel T. Poston","Yes, 30 million to 50 million, probably.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Foran of Autonomous.","Brian Foran","Not to be the dead horse on this corporate loan growth issue, but just with some of the other banks being pretty vocal around abstaining from the leverage loan market, I wondered if you could just kind of outline your activity there and maybe some of the investments you've made in people and specific protocols. Just kind of how do you think about doing that business differently and how should investors think about your approach versus the peer argument that maybe banks should just steer clear of leverage loans altogether?","Jeff Richardson","The thing that I would tell you, Brian, is for the most part, our leverage lending portfolio, while we participate, is really not very large in this scheme of things. We're kind of a middle-market lender in the leverage lending space. And so we're not active in large corporate leverage lending, so we don't have a significant impact. The driver of our growth and the driver of what we've been bringing to the table is really around the investments that we've made in terms of different verticals. And you've heard us talk about the success we've had both in the health care space, the energy space, which we feel very good about the team and talent that we've lifted out this past year. We think we're on the early stages of seeing the benefit of that to us, so we think there's some legs there for us to continue to run with. And then also in -- that the manufacturing space, that's more broadly we're seeing impact of that and opportunity of that and particularly, in the upper Midwest part of our geography. We think we also will see some additional opportunity in the commercial real estate. We still see, as you've seen in terms of our reporting this quarter, a run-off in the commercial real estate portfolio. We think that at some point that levels out and begins to not detract from overall loan growth for us going forward. We're doing that business in very different way. We've got it, I think, in a much more disciplined and focused perspective, in terms of the way we're approaching it going forward. And we'd expect that we don't know when and we don't have the crystal ball in terms of the timing on it, but we are seeing more and better type of transactions in that space. So we think that, again, that might be an opportunity for us later this year to be contributory to the outstandings as well. So I hope that addresses your question, Brian.","Brian Foran","One follow-up on -- and I apologize if I missed this already, but just as we think about the ROA guidance and the base that kind of apply that to -- should we expect assets to, I guess the disconnect I'm getting at, is loans were up this quarter, assets were down marginally. So your outlook for the medium-term net assets will just kind of bounce around in this $121 billion range? Or was there just kind of a 1 quarter swap out of securities cash and into loans?","Daniel T. Poston","Yes, I think in terms of total assets, I think that the assumption relative to total balance sheet size should probably be that it would increase consistent with what our loan growth guidance is. I think the fact that there was a disconnect on those this quarter is probably just a quarter-to-quarter average.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just wanted to talk a little bit about -- more about mortgage banking. Just if I can pin you down on the numbers here. So if you were $220 million this quarter, you think gain on sale was up $10 million to $15 million, you take out the $40 million from the hedging, you serve down to like the $190-ish million range. Is -- and then should we also be applying the reduction in volumes to that same -- or is that, I guess that might be incorporated in gain on sale. I'm trying to think about that versus say, your prior guidance of, I think it was 175 by midyear, because it seems that we're almost in a better environment based on the numbers that we're seeing. Is that fair way to look at it?","Daniel T. Poston","Yes, I think that's fair. The math that you did, I think makes sense. I think the number that you arrive at is inclusive of our expectation on both margins and volumes. And that probably is slightly better than what we had anticipated when we gave -- we initially gave our full year guidance back in January. So application volumes, while initially weak in early in the first quarter, improved pretty significantly in March. And so we're optimistic about second quarter results. That's reflected on our guidance, still cautious about the second half of the year.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then just one follow-up, on the loan growth, the guidance there. Did you, in your guidance from last quarter, did you anticipate sort of the strong average growth and then the flat period end? Because I guess what I'm trying to figure out is, you obviously were higher we were expecting on the average basis. But that kind of also implies slower growth from here to still reach the kind of the midpoint of your guidance? Is that also, is that consistent with what you're seeing? I guess we did have flat period end growth this quarter.","Daniel T. Poston","Yes, our period end growth was flat this quarter. Some of that is due to some securitization said activity that occurred in the first quarter that was not anticipated to occur in the first quarter. So we securitized $500 million worth of auto loans. We also sold $60 million worth of jumbo mortgages in the quarter, which wouldn't have been reflected in the guidance earlier. Overall, I think we did expect a fairly strong growth in average balances with not as strong of growth in the period imbalances due to the impact of the very, very strong fourth quarter results.","Jeff Richardson","And seasonality in the first quarter, which we almost always see.","Daniel T. Poston","So I think the expectations are generally in line with what we were seeing at the beginning of the year with the exception of some of that securitization in sale activity. And we would expect, as we go forward, pipelines feel good. Activity coming in to the second quarter feels good and we expect to continue to post results from a loan-growth perspective on an average balance basis that's consistent with what we saw in the first quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","First question just also another loan question. Just wanted to gauge your appetite for continuing to grow the auto book and also to potentially give -- contemplate additional securitizations like you did this quarter.","Daniel T. Poston","When we look forward, we see a pretty stable activity in our auto originations. The portfolio clearly is a mature portfolio. So the impact of monthly originations is not huge, but we would see similar trends going forward that we've seen over the past 3 or 4 quarters. In terms of securitizations, this was an off-balance sheet transaction to improve our capital usage in the business. And periodically, we may execute all balance sheet securitizations, but we will basically review the profile of our originations and determine if there is an opportunity for us to do the same thing. We may do on-balance sheet transactions going forward along with off-balance sheet transactions. So we will be opportunistic in that sense.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. Great. Got it. And then my second question is just coming back to the CCAR plans. And you guys had those extra potential activities. I just wanted to see if you can flush that out a little bit more for us and talk about whether or not you do expect to do that additional preferred issuance that you -- that was included in the press release at the time?","Daniel T. Poston","Yes, I'm not sure -- well, from a preferred perspective, we talked about $1 billion in preferred issuance made up of 2 pieces. $500 million of which was anchored to the Series G preferred stock conversion and then the buyback of those shares. So if that conversion occurs and we buy back the shares that preferred stock is converted into, we would anticipate issuing about $500 million of preferred related to that. And then, we also anticipate issuing another $500 million in preferred just to make progress toward what we perceive as the right mix of non-common Tier 1 as we move toward Basel III.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Well, that's a piece that I'm asking about. So you included it in the press release as a potential. And I guess, that's the question, then, is what's the decision tree on whether or not you do go forward with that, or is that just really a question of you will do it, it's just the question of when?","Daniel T. Poston","Yes, I think we will do that as we approach phase-in of Basel III. It is a question of when. It is included in the capital plan for this year. I think the timing of that transaction being executed will be based on our evaluation of the markets and when is the most appropriate time for us to do it from that perspective.","Jeff Richardson","This is Jeff. So the Series G conversion is a contingent situation. So there are certain requirements that need to be met from a stock-price standpoint and that has a pricing period. And that pricing period is month or 2 from now. And so we can't say whether that will happen because it requires something to happen in the future. But if it does happen, then Dan talked about how we would fund that.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","My last question is just, on the funding cost side of things, you're still showing a nice continuous improvement on overall funding cost side. How much room still is there to continue to ratchet your overall funding cost lower?","Tayfun Tuzun","There is remaining room, but clearly on the deposit side the improvement is marginal. But we also have other opportunities on the balance sheet in non-deposit items. And we will realize then as we see opportunities realize.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Paul Miller of FBR.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Can you touch base a little bit on the reps and warrants? I know there's been some on the mortgage side of the design. I know there's been some comments from FHFA they'd like to clear up by the end of this year. Have you gotten any guidance that this year would be it?","Kevin T. Kabat","No. We've not -- we've not had any indication of that in any discussions that we've had relative to our own situation. We've, obviously, seen the same things you have in terms of press, what the press is reporting. But I think our discussions have been more along the lines of what we have talked about over the past few quarter, which has been that from a Freddie Mac perspective, Freddie Mac has been more explicit with us in terms of what the criteria are that they will use to determine whether loans should be put back. That has allowed us to make better estimates with respect to what our put-backs will be and that has led to some higher reserve balances in the third and fourth quarter. We have not yet seen fully the increase in put-backs but that information will would, but we still do continue to expect to see that, ultimately, and have the reserves available to provide for that increase in volume if it materializes.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And then also with respect to the mortgage banking side, can you remind us again what's your split between retail and correspondent? And is there any plans that go into the warehouse side of the business?","Jeff Richardson","This is Jeff. I don't have the exact numbers here. Retail is -- retail and direct are about half of our originations, correspondent and wholesale being the other half.","Daniel T. Poston","It's about 50-50, Paul, when you consider correspondent and wholesale.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And do you do warehouse lending? I'm not -- I don't see it really broken out.","Daniel T. Poston","No, for all practice, intents and purposes, we really don't.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Any plans to do that going forward?","Jeff Richardson","Not at this point, no.","Operator","We have reached the allotted time of today's call.

My name is Frederick, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Bank Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn your call over to Jeff Richardson, Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Richardson, you may begin.","Jeff Richardson","Thanks, Frederick. Good morning. Today, we'll be talking with you about our third quarter 2013 results. This call may contain certain forward-looking statements about Fifth Third pertaining to our financial condition, results of operations, plans and objectives. These statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. There are a number of factors that could cause results to differ materially from historical performance in these statements. We've identified some of these factors in our forward-looking cautionary statement at the end of our earnings release and in other materials, and we encourage you to review them. Fifth Third undertakes no obligation and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call.","I'm joined on the call by several people: our CEO, Kevin Kabat; and CFO, Dan Poston; Frank Forrest, who joined us as Chief Risk Officer and Chief Credit Officer last month; Treasurer, Tayfun Tuzun; and Jim Eglseder from Investor Relations. During the question-and-answer period, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin Kabat. Kevin?","Kevin T. Kabat","Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. This morning, Fifth Third reported third quarter net income to common shareholders of $421 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.47. Earnings this quarter included the benefit of $85 million in gains on the sale of Vantiv shares, $6 million of valuation gains on our Vantiv warrant and a $15 million reduction in our mortgage rep and warranty reserve. These benefits were offset by litigation reserve expense of $30 million, $5 million in severance expense and $5 million in new Dodd-Frank large bank supervisory assessment fees. In total, these items produced an after-tax net benefit of about $0.05 per share for the quarter. Third quarter EPS increased approximately 1% from a year ago, adjusting both quarters for similar items, despite significantly lower mortgage banking income. This reflects core growth across most of our other business lines, particularly deposit service charges, which were up 10%, and investment advisory fees and card processing revenue, which were each up 6%. Returns on assets and equity remain strong, and tangible book value per share increased 3% sequentially and 8% from a year ago.","Now turning to business activity, borrowers remained cautious on the sidelines, which supported higher average deposit balances and lead to some slowing in loan demand during the quarter. Average core deposits were up 6% from a year ago and included growth in transaction deposits of $5.7 billion. The strength in our deposit franchise was also reflected in the FDIC's annual market share data, in which we grew deposits in 15 of our 18 affiliates and gained market share in 14 affiliates. As you know, we've completely revamped the deposit products in our consumer bank and recently in our business banking segment. Our new offerings were designed with a focus on building full and profitable customer relationships and to align value provided and value received, given changes in the profitability of retail products. We're through that process, and we're building upon this foundation to accelerate growth going forward. We're seeing higher balances with our new account structure, and we expect that to continue when rates eventually rise.","In the third quarter, average portfolio loans grew 1% sequentially and period-end portfolio loans increased about $200 million, reaching the highest levels of balance in the company's history. Sequential growth was a bit lighter than prior quarters, as payoffs and paydowns offset new production in the commercial portfolio and as higher interest rates reduced demand for mortgage loans and refinancing in our consumer lending business. Fee income results were solid and reflected lower mortgage revenue, as expected. We've been preparing for a shift in market conditions for quite some time and are in the middle of implementing changes to the business to reflect more normalized volume expectations. At the same time, our other businesses are performing very well. As I just mentioned, we continue to optimize our retail banking platform, both in terms of our distribution strategy and in prioritizing key customer segments that add value for the bank. For example, consumer deposit fees are up 17% from this time last year. Retail brokerage and private client fees have increased 12% and 10%, respectively, from a year ago. Credit card balances are up 8% year-over-year, and we continue to see the benefit of our investments in the mid-corporate space and in the energy and healthcare industries. Dan will discuss these trends further in his remarks. We continue to manage expense in a disciplined way. Expenses declined 7% from abnormally high levels last quarter, driven by lower litigation costs, mortgage-related costs and credit costs, as well as careful expense management overall, and that will continue, as you'd expect, from Fifth Third. Credit trends continue to show steady improvement, with net charge-offs below 50 basis points of loans for the first time since early 2007 and nonperforming assets down 12% to 116 basis points of loans. Capital levels remained very strong with a Tier 1 common ratio of 9.9% and a leverage ratio of 10.6%. Our current pro forma estimate for Basel III Tier 1 common equity is 9.5%. Our ability to generate capital and our strong capital levels under both Basel I and Basel III give us the ability to support balance sheet growth while continuing to return capital to shareholders in a prudent manner. We recently completed and settled the $539 million common stock repurchase agreement we initiated in May, and we have more than $600 million in remaining capacity over the next 6 months under our 2013 CCAR plan.","Now to wrap up my remarks. I'll tell you, it continues to be a tough and uncertain environment, one that doesn't give you anything. You have to execute and take it. We continue to generate a relatively high level of profitability despite these challenges. That's due to our strong culture and focus on revenue results on lending and deposit gathering, on continued expense discipline and on improvement in credit. These give us a lot of confidence that our strategies are working and that we're well positioned to win going forward. As you may have seen, we recently received upgrades with 2 rating agencies, which reflect in large part these strengths of Fifth Third. And finally, as always, I'd like to thank our employees for their continued focus and drive and our customers for their continued business and partnership with Fifth Third. With that, let me ask Dan to discuss operating results and give some comments about our outlook. Dan?","Daniel T. Poston","Okay. Thanks, Kevin. Good morning, everyone. I will start with Slide 4 of the presentation, and we'll discuss the results for the third quarter before turning to the outlook before the end of my remarks. Earnings per diluted share were $0.47, down $0.18 from last quarter, primarily due to lower Vantiv gains. Current-quarter results included a pretax $85 million gain on the sale of Vantiv shares and a $6 million positive valuation adjustment on the Vantiv warrant, whereas prior quarter results included a $242 million gain on the sale of shares and a $76 million positive value -- valuation adjustment on the warrant. Additionally, third quarter results included $30 million in charges to increase litigation reserves compared with $51 million in the second quarter. There were several other items that affected earnings in the quarter, which are outlined in our release, and I'll note them throughout my comments. As Kevin noted, these items contributed a net $0.05 to earnings per share this quarter.","Turning over to Slide 5. Tax equivalent net interest income increased $13 million sequentially to $898 million, and the net interest margin was 331 basis points versus 333 basis points last quarter. During the quarter, we took advantage of higher interest rates to remix and add investments to our securities portfolio. The higher earnings from these securities, along with $6 million in benefit from higher quarterly day count, contributed to the increase in net interest income. NII also benefited from lower interest expense, reflecting the full quarter impact of debt maturities in the second quarter, as well as lower CD costs due to the maturity of approximately $500 million of 2008 AR CDs. These benefits were partially offset by the negative effect of loan repricing, lower mortgage held-for-sale balances and the full quarter impact of the interest rate floors that matured in the second quarter, which is now fully in our run rate. The 2-basis-point decline in the net interest margin was primarily driven by repricing in the loan portfolio, the full quarter impact from the maturity of interest rate floors in the second quarter and a 1-basis-point reduction from the day count effect. These effects were partially offset by the impact of lower funding costs and higher securities yields. Earning asset yields continued to compress, although to a lesser extent than in previous quarters. Loan and lease yields declined, driven by C&I and auto portfolios. Reported C&I portfolio yields declined 9 basis points. The core decline was 4 basis points, with an additional 5 basis points coming from the full quarter impact of last quarter's maturity of interest rate floors. The 4-basis-point core decline in yields was driven by repricing within the portfolio, combined with a continued mix shift toward higher-quality loans. This core decline in yields is substantially smaller than the trend we've seen over the past several quarters, as we continue to focus on pricing discipline in this current environment. In the indirect auto portfolio, the average yield declined 14 basis points in the quarter, largely reflecting the continued portfolio effect of replacing older higher-yielding loans with new lower-yielding loans. In the taxable securities portfolio, yields increased 11 basis points, reflecting the benefit from higher investment balances and higher securities yields.","Turning to the balance sheet, which is on Slide 6. Average earning assets increased $1.2 billion sequentially, driven by a $1.2 billion increase in investment securities and a $333 million increase in short-term investment balances. We added a net $2 billion of securities this quarter, as the movement in rates within the quarter allowed for attractive entry points for us to purchase securities. Despite these investments, the proportion of our assets in the securities portfolio continues to be on the lower end of our peer group, providing us with additional capacity as the rate environment improves and provides additional investment opportunities. Average portfolio loans and leases were up $565 million, but were offset by an $884 million decline in average loans held-for-sale, reflecting the lower level of mortgages being originated for sale.","Looking at each loan portfolio. Average commercial loans held for investment increased $258 million or 1% from the second quarter and increased $3.9 billion or 8% from last year. C&I loans of $38.1 billion increased $503 million or 1% from last quarter and increased $5 billion or 15% from a year ago. C&I production remained strong this quarter, where we saw some acceleration in paydown and payoff activity, which resulted in softer loan growth than we were anticipating coming into the quarter. Production continues to be broad-based across industries, with particular strength in mid-corporate and healthcare lending and in leasing. Commercial line utilization declined to 30% from 31% in the second quarter, as clients are exercising a high degree of caution and minimizing line usage. This is the lowest level of utilization we've seen historically. Commercial mortgage balances declined $345 million sequentially or 4%, while commercial construction balances increased $80 million. This is the third consecutive quarter we've seen an increase in construction balances. The CRE pipeline is beginning to fill, and we should see some growth in the coming quarters. Average consumer loans of $36.5 billion increased $307 million or 1% sequentially and increased $514 million or 1% from a year ago. Residential mortgage loans held for investment were up 2% from the second quarter, as we continue to retain shorter-term, high-quality residential mortgages originated primarily through our retail branch system. Average auto loans increased 2% sequentially and 2% from the prior year. Average home equity loan balances were down 2% sequentially, reflecting continued runoff in this portfolio, and average credit card balances were up 3% sequentially and 9% from a year ago, driven by account growth and stronger cross-sell activity.","Moving on to deposits. We continue to see solid deposit trends with average core deposits up $1.4 billion or 2% from the second quarter. Transaction deposits, excluding CDs, increased $1.6 billion or 2% sequentially and $5.7 billion or 7% from a year ago. We're seeing particular strength in the commercial demand deposits, which were up 9% sequentially. Consumer CDs declined 5% as a result of the high-priced CDs that rolled off during the quarter. As Kevin noted, the recent FDIC deposit market share data is favorable across almost all of our geographies.","Turning now to fees, which are outlined on Slide 7. Third quarter noninterest income was $721 million compared with $1.1 billion last quarter. As I mentioned earlier, current-quarter fee income results included an $85 million gain on the sale of Vantiv shares and the $6 million positive valuation adjustment on the Vantiv warrant. Second quarter fee income included a $242 million gain on the sale of Vantiv shares and $76 million in positive valuation adjustment on the Vantiv warrant, as well as a $10 million benefit from the settlement of one of our BOLI policies. If you exclude these items, fee income of $630 million declined $102 million, primarily due to lower mortgage banking revenue. Nonmortgage banking-related fees grew 5% from a year ago, with solid growth in investment advisory revenue, card and processing revenue and deposit fees.","Looking at each line item in detail. Deposit service charges increased 3% sequentially and increased 10% from the prior year. The sequential increase reflected commercial deposit fee growth of 4% sequentially and 6% compared with last year. Consumer deposit fees were up 2% sequentially and 17% from -- on a year-over-year basis. The increase from the prior year reflects the completion of our conversion to the new deposit product offerings. The full impact of that conversion is now reflected in our results, and that gives us a good foundation to build on going forward. Corporate banking revenue of $102 million decreased 4% sequentially and increased 1% from a year ago. The sequential decline from a strong second quarter reflected lower customer activity as a result of increased economic uncertainty. This led to lower foreign exchange and derivatives fees, which was partially offset by higher syndication fees and business lending fees. Mortgage banking net revenue of $121 million decreased $112 million from the second quarter and $79 million from a year ago. Mortgage originations were $4.8 billion this quarter compared with a record $7.5 billion last quarter. Gain on sale revenue was $74 million versus $150 million in the prior quarter, reflecting both lower gain on sale margins and lower originations during the quarter. MSR valuation adjustments, which includes the impact of hedges, were a positive $23 million in the third quarter compared with a positive $72 million in the second quarter. Purchase volume was $2 billion or 43% of originations, up from $1.8 billion in the second quarter and 24% of originations. Investment advisory revenue of $97 million declined 2% from the second quarter, but increased 6% over the prior year. The sequential decline was driven by lower brokerage fees and private client services revenue. The year-over-year increase reflects 10% growth in private banking, as well as 10% growth in the brokerage business, which were partially offset by the impact of lower mutual fund revenue. As you'll recall, we sold our retail mutual fund assets in September of last year. Card and processing revenue was $69 million, a 2% increase from the second quarter and a 6% increase from a year ago, reflecting higher transaction volumes and account growth. Net investment portfolio securities gains were $2 million this quarter. They were negligible in the second quarter and about $2 million a year ago. We also recognized $5 million of net securities gains related to nonqualified MSR hedges. Those were $6 million last quarter and $5 million in the third quarter of 2012.","Turning next to other income within fees. Other income was $185 million this quarter versus $414 million last quarter, which included the Vantiv-related gains that I discussed earlier. Excluding the previously mentioned unusual items in each of the quarters, other noninterest income of $94 million in the third quarter increased $8 million sequentially. Credit costs in other noninterest income were $5 million in the third quarter compared with $6 million last quarter and $14 million a year ago, reflecting lower losses on the sale of OREO properties.","Turning now to the expenses, which are on Slide 8. Noninterest expense was $959 million this quarter compared with $1 billion in the second quarter. Expense results this quarter included $30 million in charges to increase litigation reserves compared with $51 million last quarter. Current-quarter expenses also included $5 million in severance expense and large bank supervisory assessment fees of $5 million. The assessment was applied retroactively to 2012, so this quarter's amount included 7 quarters of expense. On an ongoing basis, this should amount to less than $1 million per quarter. Excluding these items from both quarters, noninterest expense of $919 million decreased $65 million or 7% from the second quarter. The primary drivers of the expense decrease were lower mortgage-related costs and lower mortgage rep and warranty expense, partially offset by $4 million of seasonal pension settlement charges, which last year was recorded in the fourth quarter. Current-quarter results reflected a decline in mortgage production-related expenses of approximately $25 million, mostly in compensation expenses. As we've discussed, this included the elimination of overtime and contract work, some further reduction in full-time employee costs and lower incentive compensation due to the lower origination volumes. We will continue to adapt to the refinance and purchase environment, but our plans to manage the business are going just about as expected. Credit-related costs in noninterest expense of $16 million declined $19 million compared with last quarter. This decline was primarily driven by a $15 million reduction in the mortgage rep and warranty reserve as a result of improving underlying repurchase metrics, driven primarily by lower levels of new repurchase requests. Realized mortgage repurchase losses were $13 million this quarter versus $14 million in the second quarter.","Moving on to Slide 9 and PPNR. Pre-provision net revenue was $655 million in the third quarter compared with $905 million in the second quarter. Excluding the items that are noted on this slide, adjusted PPNR in the third quarter was $603 million, down 5% from the prior quarter and up 1% from a year ago, in both cases largely due to lower mortgage revenue, offset by higher nonmortgage revenues and lower expenses. As Kevin mentioned, our credit results continued to trend well in the third quarter.","Starting with charge-offs on Slide 10. Total net charge-offs of $109 million declined $3 million or 2% from the second quarter and $47 million or 31% from a year ago. The net charge-off ratio was 49 basis points this quarter and is the lowest we've reported in more than 5 years. Commercial net charge-offs of $44 million declined 2% sequentially and 29% from a year ago. The 35 basis points of losses was the lowest charge-off ratio since the third quarter of 2007. The sequential decrease was driven by a $10 million decline in commercial real estate net charge-offs, a $2 million decline in commercial lease charge-offs, and those were partially offset by an $11 million increase in C&I net charge-offs. Consumer net charge-offs were $65 million, down 3% sequentially and 31% from a year ago. The 70 basis points of losses was the lowest charge-off ratio since the second quarter of 2007. The improvement continues to be driven by lower home equity and residential mortgage losses, with improvements across most geographies, particularly Florida.","Moving on to nonperforming assets on Slide 11. NPAs of $1 billion at quarter end were down $136 million or 12% from the second quarter, with commercial NPAs down 14% and consumer NPAs down 6%. The NPA ratio was 1.16%, which is down 57 basis points from a year ago. Commercial portfolio NPAs were $680 million and declined $114 million sequentially. The decrease was driven by a $66 million decline in commercial real estate NPAs and a $40 million decline in C&I NPAs. Commercial TDRs on nonaccrual status, which are included in NPAs, were $241 million, up $45 million on a sequential basis. Commercial accruing TDRs were up $24 million and remained fairly low at $499 million. In the consumer portfolio, NPAs of $334 million declined $22 million, driven by improvement in the residential mortgage portfolio. Nonaccruing consumer TDRs included in these results were $138 million, down $24 million from last quarter. Accruing consumer TDRs were $1.7 billion, relatively consistent with last quarter. As you know, performing TDRs, which are included -- which included an interest rate modification below market rates, cannot be reclassified out of TDR status until they are refinanced on market terms. $1.4 billion of the accruing consumer TDRs are current, and $1 billion of them are current and have seasoned for more than a year. We would expect this portfolio to decline gradually over time, as the opportunity and the need to introduce new restructurings has declined with the improving residential real estate credit conditions. Total delinquencies of $414 million were up $4 million or 1% from the second quarter. Loans 30 to 89 days past due were flat from the previous quarter, and loans over 90 days past due were up $4 million from the second quarter, although they remain near -- at near-historical lows. Commercial criticized asset levels also continue to improve, down about $60 million or 1% sequentially, which represented the 10th consecutive quarter of decline.","The next slide, Slide 12, includes a roll-forward of nonperforming loans. Commercial inflows in the third quarter were $71 million, down 53% from the second quarter and down 41% from a year ago. Consumer inflows for the quarter were $95 million, down 41% from last year. Total inflows of $166 million were the lowest levels we've seen in recent history. We generally expect continued improvement in both the commercial and consumer portfolios. The provision and the allowance are outlined on Slide 13. Provision expense of $51 million for the quarter was down $13 million from the second quarter and included a reduction in the loan loss allowance of $58 million. Allowance coverage remains very strong at 218% of nonperforming loans and 165% of nonperforming assets.","Slide 14 outlines our recent mortgage repurchase experience. We saw a sequential decrease in GSE claims, which are down 33% from a year ago. As I mentioned, we've reduced mortgage repurchase reserve in the quarter to reflect slowing inflows of new repurchase requests, which should ultimately be reflected in lower losses going forward. We've provided a detailed breakout of remaining balances of loans sold by vintage. Repurchase requests and losses have been concentrated in the 2004 to 2008 vintages, about 84% of the total. Those vintages represent just 8% of the total remaining balances on sold loans.","Turning to capital on Slide 15. Capital levels continue to be very strong. The Tier 1 common equity ratio was 9.9%, up 46 basis points from last quarter, which included a 37-basis-point benefit from the conversion of $398 million of convertible preferred stock into common shares during the quarter. As you will recall, the share repurchase agreement we had in place over the second and third quarters was implemented in May, and therefore, it was largely reflected in our June capital results. The Tier 1 capital ratio increased 8 basis points and the total risk-based capital was up 2 basis points compared with last quarter. Tangible equity ratios also continue to be strong, with a 9.4% TCE ratio, including unrealized after-tax gains of $218 million, and a 9.3% TCE ratio if you exclude those gains. Our current pro forma estimate for the Tier 1 common equity ratio under the final Basel III capital rules is 9.5%. That calculation assumes an exclusion of certain AOCI components from capital, which is subject to an election on our part in early 2015. That pro forma estimate would be about 9.7% if you included AOCI. As a result, our capital position is well in excess of the minimum required ratios, including the capital conservation buffers. Just as a reminder, our May preferred stock issuance carries a semiannual dividend, which will not be payable until the fourth quarter. That dividend will normally be about $15 million every other quarter. The fourth quarter dividend will actually be $19 million because it will also include the stub period for the months of May and June. All told, that will impact earnings per share for the fourth quarter by about $0.02 per share.","Turning to the updated full year 2013 outlook, which is on Slide 16. Starting with net interest income and net interest margin, we continue to expect full year 2013 NII to be relatively consistent with 2012 NII of $3.6 billion, and we expect the full year NIM to be in the 333-basis-point range, plus or minus. We expect fourth quarter NII to be modestly higher than the third, up about $5 million to $10 million or so. That reflects the benefit of the higher rate environment on the securities portfolio and the yields, as well as the effect of loan growth, offset by loan repricing. We currently expect fourth quarter margin to be down a few basis points, which includes about 2 basis points of reduction due to higher cash balances that we expect to carry in the fourth quarter. Otherwise, we'd expect some modest compression from the effect of loan repricing, partially offset by the benefit of the remaining $300 million in maturing CDs that were issued in 2008. We continue to expect full year average loan growth versus 2012 in the mid single-digits range, primary reflecting growth in C&I loans, as well as continued retention of mortgage loans. We continue to expect transaction and core deposits to grow in the mid single-digits range compared with 2012 averages.","Moving on to overall fee income and expense expectations for 2013. Just as a reminder, we've adjusted 2013 and 2012 comparative results on this slide to exclude all Vantiv-related impacts, as well as debt termination charges incurred in 2012. Those adjustments are all listed in the footnote. Overall, we currently expect fee income to be relatively consistent with 2012 adjusted fee income. That would reflect generally mid to high single-digit growth across most major fee categories other than mortgage, which is down from a record 2012 level.","Just a couple of additional comments. The change in the rate environment obviously continues to impact our expectations for mortgage banking revenue. For the full year, our current forecast for total mortgage banking revenue is in the $670 million range, which would be down about 20% from 2012 record levels. This reflects lower volumes, partially offset by lower servicing asset amortization and higher MSR valuation adjustments. Fourth quarter mortgage revenue is expected to be in the $90 million to $100 million range. Corporate banking revenue should be up about $10 million sequentially, which would put it in the same ballpark as last year's record results. Our overall expectations for the fourth quarter are for fee income in the $620 million range, with the sequential reduction reflecting third quarter Vantiv gains as well as lower mortgage production revenue, largely offset by fee growth on our other core businesses.","Turning to expenses. We continue to expect full year noninterest expense to be relatively consistent with adjusted 2012 expenses. We currently expect fourth quarter noninterest expense to decline about $40 million from the third quarter reported levels. That would reflect the impact on the third quarter of some of the significant items we've discussed on the call, as well as lower mortgage-related expenses. We will continue to manage expenses in line with expected revenue results in the overall economic environment. In terms of PPNR, as outlined in my remarks to this point, our overall expectation for the year is consistent with 2012 levels. That's despite comparisons with a record year for mortgage revenue and a rate environment that remains very challenging.","Turning to the credit outlook. We expect the overall credit trends to remain favorable in the fourth quarter, with full year net charge-offs currently expected to be a bit down, about $225 million to $250 million or so. We currently expect the net charge-off ratio for 2013 to be slightly below 55 basis points compared with the 85 basis points we reported in 2012. We expect the NPAs to decline about 25% for the year, with commercial NPAs being the largest driver of that reduction. For the loan loss allowance, we expect continued reductions in the fourth quarter, with the ongoing benefit of improvement in credit results being partially offset by new reserves related to loan growth.","In summary, we're generating solid results in most of our core businesses despite the tough operating environment, and we expect that to remain the case as we move into 2014. That wraps up my remarks. Frederick, can you open up the line now for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Paul Miller with FBR.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I wanted to touch base real quick on your reps and warrants, which is really going -- which is really coming in nicely, but we've seen some banks out there being able to enter agreements with Fannie and Freddie declare the decks of future reps and warrants. Have you had any success or tried to do this at this point?","Daniel T. Poston","Well, we have ongoing dialogue with all of the GSEs relative to current results, their expectations going forward. So we continue to have those discussions. We reflect our expectations relative to the impact of what they're telling us on our reserves and expected future losses, but we can't really comment relative to dialogues relative to settlements and so forth. But I think the expectation is across the industry that Freddie Mac, in particular, is attempting to reach settlements with a number of banks, and we've certainly seen that with some of the larger banks, and the expectation is that they may well continue to seek settlements with other banks as we go forward.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And if you do -- I mean, listen, I know we've seen some of these banks taking additional charges just to clear the decks. Do you think that your reserves right now is sufficient, or would you might have to just up it just a little bit just to clean the decks out?","Daniel T. Poston","Well, we -- as I said, we reflect in our reserve all of the current information that we're able to obtain from the GSEs relative to what they're seeing and what their expectations are. You saw in the recent quarter that we actually reduced reserves because our experience is coming in a bit more favorable than we had accrued. So we feel very comfortable with the level of our reserves. Whether that reserve proves to be adequate or excessive in a settlement kind of scenario, I think, remains to be seen, but at this point, based on information that we have, we're very, very comfortable with the level of our reserves.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom from RBC Capital Markets.","Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Maybe, Kevin, a question for you on the payoff and paydown commentary on lending. Is that a few specific deals or is it broad-based, and how persistent do you think that will be over the next couple of quarters?","Kevin T. Kabat","Yes, John. So it's fairly broad. So it isn't concentrated. It isn't narrow from that perspective. It was really across a large swath. Persistency, I would tell you that our expectations, as we've mentioned in terms of our guidance today, is that we're seeing a typical increase in fourth quarter pipelines. We would expect that, again, given what happened in the last few days in Washington, whether that has a similar impact in the fourth quarter as it did, as we saw, and I think as the industries kind of talked about in the third quarter, remains to be seen, but our expectation is that we'll get a pickup. We're seeing the pipelines fill back again, but there's still an awful lot of cautiousness out there. There's still a lot of really kind of looking at things other than simply the broad economy, from that perspective. So how much of an impact that has is really hard to say at this point, Jon.","Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then, Dan, maybe if you can provide a little finer point on the expenses. The last quarter, you talked a little bit about mortgage banking expenses coming out in the lag in terms of timing, and I'm just curious if you could give us some thoughts in terms of how much more mortgage banking expenses could come out and when that might happen and kind of where you are in that spectrum.","Daniel T. Poston","Yes, John. As you alluded to, as we talked about mortgage banking, I think our key messages have been and, I think, continue to be that we always try to anticipate where we might need to go with respect to mortgage banking expenses. We build our capacity in a way that facilitates us, our adjusting that capacity fairly quickly. And as a result of that, we believe that we are able to act very quickly in response to anticipated changes in volumes. That being said, there is always a bit of a lag. I think we were very pleased with the expense reduction results in the mortgage business for this quarter. The $25 million reduction that we saw was in line with what we expected to do at the beginning of the quarter. So it was in line with the capacity that we wanted to carry into the quarter. As mortgage volumes have continued to decline, and as we said this morning, our expectation is for further declines in the fourth quarter. You could expect that we would continue to work very diligently to keep our expenses in line with that revenue reduction. So embedded in our expectations for the fourth quarter is that we will continue to aggressively take costs out of the mortgage business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian from Bank of America.","Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My first question is a follow-up to John's on the mortgage expense side, and maybe I'll just take a step back. Your adjusted efficiency went up by a percentage point this quarter, and clearly, mortgage banking revenues coming down had a lot to do with it. As we look out in 2014, I know you want to be careful in terms of giving us a dollar number of expense that can come out of the mortgage side, but is there room for that efficiency ratio to come down from the levels that you posted in the third quarter in light of what seems like a soft revenue outlook for the industry?","Daniel T. Poston","We would certainly believe that there is room in what -- as we build our plans for 2014, that will certainly be our objective. I mean, I think relative to the mortgage business, I would point out a couple of things. One, as I just mentioned, there are more costs to takeout and there always is a bit of a lag, and that will have an impact of improving the overall efficiency ratio as we get those things completely rightsized. The other thing I would point out is that, particularly with respect to the efficiency ratio this quarter, in addition to dealing with declines in mortgage volumes, which the volume declines present opportunities for taking expense out, we're also dealing in this quarter with declines in overall gain on sale margins, which were down fairly significantly for the quarter and a bit more than we expected. We expected some softening of mortgage margins, but we saw about almost 50 basis points of decline in mortgage margins, which is very significant. Fortunately for us, I think we may have fared better than most in the industry, but still, 50 basis points of margin decline is difficult to deal with from an expense perspective on a short-term basis. On a longer-term basis, obviously, if you expect those margin declines to be of a more permanent nature or more sustained, you have the opportunity to do things from an expense perspective. But it's difficult to react to those kinds of changes in margins on a short-term basis. So we believe that we have the ability to continue to work aggressively on our expenses. We've always had that mindset, and we do expect that our efficiency ratio going into '14 will reflect kind of a better environment and show improvements from where we are in the third quarter.","Kevin T. Kabat","Erika, this is Kevin. And the only thing I would add to that is our expectations in terms of the way we manage the company really haven't changed. We always have stated that we believe we can get to our goals and targets. That hasn't changed. We expected the turn in terms of mortgage as our most cyclical business. So we -- as Dan states, there'd be some timing effect of this, some lag, but our expectations for ourselves over the long run really haven't changed going forward.","Erika Najarian - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Got it. And my second question is on your comment during the prepared remarks with regards to the size of your bond portfolio and potentially taking advantage of higher long rates. Given that your core loan-to-deposit ratio is at 100% and you expect loan growth to match transaction deposit growth, are -- do you plan to potentially lever up the balance sheet to grow your bond portfolio and take advantage of higher rates, or would you just use excess deposit growth to do that?","Daniel T. Poston","Erika, we've discussed the size of our portfolio quite frequently over the past couple of years. This quarter, we've seen good entry points, and we took advantage of those opportunities to grow the size of the portfolio. Going forward, we always intended to normalize the size of the portfolio back to sort of a pure average. We're still below pure average, which leaves us with quite a bit more room to leverage the portfolio. Our intent is not necessarily to make up for weakness in loan growth, but by itself, determine whether there are good opportunities for us to grow the size of the portfolio. In terms of how much we grow, if we do see opportunities, we clearly have a lot of room in terms of liquidity and funding because deposits continue to be very strong, and we are very much underutilized and many of our wholesale funding items as well. So we think that both from a funding and liquidity perspective, as well as from sort of opportunistic profitable growth perspective, we have future opportunities to utilize more -- the timing of it is -- will depend on what the market really presents us. We are not going to be -- we're going to be patient. We have been patient for the last 2 or 3 years, and we took advantage of that patience last quarter. We'll do the same going forward.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We have a question from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I would just -- just on the loan side, auto is growing a little bit, but it looks like the industry's growing a lot faster. I just maybe wanted to ask you to kind of flush out how you're thinking about the auto business. And then also, just talk us through this use of the secure -- on balance sheet securitization and what that means for results and funding, if anything?","Tayfun Tuzun","Sure. On the auto side, Ken, as we've always stated, we have a very strong origination engine, but we want to make sure that engine actually produces profitable results, and we're very keen on maintaining that level of profitability. There may be strong growth, but if that growth does not meet our profit guidelines and targets, we will not go after that, and the paper that we put on our balance sheet will meet our targets. We're happy with where we are. We'll continue to maintain our strong presence in that business. With respect to the securitization, this is our second securitization this year. The first one was off balance sheet for specific brokers to manage our capital more efficiently. The one that we executed in August in the funding securitization, the ABS markets continue to be very strong and it's a very efficient and cheap funding source. So it just basically will be a tool that we will use going forward to supplement the liability side of our balance sheet and manage our funding costs efficiently. Beyond that, there really is not much else to say on that.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And my second question is just with regarding -- I heard you talk very clearly about the preferred dividend step-up for the fourth quarter, but can you just give us your updated thoughts on just the preferred structure relative to that extra issue you had been talking about earlier in the year? We hadn't seen that yet. Just -- can you just talk to us about the setup around capital structure and if you would continue to anticipate putting more preferreds into the structure, including that one issue that you had put out there earlier?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes, I mean, we have disclosed that we had one more preferred issuance in our CCAR plan, which was not objected to. We plan to follow our CCAR plan, and preferred securities are very efficient sources of capital today. We currently have a significant amount of room in order to utilize that bucket. That -- this next transaction is just another step towards utilizing that bucket and manage our growing capital ratios efficiently. Right now, we plan to execute a transaction, and we're watching the markets, obviously, and that still is coming up.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, and then last one for me. Just, Kevin, you mentioned that line utilization remains very low. I know, obviously, there's a lot of uncertainties that are still out there, but can you just give us just some thoughts on what customers are not doing and any tone change in terms of willingness to invest in businesses?","Kevin T. Kabat","Yes, Ken, I think the theme has been pretty consistent. I think folks have really kind of been cautious in terms of trying to look forward in terms of the investments they're making. So we have -- we did see, in the latter half of the quarter, some pullback and some delay. In terms of some of the investments, I think that's been reflected in some of the utilization itself, as well as some of the pipeline and the activities. Now we're beginning to see it fill back. Again, I just -- it's really difficult to predict what an impact will be once we approach the end of this quarter again, but as we gave guidance in, we're hopeful that we see a little bit of a tick up from what we experienced. Production was good. It was really all in the paydowns, payoffs and deleveraging that's been going on, and I think, again, if you're managing a business today in the uncertainty of today, that cautiousness is pervasive. And so as we get better clarity, I think you'll see better activity. Companies, on the other side of it, as I think we've seen demonstrated over and over again in the improving credit metrics, companies are making money. They're doing well. They're just not taking a lot of risk at this point. So that's really kind of the feelings that we have and the things we're hearing directly from clients and prospects as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A quick question on expenses. How much of the one-time expenses that you highlight on Slide 3 were included in your prior expense guidance for the third quarter? Because -- and I ask because some of those items, like severance, it seems like that would have been expected, so I'm trying to figure out if that was included or not.","Jeff Richardson","Going back, I can't really think back to July that quickly, Ken. I don't think that the large bank assessment fee had been finalized by then. Severance, I don't know what we would have known at that point.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","But it sounds like, broadly, you're saying that they were not...","Jeff Richardson","I don't think they -- obviously, if we -- we had an expectation for reserve that gets booked when you have the expectation. Warrants on that, we can't estimate those...","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, of course. Okay. No, I didn't know or see any parts of that. That's fine. The other question I had, just on the mortgage repurchase reserve, obviously, you're comfortable with your reserve, but what is a more of a normalized level, right? Presumably, the reserve today set up for, let's call it, some problem years in the past. But as we move forward, the quality of the portfolio gets much better. I'm just trying to figure out where the reserve ends up. And is there a metric to think about, whether it's basis points of loans outstanding or loans sold, that we should be thinking about on a normalized basis?","Daniel T. Poston","Yes, Ken, I think that's difficult to estimate at this point. Certainly, historically, that normalized level for repurchase has approached 0. The optimistic view would be that, someday, we'll get back to that kind of an environment. I think that's still possible, but I think that will take some time for us to get there. So we've got a combination here of standards being enforced that perhaps weren't enforced previously, losses at record levels and those kinds of things kind of produced these results. Going forward, hopefully, the loss experiences will trend back toward normalized levels. And for us, at least, we would certainly believe that the improvements we've made in controls and processes would also contribute to there being far fewer defects on any losses that do result going forward. So we will work diligently to manage that number to close to 0, but that's years away. That's not quarters away.","Operator","We now have a question from the line of Scott Siefers.","R. Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","I think most of my questions have been answered, but I guess I was just hoping you could touch on the overall reserve. Generally, I mean, you guys have obviously benefited from drawing it down over the last couple of years, but by the same token, by most measures, I mean, you've still got a very strong reserve. So just kind of qualitatively, I was hoping you could give your thoughts on how much longer does that tailwind last. Where ultimately would you see it flushing out, et cetera?","Kevin T. Kabat","Yes, I mean, relative to the reserve, we've talked in the past about the fact that our reserve methodology is what drives our reserve levels, and the reserve methodology by design tends to produce incremental benefits in terms of the overall levels of reserves as credit continues to incrementally get better. So we've continued to see improvements in credit quality. We've continued to see improvements in net charge-off rates and so forth. And as those things continue to improve, I think we will continue to see the impact of those improvements reflected in the reserve. In terms of when that levels out, I think that remains to be seen. There are a number of forces, I guess, I would say, that have an impact on that. There's the regulatory environment and what -- the posture that the regulators adopt with respect to reserves. There's also, obviously, discussions of changes and allowance rules and so forth. Absent changes in the rules, our best estimate at this point would be that we would be migrating toward about a 1.5% kind of reserve, but I think that's subject to change based upon accounting -- the accounting rules continuing to evolve, as well as regulator expectations and pressures.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this -- we've now reached our allotted time for Q&A. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Richardson and our list of panelists to give any closing remarks.","Jeff Richardson","I have no closing remarks.

My name is Scott, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q1 2016 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","Thank you. Sameer Gokhale, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Sameer Shripad Gokhale - Head of Investor Relations","Thank you, Scott. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Today, we'll be discussing our financial results for the first quarter of 2016. This discussion may contain certain forward-looking statements about Fifth Third pertaining to our financial condition, results of operations, plans and objectives. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from historical performance and these statements.","We've identified some of these factors in our forward-looking cautionary statement at the end of our earnings release and in other materials, and we encourage you to review them. Fifth Third undertakes no obligation and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call.","This morning, I'm joined on the call by our President and CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Chief Operating Officer, Lars Anderson; Chief Risk Officer, Frank Forrest; and our Treasurer, Jamie Leonard.","Following prepared remarks by Greg and Tayfun, we will open the call up to questions. As a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up, and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. We'll do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have this morning. During the question-and-answer period, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Greg.","Gregory D. Carmichael - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Sameer, and thanks all of you for joining us this morning. Today, we reported first quarter net income to common shareholders of $312 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.40. We had some non-core items that added $0.03 to earnings per share in the quarter.","Our Q1 results were solid, especially considering the market volatility we experienced during the quarter. Fee income levels, including capital market fees, were stronger despite market disruptions. As you know, we have been building out our capital markets capabilities for the last few years. We're seeing our investments pay off. During the quarter, we closed on the largest M&A deal in the history of our company.","Net interest income was also stronger than expected. We benefited from low deposit betas following the December rate hike and expect to continue to manage deposit rates tightly. Given the outlook for rate, we should continue to benefit from our steady and cautious strategy with respect to rate risk management.","We remain focused on executing our defined strategies. We closed on the sale of the branches in St. Louis, which resulted in an $8 million pre-tax gain. In addition, we expect to close on the sale of the Pittsburgh branches. We continue to rationalize our branch network and are on track to deliver $60 million in annual expense savings related to these reductions.","We're introducing new products and services. Our new Express Banking product, for example, received high accolades throughout directly from the CFPB. Since we launched this product in November of 2015, we have opened more than 65,000 new customer accounts. Our ongoing investments in digital technology continue to accelerate our growth rate in mobile banking.","In 2015, our growth of mobile users exceeded the industry average and even accelerated, while the rest of our industry experienced a slowdown. In the first quarter, over 70% (sic) [17%] of our deposit transactions were executed via mobile devices, compared with 12% in the first quarter of 2012 (sic) [2015]. In addition, we doubled the number of checking accounts that were opened online from a year ago.","During the quarter, we implemented an early retirement program. This program resulted in a $14 million one-time expense that will generate $9 million in annual cost savings. We'll continue to look for more efficient ways to operate our company. Achieving operating leverage is our top priority and we're making progress toward that goal.","Our expenses, net of one-timers, were up 2% sequentially, partly reflecting the seasonal increase in FICA and unemployment insurance. While we are investing in our company, we are very focused on controlling expenses across all of our operations. We now believe that our expense growth in 2016 will be lower than we had originally expected. Tayfun will provide more details and an update on our outlook in his comments.","As we shared with you in January, we are pursuing with several strategic initiatives to improve revenue growth, generate cost efficiencies and improve service quality. We remain on track and intend to share our progress with you as the year continues to unfold.","While in 2015 we discussed our efforts to reduce our risk exposures, as of March 31 our loans to commodity traders were down to $241 million. That's down by more than 50% from the peak. On energy, oil prices did rebound off lows, but the sector remains under stress. Our balances were stable from the fourth quarter at $1.7 billion. As expected, we saw continued deterioration in the book.","Energy NPLs were $168 million higher from the last quarter, but they represented the bulk of the total NPL increase during the quarter. The loans that moved into the NPL category were predominantly reserve-based loans. As these loans are generally well collateralized, (05:29) we do not expect a similar increase in net charge-offs.","At the end of the first quarter, we only had $294 million in loans due to higher risk oilfield services companies. We held reserves of 6.2% against our total energy portfolio and we believe these reserves are more than appropriate. Our capital levels remain strong, with common equity Tier 1 of 9.8%. Our earnings contributed to a tangible book value of $16.32 per share, which was up 5% from last quarter and up 9% over last year. During the quarter, we also announced a share repurchase of $240 million of our common stock which settled on April 11 to retire approximately 14.5 million shares.","With that, I'll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our first quarter operating results and our current outlook.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Greg. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Let's start with the financials summary on page four of the presentation. For the first quarter, we reported net income to common shareholders of $312 million or $0.40 per diluted share. There was a net benefit in the quarter of $0.03 per share, resulting from the gains on the Vantiv warrant and the branch sales, offset partially by the cost of the voluntary retirement program. We are pleased with the results, especially given challenging market conditions during the quarter.","So let's move to the average balance sheet on page 5 of the presentation. Average commercial loan balances were relatively flat sequentially, but up about 5% year-over-year. Our end-of-period balances were up by $1.5 billion or 3% sequentially. The decline in average balances was partly due to higher pay-downs and delays in closings at the very end of last year. We experienced healthy activity in the latter half of the first quarter.","Average consumer loans were down 1% from last quarter and up 1% year-over-year. Residential mortgage loans grew by 2% sequentially as we continue to portfolio only jumbo mortgages and ARMs, and up 11% year-over-year. Indirect auto loans are down 3% from last quarter and 5% year-over-year, in line with our lower origination targets and focus on improving returns in this business. The return profile of our first quarter production was one of the best in the last few years within the super prime market that we mainly focus on.","Average investment securities increased by $317 million in the first quarter or 1% sequentially. Average core deposits decreased $1 billion from the fourth quarter. This decrease was driven by seasonally lower demand deposits, partially offset by higher interest checking balances. Our liquidity coverage ratio was very strong at 118% at the end of the quarter.","Moving to NII on page 6 of the presentation. Taxable equivalent net interest income increased by $5 million sequentially to $909 million, despite the negative day count impact. The increase was primarily driven by improvement in variable rate loan yields due to the increase in the Fed funds rate in December, with deposit betas remaining at low levels.","Quarter-over-quarter, our earning asset yield increased by 8 basis points (sic) [10 basis points], accompanied by a 3-basis-point increase in cost of interest-bearing liabilities. These benefits were partially offset by the effect of a reduced Fed stock dividend payment and continued spread compression from the mix shift to lower-yielding higher-quality credits, which we've discussed previously.","NII also benefited from the timing of the investments in the portfolio as cash flows were invested earlier in the quarter and the late debt issuance during the quarter. Overall, we are pleased with our NII growth over last quarter and the 7% growth year-over-year. NIM improved 6 basis points to 2.91% quarter-over-quarter.","Shifting to fees on page 7 of the presentation. First quarter non-interest income was $637 million, compared with $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter. Our fee income, adjusted primarily for Vantiv-related items and the annual $31 million TRA payment in the fourth quarter, was $578 million, a decrease of $14 million or 2% sequentially. Despite seasonal headwinds and challenging market conditions, our results were strong.","Corporate banking fees of $102 million were relatively flat sequentially and, adjusted for the write-down of a residual lease in the first quarter of 2015, were up 10% year-over-year. As we mentioned in January, corporate banking fees are seasonally lower in the first quarter and overall market conditions were weak during the quarter. So our performance was strong despite the challenging backdrop.","Mortgage banking net revenue of $78 million was up $4 million sequentially. Originations were $1.8 billion in the first quarter, with 46% of the mix consisting of purchase volume. About 75% of the originations came from the retail and direct channels, and the remainder came through the correspondent channel. Gain on sale margins were up 57 basis points sequentially to 347 basis points, and net servicing asset valuation adjustments were negative $16 million, similar to last quarter.","Deposit service charges decreased 5% from the fourth quarter, reflecting seasonal trends in consumer deposit fees, and increased 1% relative to the first quarter of 2015. Total investment advisory revenue of $102 million was flat sequentially, mostly reflecting weaker equity market activity during the quarter. This impact was offset by seasonally higher trust tax preparation fees.","Excluding certain one-time items, our year-over-year revenue growth reached nearly 5%, a very good outcome in a challenging environment.","Next, I'd like to discuss non-interest expense in page 8 of the presentation. Expenses were $986 million, compared with $963 million in the fourth quarter. The sequential increase was partly due to seasonally higher FICA and unemployment insurance expense, and a $14 million expense related to the voluntary early retirement program.","The early retirement program was well received by our employees and approximately 160 employees participated. As a result, we expect a $9 million decrease in annual compensation expenses. As Greg said earlier, we continue to look for other similar opportunities to improve our expense run rate. I will provide an update on our expense outlook a little later.","Turning to credit results on slide 9. Net charge-offs were $96 million or 42 basis points in the first quarter, compared to $80 million and 34 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2015, and $91 million and 41 basis points in the first quarter a year ago. The sequential increase was due to a $16 million increase in C&I net charge-offs. Of the total net charge-offs, $9 million were in energy.","Non-performing loans, excluding loans held for sale, increased $195 million from the previous quarter to $701 million, resulting in an NPL ratio of 75 basis points. Commercial NPLs increased $202 million from the fourth quarter, driven by $168 million in energy NPLs. Consumer NPLs declined by $7 million sequentially. Overall, credit conditions, excluding energy, remained within our expectations.","Consumer credit continues to improve and commercial credit, excluding energy, is stable. Our provision was $23 million higher than the total charge-offs in the first quarter and our reserve coverage moved up 1 basis point to 1.38% of loans and leases.","It is important to note, as Greg mentioned, that an increase in energy NPLs should not necessarily translate into an increase in charge-offs of the same magnitude. This is because the majority of energy NPLs are well collateralized and consist of reserve-based loans.","On slide 10, we have provided a breakdown of our energy portfolio. Our energy-related loans at the end of the quarter were $1.7 billion with total commitments of $4 billion. As you can see, our loans to oilfield services companies were only $294 million or 17% of our total energy loans outstanding and leaves only $170 million in unused commitments.","We believe that we are appropriately reserved for losses in the energy portfolio based on detailed stress analysis that our teams continue to update, not only on the oilfield services portfolio, but also on our reserve-based loans.","Based on detailed analysis, we believe that our energy reserves, which are currently at 6.2%, up from 4.8% at the end of last year, are adequate. Our stress case scenario over a nine-quarter period assumes that oil prices will be at $20 in 2016 and $25 in 2017. This stress scenario would add approximately $50 million to $60 million in net charge-offs over and above our current reserves.","On slide 11, we provide a breakdown of our commercial real estate portfolio. It is important to note that our commercial real estate business today is much different than what we had pre-crisis. At the end of 2007, 21% of our total loans and leases were in commercial real estate. Today, we are at 11% below our peer levels. At the end of 2007, over 40% of our non-owner occupied exposure was in land and residential development. Today, that exposure is slightly above 4%.","As you can see, our non-performing assets continued to decrease both within the commercial mortgage and commercial construction portfolios. At the end of the first quarter, NPAs in our commercial mortgage portfolio decreased to 1.84% from 2.56% a year earlier. NPAs in our commercial construction portfolio decreased to 23 basis points from 67 basis points over the same period.","During the last two years, we significantly upgraded our credit resources in commercial mortgage and construction underwriting, which increased our focus on fine selection, geographical diversity and multi-factor stress analysis.","Moving on to capital on slide 12. Our capital levels remained strong. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 9.8%, an increase of 30 basis points year-over-year. At the end of the first quarter, common shares outstanding were down approximately 15 million. During the quarter, we announced and settled a common stock repurchase of $240 million and reduced the first quarter share count by 14.5 million shares.","Now moving to outlook. The drivers of our overall outlook remain unchanged. We expect year-over-year commercial loan growth to exceed 3% and the consumer loan portfolio to decline. The decline of our consumer loan portfolio will primarily reflect lower auto loan originations, as we had previously discussed, and includes the impact of the sales associated with the St. Louis and Pittsburgh transactions.","Our interest rate outlook now has only one rate increase in June as opposed to the two increases that we had in our original base case. For the second quarter, we would expect relatively stable net interest income compared with the first quarter, but despite one late rate increase, we still expect a 2.5% to 3% increase in NII year-over-year.","In our base case, we would expect to see a 3-basis-point to 4-basis-point of NIM decline in the second quarter and then hold relatively steady in line with our results in 2015. Although deposit betas are expected to remain low, our outlook assumes incremental spread compression due to our continued emphasis on originating higher quality loans. This update improves upon our January guidance as it includes one less rate increase. Without a rate increase, we would expect NII to grow around 2%.","Our overall fee income growth outlook is not changing. We expect to grow our fees between 4% and 5% on the 2015 base of $2.3 billion, which excludes Vantiv share and warrant gains that we had during the year. We are lowering our year-over-year expense outlook from 4.5% to 5% to the 4% to 4.25% range. We believe that our intense focus on expense control will result in an improvement in our operating efficiency compared to our January expectations. The quarterly run rate will increase from the first quarter levels and this will reflect seasonality and the timing of implementation of strategic initiatives, but we will have better year-over-year results than originally expected.","Our second quarter results will also include a one-time approximately $10 million expense as a result of retirement eligibility changes related to long-term incentive compensation. These changes will align our retirement eligibility provisions with our peer group. This is just a change in the timing of the recognition of expenses and would lower our expense going forward.","We continue to monitor our energy exposures closely. It is likely that we will see higher charge-offs in this portfolio, primarily in the oilfield services sector. Given the relatively modest size of our exposure, future credit losses should be manageable.","Credit losses, ex energy, should remain in range, with some potential variability quarter-to-quarter due to the historically low-level of current charge-offs.","With that, let me open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Thanks a lot. Tayfun, I was wondering if you could just follow-up a little bit more on the credit outlook. You mentioned that \u2013 we saw a big boost in the NPAs. You don't expect to see a lot more necessarily on the energy losses. But can you just flush out your confidence in seeing the benign underneath? And if you can just parse out the portfolios what you're expecting in kind of commercial ex energy and on the consumer side?","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Frank is here. Frank's going to answer that question.","Frank R. Forrest - Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer","Hey. Good question. Thank you, Ken. As we reported, non-performing assets are up in the quarter, almost all of that is energy-related, 90%-plus is energy-related. It's all tied to reserve-based lending loans, seven (21:57) loans. We feel very confident at this point that those loans are protected by the risk-adjusted collateral coverage that we have in place.","All borrowers in the segment that are on NPL that were just moved are current. I think that's important. The regulators, as you've probably heard on other earnings calls, have taken a much stricter view of how they are classifying these loans from an accounting perspective. They are looking to cover both the first and the second lien positions on these companies.","In our case, we have a super secured first lien position, and we've gone through a very detailed portfolio analysis of bottoms-up of all of our energy book to ensure that from a borrowing base perspective we're well secured.","So NPLs are up. However, it's in a segment that's very well protected from a collateral position both historically and based on our current outlook. We could see additional deterioration from an energy perspective in NPL given that in the future, as Tayfun indicated. But we are not changing our outlook on overall credit losses.","Beyond that, when you look at the rest of the portfolio, we've talked this morning about commercial real estate, and we feel very good about that book. The performance is holding up very well. We have very little exposure in commercial real estate in the energy states. We have four multi-family credits that are in Houston, two of which are stabilized, the other two are performing under construction according to the terms that we've set. And we have some exposure in Denver from a commercial real estate perspective, but that market has held up very well, that being in an energy sector.","So the overall commercial real estate book at this point is performing to our expectations. Our middle market book is performing very well. We're showing very strong performance in most of our core markets. We're not concerned there. Our leverage book is stable. We'll have some lumpiness quarter-to-quarter in leverage, but overall it's performing to our expectations as well.","So I hope that was responsive to your question.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","It was. Thanks. And there's one quick follow-up. Tayfun, you'd previously talked about building reserves this year more reflecting loan growth. Is that also a reasonable expectation?","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Again, we will have to look at the reserve situation on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Obviously, we did say that reserve releases are very unlikely and, by the end of the year, our provisioning will reflect loan growth ultimately. But that's a quarter-by-quarter analysis that we will share with you.","Ken Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Great. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller from FBR & Company. Your line is open.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Yeah. Thank you very much. On your energy credits, have you seen any deterioration in any of your CRE markets associated with your energy?","Frank R. Forrest - Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer","Hey. This is Frank. Let me speak to that. You're talking about non-energy credits that are...","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Yes, just the second derivative. A lot of people worry about the CRE markets and I guess other second derivatives to the energy market where a lot of people have claimed that a lot of the growth is coming out of the energy markets. So I was wondering if you saw any of the deterioration in some of these markets outside of energy that were related to energy?","Frank R. Forrest - Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer","Yeah. One thing to keep in mind, we're really not a Southwest bank. We don't have a retail presence in the Southwest. We do other business there. Our commercial books held up very well. We don't see any deterioration from a traditional, commercial middle market or mid-cap perspective.","I just talked about real estate. Again, in Texas, we just had four transactions, $100 million in total exposure, multi-family, through national developers. We see no problems there. If you switch over to indirect, we have about $1.5 billion in the energy states in indirect exposure, which is 4% of our total indirect...","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's indirect auto loan.","Frank R. Forrest - Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer","Indirect. And so it's a $1.5 billion in total indirect exposure \u2013 in consumer exposure and the vast majority of that is in indirect auto loans. We've seen some uptick in past dues in that book. We've cut off a number of dealer relationships in Texas in order to pull in and shrink back that exposure. But, overall, we feel good about the consumer indirect book in Texas.","Other than that, we really don't have any substantial consumer exposure in the energy states. So, again, our focus has been, and if you ask for concerns, it would be around what we have in real estate, but it's small and it's well managed, and on the indirect and the direct piece of consumer, it's 4% of our portfolio.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Thank you very much, gentlemen.","Frank R. Forrest - Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer","Thank you.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore. Your line is open.","Stephen Moss - Evercore ISI","Good morning. It's actually Steve Moss in for John. Wondering on with regard to the mix shift on loans going to lower yielding, higher quality loans. Wondering if you could just quantify what you're thinking about the impact to loan yields over the course of the year.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's going to be a function of basically the payoffs and originations. Originations are clearly coming at the upper end of our credit spectrum. In March, for example, when we looked at our commercial originations, the average grades were sort of very close to the investment grade spectrum in our underwriting.","Largely, the timing of the impact on margin will also depend on the payoffs from the lower-end of the spectrum, and that's a little bit tough to quantify. We will quantify that for you each quarter as the quarter goes by, but it's a fairly steady type of tightening at this point.","James C. Leonard - Treasurer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. And one thing on our NIM outlook for the second quarter that's embedded in that is that, C&I yield, the expectation would be down a couple of basis points as a result of that loan yield compression as we continue to transition to a higher credit profile client...","Stephen Moss - Evercore ISI","Okay. And also you mentioned improved profitability in the auto loan book here this quarter. I'm just kind of wondering where you're originating those, at what yields are you originating those loans this quarter and what were your total originations?","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, in terms of the spreads, the spreads this quarter were a good 25 basis points, 30 basis points above what we've seen over the past number of quarters. But I just want to remind you that that was a very deliberate decision on our part to lower our annual originations to roughly $3 billion from $5 billion, which enabled us to focus on profitability rather than volume.","Our auto business is a national business, that has not changed. The geographic distribution of originations is roughly about the same, except for what Frank mentioned earlier. The spreads have widened, the credit quality remains the same. So we're getting more return on the same type of capital allocation for the loans that we are originating.","James C. Leonard - Treasurer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. And on the first quarter origination levels, it was a little bit ahead of $900 million or so and that was a little bit ahead of our expectations, frankly, given the pricing changes and the yields you've seen. So our outlook has increased the originations from about $3 billion at the end of the year to about $3.3 billion for this year, and I think you'll see yield expansion in the second quarter in that book.","Stephen Moss - Evercore ISI","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of David Long from Raymond James. Your line is open.","David J. Long - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Just shifting gears here to the mortgage business. And a few weeks into the quarter here, can you give us some color on what the pipeline looks like and maybe what gain on sales spreads look like right now?","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Pipeline looks good. I mean, obviously, the rates have stayed under 4% for most of the first quarter. It's a little early to make a comment on spreads for the quarter. Obviously, Q1 spreads were wider. We'll just have to wait a little longer to get a firmer perspective on gain on sales spreads for this quarter.","David J. Long - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then just the second question that I had regarding the effective tax rate that's moved around a bit with the Vantiv-related transactions. Any color on how we can expect that to move here for the rest of the year?","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I mean, I think actually the tax rate came in pretty close to where we expected for the year. We're going to be close to these numbers probably within sort of a 0.5 percentage level-ish. It really is no different than what we expected going into the year.","David J. Long - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Gregory D. Carmichael - President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Matt.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Matt.","Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning, folks. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a follow-up on the margin guidance, Tayfun. You mentioned about the effect of the lower loan yields. Can you give us a sense as to how you're thinking about reinvestment yields with the 10-year treasury still visibly below 2%?","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Jamie, why don't you take that?","James C. Leonard - Treasurer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Right now, you saw on our book, at the beginning of the quarter, January, February, we reinvested some cash flows because we saw a little bit better entry point there and then you saw we lightened on an end-of-period basis on the investment portfolio as we closed out the quarter.","So, frankly, if rates were to stay at these pretty low levels, you could expect from us just to reinvest cash flows because the entry points don't look real good. But if rates were to have a little bit of a sell-up here and present more opportunity, then you would expect our investment portfolio to grow in line with earning assets. But I don't think you'll see a lot of movement in the book one way or the other throughout 2016.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Remember, when we were building for LCR, Matt, in the last two years, there was quite a bit more movement in the size of the portfolio. But, looking out now, it's going to be a steadier direction.","Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And then, if I can just follow-up on a energy-related question, I'm curious in terms of the \u2013 it looks like the overall outstanding balance hasn't really changed much quarter-over-quarter.","Gregory D. Carmichael - President & Chief Executive Officer","Correct.","Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","But within that, are you seeing loan pay-downs or other types of cash flow in from those borrowers that is offsetting some potential draw-downs from other clients?","Lars C. Anderson - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, overall \u2013 and this is Lars. We've seen pretty steady balances on an overall basis in that portfolio as we continue to work through with our clients. What we did see in this past quarter was commitment levels declined, as we've repositioned and reduced our exposure level to a number of names. Accordingly, utilization rates moved up a little bit.","But, frankly, we would expect that those overall balances committed and loan balances would come down over a period of time as the clients that we continue to work with very closely continue to sell off core, non-core assets, access the equity capital and debt capital markets and reduce their profile. But this is a great long-term business. We've got some expert bankers and we're working very closely with our clients.","Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then, just finally on the auto loan portfolio, you mentioned you're focused on prime and maybe even super prime in that portfolio. Doesn't look like from the 90-day past due volumes that that's changed very much. But can you just confirm that the asset quality in that portfolio really hasn't deteriorated much over the past 6 months to 12 months?","Frank R. Forrest - Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer","This is Frank. It has not. We have not changed our position at all. We're predominantly a super prime lender to the top dealers and it continues to perform very well to our expectations.","Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.","Frank R. Forrest - Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo from CLSA. Your line is open.","Gregory D. Carmichael - President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Mike.","Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi. I just wanted to ask about operating leverage. You said operating leverage is a priority. But then we see expenses up in the first quarter. The efficiency ratio got worse quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. You're still \u2013 your expense guidance is lower than before, but it's still over 4%. And you had closed, I guess, two-thirds of your 100 targeted branches as of last quarter.","So I'm just seeing a disconnect between some of the words. It's a priority, you're closing branches, and the result, expense is still growing faster than revenues. So I guess my question is, why do you still have expense growth over 4% in a revenue environment that seems pretty soft? And when will we see the benefits of those branch closings?","Gregory D. Carmichael - President & Chief Executive Officer","Mike, this is Greg. Thanks for the question. First off, we are focused on, once again, continuing to rationalize all of our expenses. The branch closures that we announced last year, we should be completely through. We have already sold the Pittsburgh \u2013 or the St. Louis. We'll close on Pittsburgh this week. We expect to be through that exercise by middle of this year. And we're still on target for that $60 million annualized improvement on the branches.","We also \u2013 as I mentioned before, we offered a early retirement program. We are very focused on expense management, but we're also focused on making the strategic investments that we have to make going forward, that we hope and we anticipate will continue to drive revenue, improve our operating efficiencies, improve our service quality.","We've got to make those investments. We want to do this at the best price points. So we're even sharpening the pencil closely on how we spend that money to make sure we get the return we're looking for. We're very much focused on the execution of those initiatives and drive into the outcomes. So, going forward, we've guided lower on the expenses that we initially anticipated for this year, albeit still at 4%.","We need to be lower than that obviously. We need to create positive operating leverage and that's what we're focused on. And hopefully, as we go into latter parts of this year, we'll turn the corner to positive operating leverage.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. And Mike, remember, first quarter has, compared to the fourth quarter, $25 million, $26 million higher just in two line-items, which is FICA and unemployment insurance. So the first quarter typically is going to be a higher efficiency ratio quarter compared to Q4. But, as Greg said and he's been talking about this for a couple of quarters now, there's quite a bit of focus on taking out expenses from operations, so that we can reinvest back in the company. So our outlook \u2013 we believe that we will do better than what we've told you in January.","Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","Yeah, that's helpful. Just one follow-up. Greg, I'm just curious about your style, I mean, as a new CEO, you start in the position and expenses are still growing faster than many of your peers. On the one hand, if you wind up with negative operating leverage a year or two from now, we're all going to be saying, wow, you should have not grown expenses that quickly. On the other hand, if some of your investments pay off, then we're going to say, wow, this was really forward-looking on your behalf.","So can you talk about your style in terms of this spending for future gains, the risks and the opportunities as you think about it in your mind?","Gregory D. Carmichael - President & Chief Executive Officer","Mike, first off, as I mentioned before, we have to make the investments to reposition the bank for the realities that we're operating in. And we're going to be in this low rate environment we believe for some period of time. We've got to focus on generating quality revenues with the right partnerships and we also have to focus on making sure that we have efficiencies in our organization.","If you go back and look at our operation cost, we're running our central operations less than we did in 2007 at a much higher volume rate than we were in 2007. We have a good history of managing expenses in this organization, and we'll continue that history going forward. But we have to invest to re-platform our infrastructure, which we're doing, and we'll get paid well for that.","We're pruning back and leaving back our distribution channels, as we mentioned before, around branches. We're moving to digital and on capabilities for our customers which will reduce our back-office cost, re-platforming our retail platform, our mortgage platform, which would be significantly more efficient going forward. We've got to get paid for those investments.","So it's not lost upon me at the end of the day that we're making commitments. We've got to get the return on those commitments to the bottom-line of the company, and that's what we're focused on. We've mentioned that and I mentioned before that this year is a transformational year to make those investments, but we've got to get paid for them.","So my style is this, is execution, getting it done and making the commitments that we made to the organization, our shareholders and our investors, and we're going to do just that. So, that's what we're focused on.","Mike Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you.","Gregory D. Carmichael - President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Mike.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Peter Winter from Sterne Agee. Your line is open.","Peter J. Winter - Sterne Agee CRT","Good morning.","Gregory D. Carmichael - President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Peter.","Peter J. Winter - Sterne Agee CRT","I'm just curious how far through are you in terms of the mix shift to higher quality loans. And then, secondly, with this mixed shift, how do you think about through a cycle where your net charge-offs would be in a range versus historically?","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So it's difficult to tell you exactly where we are in terms of the de-risking or repositioning of our balance sheet, and part of that is that we have a changing economic environment, interest environment, economic environment. But I would tell you that we continue to stay focused on it every single day. We're reallocating our resources to the businesses that best fit not just our risk appetite, but also produce the best returns for our shareholders over a long period of time.","One of the keys here is not just, of course, to achieve the highest returns, but also position this balance sheet and our loan portfolio so that it'll outperform through the future cycles, which I think leads to the second part of your question, which Frank may want to have a comment on.","Frank R. Forrest - Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer","Your question regarding loss, I mean our normal range is 30 basis points to 50 basis points of loss. We've performed to that number over the last several years. We've had some lumpiness quarter-to-quarter, but if you look at year-over-year performance, we've stayed within that range, and that's where we expect to be this year.","As Lars said, we are really intently focused on managing credit really well through the cycle. And so we are looking at investing in businesses that we believe will do that. We're growing our asset-based lending business. We're growing our leasing business. But we're pulling back a bit on our leverage business. Those are all conscious decisions to ensure we have the appropriate risk and return in balance that will provide good returns and consistent performance through any cycle as we go forward.","Peter J. Winter - Sterne Agee CRT","Okay. But so wouldn't it lower it through a normal cycle, just given this change that you're going through?","Frank R. Forrest - Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer","Well, it should. Over an extended period of time, it should. But where we sit today, is we're managing what we have currently on the books, and currently, how we're managing the energy book. It's small relative to the overall size of our company at less than 2% of our outstandings, but we're in a choppy environment. Our performance overall is still I think very good and our outlook for this year is continue to be consistent. We haven't changed our outlook where charge-offs are.","Lars C. Anderson - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean, I think, also just on an absolute basis, yes everything else being equal. But if the environment changes and we sort of get to the other side of this credit cycle, it is our expectation and belief that by doing what we are doing, de-risking the business, our credit performance relative to the industry should be better. That doesn't necessarily mean that at absolute levels it will stay, but relative to the credit cycles, we will do better.","Peter J. Winter - Sterne Agee CRT","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","Hello. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. It looks like the Vantiv stock price, almost feels like every day it's setting new highs and the Fifth Third stock price isn't. So what is the strategic rationale for still holding the Vantiv stake and how strategically and financially do you think about whether it makes sense to exit that versus whether it makes sense to continue to hold it?","Gregory D. Carmichael - President & Chief Executive Officer","This is Greg. First off, obviously, Vantiv has done extremely well and we're proud to have our ownership position that we have in that company. We've been very thoughtful over the last three years in how we monetize that position. I think the returns to our shareholders have been outstanding.","We're going to continue to watch that company. We're going to continue to assess the value of their equity and their forward opportunities, strategically what they have in front of them and their opportunities, and we're going to make the best decision for our shareholders going forward with respect to how we continue to monetize our position.","Consistently we've done that each year. We anticipate to continue that same path. To what extent and at what time, well, it really gets back to looking at the factors I just discussed, which is our long-term thoughts and projections on what they're going to be able to perform at and how we're performing, and we'll continue to monetize that position over time.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","But in terms of how you think about it now, is it purely a financial calculation around how you maximize the returns to Fifth Third or is there any kind of strategic benefit in having a stake at all?","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I think, Geoff, we don't have trigger points where we feel that we are forced to take action. We look at that sector, the drivers of performance in that sector. We look at performance of drivers in the banking sector. We look at Vantiv's opportunities strategically. So it is really a multi-factor analysis that we go through and try to make the same type of decisions that we've made in the past for our shareholders.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","Great. Thank you.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Terry McEvoy from Stephens. Your line is open.","Terry J. McEvoy - Stephens, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","Gregory D. Carmichael - President & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Terry.","Terry J. McEvoy - Stephens, Inc.","Greg, you were quoted in an article about Fifth Third early this week in your local newspaper talking about non-bank acquisitions, and I believe it mentioned smaller banks. I was wondering if you could expand upon your interest on the non-bank side as well as the small bank side.","Gregory D. Carmichael - President & Chief Executive Officer","And we do have \u2013 and we continue to look at once again ways that we can continue to be a better partner and add value in our business. So, when you think about our payments area, we support obviously corporate strategy verticals like retail, healthcare and so forth. So, looking for opportunities in those sectors, we made a small investment in a company called Zipscene. We just made investment in another company called Transactis that was just recently announced.","So those are the type of things I'm looking for. In addition to that, we're also looking for opportunities in the wealth management sector, insurance opportunities. That might make sense for us going forward as we continue to build out more capabilities in those sectors. So we're interested in where those opportunities lie, once again for the right value proposition, for the right long-term value for our shareholders, we're considering those.","On the bank side of the house, as I mentioned in prior discussions, we're really focused on opportunities to be more relevant in the markets that we're in. And we can continue to build out a quality franchise in our higher growth markets like the Carolinas, Tennessee, Chicago markets. We're interested in when those opportunities materialize, that make sense for our shareholders, at the right price, at the right value proposition, we're going to continue to consider those also.","Terry J. McEvoy - Stephens, Inc.","And then just a follow-up question on the corporate banking line, you mentioned and then we saw that from the results are strong, first quarter despite where you normally see seasonality, how's the pipeline for 2Q and do you think that seasonality in terms of a quarter-over-quarter pickup in the second quarter will occur this year?","Gregory D. Carmichael - President & Chief Executive Officer","No, we feel good about the pipeline, but I'll turn it over to Lars for some more color around the pipeline.","Lars C. Anderson - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, if you break down corporate banking, you really look at the significant part of that capital markets where we really outperformed, and I think we outperformed the market. We're up 18% from the prior quarter. We're up on a common quarter basis also. And frankly, we grew almost every client solution and every product throughout our capital markets platform, other than corporate bond underwriting.","Frankly, we're getting a lot of traction there. The pipeline is strong, it's strengthening. And a lot of that is because we're adding additional talent and capabilities. We're able to broaden current relationships and it's putting us into a position, frankly, to be more leaned left with a number of our clients.","So I feel good about it over the long-term. But I think it's important to keep in mind that for capital markets, that the macroeconomic environment does have a significant impact quarter-to-quarter and it does tend to be a little bit of a lumpy fee income source. And we mean to diversify it, build it out, consistent with our relationship banking strategy.","Terry J. McEvoy - Stephens, Inc.","Thanks, Lars.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Apologies if I am repeating something you said. Too many earnings calls going on at the same time, so we're trying to do the best we can. Just a couple of numbers on energy loans. What percentage are investment grade and what you have total NPLs on energy as of the first quarter?","Frank R. Forrest - Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer","52% of our core book is investment grade. Again, as we've talked about before, E&P loans make up 58% of our total portfolio. The vast majority of those are reserve-based lending loans, where we feel we're very well secured. We continue to be protected by our risk-adjusted collateral coverage.","The issue we have is not there, the issue we have is on 17% of the portfolio which is oilfield services. And it's only on a third of that portfolio, where about $90 million where we have projected losses going forward.","So it's a small book, 2% overall, and the portion that we're concerned about is 17% of that 2%, and only a third of that, if that makes sense. So we feel overall we're very well protected.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I'm presuming that's Frank who just spoke, right?","Frank R. Forrest - Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer","Hey, this is Frank, yes.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yep. Frank, can you give me some numbers on just \u2013 I know you talked about NPAs' increase of $168 million. Could you give us a number what it was at the end of the quarter?","Frank R. Forrest - Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer","On non-performing loans?","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes, please.","Frank R. Forrest - Executive Vice President & Chief Risk Officer","Yeah. We were just above the $180 million at the end of the quarter.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And switching now to Greg, going back to a question that was just asked, just a little more clarification on your interest and small bank acquisitions. Can you define small banks that are what size you're thinking about, for one? For second, Chicago, you've cited Southeast, whether Chicago fits into your interest better?","Gregory D. Carmichael - President & Chief Executive Officer","Listen, we've got a good franchise in Chicago. There's opportunities to grow in that market. So we're being thoughtful about opportunities that may emerge in markets like Chicago and our other higher Mid-South (51:59) footprint opportunities. So we will consider those type of acquisitions. I don't want to put a size limit or opportunity out there on the size of the deal we do, but obviously there's going to be something we'll make sure that fit our franchise. This is something that we could execute well against. And once again, it gets back to the value preposition of that opportunity for our shareholders long-term.","The market has not been favorable to recent deals that were announced, we're very mindful of that. We want to make sure we do the right deal at the right time for the right value preposition for our shareholders.","Vivek Juneja - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.

This discussion may contain certain forward-looking statements about Fifth Third pertaining to our financial conditions, results of operations, plans and objectives. These statements involve certain risks and uncertainties. There are a number of factors that could cause results to differ materially from historical performance and these statements.","We've identified some of these factors in our forward-looking cautionary statement at the end of our earnings release and in other materials, and we encourage you to review them.

During the question-and-answer period, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin Kabat. Kevin?","Kevin T. Kabat - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jim. Morning, everyone. Today, we reported first quarter net income to common shareholders of $367 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.44. Results included the impact of a $70 million positive valuation on the Vantiv warrant, a $37 million gain on the sale of TDRs and a $17 million charge related to the valuation of our Visa total return swap, which in total benefited earnings by about $0.07.","We produced solid returns with a 1.12% return on assets and a 10.3% return on equity. The environment continues to challenge banks. Combination of uneven economic growth, uncertainty around the Fed's monetary policies and the global impact of central bank actions continue to test the banks' business models. These are not new challenges, and we've discussed with you our strategies and tactics that are designed to preserve shareholder value and to grow our earnings with this background in mind.","We are very focused on investing in our businesses, our infrastructure and our talent, while we make sure that we have appropriate returns on the capital that we deploy, given the risk exposures that we manage. We're building profitable relationships with our clients and earnings returns on the capital that we dedicate to those relationships.","Regardless of the environment, that's what our focus is and that's where we excel. This quarter, we continued to execute our plan and the results are encouraging. Our loan growth showed momentum in the second half of the quarter, with end-of-period C&I loans up $1.3 billion or 3% sequentially. I'm encouraged by the trends that we saw in February and March, and I'm optimistic that our momentum will persist in the coming quarters.","Within fee income, mortgage banking performed well, given the lower level of rates during the quarter, which drove higher refinancing activity and better margins. Mortgage originations were up 6%, and gain on sale revenue was up 25% from the fourth quarter.","Highlights from the quarter also included record fee income in our investment advisory business of $108 million, up 7% from the last quarter and 6% from the prior year. This business continues to show solid and consistent growth, as we expected to see from the talent development and relationship management strategies we planned for that business several years ago.","We also continued to generate strong deposit growth, with average core deposits up 2% sequentially and 7% year-over-year. Expenses were up 1% compared with last quarter and down 3% from the prior year. Current quarter expenses included seasonally higher FICA and unemployment costs but were otherwise well maintained.","Even as we continue to invest in our businesses and our infrastructure, we maintain our focus on our expenses. We've discussed our efforts to reduce our risk exposures. And during the quarter, we sold $568 million of residential mortgage TDRs from the pool we moved to held-for-sale last quarter. This transaction allowed us to take advantage of the market's appetite for these types of assets.","Virtually every credit metric improved this quarter. Our net charge-off ratio was 41 basis points, the lowest we've seen in eight years, and include commercial net charge-offs of just 29 basis points of loans.","Non-performing assets were down 27% from a year ago, and our NPA ratio ended the quarter at 76 basis points. We have put forth a great amount of effort to make progress on our credit results to showing up in significant, sustained improvement over the past several years.","I'm very pleased that the Federal Reserve did not object to our 2015 CCAR plan. Capital management has been a strong and consistent part of our story, and our 2015 CCAR plan demonstrates the strength of our capital levels and our ability to generate organic capital, giving us the capacity to support shareholder returns.","As we've discussed the past few quarters, we continue to work to reposition Fifth Third. We're maintaining our prudent approach to lending, with a focus on appropriate risk-adjusted returns. We've talked about the investments we are marking to strengthen our risk and compliance infrastructure, and we expect to ultimately benefit from them. We continue to make strategic decisions to achieve the right business mix, one which produces less volatile and more sustainable earnings growth. And ultimately, we are managing the company for the long term. And we're committed to maintaining our discipline, even in challenging environments.","With that, I'll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our first quarter operating results and our current outlook.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Kevin. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'll start with the financial summary on page three of the presentation. We reported net income to common shareholders of $367 million or $0.44 per diluted share. There were several items that affected earnings in the quarter, as Kevin mentioned. The largest was the Vantiv warrant valuation mark. That was a positive $70 million this quarter.","As you know, in the fourth quarter, we transferred approximately $720 million of residential mortgage TDRs to held-for-sale. In the first quarter of 2015, we sold the majority of those loans for a pre-tax gain of $37 million. A partial offset was the charge related to the Visa total return swap. That was $17 million. The net impact of these three items was a benefit of $0.07 per share.","With that, let's move to the average balance sheet and page four of the presentation. In the first quarter, average investment securities increased by $733 million or 3% sequentially, reflecting purchases of additional securities during the quarter. On an end-of-period basis, we added $4 billion of securities.","Shifting to loans, we continue to be prudent on pricing and terms. Competition continues to be fierce, as we have stated before, but our loan activity picked up, especially during the second half of the quarter. And our C&I balances were up 3% on an end-of-period basis. It is a good sign that we are seeing growth within our risk appetite and credit and return profile targets.","Our average portfolio balances decreased $533 million from the fourth quarter, driven by declines in residential mortgage, due to the transfer of TDRs to held-for-sale last quarter. This reduced average balances by approximately $694 million in the quarter. Commercial mortgage balances were down 3%, as we continued to see refinancing activity out of our legacy book, which offset growth in commercial construction. Competition from term investors, such as life insurance companies, continues to be difficult to match.","We saw very strong deposit growth throughout 2014 and, as we expected, that continued in the first quarter. Average core deposits increased $1.8 billion from the fourth quarter, driven by growth in interest checking, money market and demand deposit accounts.","Moving to NII on page five of the presentation. In line with our expectations and guidance in January, taxable equivalent net interest income decreased $36 million sequentially to $852 million, primarily driven by a $21 million negative impact of the previously announced changes to our deposit advance product that were effective January 1. NII was also impacted by $13 million due to fewer days in the first quarter.","The net interest margin was 286 basis points, down 10 basis points from the fourth quarter, with a seven basis point decline from the changes to our deposit advance products, three basis points of compression related to loan re-pricing and a two basis points decline related to our elevated cash balances. These were partially offset by a three basis point benefit from day count.","Shifting to fees on page six of the presentation. First quarter non-interest income was $660 million compared with $653 million in the fourth quarter. Results included the $70 million positive mark on the Vantiv warrant and the $17 million charge on the Visa total return swap that I mentioned earlier. These impacts were positive $56 million and negative $19 million respectively in the fourth quarter.","The first quarter also included a $37 million gain on the sale of TDRs. Excluding these items in both quarters, fee income of $570 million decreased $46 million or 7% sequentially, driven by the $23 million TRA payment that we recognized from Vantiv in the fourth quarter and a decrease in corporate banking results, partially offset by an increase in mortgage banking net revenue.","Corporate banking fees decreased $28 million sequentially and $12 million from last year. The sequential and year-over-year comparisons were affected by a decline in syndication fees of $21 million and $11 million respectively, driven by decreased activity in the market during the quarter.","Card and processing revenue decreased 6% compared to a seasonally strong fourth quarter and was up 5% from the first quarter of 2014, as we continue to benefit from greater card utilization and higher consumer purchase volume. Mortgage banking net revenue was up 40% sequentially due to higher gain on sale margins and an increase in originations to $1.8 billion compared with $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter. Gain on sale margins were up 48 basis points to 327 basis points.","Net servicing asset valuation adjustments, which include amortization and valuation adjustments, were negative $17 million this quarter versus negative $34 million last quarter. Deposit service charges declined 5% from the fourth quarter, reflecting first quarter seasonality, and increased 2% relative to the first quarter of 2014. The sequential decline was driven by a 9% decrease on the consumer side due to seasonally lower overdraft occurrences during the quarter. Total investment advisory revenue increased to a record high of $108 million, an increase of 7% sequentially, due to seasonally higher tax-related private client services revenue in the first quarter and strong securities and brokerage revenue.","We've been successful in growing assets under management, which were up 5% from 2014, and we continue to focus on shifting fee structures to an asset-based recurring model away from transactional pricing.","We show non-interest expense on page seven of the presentation. Expenses came in at $923 million this quarter compared with $918 million in the fourth quarter and included a seasonal increase in FICA and unemployment tax expense, recorded in employee benefits, partially offset by lower credit-related costs.","Turning to credit results on page eight. Total net charge-offs of $91 million or 41 basis points as a percentage of average loans decreased $100 million sequentially. Excluding the impact of the TDR-related charge-offs in the fourth quarter, net charge-offs were down $13 million or 13% sequentially, reflecting improvement in commercial loan charge-offs.","Non-performing assets excluding loans held for sale were $691 million at quarter end and down $53 million from the fourth quarter, bringing the NPL ratio to 57 basis points and NPA ratio to 76 basis points, its lowest level in seven years.","Commercial NPAs decreased $40 million sequentially, primarily due to a $30 million decline in C&I and a $9 million decline in commercial mortgage. Consumer NPAs decreased $13 million from the fourth quarter driven by a decline in residential mortgage NPAs.","As you recall, last quarter, we moved $720 million of residential mortgage TDRs to held-for-sale with the intent to sell in the first quarter. We successfully executed the sale, and that generated gains of about $37 million in the quarter. So all in, the net mark we took on the loans sold was 8%, and we feel very good about that result.","Relative to our energy portfolio, the quality of the firms we have relationships with remains very good. The portfolio is $1.8 billion and is down $200 million since the end of the fourth quarter. Our team, which includes a petroleum engineer, has been in the business for more than 20 years. So they've seen a cycle or two.","We continue to be comfortable with our portfolio, as the vast majority are investment-grade credits, with appropriate collateral, liquidity, cash flow and reserve coverage. We did see some potential weaknesses in the portfolio during the quarter, as you would expect in a declining oil price environment, and have downgraded credits where appropriate. And we would expect to remain proactive, given the current environment.","Wrapping up on credit. The allowance for loan and lease losses declined $22 million compared to a $28 million decline last quarter, excluding the impact of the TDR-related actions, driven by continued credit improvements. Provision as a percentage of net charge-offs increased to 76% from 73% last quarter, excluding the impact of TDR-related actions. Reserve coverage remained solid at 1.42% of loans and leases and 247% of NPLs. We are pleased with the level of our credit metrics as we continue into 2015.","Looking at capital on slide nine. Capital levels continue to be strong and well above regulatory requirements. The common equity Tier 1 ratio was 9.6%. Starting on January 1, we are now on a Basel III basis, and our capital ratios for the current quarter are subject to Basel III transition provisions.","At the end of the fourth quarter, the average diluted share count was down another 1% sequentially. During the quarter, we announced common stock repurchases of $180 million. That ASR settlement is expected to occur on or before April 23 and reduce the first quarter share count by 8.5 million shares.","Relative to CCAR, the Federal Reserve's 2015 review is complete, and we received a non-objection to our capital plan. We believe our results demonstrate the relative strength of both of our capital position and our internal capital generation capacity.","Turning to the outlook and a few comments on the second quarter. In our outlook, our goal is and has been to maintain a realistic perspective on the economy and the overall market conditions. I think you are seeing some of the items that we discussed in January call emerge in peer group calls this quarter.","Beginning with NII. There is no change to our full-year NII expectations, even though our current outlook includes no interest rate hike until the fourth quarter compared with two expected moves back in early January. We have and will continue to actively manage our balance sheet to adopt a changing macroeconomic and Fed policy expectations.","As a reminder, excluding the impact of the $100 million reduction in deposit advance-related decline, we expect our NII to grow year-over-year. For the second quarter, we expect NII to be higher than the first, based on average earning asset growth and day count. For NIM, we currently expect relative stability for the remainder of the year from first quarter levels. We do expect that NIM will be slightly lower during the second quarter than the first, due to continued loan re-pricing and the impact of day count.","We expect higher fee income in the second quarter from a seasonally low first quarter, driven by card and processing revenue, deposit fees and corporate banking fees. Mortgage banking revenue continues to be a function of the rate environment. We had a good first quarter and experienced the wider gain on sale margin, but we are not forecasting second quarter margins to remain at those levels.","When you also include the continued amortization of our servicing portfolio, due to our exit from the brokered origination channel, we currently expect mortgage banking net revenue to be below the first quarter but approximately in line with last year's second quarter.","Along those lines, our guidance on operating leverage for the year is not changing either. We will continue to invest in our businesses and infrastructure. Those investments will increase our employee expenses as well as our technology spend. Expenses will increase during the next two quarters, relative to the first quarter, but we will see more stability, maybe a slight drop towards the end of the year.","Again, the guidance we provided in January with respect to our efficiency ratio and revenue growth remains roughly intact. We expect our quarterly adjusted efficiency ratio to gradually decline over the next two quarters, with a more pronounced decline toward the end of the year.","Turning to credit. We still expect ALLL releases to be significantly below last year's levels, and loan growth will result in higher levels of provisioning. We are very encouraged by the overall good quality of new loans that we are putting on our balance sheet, so our fundamental credit performance should continue to improve.","We also would like to remind you that the revenue expectations that we shared with you today do not include potential but currently unforecasted items such as Vantiv warrant marks or gains on share sales.","With that, let's open the line for questions. Cheryl?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","Autonomous Research. On the net interest margin outlook, I wondered if you could give us a sense of, first, what that would like if we don't have any rate rises this year. And then second, you still, assuming we do have the rate rises, sticking to the five to seven basis points decline, excluding deposits advance, given that we had three basis points of decline in the first quarter?","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So I'll make a brief comment and then I'll turn it over to Jamie. As I said, at this point, we only have one rate increase assumption, which is at the end of the year in the fourth quarter. So relative to our January call, that is a change. In January, we had two raises, but now we're down to one and which is now at the end of the year. And in general, we expect our NIM to be stable from the first quarter levels, and I'll let Jamie go through the detail on that.","James C. Leonard - Treasurer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. And I think if you're more focused on near-term NIM guidance, as Tayfun said, stable NIM, but for day count and the continued impact of loan re-pricing in the second quarter driving it down a couple of basis points. And obviously, there'll be other moving parts that should largely offset one another. One would be our continued holding elevated cash levels, but those cash levels should be down in the second quarter below the first quarter levels on average basis.","And we continue to obviously do well growing our deposit book, and that's created some opportunity to continue to execute on liability management opportunities. And you saw some of that come through in the first quarter numbers with our core deposit cost down two basis points, and going forward that continues to be an opportunity for us. But as Tayfun said, net-net, down a little bit in the second quarter and stable in the back half of the year.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. And relative to your question on the impact of EAX, just realize that the first quarter NIM reset for that. So that's why going forward, you're not going to feel that impact for the rest of the year.","Geoffrey Elliott - Autonomous Research LLP","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Scott Siefers from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.","Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Good morning, guys.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","I was hoping you could speak in a bit more detail on the loan growth outlook. Obviously, this quarter's numbers were a little noisy, given the TDR move from last quarter. And then you had made the kind of more optimistic comments about February and March. So, one, if you can just provide some additional commentary on overall trends; and then, two, where you're seeing the most and least strength. I think, Tayfun, you had mentioned the commercial categories as looking good end of period. So just would be curious to hear your color there.","Kevin T. Kabat - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Scott. I'll start it and I'll throw it to Tayfun. We have been encouraged, particularly as the quarter went on in terms of the type of activity that we're seeing. It's broad based, mostly in our specialty areas, but we feel good about where we're seeing it as broadly as it was. That's why we're encouraged as we look out into the rest of the year. So fairly positive from our perspective. Tayfun, you want to add some color?","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. We ended the quarter at encouraging levels, and you know that I don't tend to be that encouraging if I don't see the numbers. But the activity is at a healthy level. We see it on a widespread basis. Mid-corp continues to be doing well. Our middle market is picking up, and we're seeing good activity in verticals, as Kevin mentioned. The one weakness that we are still seeing is in commercial mortgage, not construction.","Construction still is at healthy levels. Commercial mortgage is tough because we're seeing fairly stiff competition for assets. We're seeing loosening credit structure and very aggressive pricing environment. So along those lines, we're choosing not to necessarily participate there. But what's encouraging is that we are seeing the right type of clients with good support across the board from different revenue line items, so it's been a good quarter for us.","Scott Siefers - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Okay. That's sound great. I appreciate the color.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning, guys. First question is just in terms of the energy portfolio. Do you quantify or can you quantify the reserve build associated with that this quarter? And where do you stand in reassessing the borrowing base of your clients?","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We don't. We don't typically provide detailed guidance on reserves for specific portions. And in terms of general commentary about the energy portfolio, Frank?","Frank Forrest - Executive VP, Chief Risk & Credit Officer","Yeah. Ken, when you look at our diversified portfolio in the energy sector, upstream represents 50% of our energy-related exposure. Two-thirds of upstream commitments are under what I would determine as traditional secured reserve base structures. 70% went into value. We do have two borrowing base redeterminations annually. The balance of that upstream portfolio is predominantly investment grade. So we will and expect to see some stress on the loan to value of that book as prices stay down. But we still have adequate coverage today.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks. And then just another quick question. If you look at your overall loan growth, so ex out the move to held-for-sale, loan growth is a little bit weaker than peers, broadly speaking. Any reason why that might be the case?","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","When we look at peer and loan growth, we're actually seeing better-than-peer performance. So again, this is about momentum. This is about the trends that we are seeing in the quarter. As we discussed in January, we clearly entered the year at a weaker point, so January balances were impacted by that. So I wouldn't necessarily rely on average balance comparisons between Q4 and Q1 but look more into trends that are apparent when you look at end-of-period numbers.","Frank Forrest - Executive VP, Chief Risk & Credit Officer","One other comment I would make. I think we're being prudent in our hold positions. We are seeing some fairly aggressive hold positions by peers, which is one of the things I think you will see as far as end-to-end point on loan growth. But overall, as we've said, we are seeing very good flow. We are attracting I think very good clients. We're very focused on client selection, but we are also being prudent in how much we're willing to hold on any particular exposure to ensure that we're diversifying the risk in our portfolio.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And Ken, I just want to go back to the energy piece and make one comment, which I think frequently gets missed. Despite the fact that we've been in the energy business for two, three years, you have to realize that we brought in a complete team in 2012. And that team has been underwriting loans for 20 years and it's a compact team. So I just want to make sure that we reflect the relative experience of our team with respect to our energy business.","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. That helps. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Paul Miller from FBR Capital. Your line is open.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Thank you very much. On the mortgage banking side, can you talk a little bit about the mix between refis \u2013 I didn't see it \u2013 and purchase and how you're seeing the purchase market shaping up?","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's a bit early. It's still April. And we also want to be cautious in terms of the purchase market given our experience last year. In general, the market was expecting better activity going into the season, and then we did not see that overall as a sector. So we're a bit cautious in terms of projecting balances on the purchase side.","In general, we would expect an uptick, but we have to realize that the low rate environment is providing momentum to the refi activity. And that's what we saw in Q1. In April, we'll probably see some of that still happening on the refi side, which could sort of tilt the balance a little bit more in favor of refi. But going into May and June, we would expect the purchase activity to pick up a little bit. So I think, Paul, it's a bit early. We'll probably be able to give you a little bit better update in July when we sort of observe the activity. But right now, we're at about a 40% purchase volume as of...","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","40%. And then real quick, I know it's a small number but it's bucking the trend here a little bit. You wrote up your MSR. Can you add some color behind that?","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We can. I'll turn it over to Jamie with details. But you have to realize that we've done actually \u2013 if you go back two, three years, we've had very consistent performance on the MSR side because we truly manage our mortgage exposures in combination with what we're doing on the production side as well as what we're doing with the servicing side. Jamie?","James C. Leonard - Treasurer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. And the one maybe anomaly this quarter was we did take advantage of the opportunity, when we saw the sell-off in rates in mid-February that we took our hedge coverage ratio from the low 80% levels and then locked in those gains. And so we're hedged almost at 100% at the end of the quarter. And that really was where we captured some extra value during the quarter.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay. So it's mainly just some small hedging gains; not really writing up the MSR.","James C. Leonard - Treasurer & Senior Vice President","Right.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Correct.","Paul J. Miller - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Okay. Hey, guys, thank you very much.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Paul.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Kenneth Michael Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Ken.","Kenneth Michael Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Tayfun, I was wondering if you could just elaborate on your comments about the expense trajectory across the year. Can you walk through where you are in that compliance spending increase that you had alluded to last quarter? And then can you also help us understand why the trajectory would go up for the next few and then drop off in the fourth? Is there something happening underneath the surface that you're expecting?","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Ken, thanks for the question. The trajectory really has some seasonal factors, but let me answer the first part of your question. I think we are going to see throughout the year increases in our infrastructure investments in risk management and compliance. You're seeing very similar trends with our peer group banks. We're moving to this new methodology, and we're making sure that our infrastructure supports the new risk management and compliance structure. So you will see increases throughout the year.","With respect to the rest of the expense trends, I think there is some seasonality in our marketing expense that you will see in Q2 and Q3. Clearly, we are making sure that we support revenue growth, and marketing spend is part of that. Typically, toward the end of the year, that spend goes down. From Q1 to Q2, you will see some increase in incentive compensation to increase in line with higher levels of business activity. Some of it in Q2 is related to higher, long-term incentive expense, which really is related to retirement-eligible employees. And we are still reducing head count in some areas. But again, redeployment of that head count into risk management infrastructure, we'll probably see higher head count going into second, third and fourth quarters.","And technology investments are also going up. As we have said, regardless of the environment, we will continue to invest in our businesses. That's across the board. That's in our retail business, that's in our commercial business and that line item will see increases. But in general, we do believe that we are still maintaining focus on managing expenses in other areas. And ultimately, we will get to a level where some of these new processes and tasks will be replaced with technology. When we get to that level, you will see better efficiencies, even from sort of the existing risk management and compliance infrastructure.","Kenneth Michael Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Great. And then to wrap that into your operating leverage comment, then, can you just remind us again your determination to deliver positive operating leverage on the full year? That's a year-over-year basis. And can you just remind us, is it against like the all the adjusted results like on page 11 of the supplement? How should we just be making sure that we're looking like-on-like?","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Just one correction. Despite the fact that I think Q1 will be the high water mark for the efficiency ratio, I do want to remind you that our guidance is actually not \u2013 we're not guiding to a positive operating leverage. We said in January and we reiterated again today that we would expect revenues to increase. But given the $100 million decrease in EAX, our deposit advance-related revenues, we will see negative operating leverage this year. So I just wanted to...","Kenneth Michael Usdin - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Right. No change to that then. Okay. Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Erika Najarian, Bank of America. Your line is open.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Erika.","Erika Penala Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. I just wanted to ask a clarification on the NII outlook. You mentioned that you took out one rate increase but didn't change your NII guidance from January. And I'm wondering if that was made up for in terms of a more robust outlook for loan growth for the balance of the year? Or is it coming from balance sheet growth from continued strong deposit inflows?","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's a combination of all. And I think what we try to do is when we manage our NII, we try to manage it depending upon the market conditions that are current and that we expect to happen. And with that, we will make tactical changes in the way we manage our balance sheet. Jamie?","James C. Leonard - Treasurer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Yeah. Just to reiterate what Tayfun said, I think it's both. It's the earning asset side, you saw the investment portfolio growth in the quarter. We're pretty opportunistic, able to pull forward some of our anticipated growth there. And so the portfolio's 19% of our total assets, so on average or a little bit underweighted to peers. But again, we are opportunistic. And then the strong deposit growth with household acquisition, new customer acquisition, really has given us some flexibility to go after the deposit pricing. And you're starting to see that show up in the numbers. So I think we've been responsive to the environment, and we're pretty pleased with the results.","Erika Penala Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. And my second question is on corporate banking. I appreciate the seasonality in the first quarter and the guidance for higher level in second quarter. But the first quarter number was down 11% year-over-year. And I'm wondering how we should think about the full-year progression in corporate banking and sort of the factors that are underlying that progression versus what you saw in 2014.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think our full-year expectations in corporate banking, we're still looking to growing corporate banking fee revenues. Clearly, first quarter was challenging because from a loan syndication perspective, the level of activity was significantly below what we expected. Now having said that, we're not necessarily saying that we're going to go back to the level of activity that we experienced last year. We are expecting some pickup, and you should see some revenue pickup there related to an uptick from Q1 levels.","And we are growing in other areas. We clearly have a very healthy derivative business in foreign exchange and interest rates, and we're seeing some activity there. And I think in interest rates, for example, I think we hit the low levels and I think last year. This year, we should perform better in business lending fees. We should see an uptick there this year. That will support growth year-over-year. So in general, despite weakness in the syndication activity, other lines should pick up the flag and we should see growth on a year-over-year basis.","Erika Penala Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell, Wells Fargo Security (sic) [Securities]. Your line is open.","Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Jamie, maybe a question for you. You mentioned the pull forward of some of your securities activity that you're planning on for all of 2015 into the first quarter. Also noted that the duration of the securities portfolio was down to about 4.3 years from five years at the end of last year. Can you give us a little bit of color as to sort of where you stand in terms of what you've got to do for the remainder of the year in terms of the securities portfolio and what growth you anticipate from here in the portfolio?","James C. Leonard - Treasurer & Senior Vice President","Sure. And, yes, the 4.3 years, also, yield was up in the first quarter. And so we're pretty pleased with the outcomes there. We do expect the yield to be down a little bit in the second quarter due to day count as the rest of the purchases, the full quarter impact there. But what we're seeing on the investment opportunity side really is dictated to a large extent by the LCR. So finishing the first quarter at 108% on the LCR with about $2.5 billion or so of excess cash to where our targeted cash levels are really means that as we look ahead and how much cash we need to deploy and still stay above 100% LCR, which is our goal, 10% above the 90% regulatory minimums means that we'll need to put $1 billion to $2 billion to work to maintain an LCR above those levels. So that's how we're thinking of the rest of the year is really use the portfolio to ensure that LCR's above 100% and then just attack opportunities as they're presented by the market.","Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks, Jamie. And Kevin, maybe a question for you. I appreciate this is a sensitive topic, but I'm just curious if you have any comments about the potential for the SIFI designation to get lifted from $50 billion. Seems that raising that to $100 billion wouldn't necessarily be a material benefit for you. But if it's raised materially above that, what are the benefits to Fifth Third from such change?","Kevin T. Kabat - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Matt. What I would say is that I think a lot of dialogue is going on today, and I think there's a lot of folks really kind of reflecting on some of the rules and what gets used as kind of the metric for evaluating. If you use strictly a straight-line asset number, yeah, then some people will fall above and some people will fall below. If you use that in combination with some of the things that have been talked about relative to complexity in the industry, it potentially changes the field quite substantially. How that will come out, I can't predict and I wouldn't even know how to handicap that from our perspective.","Clearly, though, if the line moves, I mean I think the two most obvious impacts to us would be some of the work necessarily involved in the CCAR process could potentially change. Not that we would walk away from the benefits of the tools that we now incorporate into our capital planning process, but we could see some expense savings there in terms of being more productive and less voluminous in terms of our justifications for our CCAR levels.","And then the second area would be in the living will kind of area. Those would be the two most obvious impacts to folks that fall above or below that line. Changing that again changes the amount of work, the amount of time and the amount of effort that we as an organization would have to put into that. So I think that kind of frames for you what's at stake here.","Matthew Hart Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for the color.","Kevin T. Kabat - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. And just a quick reminder. Please limit your questions to one primary question and one follow-up question. Our next questioner is from the line of Bill Carcache, Nomura Securities. Your line is open.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning. Could you talk about how we should be thinking about the timing and magnitude of Vantiv share sales throughout the rest of 2015, particularly given the nice rally that the stock has had and the fact that it's now near all-time highs post-IPO? And I guess in general, is it reasonable to expect that those share sales could be completed by the end of this year, or are they more likely to extend into next year?","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We typically don't give guidance in terms of the timing and the size of our disposition. But in general, we have stated before that we will not be a long-term owner of the company. We are very pleased with the company's operations and the value that we were able to build and achieve. And our goal is to make the optimal decision for our shareholders. And we had one sale last year and we'll see how this year goes. But we are monitoring, clearly, all of the same metrics that you are there.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. In the past, you guys have talked about some of the initiatives that had been in place to replace what would eventually be that last Vantiv income stream. Maybe could you give us an update on those initiatives? And then perhaps also speak to the possibility of hanging onto Vantiv a bit longer, given the nice, I guess, equity method income contribution that you get from that business, the potential to which there might be some incentive in hanging on to it, perhaps a bit longer.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. Ultimately, I think if we were to liquidate our shares and convert it to share buybacks, that's an accretive outcome. So with respect to the revenue piece, and so economically, our shareholders will be compensated for a potential exit from the company, regardless of the decrease in the revenues.","Now as you know and as we have discussed with you, we have combined our payments businesses, the consumer and commercial side under one roof. And we are making investments and introducing new products to the market to be able to support revenue lines that we get from our commercial and consumer clients. And in general, our goal is clearly, just if you only focus on the revenue line to continually grow other fee-generating businesses and grow the sort of earnings per share contribution there. So there are clearly different sensitivities that we are mindful of and we are looking at as we build our strategic decisions around Vantiv.","Kevin T. Kabat - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And the only thing I would add, Bill, is, you've heard us talk about the development and the organization around our payments and commerce space. We're quite pleased with the continued progress and focus there. We think that's a good long-term strategy for us as we're building products and orientations around selling into value in a space that we have some real significant expertise. So again, we're encouraged. We think we're on the right track from that standpoint. And over the long-term will benefit shareholders, so...","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys. That's very helpful.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning.","Kevin T. Kabat - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Matt.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Can you guys talk about how you're feeling on the indirect auto lending business? I know you had pulled back a little bit as things had gotten very competitive and the balances are kind of flat to down. Any change in the competitive landscape there or how you're thinking about it?","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Not really. I think our views have been fairly stable in that business over the last two, three years. We're still very mindful about returns. We're focusing on maintaining the credit profile that is commensurate with the returns. Jamie, any commentary about what you're seeing?","James C. Leonard - Treasurer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. The yield, Matt, in the first quarter on new production continued pretty much on pace with what we saw in the fourth quarter at a 304. The FICAs were again 750, a little better. The credit profile continues to be great. It's 52% used, 48% new for the quarter, 69-month average term with obviously durations much shorter than that. And the LTVs, 90%, 91%. So it's...","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Stability is the name of the game there, and we clearly are very focused on what the market is doing. But in general, there is really no change in the way we approach that business.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","And where do you think you differ the most versus the overall industry? I mean obviously, the industry is growing. Some peers are growing outsize, but which, whether it's the yield or the term or FICO, like where do you think you differ versus the overall market?","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I think it's a combination of all. Our advance rates tend to be lower compared to what we're seeing from others. We are not competing on the seven-year products. The term is an important piece for us. And clearly the \u2013 just FICO scores in general, we are not moving down the credit profile. And some of our competitors have subprime businesses and we don't. So they're experiencing better growth in those segments, which fits their credit appetite and it doesn't ours.","Matthew Derek O'Connor - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo, CLSA. Your line is open.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Mike.","Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi. Two short follow-up questions and my main question. What is the carrying value of Vantiv versus the market value?","James C. Leonard - Treasurer & Senior Vice President","We don't disclose the carrying value yet, Mike, because they haven't released their earnings yet. But you're in that unrealized gain position between $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We own 22.8% of the company, and we carry that at about a $400 million number right now. So that's what our numbers show. And then you have obviously the warrants, which are mark to market, and then you have the TRA that is not showing up on our books.","Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Is the full drop from the deposit advance product in the first quarter? I guess it hurt $21 million this quarter, and you said it will eventually hurt by $25 million. So do we have $4 million more to go per quarter?","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. I think the commentary that we made last January was relative to the full year in 2014. And as we have not expanded the marketing of that product to new clients, the usage on a quarter-to-quarter comparison will continue to drop and, therefore, will be coming off of that $25 million number. So for now, the $21 million number is fully baked in.","Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","Right. No, I just mean, in other words, the fourth quarter to first quarter drop, it was $21 million.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Correct.","Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","So we shouldn't expect any more big quarter-to-quarter drops?","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You should not.","Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","It's done. And that's why you feel better about efficiency getting better this year. It's is one of the factors?","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's correct. Yeah.","Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. And now my...","Kevin T. Kabat - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","If you think about it, Mike, from the time that we talked about it last year when you're not selling the product and you're not opening new accounts, you do have account closings during the course of the year. And that probably accounts for most of the attrition and the difference of those two numbers.","Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. And now my main question for Kevin. I guess the question is, will the real Kevin Kabat please stand up? I mean I'm looking at your CEO letter here, and it seems pretty cautious. You're talking about competition, technology, regulation, the new age in banking and all these headwinds. And you started off today's call talking about record fees and investment advisory accelerating commercial loan growth, deposit growth. And so I can't tell if you're cautious or optimistic between the CEO letter and the way you started off today's call. What message are you trying to convey?","Kevin T. Kabat - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The way that I would kind of put that, Mike, just so that you had a perspective is, look, a lot of what you talked about in terms of the annual letter is a description of the environment that we're in. And the fact of the matter is that the environment's challenging for banks for a lot of those reasons that I talked about. That notwithstanding, there are things that we've been able to continue to do strategically, competitively that continues to differentiate Fifth Third going forward. So if you're getting confused of the way that we attack in an environment that's challenging, that would be the clarity I would try to draw you to.","Mike L. Mayo - CLSA Americas LLC","All right. Thanks for that color.","Kevin T. Kabat - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari, Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC","Good morning.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC","Just back to loan growth, I wanted to ask a little bit about outlook. I appreciate the color you gave around the C&I trends and also what you're seeing on commercial real estate being somewhat sluggish. In terms of your overall outlook for loan growth, is it likely here that it stays in the 4% range of kind of where it's been or where it is now? Or could we see strengthening in that growth rate as we move through 2015 consistent with your recent bullishness?","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think what we said in January was that you should expect the banking sector to grow at GDP plus. We clearly have some investments in our retail businesses and in other areas that should help us to get over that GDP number. And our bullishness is based on the trends that we are seeing. Those trends, if they continue, we should see outstripping that 3% number for the year. And we will update you as we go along. But for now, we are seeing good activity, and we are optimistic that, that will continue.","John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. And then separately, on the expense side, just wanted to get your thoughts on the efficiency ratio from a long-term perspective with and without higher rates. Again, thanks for the color you gave on the near-term likelihood around operating leverage or not. But just how do you think about the trend and the efficiency ratio not just through 2015 but into 2016 with or without rates?","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think clearly, this year, the interruption in our success in driving our efficiency ratio down was interrupted because of EAX change. And that $100 million is a big number to overcome. And you will see throughout 2015 growth in revenues, which is going to help to drive down the efficiency ratio. Our longer-term outlook is, the sort of mid-50s type of target was always based on a more normalized rate environment. And some of the statistics that we publish with respect to where our rate sensitivity is would support that outlook. But regardless, I think we will be able to grow our revenues to gain efficiencies. And that clearly does not even include the expense management focus that we have in place.","As I said, our risk management and compliance expenses are going up this year. But eventually \u2013 and it always happens \u2013 that we take a look at the processes and find technology solutions to achieve the same results. And all those combined should support further improvement in our efficiency ratio. And if the rate environment helps us a little bit more, we can achieve that faster.","John Pancari - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sameer Gokhale, Janney Montgomery Scott. (sic) [Scott]. Your line is open.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Sameer.","Sameer Shripad Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Just a few questions. I wanted to follow up on the question about deposit advance, the product and your guidance. And specifically, what I wanted to ask you was whether your outlook incorporates like a recent proposal from the CFPB, which seems to have some more onerous requirements for these type of short-term product. And also wanted to get a sense for whether this somehow affects any alternative products you might be offering to that customer base. And again, whether you've baked that all into your guidance because it sounds like you have. You don't really expect much of an incremental impact beyond the Q1 impact, but I just want to clarify that?","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean we've seen, obviously, the same language that you've seen from the regulators, and we are evaluating currently our product offering accordingly. We're not making an adjustment in terms of our outlook and our expectations. We will be further analyzing the guidance, further analyzing our business and the interests of our clients. And if there is a change in that, we will update you. But for now, I don't have really any updates on that for you.","Sameer Shripad Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay. And then the other question I had was in terms of your commercial loans and commercial loan growth, I think you gave some commentary saying that the growth was somewhat broad based, at least that's what we're hearing from other banks as well. The question I had was, it looks like your utilization rates were flat sequentially. And I was curious what happened to loan commitments, if those increased or stayed flat. And I'm trying to just again kind of think about that in the context of broad-based loan growth and like maybe a pickup in commercial loans because certainly, it doesn't seem like utilization rates have increased. That would be perhaps more of an indication that there is broad-based demand. So how should we think about that?","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Utilization rates have stayed flat quarter-over-quarter, and they have been flat since the middle of next year. I think there was one uptick last year from Q1 to Q2, maybe. Our commitments are up a little bit. And it's difficult to necessarily interpret the demand side of this because clearly, there are some sectors that are benefiting. And I think we're going to see, for example, the healthcare side will remain healthy. Our verticals on retail, for example, I think the consumer expenditure side with the expectation of the gas price decrease should look healthier for the remainder of the year. And one challenging part is clearly the export sector, but we will just have to see what the global macro environment does for that. So in general, there is no underlying expectation of an increase in utilization rates in our outlook.","Sameer Shripad Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay. And then just, my last question was I think you have decided to exclude AOCI from your common equity Tier 1 capital ratio. I mean that's something we were expecting most banks to do anyway because it seems like that would limit volatility in that ratio. But aside from the effect of volatility, is there any other reason we should think of as far as your decision to exclude AOCI, or is it really just to limit the volatility potentially there?","James C. Leonard - Treasurer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. It's simply to limit the volatility in managing your capital base.","Sameer Shripad Gokhale - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC","Okay. Okay. That's all I had. Thank you.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Sameer.","James C. Leonard - Treasurer & Senior Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of David Eads, UBS. Your line is open.","David Eads - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the call. Just kind of following up on C&I loan outlook. I think a couple quarters when you guys had a little bit slower growth there, you pointed to basically originations being healthy but a little bit of a pickup in paydowns. And I'm curious what kind of dynamic you're seeing there, whether it's an increase in origination or kind of a slowing in paydown activity.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Oh, I mean I think paydowns are slowing down. We've seen the high water mark last year. Well, it's too early to say what happens the rest of this year. But so far, early in the year here, we've seen a drop in paydown activity.","David Eads - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then just kind of going to the strong investment advisory revenues, I know you guys talked about a little bit of a seasonal uptick there. When I look at recent years, there really hasn't been that much of a 2Q decline there. So I mean, I guess was there anything uniquely seasonal this year, or should we kind of think of this as a pretty good run rate going forward?","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I mean I think last year, we were flat. Some of it clearly has to do with where the market is, and we'll see what happens in Q2. But in general, it's probably better to do year-over-year growth comparisons. And for this year, we expect to grow our revenue line there. Quarter-to-quarter, we're a little bit hostage to what happens to the market. But we're seeing good asset inflows, which will support growth for the year.","David Eads - UBS Securities LLC","Sure. That's great. Well thanks so much.","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Kevin T.

My name is Polly, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Fifth Third Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Mr. Richardson, sir, you may begin your conference.","Jeff Richardson","Good morning. Today we'll be talking with you about our third quarter 2012 results. This call may contain certain forward-looking statements about Fifth Third pertaining to our financial condition, results of operations, plans and objectives. These statements involve certain risks and uncertainties.","There are a number of factors that could cause results to differ materially from historical performance in these statements. We've identified some of these factors in our forward-looking cautionary statement at the end of our earnings release and in other materials, and we encourage you to review them. Fifth Third undertakes no obligation and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call.","I'm joined on the call by several people: Kevin Kabat, our CEO; Chief Financial Officer, Dan Poston; Chief Credit Officer, Bruce Lee; Treasurer, Tayfun Tuzun; and Jim Eglseder of Investor Relations.  [Operator Instructions]","With that, I'll turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin?","Kevin T. Kabat","Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. This morning, Fifth Third reported net income to common shareholders of $354 million and earnings per diluted share of $0.38. Results included charges related to the redemption of trust preferred securities as expected, which reduced EPS by $0.02. Results also included a negative valuation adjustment on our Vantiv warrant and a gain on sale of mutual funds, which generally offset one another. Third quarter return on assets was 1.23%, and return on tangible common equity was 13%.","Core trends in our operations remained favorable as evidenced by continued loan growth in most categories and revenue strength, particularly in commercial banking, which was up 16% over last year, and mortgage banking, which was up 13% over a very strong quarter a year ago. These businesses continue to produce and have been important contributors during a difficult operating environment. Overall fee results were very good in the quarter, and the fourth quarter looks to be better.","Average portfolio loans were up 5% from a year ago, driven by a 16% increase in residential mortgage loan and a 15% increase in C&I loans. Sequential loan growth was a bit lighter than the last several quarters, which reflected higher paydowns, as borrowers became more cautious and the ability to refinance in the capital markets remained strong. Based on our pipelines and seasonally strong production in the fourth quarter, we expect loan growth to be a bit stronger in the fourth quarter as we close in on year end and the election moves behind us.","Net interest income was up $8 million from last quarter, excluding the benefit of several items that Dan will discuss in a moment. NII was consistent with last quarter. Obviously, the interest rate environment is extremely challenging, made more so by the impact of QE3 last month. The lower rate environment will negatively impact NIM trends going forward, at least until rates move back up. This is obviously the opposite of the rate environment a bank wants to see, although the impact on NII and NIM should be manageable for us.","We continue to exercise discipline on the expense front. Reported expenses were elevated this quarter and included the impact of the TruPS redemption charges and the increase to mortgage repurchase reserves. Expenses in the mortgage business are higher than normal. That's largely due to exceptional levels of production, so we'll take that.","Overall, PPNR was $568 million or $617 million when adjusted for items described on the second page of our release. We're looking for similar PPNR results to that adjusted level or perhaps a little better in the fourth quarter as well.","Credit trends improved again with quarterly charge-offs of $156 million. That was down 14% sequentially and 40% from a year ago. The net charge-off ratio was 75 basis points, down 13 basis points from last quarter and the lowest we've reported since 2007.","Capital levels also continued to be very strong with the Tier 1 common ratio of 9.7% and a tangible common equity ratio of 9.5%. In August, after approval of our capital plan, we initiated share buybacks with a repurchase agreement for $350 million of common stock. Most of the impact of that transaction is in our third quarter capital ratios while 1\/3 of the impact is reflected in our average share count.","Our capital plan included a possibility of an additional $250 million in common repurchases through the end of March 2013. We also increased the common dividend to $0.10 per share in September. Fifth Third's ability to generate capital and our strong capital levels under Basel I or Basel III give us the ability to retain the capital we need to support balance sheet growth while continuing to return capital to shareholders in a prudent manner.","Dan will discuss our outlook in more detail, but we expect to be able to produce similarly strong results in the fourth quarter. The environment remains challenging from a growth perspective, but we continue to demonstrate the ability to generate a relatively high level of profitability from solid revenue results, continued expense discipline and continued credit improvement.","At this point, let me turn it over to Dan. Dan?","Daniel T. Poston","Thanks, Kevin. I'll start with Slide 4 of the presentation. For the quarter, we reported net income of $363 million and recorded preferred dividends of $9 million. Net income to common was $354 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.38.","Third quarter results were reduced by $26 million of costs that are associated with our TruPS redemption or about $0.02 per share after tax and $16 million in losses on Vantiv warrants or $0.01 per share after tax. Those detriments totaled $42 million or $0.03 per share and were partially offset by $11 million of net benefit from the sale of certain Fifth Third mutual funds or $0.01 per share after tax.","Quarterly results also included an additional $24 million of pretax charges related to the increase in our mortgage repurchase reserve. I'll touch on each of these items later in my discussion.","Taking a look at the details of the quarter and turning to Slide 5. Tax equivalent net interest income increased $8 million sequentially to $907 million, and the net interest margin remained stable at 3.56%. Net interest income benefited from several items, including hedging effectiveness from the redeemed TruPS and income related to an auto securitization cleanup call. These items in total contributed $10 million to NII during the quarter and 4 basis points to the net interest margin. Otherwise, net interest income declined about $3 million versus the second quarter results and the margin declined 4 basis points, both about what we expected for the quarter.","As expected, net interest income benefited by $6 million due to an additional day in the quarter, as well as from lower interest expense due to the redemption of $1.4 billion of Trust Preferred Securities that occurred in August. The TruPS redemption increased third quarter NII by about $4 million.","These benefits, coupled with loan growth and lower deposit costs, were offset by yield compression in the loan and securities portfolios, as well as lower purchase accounting accretion. The 4 basis point core decline in margin reflected 2 basis points in benefit from the August TruPS redemption offset by lower loan and securities yields, lower purchase accounting accretion and the negative effect of day count.","From a balance sheet perspective, investment securities yields declined 7 basis points due to portfolio repricing of higher-yielding investments. The impact of QE3 increased prepayment speeds, and we'll see a full quarter effect of that in the fourth quarter.","On the loan side, we continue to have slow compression in yields primarily driven by loan repricing, particularly in C&I and auto portfolios. On the C&I side, portfolio average yield was down 5 basis points compared with last quarter, which is due to repricing and mix shift toward higher quality loans, as well as some pressure on new origination yields. In the indirect auto portfolio, average yield also continued to decline, largely reflecting the portfolio effect of replacing older higher-yielding loans with new lower-yielding ones.","Looking forward, we expect NII in the fourth quarter to be in the $890 million range. Those results will reflect an additional $4 million of benefit from the full quarter effect of the TruPS redemption. Otherwise, we expect NII to be reduced by about $10 million due to the higher prepayment speeds, reflecting the full quarter effect of QE3, as well as lower LIBOR rates and portfolio repricing, partially offset by loan growth.","In terms of the margin, we currently expect NIM to decline about 10 basis points in the fourth quarter. This reflects 6 basis points of core NIM contraction, given the fact that we had 4 basis points of benefit that I described earlier in the third quarter. We also have a full quarter effect of QE3 on prepayment rates and the repricing in the securities loan portfolios. We'll also continue to look for opportunities to mitigate the effects of this, including liability management.","Turning to the balance sheet in Slide 6. Average earning assets declined $259 million sequentially, driven by a $580 million decrease in securities balances, partially offset by an increase in the average portfolio loans. The decline in securities reflected our pre-investment in the second quarter of anticipated third quarter portfolio cash flows. Looking forward, we'd expect average securities to remain fairly stable in light of the current rate environment.","Average portfolio loans and leases increased $302 million sequentially, driven by higher C&I and residential mortgage balances and partially offset by declines in commercial real estate and home equity balances. Looking at each portfolio, average commercial loans held for investment were flat compared to the prior quarter and increased $3 billion or 7% on a year-over-year basis.","C&I loans increased to $33.1 billion, up 1% from last quarter and 15% from a year ago. C&I production has been broad based across industries and sectors with particular strength in the manufacturing and healthcare sectors. We've seen large corporate borrowers continue to refinance into the capital markets, which has impacted growth in that portfolio. Growth moderated somewhat in the third quarter, but we expect solid C&I growth in the fourth quarter given our current pipelines.","Commercial line utilization remained at 32% this quarter. Commercial mortgage and commercial construction balances declined in the aggregate by $374 million sequentially or 4%. While our originations continue to increase modestly in this area, we're also seeing increased payoffs driven by market activity. We expect to see similar levels of run-off in the fourth quarter.","Average consumer loans in the portfolio increased $287 million sequentially and $1.2 billion compared with a year ago. Residential mortgage loans held for investment were up 3% sequentially. This sequential growth reflected strong originations during the quarter due to the rate environment and continued retention of jumbo loans and shorter-term, higher-quality residential mortgages that we originate through our retail branch system.","Average auto loan balances were flat compared to the second quarter, but we still like the business in this asset class. We continue to see competition in this space, and we're very focused on managing volume and pricing. We currently expect modest auto loan growth in the fourth quarter.","Home equity loan balances were down 1% sequentially, and average credit card balances were up 3% sequentially. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect loan growth to be driven by solid growth in C&I, auto loan growth, as well as the mortgage portfolio, with that growth somewhat mitigated by the impact of the run-off in the commercial real estate and the home equity portfolios.","Moving on to deposits. We continue to manage our deposit book by focusing on higher-value transaction deposits while managing non-relationship deposit accounts down. In total, average core deposits decreased $258 million from the second quarter. Average transaction deposits, which exclude consumer CDs, decreased $123 million sequentially but were up 7% or $5.3 billion from a year ago. The sequential decrease in transaction deposits was driven by declines in consumer savings and commercial interest checking balances as a result of lower public funds balances. Demand deposits increased $776 million or 3% sequentially. Consumer CDs declined $135 million in the quarter, driven by our continued disciplined approach to CD pricing. For the fourth quarter, we currently expect transaction deposits to be up modestly compared to the third quarter and for consumer CD balances to continue to decline.","Now let's turn to fees, which are outlined on Slide 7. Third quarter noninterest income was $671 million, a decrease of $7 million from last quarter. Now there were a few unusual items that impacted each quarter. Third quarter results included $16 million in negative valuation adjustments on the Vantiv warrant and $13 million in gains on the sale of mutual funds, which closed in September. And you'll recall that the prior-quarter results included $56 million in positive valuation adjustments on the Vantiv warrant, which was partially offset by $17 million in negative valuation adjustments on property held-for-sale and $11 million in charges related to the Visa total return swap. If you exclude those items from both quarters, fee income of $674 million was up $24 million from the second quarter, driven primarily by strong mortgage banking results.","Looking at each line item in detail. Deposit service charges decreased 2% sequentially and 5% from the prior year. The decline was driven by consumer deposit fees, which were down 9% sequentially and 19% year-over-year, and included the full quarter effect of our elimination of daily overdraft fees on continuing customer overdraft positions. Commercial deposit fees increased 3% sequentially and 6% over the prior year, due to account growth and increased treasury management sales. For the fourth quarter, we expect to see mid-single-digit increases in deposit fees, driven by higher account fees and positive seasonality. We think that the third quarter represented the low point, and we will be able to grow deposit fees from there.","Investment advisory revenue decreased 2% from last quarter and was flat compared to the prior year, largely due to lower mutual fund fee revenue resulting from the sale of mutual funds that closed in September. Otherwise, revenues reflected overall market valuation trends and improvement in the equity and bond markets. We currently expect IA revenue to increase modestly in the fourth quarter.","Corporate banking revenue of $101 million decreased slightly from very strong second quarter levels and increased 16% from last year. The sequential decline was driven by seasonality and lower foreign exchange. The year-over-year increase was largely due to higher syndication fees, higher lease remarketing fees and higher institutional sales revenue. We expect fourth quarter corporate banking revenue to be relatively consistent with the strong third quarter levels or perhaps up modestly.","Card and processing revenue was $65 million, up $1 million from the second quarter but down $13 million from a year ago. That year-over-year decline was driven by the impact of debit interchange legislation but was partially offset by increased transaction volumes, as well as mitigation activity in that line item. The sequential increase reflects higher transaction volumes and levels of consumer spending. We currently expect transaction volumes to drive mid-single-digit growth in the card and processing revenue line for the fourth quarter.","Mortgage banking net revenue of $200 million increased 9% from strong second quarter levels and increased 13% from a year ago. Originations were $5.8 billion this quarter versus $5.9 billion in the second quarter. Gain on sale margins were wider in the third quarter, reflecting wider secondary market spreads and a higher proportion of retail channel and HARP originations. As a result, gains on deliveries were a record $226 million, up $43 million from the prior quarter. MSR valuation adjustments, including the impact of hedges, were negative $40 million this quarter versus a negative $22 million in the second quarter. Currently, we expect mortgage banking revenue to be up $30 million to $35 million in the fourth quarter, due to lower MSR valuation adjustments, higher volumes and relatively stable margins.","Turning next to other income within fees. Other income was $78 million this quarter versus $103 million last quarter. Third quarter results included the $16 million Vantiv warrant loss and the $13 million in gains on the sale of mutual funds. Second quarter results included $56 million in Vantiv warrant gains, the $17 million negative valuation adjustment on bank premises held-for-sale and the $11 million negative valuation adjustment on the Visa total return swap. If you exclude those items, other income was $81 million, which was up about $6 million from the second quarter.","Credit costs recorded in other noninterest income were $14 million in the third quarter compared with $17 million last quarter and $25 million a year ago. We expect fourth quarter credit costs and revenue to be in a similar range to the past couple quarters.","Looking at overall fee income expectations for the fourth quarter. We expect growth across most fee categories with fee income up about $40 million from the $671 million we reported this quarter, and that assumes no change in the value of the Vantiv warrant.","Turning to expenses now on Slide 8. Noninterest expense of $1.0 billion increased $69 million sequentially or 7%. Current quarter expenses included $26 million in costs associated with the TruPS redemption in August, $22 million in additional expense resulting from the increase in mortgage repurchase reserves and $2 million of costs related to the sale of mutual funds and $5 million benefit from the sale of affordable housing investments. In total, these increased third quarter expenses by $45 million. Expenses in the prior quarter included a $9 million reduction to the FDIC insurance expense and an $8 million benefit from the sale of affordable housing investments. Excluding these items from both quarters, noninterest expense of $961 million was up about $7 million from the prior quarter. If you'll recall, the expenses over the past 2 quarters also reflect elevated levels of marketing costs associated with our new branding campaign, which should return to more normalized levels in the fourth quarter.","Credit-related costs within operating expense were $59 million, up $19 million from last quarter and driven by the increase in mortgage repurchase reserves. The mortgage repurchase expense was $36 million this quarter compared with $18 million last quarter and included $22 million related to the increase in the reserve. Realized losses were $15 million this quarter versus $16 million last quarter and $31 million last year.","As we indicated last quarter, Freddie Mac informed us that they were planning to request files, beginning in the fourth quarter and on an ongoing basis, for any loan that was nonperforming. During this quarter, we received more detailed information from Freddie Mac, as well as the FHFA, regarding the selection criteria and the timeframes covered. And as a result, we are now in a position to better estimate the probable losses on loans to Freddie Mac. We don't currently have the same type of information from Fannie Mae, however. Fannie Mae represents approximately 20% of our servicing portfolio and about 30% of the loans sold to GSEs over the past 6 years.","In terms of the fourth quarter, we currently expect mortgage repurchase expense of $10 million to $15 million and total credit-related costs recognized in expense to be about $40 million.","Overall, for the fourth quarter, we currently expect total noninterest expenses to be down about $30 million from this quarter's elevated level. We expect that to be driven by a decline in mortgage repurchase expense and the absence of TruPS redemption charges that we had this quarter. In the fourth quarter, we expect to recognize about $7 million in seasonal pension curtailment expenses, which previously we had expected to occur in the third quarter, as well as an offset to that from lower remarketing costs of about the same amount. Otherwise, we expect modest growth in expenses, primarily driven by higher mortgage fulfillment costs.","The efficiency ratio was 64% in the third quarter and would have been 61%, excluding the items noted on the next slide, compared with 62% on the same basis in the second quarter. We expect fourth quarter to be similar to that 61% level that we reported here for the third.","Moving on to Slide 9 and PPNR. Pre-provision net revenue was $568 million in the third quarter compared with $636 million in the second quarter. Excluding the items noted on this slide, PPNR in the third quarter was $617 million, up about 5% from the results in the second quarter when you adjust those similarly. We expect fourth quarter PPNR to be consistent with that core third quarter result or perhaps a little better.","The effective tax rate for the quarter was 27.7% compared with 31.8% last quarter. You'll recall that the prior quarter tax rate was elevated due to tax expense associated with the expiration of employee stock options. We currently expect the fourth quarter effective tax rate to be about 28.5%.","Turning to capital, which is reflected on Slide 10. Capital levels continue to be very strong, including the initiation of common share repurchases and the redemption of TruPS this quarter. The Tier 1 common ratio was 9.7%, a decrease of about 10 basis points from last quarter. Tier 1 capital was 10.9% compared with 12.3% last quarter, and the total capital ratio was 14.8% compared with 16.2% in the prior quarter.","Tangible common equity was 9.5%, including unrealized gains of $460 million -- $468 million after tax and 9.1% if you exclude those. Our capital position would also be strong from a Basel III perspective with Tier 1 common equity of about 9% based on our current estimates and assuming no changes to the proposed rules and before any mitigation activity on our part. That reflects about 45 basis points of benefit on the numerator side and about 115 basis points detriment from an increase in risk-weighted assets. As you know, these proposals are currently in the comment period.","As Kevin previously mentioned, we entered into a share repurchase transaction in August to repurchase approximately $350 million of common shares. Our capital plan included an additional $250 million of possible repurchases through the first quarter of 2013, depending on market conditions.","That wraps up my remarks, and I'll turn it over to Bruce to discuss credit results and trends. Bruce?","Bruce K. Lee","Thanks, Dan. We continued to see credit improvement across all categories in the third quarter. Credit results were the best we reported since prior to the crisis in 2007.","Starting with charge-offs on Slide 11. Total net charge-offs of $156 million declined $25 million or 14% from the second quarter and $106 million or 40% from a year ago. The net charge-off ratio was 75 basis points for the quarter, the lowest in 5 years, not as low as it should be but it's getting there. Commercial net charge-offs of $62 million declined 21% sequentially and 54% from last year. At 53 basis points, this was the lowest level reported since the third quarter of 2007","[Audio Gap]","$15 million sequentially, and commercial lease net charge-offs down $6 million from abnormally high quarter levels. Commercial real estate net charge-offs were up a combined $7 million from last quarter but continue to moderate in general.","Total consumer net charge-offs were $94 million, down 9% sequentially and 25% from a year ago. Most of this improvement was in residential mortgage charge-offs, which dropped 28% from last quarter driven by improvements in Florida, which was down to 34% sequentially. This significant reduction was a result of improved early delinquencies throughout the year, and we believe this represents the level that we can continue to improve upon.","Overall, it was another solid quarter for us from a credit perspective, and we continue to see improvement across the portfolio. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we currently expect net charge-offs to be down another $5 million to the $150 million range.","Now moving to nonperforming assets on Slide 12. NPAs, including held-for-sale, totaled $1.5 billion at quarter-end, down $190 million or 11% from the second quarter. Excluding held-for-sales, NPAs were $1.4 billion on $173 million or 11% from the second quarter, driven by improvement in commercial NPAs. Commercial portfolio NPAs declined $165 million sequentially to $1 billion, their lowest level since the first quarter of 2008.","Most portfolio categories improved, with commercial real estate NPLs down $106 million or 20% and C&I NPLs down $76 million or 17%. This was partially offset by commercial OREO balances, which were up $12 million from past quarter. Within portfolio NPAs, commercial TDRs on nonaccrual status were $153 million, up $6 million on a sequential basis. Commercial-accruing TDRs were down $13 million and also remained fairly low at $442 million.","In the consumer portfolio, NPAs declined $8 million to $429 million or 118 basis points with NPLs down $12 million, driven by broad-based improvement across all categories. Non-accruing consumer TDRs were $192 million, down $1 million from last quarter. Accruing consumer TDRs were $1.6 billion, consistent with the last quarter. The TDR book continues to perform as expected and has stabilized as opportunities for new restructurings have become more limited, due to our historically proactive practices and more stable residential real estate credit conditions. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we currently expect NPAs to continue to decline with the majority of the improvement in the commercial portfolio, which should be down $75 million to $100 million.","The next slide, Slide 13, includes a roll-forward of nonperforming loans. Commercial inflows at $121 million were down $82 million in the third quarter. Additionally, paydowns on nonperforming loans were up $37 million compared with the prior quarter. Commercial inflows for the quarter were $161 million, down $21 million. These were the lowest inflows we've seen for both commercial and consumer NPLs in several years.","Moving to Slide 14, which outlines delinquency trends. Loans 30 to 89 days past due totaled $346 million, down $25 million from last quarter with consumer up $13 million, primarily in credit card and auto, and commercial down $37 million, primarily in commercial real estate. Loans 90-plus days past due were $201 million, down $2 million from the second quarter and down $73 million or 27% from a year ago.","Total delinquencies of $547 million decreased $27 million or 5% from the second quarter and remain at pre-crisis levels. Commercial criticized asset levels also continue to improve in the third quarter with the 6th consecutive quarter decline, down $670 million or 10% sequentially.","The provision and allowance are outlined on Slide 15. Provision expense of $65 million for the quarter was down $6 million and included a reduction in the loan loss allowance of $91 million. Allowance coverage remains strong at 167% of nonperforming loans and 3.1x annualized charge-offs. We expect to see continued declines in the reserve based on continued credit improvement.","Slide 16 outlines our recent mortgage repurchase experience as a majority of our activity has been with the GSEs. The claims and losses associated with the GSEs have remained fairly stable in the past several quarters, but we expect this will likely increase some with the increased file requests from Freddie Mac, as Dan mentioned.","We've provided a detailed breakout of loans sold by vintage and remaining balance. Repurchase requests and losses have been concentrated, about 80% in the 2005 to 2008 vintages, which represent 13% of the remaining balance.","Overall results for the quarter continue to show significant improvement in our credit metrics. The trends remain headed in the right direction, and we expect this to continue in the upcoming quarters.","One last thing to touch on. You're aware the OCC has issued guidance related to consumer loans to borrowers that have been through Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower. This guidance included classifying such loans as TDRs, writing them down to their collateral value and classifying them as nonperforming. We are not an OCC bank and the Fed and FDIC have not issued similar guidance.","As a result, we haven't taken any action in response to this, although we continue to monitor developments and are in the process of analyzing the nature and amount of such loans in our portfolios. We currently estimate that we have approximately $150 million of loans that would fall into this category, about 1\/3 of which has already been through the TDR process and approximately 80% of which are current.","From a charge-off perspective, the exposure would require a write-down of these loans to appraised value, despite the fact they continue to pay as agreed. We're not in a position to estimate what that $150 million would need to be charged down to if this change were adopted. The bottom line is that this would be manageable for us, but we're not in a position to provide further information at this time.","That wraps up my remarks. I'll turn it back over to Kevin now for closing comments. Kevin?","Kevin T. Kabat","Thanks, Bruce. As Dan and Bruce outlined, our core businesses continue to perform well despite economic and regulatory headwinds. Our 21,000 employees remain focused on building strong relationships and offering our customers products and services that they genuinely find to be value added. We're finding and capitalizing on opportunities to make sure that we take share in our markets, and we expect that to continue to drive our results going forward.","That wraps up our formal remarks. Operator, can you open up the line for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just a question on the outlook for C&I. I know you said it's going to pick up in fourth quarter because you have a stronger pipeline. Can you just comment about how, I guess, accurate looking at pipeline is in terms of actual -- translating into actual C&I growth? And maybe just for -- to help us understand the magnitude, I guess, what was the pipeline last quarter, and were you surprised going into third quarter by the slowdown in C&I, if that makes sense?","Kevin T. Kabat","Ken, I'll give you a perspective. Bruce may chime in. But from our standpoint, the pipeline continues to be a good measure for us in looking at what future production anticipation is. These are deals, obviously, that we've got and understand explicitly where they are in development. And so while they can move a little bit, for the most part, we track them along from a progress standpoint. So production continues to be clear to us. The biggest -- I think the biggest challenge for us has been really kind of what happened with the capital markets and some of the paydowns, which is a little bit more difficult to forecast and to keep ahead of in terms of understanding impact from that standpoint. Obviously, we're in touch with our clients closely. But they're taking advantage of the marketplace, and quite frankly, in some cases, we're counseling them to. So that's really the challenge on a look-forward basis. That's, I think, will continue to be the challenge. I think we've been pretty transparent and open relative to what we see from a pipeline standpoint and production, and it's really then the challenge of the paydowns have continued to be kind of the variable. I don't know, Bruce, if you had...","Bruce K. Lee","Yes. We feel very good about the fourth quarter pipeline. We know exactly where it's coming from. We've been involved in those credits and the approvals. So we feel good about the fourth quarter. As Kevin did mention, there's been much more capital markets activities and refinancing in the bond market than maybe we had initially anticipated, but that's really what's going on. The production side is good, and we feel very confident in the accuracy of that.","Kevin T. Kabat","And the only other thing I would add, Ken, is compared to where we were relative to last quarter and guidance given and what we see today in the pipeline, that's why we've given the guidance that we've given in terms of the fourth quarter. We feel good about that.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","All right, that helps. And then just one quick one on resi. Can you just talk about your appetite for resi mortgage growth? Because I'm trying to reconcile that with your comments about security balances being relatively flat. Meaning, are you intentionally running off or, at least, keeping the -- you're growing resi at the expense, so to speak, of a flat securities portfolio, given where MBS yields are?","Tayfun Tuzun","The resi portfolio clearly continues to be impacted by faster prepayments speeds. But at the same time, we do have our own branch mortgage product originations and jumbo originations that are cushioning that impact. So I would expect our resi portfolio to continue to grow, not like heroically, but I think we should see stable growth rates in that portfolio.","Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So you're finding resi to be a more attractive product than MBS at this point?","Tayfun Tuzun","It is. I mean not to the extent that where we have decided to portfolio conforming mortgage loans. We've done that in the past, a couple of years ago, and we continue to evaluate that on a quarterly basis to replace prepaying mortgage-backed security balances with mortgage loans. But at this point, given the valuation of conforming loans, we don't see that as an attractive risk return trade-off. And we are also trying to manage our durations within reasonable limits, and keeping 30-year mortgages today does not seem like a good strategy to us.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Todd Hagerman with Sterne Agee.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Kevin, just kind of a follow-up on the loan growth commercial question. You referenced the election in your prepared remarks and production being very strong going in the quarter. If you could just help me better understand, just as you reference the challenges with the payoffs in capital markets, could you be more specific in terms of where the production, really the strength is relative to that kind of headwind, if you will? And the reference to the election, is this something that's kind of more back-end loaded, or just -- I'm just trying to get a little bit more clarity in terms of the outlook.","Kevin T. Kabat","Yes. Todd, generally, what I would say -- a couple of things to your question. One is where we're seeing some of the activity is really fairly broad based, and we talked about, specifically in the manufacturing healthcare space, that's true, but it is fairly widespread and broad based. We are hearing, seeing that uncertainty does impact and has been impacting reflections on managements on what they do and where they are. So we hope that as we get more clarity and the election being significant in this time period, that brings more clarity and decisiveness in terms of the actions posed we're considering or being considered by our clients and by the marketplace in general. So that's kind of the impact we're seeing and hearing from this, from our standpoint. So and again, with regard to them taking advantage of the marketplace, again, some of it's through our counseling, some of it is their own desire to strengthen and manage their balance sheets, and we continue to work with them from that standpoint. I think as we get more clarity, there potentially is some pent-up demand. We're -- we see that continually. You've heard it in terms of the industry broadly relative to deposits bases and deposits on -- in banks, where they're not really looking to put that capital to work. And so we're hopeful that as we get more clarity and may not be simply a next item, but as we get into later next year, that clarity becomes a matter of confidence that they begin to move forward with. So that's all we're hearing. That's all we're seeing. We saw some of the -- some of that play through our production and through our paydowns, and I think that's going to continue to be a trend as we move through this time period, so.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And just on that point in the -- in terms of the paydowns. Could you just give us a sense of kind of where that's been trending? If I look at Q2 relative to Q3, what the trend there has been in terms of the payoffs?","Kevin T. Kabat","Yes. In the C&I space, it's clearly escalated in the third quarter. Again, as the capital markets open up and as interest rates -- as QE3 is talked more about, long-term interest rates, people are going to the bond market. We're suggesting they go there. It helps their capital stack, and it will reduce their costs long term and provide them with some fixed rate funding. So that's what we're seeing. We saw it escalate in the third quarter, and we think that we have a much better idea what it will be in the fourth quarter and it's been built into our guidance.","Todd L. Hagerman - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. But relative to some of the other categories, if I think about the commercial real estate, that sort of thing, is that significantly different than what you're seeing within the large corporate or no?","Kevin T. Kabat","Yes, it's very different. Some of that real estate, that's being -- that we're seeing the reduction here is there's some refinancing going on, but there's also some assets being sold by our borrowers. So we expect that paydown to be consistent in the fourth quarter with the third quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Miller with FBR.","Thomas LeTrent - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","This is actually Thomas LeTrent on behalf of Paul. I had a quick question, I guess sort of on the loan growth front. But one of your competitors the other day was talking positively about Michigan and the trends they're seeing there. And given your size there, I just wanted to get your thoughts on sort of what you're seeing in that market.","Kevin T. Kabat","Tom, what I would tell you again, I don't -- as we look at kind of the geography, we feel good about the broad diversification that we have. Obviously, when we talk about manufacturing, Michigan falls into that category, as does a good portion of our upper Midwest profile. So we are seeing good activity. We are seeing kind of a good area of recovery from that standpoint. I don't know of -- I wouldn't say it's outsized relative to the rest of our footprint and the rest of what we're seeing as you overlay kind of the manufacturing profile across our geographies. So that would be kind of our commentary relative to Michigan and what we see from that standpoint.","Thomas LeTrent - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And a quick clarification point, because I sort of caught it but I didn't catch all of it. The repurchase reserves in this quarter, that was related to sort of Freddie and FHA read-through and not related to Fannie, correct?","Kevin T. Kabat","That is correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.","Nick Karzon","Nick Karzon standing in for Craig this morning. I guess just first, kind of following up on the mortgage rep and warranty and the reserve there. Can you give us a little bit more color on the expectations on that going forward? And a lot of your peers have taken kind of full -- kind of built their reserve to the extent that they don't expect to take further reserves for that 2005 to 2008 vintage. And are there plans to meet with Fannie to potentially sit down and have a similar discussion to get to that level of confidence?","Daniel T. Poston","Yes. Craig, this is Dan. Certainly, we continue to have discussions with both Fannie and Freddie and incorporate into our reserving methodology all the current information that we have based on those discussions. So I don't want to give the impression that we haven't had any discussions with Fannie Mae. We have those discussions all the time and attempt to get the best information we can with respect to what their intentions are and what we should expect going forward. I think the -- what occurred with Freddie Mac this quarter, which really, frankly, started last quarter. You'll recall, last quarter, we talked about the fact that Freddie Mac had been signaling that we should expect an increase in file requests on a going-forward basis. At that point in time, we didn't have the clarity that we do now with respect to when those requests would increase, how much they would increase and more importantly, what methodology or selection criteria they were using or they would -- they expected to be using to arrive at those higher levels of file requests. So we now understand better what criteria they're using, and we can use that criteria to -- as a component of our reserving methodology. So now we have reserves on the books, not only for file requests that we've received, but also file requests that we expect to receive based on those revised criteria. So that's the kind of clarity we got this quarter that allowed us to incorporate that information to -- into our reserving methodology with respect to Freddie Mac. We continue to have discussions with Fannie Mae. And like Freddie Mac, our reserves for put-back from Fannie Mae reflect all of the information that we've received up to this point from Fannie Mae. We just thought it was important to emphasize that with respect to the incremental reserves that we recorded this quarter and the change in methodology, that was something that was applicable to Freddie Mac but not Fannie Mae. Yes, the future -- the second part of that question was what should we expect in the future. I think our methodology is based upon those loans that we expect to get a file request for based on the criteria that Freddie has laid out for us. That criteria will continue to apply into the future. And to the extent that more loans in the future meet that criteria, we would expect to receive incremental file requests over and above those that are reserved for today. So we haven't -- we don't believe that we've booked reserves for everything that will happen in the future. But clearly, to the extent that there are a population of loans out there that already meet this criteria and that there's somewhat of a backlog that Freddie will be working through over the next 3 to 6 months, we have accounted for those loans at this point in time. So I think we've reserved for a chunk of our remaining exposure, but I don't think it's something that we believe we've reserved for all losses for the life of the portfolio and don't think that that's the appropriate accounting policy.","Nick Karzon","Got it. I guess a second question is how much room do you see on the deposit cost side, and are there any large upcoming CD maturities that we should be aware of?","Daniel T. Poston","Yes. I think, clearly, with rates where they are, there's probably less room on deposit pricing than there has been in the past. But that being said, I think we continue to see some room there as we monitor those rates, monitor what competitors are doing. So that's something that we look at all the time, and we will continue to look at. I think with respect to any large amounts of repricing, we've talked in the past about CD repricing, primarily CDs that were put on the books in '08, at the end of '08, during the liquidity crisis that had some higher rates. Most of that is behind us. However, there were -- or there was a slug of those put on at the end of '08 that have 5-year maturities. And therefore, toward the latter half, third, fourth quarter of 2013, we'll see a little bit of activity in terms of some high-rate CDs that mature in that timeframe. But that's a few quarters off yet.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan.","Vivek Juneja - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","With everything going on this morning, I think I missed part of the comment about the OCC-related guidance. Did I hear you say $150 million loans are impacted but you said you aren't able to estimate the charge-offs? Do you have a sense of when you might be able to do so, and what's holding that back?","Daniel T. Poston","Yes, Vivek, this is Dan. You did hear that right. We believe that there's about $150 million of loans that we will need to analyze. This is recently issued guidance. And as I think you probably know, the guidance is that there should be charge-downs of those loans to the appraised values. We don't have current appraised values on our entire portfolio. So as we analyze what the potential impact of this item is, one of the things that we need to do is to go get current appraisal information for those loans. So that's the reason that we're unable to estimate that at this time. It's just simply the fact that it's very recent guidance and we haven't received that information yet. Our understanding is that our regulators, the Fed and the FDIC, are considering that guidance, and we will have a clearer view as to what the expectations of us are as we go into the fourth quarter. And certainly, we would anticipate having that information in the fourth quarter to enable us to respond to whatever that guidance is that we receive.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Kevin Barker with Compass Point.","Kevin Barker - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Declines in the savings and checking accounts, and if there is a change in strategy to allow may be some core -- some deposits to come down in order to manage your net interest income? Or is there something going on there where you will allow some funds to run-off? Is there something there?","Tayfun Tuzun","Kevin, I think we missed the first part of your question. Can you please repeat that?","Kevin Barker - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Could you discuss some of the declines in the checking and savings account balances?","Tayfun Tuzun","Okay. I don't think that there is any sort of trends that we are seeing. It's sort of normal fluctuations. We're not necessarily strategically guiding them down or up. We obviously are very interested in deposit growth, continue to be interested in deposit growth, and the DDAs were up quite a bit this quarter. And obviously, our clients, both on the corporate side as well as the consumer side, continue to hold quite a bit of liquidity, and I think we're taking our market share. And we're also trying to be smart about those deposits that are interest bearing and make sure that we are managing interest costs efficiently. So I don't think that this -- the balances indicate any trends or strategic direction at this point.","Kevin Barker - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then on auto lending. What rates are you seeing out there for new auto loans, and what type of ranges are you seeing for new auto loans right now?","Tayfun Tuzun","Rates have continued to inch down from second quarter to the third quarter. Clearly, the third quarter from just the base swap rate perspective has been very volatile. Typically, sort of a 5-year auto loan to the high FICO score, 760-plus type FICO score borrowers is probably around 3% today.","Kevin Barker - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Now what about the lower FICO scores? Are you\u2026","Tayfun Tuzun","We don't do lower FICO scores, so it's difficult for me to give you guidance on that.","Kevin Barker - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Are you seeing much more competition out there for auto loans? Is it something that's really going to be pushing rate? Is it going to continue to go lower?","Tayfun Tuzun","There is competition. I mean, I think Fed's commitment to keep these low rates lower for longer period of time continues to fuel that competition. We are doing the business smartly, and we've been in that business for a long time. So we're managing the risk profiles within our normal traditional guidelines, and we have good established relationships with dealers, which is enabling us to keep rates stable at this point. But competition clearly is picking up.","Kevin Barker - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then finally, most of the originations on the mortgage banking side, was that -- what was the breakout between retail and wholesale originations this quarter?","Daniel T. Poston","Hang on just a minute. Let me see if we have that here.","Kevin Barker - Compass Point Research & Trading, LLC, Research Division","What I'm trying to get at, where was most of the growth in originations?","Daniel T. Poston","Yes, most of the growth has been in retail. In terms of our originations...","Kevin T. Kabat","About 60% of our originations were retail this quarter, and that was a little higher than last quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom.","Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just 2 quick questions. What's the plan for the rest of the buyback that's not part of the accelerated program?","Daniel T. Poston","Yes. Jon, this is Dan. As you know, we had a $350 million accelerated share repurchase program that was initiated in August. We have approval for about $250 million in additional repurchases over the balance of our CCAR period which, as you know, goes through the end of the first quarter. So fourth quarter or first -- fourth quarter of '12 or first quarter of '13, there's about $250 million in additional capacity. And we would expect that barring unforeseen market conditions, that those repurchases would take place ratably over that period, would probably be the most likely result at this point in time.","Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just to clarify, the high end of your targeted combined payout range is still 80% in terms of dividend plus buybacks?","Daniel T. Poston","Yes. I think that's probably a good estimate of the high end of the range, yes.","Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, good. And then just one unrelated question. But I believe you had a leadership change in Chicago, and I'm just curious to how you feel you're doing in that market and if there's any change in approach in terms of how you go about your business in Chicago.","Kevin T. Kabat","Jon, yes, I mean, for the most part, our leadership team in Chicago's been fairly stable. I'm not sure if there's a specific individual or a specific person you're referencing, but we feel really good about that marketplace. We feel really good about what Bob Sullivan has been doing in that marketplace. I think we've really had great results and continued momentum in that marketplace, and Bob is doing a fantastic job for us up there. So no -- I guess that's what I'd say unless there's something specific you'd want.","Jon G. Arfstrom - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes. We can take it offline. That's fine.","Kevin T. Kabat","Sounds good.","Jeff Richardson","Bob's been in Chicago 2 -- or has headed up Chicago 2 years. He'd obviously had senior positions in the company for many years.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Two follow-ups, one on just the NII and NIM outlook. I know that all banks are going to be pressured, but we didn't see a lot of earning asset growth this quarter also. So I just wanted to see if you can help us understand. As you look out into next year, you mentioned that you think that NIM and NII challenges are manageable. But can you guys grow NII next year? Do you anticipate that the pace of loan growth and earning asset growth will be able to stem the tide of the obvious NIM challenges for the industry?","Tayfun Tuzun","Ken, as you remembered, actually, I understand why these NIM and NII questions are a hot topic this time around. But we started talking about this early this year, and we said that NIM takes a second seat to NII growth. And I think all year, we focused on growing earning assets, and we're giving you guidance for Q4. I wouldn't read too much into that. We're not giving you guidance for 2013, but that's because our typical update happens this quarter and there are a couple of obviously unknowns with respect to the elections and the fiscal cliff. But we will be updating that. We're still confident that our earning asset growth will cushion NIM contraction. Although when you look at our numbers, our Q4 guidance is probably on the low side of what other banks are guiding their NIM. We've been able to manage both sides quite successfully this year. We're going to end up this year with most likely a higher NII than we did last year in a very difficult market environment. And we've focused on this all year, and I think we are pretty confident that going forward, that same focus will benefit our numbers.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then my second question, just relating to as you think -- as you guys go into the next stress test, obviously, you've just given -- I want to just get some perspective on your takeaways from how this year's process went. You obviously did resubmit and were allowed to proceed or non-objected to. I know we haven't seen -- you guys haven't seen the data yet. But just any different thought process as you go into next year's stress test in terms of that -- even that 80% top line that Jon asked about before in terms of -- is there any -- do you anticipate there being any pushback or change, given what you guys had to experience this year?","Daniel T. Poston","Ken, this is Dan. I think as we go into this year's process, as you pointed out, we're still waiting for the scenarios and final guidance and so forth, so we will have to react to that and incorporate that into our expectations. But as we sit here today, I don't believe there's any significant change in our thought process relative to what is an appropriate capital return plan and what might be reflected in that. I think -- I don't think there's a strong bias that the level of our returns of capital would go up or down from the prior year based on where we sit today, because I think we continue to have very strong capital levels. We continue to have strong capital accretion from strong earnings. And so on an overall basis, I think our expectations would be that it would look pretty similar to last year unless there are changes in the process that we've yet to see.","Kenneth M. Usdin - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And my last one is just related to another capital question. Any update with regards to Vantiv? I know we saw just the negative warrant account this quarter. But can you just give us just a quick thought on core performance of Vantiv, and again, just how you guys are thinking about the stake versus opportunities versus what Vantiv's own strategy is with regard to liquidity and the holding and et cetera.","Daniel T. Poston","Yes. I think, overall, we're very pleased with the progress that Vantiv is making, pleased with their results. I think they have good growth plans in place, which has included some level of acquisitions. I think they're in an industry that has opportunities to grow from that perspective, and we believe that they have taken advantage of those opportunities very well thus far and are likely to continue to do so. So we think that that's an attractive holding for us. Relative to plans going forward, we don't have any definitive plans at this particular point in time. So that will -- that's something that we think is an attractive holding, and we think we have a lot of flexibility now that it's a public company, as to how we approach that going forward, we will continue to evaluate going forward. So we did have a bit of a negative mark this quarter. As you know, that follows some fairly large positive marks over the preceding quarter. So there's a little bit of volatility now that it's a publicly traded company and the stock price moves around a little bit. But overall, their stock has performed very well, and we're very comfortable with our position.","Kevin T. Kabat","I mean, just as a -- the warrant is a warrant to purchase Vantiv stock. It is for 15 years. So the way we look at that warrant is as a 15-year instrument. The accounting for it is it changes in value every quarter, but it doesn't change in value every quarter from our perspective. But it is -- it can be volatile. And as Vantiv stock moves, you can see that clearly in the market because they're publicly traded. And that's going to have an impact positive or negative as their stock moves each quarter on our earnings, and we'll be clear about what the impact was. But you have the ability really to estimate that every quarter.","Operator","And we've now reached our allotted time for questions. Are there any closing remarks?","Jeff Richardson","No. Thanks, Polly. Appreciate it.","Daniel T. Poston","Thanks, everyone.","Jeff Richardson","Thanks, everyone.","Operator","And thank you for your participation. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect."],"9045":["Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ:FITB) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call January 22, 2020  9:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Chris Doll - Director, Investors Relations","Greg Carmichael - President and Chief Executive Officer","Tayfun Tuzun - Chief Financial Officer","Frank Forrest - Chief Risk Officer","Jamie Leonard - Treasurer","Lars Anderson - Chief Operating Officer","Conference Call Participants","Scott Siefers - Piper Sandler","Ken Usdin - Jefferies","John Pancari - Evercore ISI","Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley","Erika Najarian - Bank of America","Matt O'Connor - Deutsche Bank","Saul Martinez - UBS","Christopher Marinac - Janney Montgomery","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Fifth Third Bank's Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions]","I will now hand today's conference over to Mr. Doll. Please go ahead.","Chris Doll","Thank you, [Dkitria]. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. Today, we'll be discussing our financial results for the fourth quarter of 2019. Please review the cautionary statements on our materials, which can be found in our earnings release and presentation. These materials contain reconciliations to non-GAAP measures, along with information pertaining to the use of non-GAAP measures, as well as forward-looking statements about Fifth Third's performance.","We undertake no obligation to and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call. This morning, I'm joined by our President and CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Chief Operating Officer, Lars Anderson; Chief Risk Officer, Frank Forrest; Treasurer, Jamie Leonard. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Tayfun, we will open the call for questions.","Let me turn over the call now to Greg for his comments.","Greg Carmichael","Thanks, Chris, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. Earlier today, we reported record full year 2019 net income of $2.5 billion or $3.33 per share. Full year adjusted net income of $2.1 billion was also a record for the Bank. As I reflect on the past year, I'm very pleased with the significant progress we made positioning Fifth Third for long-term success. ","In addition to the record net income, we generated our best full year core return on tangible common equity, excluding AOCI in over a decade, up 120 basis points from last year. We produced our lowest efficiency ratio in over a decade, which decreased 160 basis points from last year. We generated peer-leading household and deposit growth, all while reducing deposit cost during the year.","Also, during the year, we successfully integrated MB Financial. We added significant scale in the Chicago market and expect to generate even stronger deposit, household and revenue growth going forward. We successfully navigated the evolving interest rate environment as our full year 2019 core net interest margin expanded 5 basis points after expanding 18 basis points in the year before, which is at the higher end of our peer group.","We generated record fee income, including corporate banking, as our capital markets business generated double-digit revenue growth for the second consecutive year. We also generated record revenue in wealth and asset management, while generating positive inflows every quarter during the year.","Net charge-offs and other key credit metrics remained at or near historically low levels throughout the year. We generated nearly half a billion dollars of excess capital through Worldpay transactions in 2019, which is yet to be deployed. And we returned over 110% of adjusted earnings to shareholders in 2019 through a 27% increase in our dividend and through share repurchases.","In summary, we are extremely pleased with the progress we have made and expect to build on our strong performance in 2020 and beyond. For the fourth quarter, net income available to common shareholders was $701 million or $0.96 per share. Reported results included a positive $0.28, primarily from the successful Worldpay tax receivable agreement transactions completed during the quarter.","Since the spin-off of our processing business 10 years ago, we have generated over $7 billion in pre-tax value for our shareholders, with another $195 million remaining in TRA income, which will be fully realized over the next five years. Tayfun will discuss the fourth quarter TRA transaction in more detail.","Our fourth quarter financial results were very strong, reflecting our prior North Star investments to further diversify our revenue streams, prudent balance sheet management, continued expense discipline and our success in achieving the targeted financial outcomes from the MB Financial acquisition.","We generated very strong fee revenue, including a new record in capital markets. Our net interest income results once again reflect our ability to successfully manage the balance sheet despite the lower rate environment, which led to strong NIM performance in the quarter.","We continue to manage our expenses diligently. This reflects our continued focus on [indiscernible] the Bank, while still investing in high-priority areas to support revenue growth. We remain on track to achieve the $255 million in annual savings from the MB acquisition by the end of the first quarter of 2020 and are excited about the revenue synergies that are emerging.","Loan growth during the quarter was consistent with our previous guidance, reflecting the generally subdued macroeconomic environment. Total commercial loans were stable and consumer loans were up 1%, sequentially. Following our trend, we successfully generated strong core deposit growth, while proactively reducing deposit cost more than our previous guidance. Our average loan to core deposit ratio of 90% is the lowest in over 15 years.","Credit results during the quarter were partially impacted by our conversion to a national charter. Excluding this impact, net charge-offs were up just 1 basis point sequentially, with consumer flat and commercial up 2 basis points. Provision was primarily impacted by growth in specific reserves related to a couple of commercial loans.","Before I turn over to Tayfun to discuss our results and outlook, I'd like to once again emphasize our strategic priorities to outperform through the cycle and generate long-term shareholder value. As I mentioned, we have been very successful in executing our priorities throughout 2019 and have delivered on our targeted outcomes as expected.","We will continue to focus on these priorities going forward, including: leveraging technology to accelerate our digital transformation; investing in talent, capabilities and process improvements to generate relationship growth and improve profitability; continue to expand our presence in select geographies, focusing on high-growth markets.","We are investing in the Southeast footprint with better deposit growth trends, higher expected population growth and greater market vitality. And lastly, we are focused on maintaining our disciplined approach throughout the company.","To that end, our capital allocation priorities are: organic balance sheet growth, fee-generating non-bank acquisitions, paying a strong dividend, and share repurchases. Bank acquisitions are not a priority. Our medium term CET1 capital target remains at approximately 9.5%. We plan to increase our dividend another $0.03 this quarter. Subject to Board approval, we expect to execute our remaining buybacks from CCAR 2019.","Our clearly defined strategic growth priorities, our proactive balance sheet management, and our ongoing discipline throughout the Bank position us well for the future. We continue to focus on striking the appropriate balance in order to generate positive operating leverage this year, while continuing to invest for long-term performance.","I'm pleased to report that we were again able to deliver strong financial results. Our strong performance this quarter was a direct result of our employees' hard work and dedication to keeping the customer at the center of everything we do.","With that, I'll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our fourth quarter results and our current outlook.","Tayfun Tuzun","Thank you, Greg. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Let's move to the financial highlights on Slide 4 of the earnings presentation. We are pleased with our overall financial performance and strong finish to a strong year. Similar to the trends all year, during the fourth quarter, our net interest income, net interest margin, non-interest income and non-interest expenses, all performed in line or better than our October guidance.","Reported results for this quarter were positively impacted by $0.28 per share from several notable items. The most significant was a $265 million after-tax gain from the Worldpay TRA transaction, which added approximately 20 basis points to our CET1 ratio. Similar to all of the strategic decisions related to our legacy processing business over the past 10 years, the TRA transaction creates significant value for our shareholders by monetizing gross cash flows that previously expected to occur, primarily from 2025 until 2035.","Consequently, we are also no longer exposed to FIS' taxable income capacity in the future related to those cash flows, and we still have multiple years of annual benefits impacting our fee income in the future. We provide more information on the transaction in our presentation appendix.","In addition to the TRA transaction, reported results were also affected by a $34 million after-tax negative mark related to the Visa total return swap, a $15 million after-tax contribution to the Fifth Third Foundation and a $7 million after-tax impact from MB merger-related charges. Additionally, our quarterly results were negatively impacted by a $7 million after-tax impact to provision for credit losses, resulting from our conversion to a national charter.","Our earnings materials provide more information on the various credit metrics that are affected by this conversion. Adjusting for those items and the purchase accounting impact shown in our earnings materials, fourth quarter pre-provision net revenue increased 14% from the prior year.","Our core return on tangible common equity, excluding AOCI also increased 30 basis points from the prior year to 14.8%, while our tangible book value per share increased 10% from last year. Our goal is to carry the revenue momentum forward, while maintaining tight expense control.","We will continue to manage balance sheet risk by remaining cognizant of the environmental factors and maintain a prudent approach to capital management with the ultimate goal of rewarding our shareholders today and in the future.","Moving to Slide 5, total average loans were flat sequentially as consumer grew 1% and commercial was stable from the prior quarter. Our focus continues to be on generating higher-quality loan growth to maximize our returns through the full cycle. In our commercial business, similar to last quarter, strong production levels in both regional middle market and corporate banking were offset by elevated payoffs.","We have experienced higher-than-usual payoffs this quarter in our leveraged lending and structured finance portfolios, as well as in our construction portfolio. New loan production in regional middle market banking has increased every quarter since the first quarter of 2019. Our new loan originations, particularly in Cincinnati, Chicago and Florida, were strong in the fourth quarter. Total commercial line utilization was stable.","In commercial leasing, our balances continued to decline due to our 2018 decision to hold new originations in our large ticket indirect segment and focus on driving relationship-oriented growth. We expect to see lease balances decline by approximately $300 million by the end of 2020 as a result. Beyond 2020, this impact should be lower.","Average commercial real estate loans were up 1% from last quarter, primarily reflecting draws on prior-period commitments. Our CRE balances as a percentage of total risk-based capital remained very low at less than 80%. Commercial loan growth will likely remain relatively muted in the near term, reflecting the subdued environment for corporate capital investments. We will continue to maintain our focus on client selection and prudent underwriting in the best long-term interest of our shareholders.","Average total consumer loans grew 1% from last quarter, predominantly driven by strong auto loan production of $1.7 billion within the same risk return profile that we have targeted for the past number of years. The decline in home equity balances continues to reflect high levels of payoffs and paydowns. Our credit card growth continues to track in line with the industry.","The residential mortgage portfolio was flat sequentially. We expect this portfolio to remain flat for the foreseeable future, barring any significant changes in the interest rate environment. In the first quarter, we expect total average loan balances to remain relatively stable sequentially. For the full year 2020, we expect average loans to increase approximately 4% relative to last year with growth in both commercial and consumer portfolios.","Moving on to Slide 6, reported net interest income declined 1%, compared to the prior quarter. The purchase accounting adjustments benefited our fourth quarter NII by $18 million and our net interest margin by 5 basis points, compared to $28 million and 7 basis points in the third quarter. Adjusting for purchase accounting accretion, NII was relatively flat with just a $4 million decrease sequentially.","Interest income benefited a couple of million dollars from seasonal dividends. The adjusted fourth quarter NIM of 3.22% decreased 3 basis points from the third quarter adjusted NIM, which was better than our October guidance of down 4 basis points to 5 basis points. Our relative NIM performance throughout this rate cycle has been outstanding.","Our focus on reducing our overall interest-bearing liability costs to offset the impact of lower market rates remains very high. Interest-bearing core deposit rates were down 19 basis points during the quarter, better than our previous guidance range of 15 basis points to 18 basis points. We expect interest-bearing core deposit costs in the first quarter to decline approximately another 8 basis points to 10 basis points from the fourth quarter, assuming the Fed remains on hold.","Combining our first quarter forecast with the results of the past three quarters, we will achieve a cumulative 30 basis point decline in interest-bearing core deposit costs since the Fed started lowering interest rates last year, resulting in a 40% beta. On a core basis, we expect first quarter NIM to expand 1 basis points to 2 basis points from the fourth quarter core NIM of 3.22%, reflecting the increasing benefit from the forward-starting hedge positions that became effective over the past few months.","For the full year 2020, we continue to expect core NIM to be 3.25%, consistent with our October guidance and down just 2 basis points from our core 2019 NIM, assuming no Fed rate cuts this year.","For the full year, we currently expect net interest income, excluding purchase accounting adjustments to increase approximately 2%. We expect our first quarter net interest income, excluding purchase accounting adjustments to decline approximately 2% sequentially, impacted by day count and the relatively stable loan growth outlook. Our first quarter outlook also assumes partial reinvestment of the investment portfolio cash flows, which may change depending on the environment.","Moving on to Slide 7, we had a stronger quarter in fee income than we guided to in October. Adjusted non-interest income decreased only 2% sequentially as deposit fees and corporate banking fees performed better than expected, offsetting a portion of the seasonal decline in mortgage revenues. Continuing its recent trends, corporate banking fees exceeded our guidance.","Our capital market teams generated record revenues this quarter, up 10% from the third quarter. For the full year, our capital markets fees were up 12%, following 15% year-over-year growth in 2018. We are very pleased with the second half revenue strength in capital markets, especially the growth from our regional banking client activities. Our focus on client selection and deepening those relationships is working well to diversify our revenue streams. ","The power of our One Bank model, which engages all business lines in meeting our clients' needs, is very visible in our financial results. We generated very strong 30% growth in corporate banking revenue in 2019 relative to 2018, reflecting the investments we have made in our North Star project in talent and in advanced capabilities to better serve our clients. As we anticipated, the return to those investments will continue to reward our shareholders.","Mortgage banking revenue decreased 23% to $73 million sequentially and increased 35% relative to the fourth quarter of 2018. Origination volume of $3.8 billion was up 13% from the prior quarter. Our gain on sale margin was 156 basis points in the quarter, impacted by seasonally lower application volumes in the quarter and tightening primary-secondary spreads.","Wealth and asset management revenue increased 4% from the prior quarter, due to higher personal asset management fees. We finished the year very strong in new AUM flows and expect this trend to continue in 2020. Deposit service charges were up this quarter with higher fees in consumer, as well as commercial. We expect a stronger year in 2020 in our consumer and commercial deposit service charges, based on the trends that we are seeing.","Our 2019 non-interest income results demonstrate the increasing benefit of having a platform with a wide scope of product and service capabilities. For the full year 2020, we expect core non-interest income growth of approximately 8% relative to the adjusted 2019 level of $2.711 billion, including the expected Worldpay TRA benefit in the fourth quarter.","We expect first quarter non-interest income to decline approximately 3%, reflecting seasonally lower mortgage and interchange revenue. Our first quarter forecast also does not include any investment gains. In total, as a result of NII growth and strong increase in fees, we expect to achieve a very strong 4% total revenue growth in 2020.","Moving on to Slide 8, fourth quarter reported pre-tax expenses included merger-related items totaling $9 million, intangible amortization expense of $14 million and a contribution to the Fifth Third Foundation of $20 million. Adjusted for these items and prior-period items shown in our materials, non-interest expense was flat sequentially. We remain on track to deliver on the previously provided outlook for MB-related expense savings.","We continue to expect to achieve $255 million in savings by the end of the first quarter of 2020. Additionally, we expect our total after-tax merger charges, inclusive of the merger-related charges recognized in current and past periods, as well as projected future charges, to be approximately $245 million after tax, which is $5 million lower than our deal estimate.","As is always the case for us, our first quarter expenses are impacted by seasonal items associated with the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes. Excluding these seasonal items, we would expect our total expenses in the first quarter to be down approximately 1% sequentially.","Total first quarter expenses, including the seasonal items are expected to be up approximately 5% from the adjusted fourth quarter, which also includes the full impact of the $3 raise in our minimum wage to $18 an hour. Although in the short term, the increase in minimum wage is dilutive, in the long run, we expect to achieve a stronger financial outcome through lower turnover, improved workforce quality, lower recruiting expenses and more effective training.","For the full year, there are a number of discrete one-time changes, including the impact of the minimum wage increase and the increase in direct regulatory fees related to the OCC charter conversion. In addition, we are planning to continue to rationalize and modernize our technology infrastructure, which will result in additional in-year expense growth relative to our recent trends. These three unique items are expected to increase our total expenses by approximately 1%.","We are anticipating a minimal increase in discretionary expenses outside of these items. Excluding these unique items affecting 2020, total expenses should increase less than 2%. In total, including these items, we expect total adjusted expenses to increase between 2% and 3%, compared to adjusted 2019 non-interest expenses of $4.372 billion, which reflects growth in expense items tied to strong revenue performance that I mentioned.","Regardless of our 12-month outlook, which calls for positive operating leverage resulting from strong revenue and disciplined expense growth, in this uncertain macroeconomic environment, we intend to maintain flexibility to achieve positive operating leverage under potentially less favorable economic conditions. ","We recognize that as we navigate through the environment, investments in projects with lower returns may be de-emphasized or delayed in order to focus our capital investments in the highest areas of importance within the four strategic corporate priorities.","Turning to credit results on Slide 9, due to our national charter conversion, fourth quarter credit results were impacted by accounting policy changes to conform to OCC guidance regarding certain assets, which resulted in an increase in TDR and OREO balances. These changes increased consumer NPLs by $83 million and NPAs by $113 million, which added 7 basis points to the NPL ratio and 10 basis points to the NPA ratio.","The same change resulted in a one-time $10 million increase in charge-offs, all within our consumer portfolio. Excluding the one-time OCC impact, net charge-offs remained at historically low levels during the quarter. The consumer net charge-off ratio was flat and commercial was up 2 basis points sequentially. The adjusted NPA and NPL ratios continue to be benign and in line with the levels that we have seen all year.","The ALLL ratio increased slightly to 1.1% of portfolio loans and leases, driven largely by two factors. The larger portion of the increase was due to higher specific reserves for two middle market commercial loans in two different industries. We expect these loans to go through our resolution process in the first or second quarter. We also increased the allowance in our credit card portfolio as the incurred loss methodology captured the uptick in historical loss rates.","As we discussed before, the higher credit card loss rates are related to growth in certain promotional test portfolios, which are expected to run off and result in more normalized charge-offs toward the end of the year. Card charge-offs were actually down 20 basis points this quarter, compared to third quarter.","With respect to the CECL adoption, which is in effect as of January 1, the day-one adjustments will result in an increase of approximately 48% to 50% or between $645 million and $675 million to our allowance for credit losses, which includes reserves for unfunded commitments, and is below the upper end of the range that we provided in October.","As a reminder, this increase includes the impact of the MB acquisition accounting methodology pertaining to our non-PCI loan portfolio and the CECL treatment of reserves, which adds more than 10% to the increase that I mentioned. As discussed previously, excluding the impact of MB, we expect reserves for commercial loans to decrease and consumer and mortgage loans to increase relative to the incurred loss methodology. We plan to include a full description and transition details in our upcoming 10-K disclosure.","Consistent with peer banks who have recently commented on the impact of CECL, given the number and potential volatility associated with the underlying variables supporting the CECL methodology, we expect more volatility in our quarterly provision expense. Our calculations for the allowance for credit losses rely on various models and estimation techniques, utilizing historical losses, borrower characteristics, economic conditions, and a reasonable and supportable forecast, as well as other relevant factors.","For expected losses in our reasonable and supportable forecast period of three years, we will use three macroeconomic scenarios. From there, we assume losses revert to historical levels over a period of two years on a straight-line basis. Given the multiple variables impacting provision expense under CECL, we will be providing forecast for net charge-offs for the foreseeable future.","Overall, we expect our full year 2020 charge-offs to remain near historically low levels and be in the 35 basis point to 40 basis point range, which is up just a few basis points, compared to the 36 basis point to 37 basis point charge-off rates that we have seen in the last couple of quarters.","Again, I would like to remind you that the current economic backdrop continues to support a relatively stable credit outlook with potential fluctuations in losses on a quarter-to-quarter basis, given the current low absolute levels of charge-offs.","Turning to Slide 10, capital levels ended the year very strong. Our common equity tier 1 ratio was 9.7% and our tangible common equity ratio, excluding AOCI, was 8.4%. Our tangible book value per share was $21.13 this quarter, up 10% year-over-year.","During the quarter, we completed $300 million in buybacks, which reduced our share count by approximately 10 million shares or about 1.5% of our common shares outstanding, compared to the third quarter. We expect to execute the remaining approximately $600 million of repurchases over the remaining two quarters in this CCAR cycle. Between the Worldpay sale gains in the first quarter of 2019 and the impact of the recent TRA transaction, we have nearly $0.5 billion of additional capital above our initial expectations as we proceed into the 2020 CCAR exercise.","As we discussed last quarter, the pacing of our preferred dividends has recently changed in light of our September issuance and the conversion of existing preferred stock to floating rates with quarterly payments. We expect our preferred expense to alternate between $17 million and $33 million every quarter going forward, assuming no issuances or change in LIBOR. Slide 11 provides a summary of our current outlook.","In summary, I would like to reiterate a few items. Our fourth quarter results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress we've made over the past few years toward achieving our goal of outperformance through the cycle. Our execution on the MB acquisition is on track to meet our targets on both expense and revenue synergies. As always, we remain intensely focused on successfully executing against our strategic priorities and remain confident in our ability to outperform through various economic cycles.","With that, let me turn it over to Chris to open the call up for Q&A.","Chris Doll","Thanks Tayfun. Before we start Q&A, as a courtesy to others, we ask you to limit yourself to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. We will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have this morning. During the question-and-answer period, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator. [Dkitria], please open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.","Scott Siefers","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question.","Greg Carmichael","Good morning, Scott.","Scott Siefers","Hi, Tayfun, I just wanted to ask about the fourth quarter provision and give some detail on the items impacting it, in addition to just the move to the national charter, but you had, it sounds like, a couple of commercial credits and then the impact from the credit card portfolio as well. Just as you think about things sort of on a go-forward basis, how much of that proves transitory and how much, if any, is sort of a new run rate? In other words, if it was higher than expected this quarter due to some of those, kind of revert back down, or what's the best way to think about it?","Tayfun Tuzun","Sure. Scott, I will make a few comments and I'll turn it over to Frank for the credit piece. We believe that clearly these couple of credits that just happened in one quarter impacted the provision numbers, which we believe to be transitionary. If you look at our guidance for next year, we are clearly expecting continued stability in benign credit performance away from sort of the accounting-related changes in our credit metrics. This truly was just one of these quarters where a few credit loans came up, but, Frank, do you want to comment on that?","Frank Forrest","Tayfun, I will. And Scott, we've talked about before, the commercial business \u2013 and we've done this a long time \u2013 is lumpy. The nature of the business is lumpy. One quarter didn\u2019t make us trend in either directions in the commercial business, and it's something that you manage over an extended period of time. These two credits are non-related to each other. They're both kind of core middle market companies.","The company has actually banked for a long period of time. One is a retailer. One is in the hospitality sector. They're just \u2013 they're going through a workout and they happen to hit at the same time. But if you revert back to the year and if you look at our overall, again, results for the year, we're actually very pleased with the asset quality for the year.","As we said before, our criticized assets came within our expectations for the year. Our outlook for 2020 has really not changed other than maybe a [2 or 3 basis points] increase, just given the economy. And overall, our nonperforming assets for the quarter were centered on these two items, the $50 million net flow at the end of the day.","When we think back to the work, we've done in the company intentionally over the last four years, we've repositioned this company to be strong through operating cycles. So, we're highly confident \u2013 I'm highly confident we've done that. These are middle market credits. The increases we've actually seen for the year in our problem credits have been tied to kind of the lower-end middle market.","A lot of that's reflective of repositioning the rating system from MB. Some of it's in our systems as well. Those credits tend to be very well secured and historically have a loan loss rate, and it's a very granular portfolio, which is what we like to see.","When you think about the portfolios, at least in my experience, where we \u2013 you should be concerned, as you think about the economy, when an [economy slips], it's commercial real estate, it would be your large corporate book and it would be leveraged. And when you think about our commercial real estate book, we have the lowest concentration of commercial real estate loans than any of our peers. And that portfolio has performed exceptionally well. And we position it with companies today that are basically national and large regional developers that are essentially investment grade or near investment grade, lot of liquidity.","Our large corporate books performed exceptionally well, our shared national credit book; very low level of criticized assets, and it's very diverse. We manage the risk exposures there, I think, very prudently. And when you think about leverage, leverage in our case, we've been focused on reducing that for now for four years.","We've reduced over $5 billion in leveraged loans in the last four years, which is a 48% decrease, but we feel very good about the remaining leverage that we have today. We have specialized groups that lend to that sector both in the line of business, and they're tied together with specialists that we have in risk. And we manage it prudently, we monitor it prudently.","So our overall thesis, I suppose, is that when you think about the portfolio and what Fifth Third has done over the last four years, we've completely repositioned this portfolio for success, and we're highly confident that that work will project itself as we move forward in 2020 and beyond under any economic scenario.","Scott Siefers","Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate that. And then separately, Tayfun, I was curious on the gain that you got from the change in the TRA agreement, do you guys have the same flexibility to repurchase shares with that gain as you do under kind of a more traditional \u2013 if you were to just sell shares and get an after-tax gain in that way?","Tayfun Tuzun","Not with the gain that we book. We typically go to the Fed with a specific request, but clearly, the first quarter 2019 gain on share sales, we are able to buy back shares with that. But obviously, this gain that we booked in the fourth quarter goes into our overall capital ratios, which gives us a better starting point for the 2020 CCAR exercise.","Scott Siefers","Yes. Okay, perfect. Thank you.","Chris Doll","Dkitria, are you there?","Operator","Yes. Next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.","Ken Usdin","Thanks, good morning guys. Can I ask a question on the right side of the balance sheet, you talked about loans growing 4% this year? I'm wondering if you could put the deposits into context in terms of the mix of deposits and what type of growth you're expecting on the deposit side overall? Thanks.","Tayfun Tuzun","I suspect that I'll turn it over to Jamie with details as well. We obviously have had a very good year both in consumer, as well as commercial deposits in 2019. We expect that our stable growth in consumer accompanied by good growth in household will continue. We do expect a stronger year in commercial deposit growth as well because we have a good amount of focus on the partnership in our treasury management group and our commercial deposit. Jamie, anything you want add?","Jamie Leonard","Ken, this is Jamie. One of our goals this year is that we do match loan growth with deposit growth. And so, for us, we would expect core deposits to be growing similarly to the loan side at 4%. Tayfun mentioned our focus is really improving the share of wallet that we get on the commercial side of the aisle because historically, retail, as you know, has been a very strong provider of deposits and funding for the company over the years. So, our focus is getting commercial up to those levels.","So, we would expect commercial to outperform those numbers, and then on the retail side, to be a little bit less than that 4% number, in part because we\u2019re intentionally running down our CD portfolio and repricing a lot of those higher-cost CDs around 2% or so, right now, repricing them down in the 1.25% range. So, we are driving those deposits out the door, which results in a little bit lower retail deposit growth number. However, you see that benefit show up in our deposit costs, both in the fourth quarter, as well as a big support to what we expect in the first and the second quarter of the year.","Ken Usdin","Got it, Okay. And maybe as a follow-up, on the first quarter outlook, you talk about down 2%, but you did indicate that you expect the core NIM to be up and loan stable. So, can you help us flush out what the other deltas would be in terms of \u2013 you mentioned the seasonality of securities and some of the deposits. Like what else \u2013 it seems like that there wouldn't be so much of a drag on fourth to first.","Jamie Leonard","Yes. From an NII dollars perspective, the fourth to the first is really driven by day count of $10 million, then higher wholesale funding costs and the impact of seasonal runoff in DDAs. That's about $5 million. And then the investment portfolio, we expect to be down about $10 million from the elevated fourth quarter levels. ","The fourth quarter levels include a lot of the year-end one-time mutual fund dividend amounts, and that was $6 million. And so, the other portion of the investment portfolio reduction is that we did not reinvest cash flows in the fourth quarter. And as Tayfun mentioned, given where rates are right now, we don't expect to reinvest all of our portfolio cash flows in the first quarter.","So, we'll be opportunistic. If things change, we certainly have the capacity to reinvest, but right now, we're running the portfolio at about 21% of total assets. And that's \u2013 will probably be in that 21% to 22% range over the course of the year.","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes. And maybe this is a good point for us also to add that for the year, our NII guidance for the year basically assumes a fairly flat, even maybe a slightly down average portfolio balance. So, for those of you who are modeling investment portfolio numbers for 2020, our decisions on the investment portfolio tend to be very opportunistic, but for now, as we sit here at the beginning of the year, we're not anticipating an increase to investment portfolio balances. If we do see opportunities, if the environment changes, that clearly will have an impact on the actual performance when we get to the end of the year.","Ken Usdin","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI.","John Pancari","Good morning. On the CECL front, if you could help us think about how provision on a day-two basis could shape up in terms of either on a quarterly basis as we go into 2020 or how we could think about it on a full year basis on how it's impacted by the adoption? Thanks.","Tayfun Tuzun","Sure. Yes, I think the progress in our reserves and the impact on the provision number is probably very similar to others, except for when you look at what's driving the higher reserve rates, it really is the longer dated loans and some of the consumer credit outstandings. We, as you know, have been very clear on our expectations with respect to the residential mortgage portfolio.","We do not intend to grow that portfolio, not necessarily because of CECL, but just because in the current interest rate environment, I don't think that we're getting paid to grow that. And home equities have been declining. That's another portfolio that has a relatively large increase in \u2013 under CECL compared to the incurred methodology. So, those two portfolios should not contribute much in terms of increases in reserve coverage.","The one portfolio that we continue to grow is auto. Now, auto CECL is also higher than auto incurred loss. So, that should have a slight sort of increase, but if we continue to grow our commercial book, as we have done so in the past, that's our biggest book, and we will continue to grow that. I suspect that our coverage ratio ultimately will not change much from where we are standing, but we're all going to have to wait and see how this plays out.","It is without having not even a quarter under our belt, it is very difficult to establish good, reliable trends, given the impact of these various macroeconomic scenarios that we will be applying.","John Pancari","Got it. Okay. Thanks Tayfun. And then, separately on the MB side, just wanted to see if you can give us an update on banker retention. I know there was some concerns about that a few months back on some headlines that everything you had indicated that you're retaining a majority of your targeted employees as part of the deal. You mentioned that last quarter. Just want to get an update on that front and how that's been progressing? Thanks.","Greg Carmichael","Hi, John. Thanks for the question. This is Greg. First of all, we feel really good about the talent that we have in the Chicago market, as evidenced by the strong production numbers that we're seeing from Chicago. As you would expect, we have a target of $255 million of expense reduction. So, a lot of that reduction shows up in the form of individuals to late expenses and so forth that did not have jobs offered to them. So, a lot of attrition, you would expect to see that.","I would tell you in general, 80 plus percent individuals we offer positions to or with the company remain. We feel really good about that. And our ability to hit our expense targets that we modeled in this attrition is exactly where we'd expect it to be. So, there's no surprises here. We've also taken a best-of-breed approach. So, when you think about leadership in that market, alright, and as far as a CEO, we've retained the best of breed we thought to run that company. There's redundancy. There's optimization that's going to occur. You would expect certain individuals to look for other opportunities as we modeled in.","So, it's very much in line with what we expected. There was no surprises here. And we'll achieve the objectives we've mentioned, but more importantly, the outcomes in Chicago, when you look at our retail franchise, our wealth business and our strong, strong core middle market production, we're really excited about what we're seeing there, and also the revenue synergies as they start to come together as we integrate that business into the rest of our business, whether it be asset-based lending, leasing, capital markets, into the old MB book, we feel really good about what we're seeing there. And we're very bullish on the ability to accomplish our objectives that we set forth in that market, but there\u2019s no surprises here.","John Pancari","Got it. Thanks Greg. Appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken Zerbe","Great, thanks. And just in terms of corporate banking, obviously, you've had really good success over the last couple of years with that business. And I know your fee growth is obviously higher for 2020 in general, but could you just talk specifically about corporate banking in terms of what you're expecting from that line? Is that \u2013 like how far forward can we continue to expect sort of those double-digit gains? I'm just trying to understand what's sort of transitory versus more of a sustainable growth rate.?","Greg Carmichael","Ken, I'll add to this and then I'll turn it over to Lars for a little more color on this. First off, when you go back and think about our North Star commitments, a lot of those investments were in corporate banking, capital markets area. And those investments we said will start to materialize from a revenue perspective in 2019, you're seeing that. Strength in 2018, continued strength in 2019. We continue to invest in that area because once again, it provides the products and services we need to better support our clients. And we\u2019ve a great team assembled and we continue to make great progress in that area. So, we would expect that performance to continue on as we look into 2020 and beyond. So, Lars, let me give you the [that].","Lars Anderson","Yes, Ken, we're really pleased with how the North Star investments foundation have really played out. We shared with you in particular the re-platforming of our FRM business. We're already seeing the benefits of that. You can actually see that in our foreign exchange performance this quarter. FRM business is really coming back. It's strong, but in addition to that, a real focus on our advisory model, our relationship banking model and aligning our businesses to both our middle market focus as a company, as well as our industry verticals to be an advisor, a consultant, which that meant that we really needed to go after the investment banking piece of capital markets, and that is paying big, big dividends for us today.","So, an example of that would be Coker Capital that we acquired, and that perfectly aligns with our advisory approach to the healthcare industry. Most recently, you saw the fact that we recruited 12 investment bankers in San Francisco. It aligns with our renewables and solar business. So that's the theme here is to continue to build out a broad platform to serve the industries, geographies, and segments that we plan to win in.","Now look, we may not be able to control the ultimate loan growth quarter-to-quarter or year-to-year because there are macroeconomic impacts on that, but one thing we can do is, bring them advice, solutions, and those are often tied toward our fee products and services. And you're seeing that come through in our corporate banking success. I'm really proud of the talent that we have.","Ken Zerbe","Alright. That's great. And then, just maybe one follow-up question for Tayfun. You mentioned that you have higher regulatory expenses related to the charter change in 2020 as part of that 1% extra expense growth next year. Is there any seasonality related to that? I'm trying to figure out what's \u2013 again, what sort of unusual first half kind of driven expenses versus this just permanently increases your expense base. Thanks.","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes, there is no \u2013 Ken, there is about $11 million, $12 million just the direct fee that we pay to the OCC. It's just \u2013 that's the marginal increase in direct costs, but there is no seasonality.","Ken Zerbe","And it's just an ongoing expense going forward?","Tayfun Tuzun","That's correct. The change is a unique change year-over-year, but it will be in our expense rate going forward.","Ken Zerbe","Perfect. Alright, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.","Erika Najarian","Hi, good morning. I just wanted to reiterate maybe the point that you made earlier. If the NII or the non-interest income revenue outlook fell short, there is room to pull the expense lever and potentially we do better than the 2% to 3% range to achieve positive operating leverage for 2020?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes, so we clearly \u2013 we have always intended to \u2013 in the past number of years to achieve it. We achieved it every year. And we continue to keep the same target. And when you look at the contents of the remaining expenses beyond that 1% sort of unique change, Erika, clearly our largest expense is in compensation. And there is an underlying inflation built into that, and that consumes over 0.5 point of that expense increase. And in addition, there is also another 0.5 point or so in expense increase related directly to revenue growth. So, if the revenues sort of tend to come in slower than we expect, we believe that it will be reflected on expense growth as well. And then, we're going to have to make some choices as to where to invest and where not to invest to wait out a slower revenue growth environment.","Erika Najarian","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Good morning. I was wondering if you could talk a bit about just commercial borrower sentiment. You did mention that the payoffs were quite high in 4Q and had a somewhat muted outlook for commercial lending. I think it was the first quarter, but it seems like maybe commercial and corporate sentiment is improving. Maybe it's just literally the last few weeks here, but that's one of the themes that we've been hearing from some other banks and maybe some of the things in the credit markets point to that as well. So, are you seeing some early signs of that? Or is it a little bit of a different customer base for you guys than maybe we're seeing elsewhere?","Lars Anderson","Yes, Matt. So, first of all, just to address the first quarter, there's seasonality issues in that. So, I would really be looking to Tayfun's guidance for the year. That's what we're focused on is executing in 2020. There has been a heightened sense of caution as we have moved through the second half of 2019 with some of the global tensions, tariffs, those kinds of things, but some of the resolution of that, we're beginning to hear some positive things. We're seeing some activity levels that are reflected in the pipelines, not just from a lending, but also from a fee solutions perspective. That is giving me a little bit more confidence as we look at 2020 and a potential pickup in activity levels there.","So, frankly, I'm not looking at 2020 with a lot of concern. I feel like that we can go out there and execute, given where we have positioned our resources in the Southeast in middle market banking, in industry verticals, but in summary, there is still a sense of caution, but I would describe it as positively migrating. As you see, a number of things start to play out in the global marketplace and with some of the trade tariff activities recently completed.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Okay, that's helpful. And then, just separately, you reiterated sort of your interest in additional fee deals. You've talked about this in the past. Just remind us kind of which areas you\u2019re mostly looking to complement, and are they sizable enough that you kind of pull back a little bit of your capital versus your target? Or they're just not going to be meaningful enough to really impact the kind of capital and buyback story? Thank you.","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes. The capital decisions are independent from that, Matt, because they \u2013 the timing of these availabilities are random. We have in the past \u2013 we're very clear. Lars mentioned the confidence that we have in our advisory businesses, in commercial. We clearly, if we come across opportunities to even grow our advisory M&A services etc., we will be looking for those. Long time ago, we started talking about potentially adding more capital markets capabilities in commercial real estate. As they may become available, we will be focusing on those.","We have invested in our asset management business. There are opportunities that are financially feasible and rewarding. We will be looking at those. So, it is going to be more business commercial-oriented fee-oriented opportunities, but at this point, what we do with the capital that we have is somewhat independent of the opportunities. If we see the opportunities, we will execute them regardless of whether we're sitting on $0.5 billion of capital or not.","Matt O\u2019Connor","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.","Saul Martinez","Hi, good morning, guys. First, I wanted to clarify a couple of points on credit. First, you obviously \u2013 on the commercial side, you obviously mentioned the specific allowances for two commercial credits. You also had a big increase in NPL formation in commercial, I think $165 million, on Page 21. I think, Frank, you mentioned that was also related to the \u2013 those two specific credits. I just wanted to confirm that was the case. And also, on CECL, Tayfun, just again a clarification. And I have to sharpen my pencil on this, but I think your allowance takes your ACL ratio to like 160 bps, 170 bps. I guess what you're saying is that obviously, there is volatility, there's more things driving quarterly provision, but your best guess at this point would be that it sort of stays in that range and we should be modeling provisions with charge-offs and growth. Is that sort of the right way to think about it? So, a couple of questions with more a clarification question on...","Tayfun Tuzun","I'll take the CECL one and then I'll turn it over to Frank. I think your numbers are right in the ballpark, Saul. And yes, sitting here looking at the balance sheet progress, without necessarily having a perfect knowledge of macro scenarios, I can only assume that it's probably going to stay around those levels, but obviously, after a couple of quarters under our belt, we will be able to give you a more precise answer on this one. Frank, on the credit side?","Frank Forrest","Yes, on the $165 million, your question was is it inclusive of the $50 million. And the answer is, yes, it was. And just as a reminder, in the workout business, things are lumpy. It's \u2013 you don't package things up in any package and you have even inflows and outflows. We want to \u2013 we analyze inflows every quarter in detail and look to see if there's any particular trends that are bothersome to us.","So, we didn't see anything there in particular that's spread out. I will say the flip side of that is, we had a really strong quarter on collections. So, our net at the end of the day was $50 million, which I think about as sort of those two credits that were there before. So, that's the story there. And again, it doesn't \u2013 I don't think portend anything different in our outlook for 2020. We feel very good about 2020 based on where we sit today.","Saul Martinez","Great. That's really helpful. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Christopher Marinac with Janney Montgomery.","Christopher Marinac","Hi, good morning. I just wanted to follow up on Tayfun's comment early in the call about the accelerated paydowns of leveraged loans in other commercial. Is that attrition going to continue do you think? Or would you look to replace those loans this year?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes. Our intent is not necessarily to grow the leveraged portfolio to make up for the faster payoffs. We will make loan decisions independent of the payouts, but Lars, any comments on that?","Lars Anderson","Yes. No, so actually going back to a previous question, just so that you understand, the build that you see, and we have seen both in middle market and corporate banking, increasing volumes of loan production throughout the year, and that is really encouraging, which I had mentioned about 2020, some of my optimism.","On the flip side, and part of the muted impact in the ultimate balance sheet, a softness in the industry that we're seeing has been in paydowns, elevated paydowns. However, the complexion of that changed in the fourth quarter. In the fourth quarter, rather than just deleveraging of some of our portfolio, what we saw with the two biggest drivers was number one, higher risk assets in the leveraged lending portfolio where we actually saw a decline there. And that's a positive thing.","It's strengthening our balance sheet. And it's not that we will not extend credit into the leveraged lending market, but we're being very disciplined and selective in that market. The second piece of it goes back to what Frank said earlier. We saw pretty significant paydowns in our construction lending line of business, which I shared previously in prior calls that we expected that that would begin to occur. This was a sign of a healthy commercial real estate portfolio late in the cycle. So, maybe a little bit more than you asked, but to kind of frame it, we do not see that leverage lending will be a growth area for us for a period of time this late in the cycle.","Christopher Marinac","Great Lars. That's really helpful background. Thank you both for the comments.","Operator","Thank you. Your final question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.","Scott Siefers","Hi, guys, Thanks for taking the follow-up. I just wanted to ask on your GreenSky relationship. I know you guys had renewed that relationship. Just at a top level, any changes to how you're thinking about appetites for those types of credits? And then, I guess more specifically, were there any changes in the terms as a result of that renewal?","Tayfun Tuzun","I can't necessary \u2013 yes, we renewed the relationship, and we renewed the relationship of having had the experience with GreenSky over the past couple of years and having seen a fairly stable credit performance. Having said that, we believe that the renewal actually benefits us the way it was done, the way it was structured from a credit support perspective, as well as pricing perspective. That's all I'm going to comment, given the fact that they're the counterparty to the agreement, but we feel pretty good as to where we ended during the renewal discussion.","Scott Siefers","Alright. That sounds great. Thank you.","Tayfun Tuzun","Okay.","Chris Doll","Well, there is no further questions. Thank you all for your interest in Fifth Third Bank.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you.","Sameer Gokhale, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Sameer Gokhale","Thank you, Melissa. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. Today, we'll be discussing our financial results for the third quarter of 2017. This discussion may contain certain forward-looking statements about Fifth Third pertaining to our financial condition, results of operations, plans and objectives. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from historical performance and these statements.","We've identified some of these factors in our forward-looking cautionary statement at the end of our earnings release and in other materials, and we encourage you to review them. Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call.","Additionally, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures we reference during today's conference call are included in our earnings release along with other information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures. A copy of our most recent quarterly earnings release can be accessed by the public in the Investor Relations section of our corporate Web site, www.53.com.","This morning, I'm joined on the call by our President and CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Chief Operating Officer, Lars Anderson; Head of Commercial Bank, Richard Stein; and Treasurer, Jamie Leonard. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Tayfun, we will open the call up for questions.","Let me turn the call over now to Greg for his comments.","Greg Carmichael","Thanks, Sameer, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. As you\u2019ll see in our results, we reported third quarter 2017 net income available to common shareholders of $999 million and EPS of $1.35. Our reported EPS included a net benefit of $0.87 from a few significant items including our August Vantiv share sale.","Our results for the quarter were strong, reflect the progress we continue to make for our long-term financial targets by strengthening our balance sheet, building profitable relationships and returning excess capital to our shareholders.","Before discussing highlights of the quarter, I\u2019d like to make a few observations about the broader macroeconomic environment. Our commercial clients remain cautiously optimistic about their business expansion opportunities. Consumer confidence, consumer spending and the overall labor markets continue to be strong.","But our customers like to gain more clarity to the direction of the U.S. economy. Although U.S. GDP growth picked up in the second quarter, it is unclear where this acceleration will continue. The Fed currently forecast U.S. GDP growth of approximately 2% for 2018, which is still relatively tepid. Many of our clients also continue to take a wait-and-see approach for cash reform and other administration\u2019s public pro-growth policies.","Additionally, this is one of the longest periods of economic expansion for the U.S. Fiscal stimulus may help extend this expansion but is unclear how much faster the economy will growth from the current run rate given the length of this cycle.","Lastly, the Fed\u2019s decision to reduce the size of its balance sheet could put some pressure on market liquidity in interest rates. While some of the economic indicators are positive, there is still uncertainty about how much faster the economy can grow given the factors I just mentioned.","Our results continue to demonstrate that we are making progress towards our financial targets that I laid out over a year ago with project North Star. In Q3, we benefitted from revenue growth, effective expense management and an improvement in our credit metrics.","Our asset-sensitive balance sheet allows us to continue to grow net interest income resulting from increased short-term interest rates and higher growth \u2013 growth in higher yielding loans. Although loan demand remains relatively weak, we grew period end loans inclusive of the impact of our strategic exits.","Our commercial loan production for relationship manager is up 14% this year on top of an 18% improvement last year with fees per relationship manager up 8% year-over-year. Our net interest margin expanded 6 basis points sequentially exceeding our previous guidance. This reflected a benefit of higher rates and a shift into higher yielding consumer loans.","We also maintained our commercial loan pricing discipline which helped our overall net interest margin. Our total average loan portfolio was relatively flat sequentially. This reflected the impact of deliberate commercial exits as well as a continued decline in direct and home equity loan balances.","In our commercial business, we announced at the beginning of the year that we plan to exit about $1.5 billion of commercial loans this year which will impact our net loan growth. For the first three quarters of 2017, we have exited $1.3 billion of loans. Excluding deliberate exits, our average commercial portfolio grew 1% sequentially and 3% year-over-year.","As we have stated previously, we continue to expect that the commercial loan authorization efforts will be completed by the end of this year. In the consumer portfolio, excluding auto loans, average consumer balances were 3% year-over-year.","During the third quarter, we continued to manage our expenses diligently while investing in areas of strategic importance. For example, we increased our direct marketing spend reflecting improved analytical capabilities to grow households through more targeted mailings. The results of these campaigns have been very positive with an internal rate of return two times higher than previous campaigns.","Our expenses also continue to reflect IT spending necessary to better serve our customers, investment infrastructure upgrades and enhance our cyber security measures. Despite these as well as other strategic investments, Q3 noninterest expenses were flat year-over-year. We continue to expect full year 2017 expenses to be flat compared to 2016.","We continue to manage credit risk effectively and nonperforming loans and nonperforming assets decreased substantially during the quarter. Our NPA ratio was at the lowest level since 2006. Our criticized asset ratio remains stable during the quarter of 5.5% with our classified assets at the lowest level in over 10 years.","Our net charge-off ratio continues to remain at historically low levels. Although credit quality remains strong, we expect some upward pressure on provisioning from select loan growth. This again assumes that the economy remains relatively stable. Any weakness in the economy would clearly have an impact on credit losses.","Our capital and liquidity levels remain very strong with our common equity Tier 1 ratio at 10.6% while our LCR exceeded regulatory requirements by over 20%. Our strong capital position allowed us to both increase our dividend to 14% and to invest nearly $1 billion in share repurchases during the quarter. We have increased our dividend 23% since the third quarter of 2016.","We\u2019re also making progress on our North Star initiatives. In December, during our Investor Day in New York, we plan to provide you a detailed update on our progress. As I\u2019ve stated before, we are accelerating the pace at which we are introducing new and better products, services and experiences.","We are focused on implementing the best solutions to solve customer problems as quickly as possible. To that end, we are embracing select acquisitions with think-tank partnerships to fuel growth. We\u2019re also leveraging in-house innovation. We recently opened an innovation and capability center at the company\u2019s headquarter to help foster this culture of innovation.","One particular area of focus for us relates to our Millennial Research Project. Although we aren\u2019t ignoring other generations, we recognize the tremendous long-term opportunity with what is already the largest generational segment in the U.S. today. The first millennial idea activated out of our innovation incubator was our app called Momentum. Millennial see student loan debt as one of our biggest drags on their financial well being and they want to pay down that debt as soon as possible.","Through our app, customers are automatically rounding up their transactions to help pay off their student loan balances. In the first 30 days since we launched Momentum at the end of August, the app was downloaded 10,000 times and the early results are very promising. We will continue to rollout additional millennial-focused solutions in the future.","We\u2019re also leveraging innovation with new geographical science capabilities. We have developed specialized technology in the analytics to more accurately assess our branch network and staffing allocation and refine sales goals. We also recently announced additional strategic relationships acquisitions in equity investments. This follows several other agreements we have discussed with you throughout the first part of the year.","Our recent acquisition of Epic Insurance Solutions and Integrity HR enables us to enhance our insurance capabilities and HR consulting services. We expect this acquisition to provide value-added products and services to help clients with their most pressing financial and risk management challenges. The acquisition complements our R.G. McGraw Insurance acquisition early in the year to further build on our modest of expanding insurance capabilities.","Our strategic relationship and equity investment in NRT and Sightline, the largest pure play casino payment technology company in the world enables us to provide a comprehensive suite of treasury management and payment solutions to our entertainment, lodging and leisure vertical.","We also recently announced a strategic relationship with AvidXchange and Mastercard to bring best-in-class automated accounts payable solutions to our customers. We are proud to be the first bank on the forefront of revolutionizing commercial payments by joining Mastercard\u2019s B2B Hub. This Hub provides an end-to-end automated platform that converts payable processes traditionally done by paper into an electronic transaction. We expect that over time these solutions will result in increased insurance, HR consulting and payment solutions fee revenue.","We are very focused on improving the customer experience. Our objective is to provide appropriately tiered solutions and to be a trusted advisor to our customers into every aspect of their financial life. Our efforts are bearing fruit in addition to being ranked in the top three across the industry by two independent surveys for overall customer satisfaction earlier this year. We were just named the 2017 Javelin Online Banking leader in two categories, including recognition for our customer service and for customers\u2019 ability to move money easily and securely with confidence.","We\u2019re also aligning resources to further improve the client experience in our payments business. We recently announced the addition of Jed Scala to head our Payments and Commerce Solutions division. Jed has over two decades of experience in financial services. He joined us from American Express where he most recently led the U.S. Consumer Lending business. We are fortunate to have Jed as part of the Fifth Third team.","Today\u2019s reality is that our competition is no longer the bank across the street but the customers\u2019 last best experience. The bar is continuously rising to deliver a world-class customer experience in the branch, on the phone, on the Web and on our highly rated mobile applications. While we are developing new client facing solutions, we also know that data security is just as important.","Especially given the recent cyber attacks in the news, we continue to be proactive with ways to future enhance our cyber security controls. Although systems and controls are critically necessary to prevent attacks, I firmly believe that each of our nearly 18,000 employees are the key to defending the bank and our customers\u2019 data from the ongoing risk we face.","I\u2019d like to once again thank our employees for their hard work and dedication which is evident in our financial results, our customer satisfaction scores and our community outreach efforts. I was pleased that we were again able to deliver strong financial results and our North Star initiatives remain on track. We plan to share more information about this at our Investor Day in December.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Tayfun to discuss our third quarter results and our current outlook for the remainder of the year.","Tayfun Tuzun","Thanks, Greg. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Let\u2019s move to the financial summary on Slide 4 of the presentation. As Greg mentioned, during the quarter our NIM expansion, continued focus on disciplined expense management, stable credit quality and efficient capital management, all reflected our commitment to driving improved financial performance and shareholder returns.","Relative to last year\u2019s third quarter, our net interest margin was up 19 basis points, NII was up 7%, noninterest expenses were flat and total net charge-offs were 36% lower, so core revenues were 3% higher. These positive results were accompanied by a 42 basis point increase in our common equity Tier 1 ratio and a 7% reduction in shares outstanding.","Although some of our balance sheet decisions had a negative impact on loan growth over the past year, the benefits of these strategic actions are apparent in our financial results and will continue to have a positive impact on shareholder returns in coming years.","Reported results were materially impacted by our Vantiv share sale during the quarter which boosted pre-tax income by over $1 billion. We also recognized a $47 million charge as a reduction to noninterest income associated with the Visa swap. The charge is attributable to litigation developments during the quarter and to the increase in Visa share price.","Pre-provision net revenue adjusted for items disclosed in our presentation increased 2% sequentially and 6% year-over-year. Our focus on prudent expense management enabled us to drive positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis. We expect to achieve positive operating leverage again next quarter and for the full year of 2017.","The environment continues to be challenging in commercial lending, whether it is the uncertainty related to tax policy and its impact on capital investments or the ongoing back and forth related to healthcare legislation and its impact on the healthcare sector, these uncertainties are understandably keeping a lot of clients on the sidelines. The lack of clarity on these important topics has also slowed M&A activity overall.","Having said that I think we actually did a very good job navigating through these challenges this quarter in our commercial business. Average loans were flat sequentially. Growth in commercial real estate, residential mortgages and other consumer loans was mostly offset by the reduction in certain C&I exposures that did not meet risk return hurdles as well as the planned decline in our indirect auto loan portfolio.","Average commercial loan balances were flat sequentially and down 2% year-over-year including the impact of our planned exits. Excluding the impact of these exits, average commercial loans were up 1% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. Approximately 60% of the exits were credit based and the remainder consisted of return-based exits.","We have seen a strong pick up in our regional production, especially in our larger markets in Cincinnati, Chicago and Indiana. Production coupons were stable. The sequential decline in average C&I balances was partially offset by 2% growth in commercial real estate loans this quarter, most of it in construction.","The growth in construction loans was mainly driven by embedded funding from existing construction loans. We continue to maintain a conservative risk profile in construction lending as we are in the later stages of the cycle. Certain segments such as hospitality and urban luxury multifamily are losing their attractiveness while others like self-storage and industrial segments are more appealing.","Expanding new production spreads, combined with the move in LIBOR resulted in a 22 basis point yield improvement in that portfolio. At this time, we have roughly another $200 million of commercial exits to go for the fourth quarter of 2017. We are expecting modest growth in the commercial portfolio during the fourth quarter, which will reflect the impact of these exits.","We remain competitive in all of our markets and are maintaining our focus on growing profitable and doable relationships. Commercial loan production across the board has been steady. To further boost loan growth, we are expanding our commercial sales force. We also continue to assess additional geographic expansion within middle market lending which should provide future loan or revenue growth opportunities.","Including the planned decline in the indirect auto loan portfolio, average consumer loans were flat sequentially and down 1% year-over-year. Excluding auto, average consumer loans were up 3% year-over-year. Auto loans were down 12% year-over-year reflecting the ongoing impact of our decision to curtail indirect originations and redeploy capital. Returns to this business have improved with the high single digits from the mid single digits earlier in the year. Our pace of origination activity will depend on how much returns continue to improve.","Residential mortgage loans grew by 1% sequentially and 7% year-over-year as we continue to retain jumbo mortgages, ARMs, as well as certain 10 and 15-year fixed rate mortgages on our balance sheet during the quarter. Our home equity loan originations were 2% lower sequentially and up 6% year-over-year. As loan pay-downs in our legacy book continued to exceed origination volumes, our portfolio decreased 2% sequentially and 9% year-over-year.","Our credit card portfolio increased 3% from the second quarter. Purchase active accounts were up both sequentially and year-over-year reflecting stronger growth from new card rollout at the end of last year. We expect our simplified and more competitive card offerings along with our enhanced analytical capabilities to drive faster growth in the fourth quarter and into 2018. We are expecting portfolio growth rate to accelerate closer to 5% in coming quarters.","Other consumer loans increased 18% sequentially. Growth was driven by our personal lending portfolio primarily through loans generated from our GreenSky partnership. We currently expect personal lending balances to grow to $2 billion by the fourth quarter of 2019 and were approximately $600 million at the end of third quarter 2017. Loan originations will remain focused on high-quality prime customers with GreenSky providing first loss coverage as we had discussed before.","Growth in personal loans should allow us to generate a higher ROE revenue stream and help us achieve a better balance between our commercial and consumer portfolios. Excluding indirect auto loan balances, we continue to expect low to mid-single digit growth in consumer and mortgage loans in the fourth quarter.","Our investment portfolio balances remained relatively stable in the third quarter as we had expected. We expect to continue to maintain our investment portfolio at roughly the same level in the fourth quarter. Average core deposits were down 1% sequentially. A sequential decline in commercial money market, consumer savings and consumer demand deposit accounts was partially offset by increases in commercial demand deposit accounts and consumer money market balances.","Deposit markets are competitive and international banks in particular are competing aggressively for deposits. We feel good about our deposit balances as we continue to make rational decisions between pricing them appropriately for profitability and maintaining and growing relationship-based LCR-friendly deposits.","Improving marketing analytics drove an increase in new DDA account openings which were up 14% from last quarter and up 5% from last year. Our modified liquidity coverage ratio continued to be very strong at 124% at the end of the quarter.","Taxable equivalent net interest income of $977 million was up $32 million or 3% from the previous quarter\u2019s NII and is up $64 million or 7% from last year. Our strong NII performance primarily reflects the positive impact of higher short-term rates.","Growth in NII came from both the consumer and commercial portfolios. The increase in the NII reflected higher interest rates, a funding benefit from the temporary influx of cash related to the Vantiv sale and a modest benefit from interest payments on nonaccrual loans that paid off during the quarter.","The NIM increased 6 basis points from the second quarter to 3.07% exceeding our guidance. On a sequential basis, our total loan yield was up 14 basis points with commercial yield up 15 basis points. The NIM reflected a total benefit of 2 basis points from the temporary influx of cash and the interest payment on nonaccrual loans that I just mentioned.","Due to the temporary nature of these two items in the third quarter, the NIM in the fourth quarter should be a couple of basis points lower compared to the third quarter. Excluding the impact of these items, we expect the NIM to be stable quarter-over-quarter in Q4.","Overall, deposit pricing so far has remained relatively muted with cumulative beta since the end of 2015 when the Fed triggered the first rate hike in the sub-20% range on a blended basis. Consumer has been in the mid-teen range with commercial in the low 30s.","The incremental blended beta for the last move in June is in the low 30s and we project a data in the mid-40s for the next potential move in December. For subsequent rate hikes, we continue to expect deposit betas to be in the 50% range. If we see betas at low ranges, our margin could exceed our guidance.","We expect our fourth quarter net interest income to be similar to our third quarter NII. This includes the full quarter impact of an auto securitization executed near the end of the third quarter. The market remains competitive and our margin and NII outlook reflects current market dynamics.","Credit spreads continue to pressure margins across the banking sector, but the strategic actions we have taken during the last two years have led to redeployment of capital away from low-returning loans and is helping us achieve very stable NII and NIM performance. We would expect to maintain this relative stability even in the absence of future Fed rate increases in the coming quarters.","Excluding the impact of the Vantiv sale and Visa swap, noninterest income in the third quarter was $571 million compared to $573 million in the second quarter. Underlying noninterest income would have been up about 1% had we not reduced our ownership stake in Vantiv during the quarter had the sale reduced equity method earnings from our ownership stake.","The Vantiv transaction was clearly an important milestone in our very successful partnership with the company. Since the initial joint venture with our private equity partner in 2009, we recognized over $5 billion in pre-tax gains. After the sale, which generated an after-tax gain of $679 million, we owned 8.6% of the company. This will decrease the 4.9% of the new company once their acquisition of Worldpay closes.","The sale is figured roughly $650 million in future growth CRA cash flows under the current corporate tax regime. A 10% reduction in the marginal corporate tax rate would reduce this amount by about a third. Our remaining ownership is worth roughly $1 billion.","We expect to report an approximately $350 million pre-tax step-up gain upon the close of the Worldpay acquisition which will leave us with an unrealized pre-tax gain of roughly $0.5 billion at current market prices. We believe that this was a very good transaction for our shareholders. We will continue to benefit from utilizing the equity method of accounting going forward related to our ownership in a larger and now global company.","Moving on to other fee income categories, mortgage banking net revenue of $63 million was up $8 million sequentially. Originations of $2.1 billion was 6% lower than the second quarter, but our gain on sale margins improved to 228 basis points from 209 basis points in the third quarter. Volumes in our direct and retail channels dropped in September largely tied to the hurricane in Florida. Origination fees were up 8% sequentially.","During the quarter, two-thirds of our origination mix consisted of purchase volume. Approximately two-thirds of our originations continued to be sourced from the retail and direct channels and the remainder through the correspondent channel. In servicing so far this year, we have acquired MSRs tied to $10 billion of residential mortgage loans and will continue to assess opportunities in the future.","Corporate banking fees of $101 million were flat compared to the second quarter. Most of our individual line items were above the second quarter levels but were offset by lower lease residual gains which somewhat masked the underlying strength in our capital markets business. Although the market environment and low levels of client activity continued to challenge revenue growth in the FICC business, we saw double-digit growth in capital markets fees for the quarter.","Financial risk management, loans syndications, equity capital markets and M&A all showed growth sequentially and versus last year\u2019s third quarter. We\u2019ve also seen good quarter-over-quarter growth in corporate bond revenues. Capital markets fees will continue to exhibit some quarterly variability given the nature of the business. We currently expect corporate banking fees to increase 10% to 15% sequentially driven by deals in our pipeline that we expect to close by the end of the year.","Deposit service charges were relatively stable, down $1 million from the second quarter. Card and processing revenue was flat sequentially reflecting an increase in credit card spend volume offset by higher rewards costs. Total wealth and asset management revenue of 122 million was down 1% sequentially due to lower brokerage fees and specialty service fees, partially offset by higher personal asset management revenue.","Revenues increased 1% relative to the third quarter of 2016 mainly due to higher personal asset management revenues. Recurring revenues in this business have increased to 82% of fees from 78% in the third quarter of 2016 and 73% in the third quarter of 2015. We will continue to shift our product and service offerings towards more recurring revenues to limit our reliance on transactional activity.","For the fourth quarter, excluding mortgage banking, we expect adjusted fee income growth of approximately 10% with the potential to reach low teens from the third quarter. This outlook also includes Vantiv JV earnings adjusted for our reduced ownership. Recall that our fourth quarter noninterest income guidance incorporates the impact of our recurring annual TRA payment which is expected to be approximately $40 million.","Our fourth quarter fee guidance is strong with this recurring payment but the underlying trend is very healthy both to mid digits and operating fees. Despite some current environmental volatility and subdued low client activity, we are still optimistic about our fee growth trends in light of the investments that we are making to grow the scale and scope of our fee-producing products and services.","We remain focused on disciplined expense management while continuing to invest for future revenue growth. Noninterest expense was flat compared to the third quarter of 2016 and up 2% sequentially. We will focus on continuing to drive positive operating leverage while still making strategic investments that position us for long-term outperformance.","A good example of this is our investment in our direct marketing and analytical capabilities over the last year. These enhanced capabilities will help us generate future retail household growth to support both loan and deposit production.","Our investments in technology continue to support many revenue growth and cost saving opportunities across the company. We continue to target new opportunities to create value for our customers while investing to compete effectively with larger banks and non-bank competitors.","Similarly, as Greg mentioned, fraud protection and cyber security are in the top of our priority list. Bad actors are still very active and there is an ongoing need to upgrade our defenses both to protect our clients\u2019 information and to prevent fraud losses from increasing.","We continue to expect total expenses in 2017 to be flat relative to 2016 as we guided last quarter. Fourth quarter expenses are expected to be up about 1.5% from reported expenses in the third quarter.","Turning to credit results on Slide 9. We are very pleased with our third quarter credit results as gross charge-offs remain at a 17-year low. Our charge-off and nonperforming loan results fully reflect the impact of our recent Shared National Credit Review completed in the third quarter.","Net charge-offs were $68 million or 29 basis points, up 1 basis point from the second quarter of 2017 but down 16 basis points from last year. Commercial charge-offs of 21 basis points continued to be positively impacted by our decision to deliberately exit certain loans which no longer meet our desired risk parameters.","Commercial charge-offs are up 4 basis points from last quarter but down 22 basis points from last year. Consumer charge-offs of 43 basis points were down 3 basis points sequentially and down 6 basis points year-over-year led by lower charge-offs of residential mortgage and home equity loans.","Total portfolio nonperforming loans and leases were $506 million, down $108 million or 18% from the previous quarter and down 16% from last year resulting in a NPL ratio of 55 basis points. C&I NPLs were down 36% from last quarter. The largest concentration of nonperforming loans continues to be in energy which comprises roughly 30% of the balances.","Total NPAs were down 14% from last quarter and down 28% from last year. Nearly all loan categories showed a sequential improvement. At the end of the third quarter, the criticized assets ratio remains stable with the previous quarter at 5.5% of commercial loan and remains near a 10-plus-year low.","Our loss provision was up $15 million compared to the second quarter, largely due to a $12 million release in the prior quarter. The reserve ratio declined 3 basis points to 1.31%. This decline was primarily driven by a $20 million reserve reduction due to the deconsolidation of a variable interest entity.","Our reserve coverage over NPLs increased 238% from 200% last quarter. Our coverage of NPLs is at a multiyear high with the broader reserve coverage over NPAs at the highest point since the end of 2004.","While remain in a relatively stable credit environment, we continue to caution you that charge-offs are at near historic lows and that we could potentially experience some upward pressure in the future. Nevertheless, we continue to believe that our provision expense will be primarily a reflect of loan growth and some normalizing of credit losses.","Despite the highly competitive market with some banks relaxing underwriting standards, our top priority continues to be focusing on maintaining our disciplined client selection. Our capital levels remained very strong during the quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.6% reflecting a decrease of 4 basis points quarter-over-quarter but an increase of 42 basis points year-over-year.","The sequential decline reflects the $990 million share buyback initiated during the quarter which included the after-tax gains from the Vantiv sale and a declaration of our $0.16 dividend which was a 14% increase from the prior quarter. Our tangible common equity ratio, excluding unrealized gains and losses, decreased 13 basis points sequentially or increased 11 basis points year-over-year.","At the end of the third quarter, common shares outstanding were down 33 million shares or 5% compared to the second quarter of 2017 and down 50 million shares or 7% compared to last year\u2019s third quarter. Book value and tangible book value were both up 4% from last quarter.","Effective capital management is a very important component of our overall strategic approach. We will always be very prudent with the amount of capital that we keep on our balance sheet to support the current and future risk profile of our company and aim to maximize the long-term return on that capital in alternative environments.","With the lessons learnt from the financial crisis, we will remain focused on long-term shareholder value. At the same time, we do not intend to keep more capital than we need and will look to return it back to our shareholders prudently.","With respect to taxes, our third quarter rate was impacted by the partial sale of our Vantiv stake and a specific Vantiv tax item noted on Page 1 of the release. Our tax rate for the third quarter was 31.9%, but excluding the Vantiv sale, our tax rate would have been 25.8%. A large gain reported in the third quarter also impacts our tax rate for the last quarter of the year.","We expect our fourth quarter tax rate to be slightly elevated from the normal levels to around roughly 29% to 30%. Excluding this impact, we would have projected the fourth quarter tax rate to be in the 25% to 26% range. This would result in a full year 2017 tax rate in the 28.5% to 29.5% range.","Our revenue growth outlook, our ability to achieve positive operating leverage without changing our risk appetite, our strong balance sheet and our strategic positioning give us confidence in our ability to create additional shareholder value.","As Greg mentioned in this remarks, we will be hosting our first-ever Investor Day on December 7 in New York. Our executive team will share additional details about their businesses and the progress we are making towards our strategic objectives.","With that, let me turn it over to Sameer to open the call up for Q&A.","Sameer Gokhale","Thanks, Tayfun. Before we start Q&A, as a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. We will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have this morning. During the question-and-answer period, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator. Melissa, please open the call up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Ken Usdin","Thanks very much, guys. I actually wanted to ask on your comments about the NII trajectory. You said, Tayfun, that the fourth quarter should be kind of flattish and then you\u2019d expect to be able to keep that flattish, ex-rates. Was that what you said? So could you just walk us through kind of how you\u2019re expecting to grow NII? What are the drivers of future NII, ex-rates? And then the follow on would just be what incremental rates due from here? Thanks.","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes, the reason why I provided that color, Ken, is there\u2019s a lot of interest obviously from the investor community to understand NII dynamics in the absence of rates. So what we are projecting is even if the Fed does not have any rate increases left, we do believe that we will be able to maintain a stable NIM and NII. And obviously loan growth with a stable NIM, loan growth will be the factor that influences NII. We clearly still expect widening NIM and growth in NII resulting solely from Fed\u2019s rate increases, but even in the absence we\u2019re not seeing an erosion in our expected numbers.","Ken Usdin","Okay. And then just a follow up on the loan point then. At what point do you expect to be kind of clear of incremental either C&I exits or get to a comfort point with some of the portfolios that you\u2019ve been slowing the growth? So I guess at what point do we get kind of a better base to kind of start to grow back off of?","Greg Carmichael","Ken, this is Greg. What we\u2019ve communicated is by the end of this year this optimization program is over and there\u2019s more business as usual. So we talked about 5 billion for the last couple of years, 1.5 billion of that this year. We\u2019re pretty much through that, a little bit left in the fourth quarter and then we\u2019re done with the optimization efforts. So you could expect us going forward of a more stable base.","Tayfun Tuzun","The one color that I would add to that is Greg\u2019s comments relate to the commercial loans but we will see continued reduction in auto loans because our originations will still continue to be under our long-term trends. But we expect obviously with added consumer loans in other line items to make up for that reduction in auto loan outstanding.","Ken Usdin","Got it. Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Your next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Geoffrey Elliott","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. On the noninterest income, I know there are a couple of details you called out around lease residual gains and so on. But if you look at the year-on-year comparison; service charges down 3% year-on-year, corporate banking revenues down 9% year-on-year, wealth is up 1%. It doesn\u2019t feel like there\u2019s a lot of growth there. Can you maybe give us a kind of update on the initiatives you\u2019ve been running to grow fees, where you feel like things are working, where you feel like there\u2019s more to do? And then some thoughts on how we should look at noninterest income going forward, what you can do to get growth back into positive territory again?","Tayfun Tuzun","Great. Thanks, Geoffrey. I\u2019m going to make some general comments and I\u2019m going to turn it over to Lars for his perspectives as well. So in general, clearly a number of our initiatives going forward are focused on fee income generation. That includes payment processing. It includes mortgage banking. It includes capital markets. When you look at the year-over-year comparisons, you also need to keep in mind that especially in commercial related line items such as treasury management and such as capital markets, we are seeing some impact of the exits that Greg detailed over the last 24 months. So I think Lars is going to give you some color on the underlying strength on the commercial side. We are also as you know focusing on growth in wealth management through either acquisitions or expanded sales force. There\u2019s insurance acquisitions going on. So as we look forward, there are a number of line items that we would hope to discuss with you in December to support stronger fee growth. Lars, any sort of specific color?","Lars Anderson","Yes. So maybe speaking to corporate banking fees in particular, Geoffrey, a couple of things. As Tayfun had pointed out, that prior period comparison and what those prudent leasing gains as we actively manage that leasing portfolio is really an important part of that strategy. So you really do have to kind of look a little deeper into it. And I would tell you I business lending fees on a year-over-year basis were up about 2% and that\u2019s why we executed on our balance sheet optimization. So we continue to feel good about those business lending fees and the opportunity to accelerate those as we see the overall lending market grow. But in particular, corporate banking fees are \u2013 over 60% of that is capital markets. You know what is going on in the FICC kind of segment this year and the pressure there. But we continue to make investments in our FICC business in replatforming that business to enhance the client experience. That\u2019s going to be rolling out in the coming quarters. But despite that, we\u2019ve stayed very close to our client because we knew, as Fed tightening became closer, that we would see clients begin to take action on a linked quarter basis. Actually our FICC business was up 13%. Investment banking was up 22% on a linked quarter basis. Again, I\u2019ve shared with you that we\u2019ve continued to invest in our loan syndication, capital, our equity and corporate bond, underwriting capabilities, our M&A advisory very strong. That 22% gives us an 18% linked quarter growth overall in capital markets. So we\u2019re going to position ourselves with our clients to capture that. I think we\u2019ve got the right products for the right lines of business and in both our industry verticals and core middle market to continue to accelerate that in the future, albeit that this is a variable area of our noninterest income and the overall economic environment will influence it.","Geoffrey Elliott","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Scott Siefers from Sandler O\u2019Neill + Partners. Your line is open.","Scott Siefers","Good morning, guys. I was just curious on the expense base, just trying to figure out sort of the puts and takes in that you look at sort of year-over-year the expense growth has certainly been pretty well controlled but it looks like they\u2019re going to be up in the fourth quarter and we will be up a couple of percent from when you first announced the North Star initiative. So I guess I\u2019m just wondering given how large North Star is just in terms of dollars, would there be a point where we would see absolute declines in the cost base or should we be thinking about it despite the sizable dollar values involved as sort of offsetting nature growth in the expense base?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes, I think so obviously I don\u2019t know how many quarters in a row now, but we have done better than we guided. We continue to focus both on headcount expenses as well as expenses in other line items. There is some increase into the fourth quarter somewhat seasonal in some of the operation areas given the pickup towards the end of the year, some increase in IT expenses related to the timing of the projects coming on line. Our goal is to clearly \u2013 first and foremost is to achieve positive operating leverage. The ability to lower expenses will depend upon the investments that are needed to boost our revenue growth opportunities. And we\u2019re not necessarily looking at expense management solely by itself but at how it relates to future growth opportunities. Having said that, it is clearly our goal to maintain a low level of expense growth in order to also achieve \u2013 make sure that we achieve operating leverage in this environment which continues to be challenging with respect to revenue growth opportunities. So the company is very focused. We will share more obviously about 2018 with you in December and in our upcoming fourth quarter earnings release in January.","Scott Siefers","Okay. Thank you. And then, Tayfun, I just want to make sure I understand the tax guidance correctly, the 29 to 30 in the fourth quarter. I think in your prepared comments, you kind of implied that\u2019s simply a fourth quarter event. That\u2019s just not the new run rate we should be thinking about in 2018?","Tayfun Tuzun","That is correct. It\u2019s simply a fourth quarter impact. And let me give you maybe a little bit more of a color there. As you can see on the first page of our earnings release, the after-tax impact \u2013 after-tax gain on Vantiv share is $679 million this quarter. If you include the fourth quarter impact on our tax rate, that ultimate resulting after-tax gain is going to be around $657 million, $658 million which is the marginal increase \u2013 which leads to the marginal increase in our tax rate. And that year-ending after-tax of $657 million, $658 million in Vantiv is very close to what we disclosed in September at Barclays Conference. So that\u2019s a one-time only tax rate increase that will not show up again in 2018.","Scott Siefers","Okay, perfect. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Saul Martinez from UBS. Your line is open.","Saul Martinez","Hi. Good morning, guys. A couple of questions. First, you mentioned that the exiting of commercial relationships has kind of run its course and presumably the runoff on the auto books starts to lessen a bit, albeit it\u2019s going to be there for a little bit. As we think about loan growth going forward beyond 2017, how do you think about how quickly you can grow and are there opportunities to gain share and how do you think about what could be sort of a more normalized level for loan growth being your different portfolios?","Lars Anderson","Good question. As we look forward to 2018, Tayfun has made some prior comments and we\u2019ll be sharing a little bit more about that in December at the Investor Conference. But we\u2019re looking obviously to grow our commercial portfolio at a rate that would be around nominal GDP plus. We obviously are very focused on moving market share. We\u2019re positioning our businesses to have the capabilities and the talent to frankly execute on that. We continue to build out our industry verticals, which has been a very successful strategy for us. We\u2019re also, as Greg mentioned earlier, we\u2019re focused on also expanding some of our middle market banking operations and markets in which we\u2019ve been operating in the past through verticals and corporate banking around the country. So I believe that with the things that we\u2019ve been investing in and our payments, treasury management, capital markets, we really do have an advantage as we head into the coming quarters. Obviously, the overall economic environment is going to have an impact on it. Our clients, we continue to hear from them. They are more optimistic today I would tell you than they were six months ago. However, there is still a lot of commerce that\u2019s on the sideline. It\u2019s very ready to go, but they need clarity and at that point I think that we can really accelerate the growth.","Greg Carmichael","The only thing I would add to Lars\u2019 comments on the consumer side, credit card has been an area of focus for the organization. You see the slight increase this quarter. We expect that to continue onto next year with the investments we\u2019ve made both in people and products in this space. In addition to that, unsecured lending is also another bright spot in our partnership with GreenSky, more originated there and the quality of that relationship, we\u2019re very pleased with. In addition to that, we expect to continue to grow consumer mortgages as we rollout our new platform that\u2019s rolling in at course [ph] already, but we\u2019ll roll in to our retail and direct channels later this year. So we feel confident that we can continue to grow roughly, as Lars said, on low GDP levels.","Saul Martinez","That\u2019s helpful. And if you can\u2019t kick-start loan growth and start to grow closer to nominal GDP plus, what does that mean for deposit cost pressure? Does it \u2013 your LTR moved up a little bit. You\u2019re at 90% plus. Obviously rates are moving up. How do you think about deposit betas in an environment where we do start to see a little bit more growth?","Jamie Leonard","This is Jamie. As Tayfun mentioned in his prepared remarks, betas have been pretty benign. We\u2019re at about 18% cycle to-date but we\u2019re certainly expecting betas to increase the June move during the quarter was at 20 beta, but we think it will be a 30 beta by the end of the year and a December move we\u2019re modeling in the mid-40 range. So we certainly expect competition to pick up as the Fed continues to hike rates. In terms of deposits, they were down sequentially about 900 million. There was some consumer seasonality softness combined with an ongoing trend on the commercial side that we saw in the second quarter that continued into the third quarter and that\u2019s really driven by a few factors. One, there are certain segments where liquidity is being deployed for working capital or other seasonal needs such as in CRE and pub funds. Also, we\u2019ve seen the large corporate customer base that currently has excess liquidity begin to seek alternative investment options or seek higher deposit rates and that\u2019s a phenomenon where we\u2019re keeping the customer but we lose those excess deposits, because we\u2019re unwilling to match those overly aggressive rates. I think one good data point back to your LCR comment; within our LCR calculation, our nonoperational deposit categories are where we have had the runoff. It\u2019s down about 1.6 billion whereas our operational deposits continue to increase and that\u2019s really as we look forward where we expect to be funding this loan growth in 2018 has continued improvement in the commercial deposit gathering space driven by strong TM client acquisition.","Tayfun Tuzun","Having said all of that, just keep in mind we\u2019re not giving 2018 guidance, we\u2019re not giving guidance on loan growth in 2018 at those levels. So I just want to caution you.","Saul Martinez","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Peter Winter from Wedbush. Your line is open.","Peter Winter","Good morning.","Greg Carmichael","Hi, Peter.","Peter Winter","I was wondering, can you just talk about some of the factors puts and takes that keeps the margin stable without a rate hike?","Tayfun Tuzun","The biggest impact, Peter, is the decision that we made two years ago to reallocate capital away from lower returning assets into higher returning assets, whether it\u2019s in autos or whether it\u2019s in C&I. The churn of that capital into higher returning assets is clearly a defense mechanism that has worked well for us. At the same time, we are also seeing very healthy and stable origination coupon. Now that doesn\u2019t mean necessarily that spreads are not under pressure and also the betas on deposits so far have fared below our expected levels. But in general overall as we guide for stable NII and stable NIM, this continued churn away from lower returning assets into higher returning assets whether it\u2019s from auto to secured, unsecured lending or within commercial to better relationships is helping us.","Peter Winter","Great. And just one quick follow up. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve said it but how much was the auto securitization at the end of the quarter and was there any gain from it in the third quarter?","Tayfun Tuzun","The auto securitization was on balance sheet it was $1 billion transaction where we held one of the tranches. So it provided 750 million of proceeds but simply was a funding mechanism, no gain or loss on that transaction.","Peter Winter","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ken Zerbe","Great. Thanks. Just had another follow-up question on the deposit side. I hear what you\u2019re saying but we still see the core deposits coming down. What\u2019s the launch from strategy there? Should your deposit beta be higher? Should you be paying up more to retain some of those deposits or even grow your operational deposits to fund balance sheet growth? I\u2019m just kind of trying to get a sense of how you \u2013 where you want deposit growth to be over the next, say, few quarters?","Jamie Leonard","Ken, it\u2019s Jamie. We definitely want deposit growth but we want it in the right categories. And if you look year-over-year, our commercial space we\u2019re down 2 billion in deposits and we\u2019re up 2 billion in the consumer side. And so we\u2019re definitely focused on growing our households and we\u2019ve been very successful in doing that on the consumer side. On the commercial side, we\u2019ve allowed deposit balances to run down just simply from the economics where we have the flexibility when faced with aggressive deposit pricing levels to let deposits run off and fund it through the FHLB. So over time, in '16 and '17, that\u2019s allowed us to experience a lower beta. We still have significant amount of flexibility and contingent liquidity to do so; however, we are focused on growing commercial operational deposits going forward.","Ken Zerbe","So I guess that kind of leads into the second part though, does there come a point where deposit betas don\u2019t price gradually? Where you say, okay, we\u2019re done with the commercial runoff, we actually need the commercial deposits and therefore we see a much more meaningful step up in your deposit betas that you try to stabilize that portfolio?","Jamie Leonard","I think it\u2019s possible that that would happen but not at the type of Fed increases we\u2019re expecting which are pretty low step-ups from the Fed. We\u2019re just not at that point yet.","Ken Zerbe","All right, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from John Pancari from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","John Pancari","Good morning.","Greg Carmichael","Good morning.","John Pancari","Back to the loan growth, I heard that the exiting of the commercial relationships has pretty much run its course at the end of next quarter. Can you just remind us of the Shared National Credit portfolio, was is the size of that as of today and was that part of any of the intentional runoff?","Lars Anderson","This is Lars. Let me just take that question. To give you a little bit of background on that, we had a number of years ago an increase in the Shared National Credit portfolio in particular consistent with the build out of some of our industry verticals which frankly really benefitted us in a large way. However, Shared National Credits, it\u2019s not a line of business. It is just an outcome of our business strategy. If you look at our SNC portfolio, it\u2019s been fairly stable in that 50%, 51% type range over a number of quarters now. It\u2019s stabilized as we continue to focus even more on our middle markets portfolio. And I would remind you of this too. Our Shared National Credit portfolio is underwritten with the same risk team to the same standard, held to the same pricing discipline, same expectations in terms of risk profile. In fact, if you look at the asset quality of that portfolio today, you would see that it largely matches our overall commercial portfolio the same thing in terms of the overall returns. And we\u2019re really pleased with what we\u2019ve been able to drive there as we have executed on our balance sheet optimization. There has been a churn in that Shared National Credit portfolio today. About 80% of those Shared National Credit relationships have multiple products with us which is very high. The other 20% frankly our newer relationships, ones that we are actively building out and deepening client relationships as we bring to them strategic options in treasury management, more sophisticated products that we\u2019re investing in. So we feel good about our strategy there. But I wouldn\u2019t expect that that would grow significantly in the future in particular as we invest in our core middle market franchise even more on a go-forward basis.","Greg Carmichael","The only thing I\u2019ll also add to Lars\u2019 comments is our SNC criticized assets are lower than our overall commercial in general. So they performed extremely well and have even through the cycle performed well for us.","John Pancari","Okay. And I know you mentioned that it shouldn\u2019t grow, but you think that at the current level that 50% to 51% range I guess with that 25% to 30% of total loans that that\u2019s pretty much where it\u2019s going to stay?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes, it\u2019s hard to say quarter-to-quarter where things will go depending upon the overall economic environment. But our longer term goal would be for that to be a smaller portion of our overall balance sheet. As I said before, we\u2019re putting a lot into our core middle market business banking focus and we would expect to be accelerating the growth of that in the future.","John Pancari","Okay. And then one more follow up on that. What is the average yield of your Shared National Credits? And then separately what percentage of them are you lead arranger? Thanks.","Tayfun Tuzun","We are not disclosing the specific yields in sub-portfolios and clearly where we are the lead arranger, that\u2019s a smaller percentage of the total.","Lars Anderson","Yes, again I would just \u2013 I\u2019d reinforce that 80% of that Shared National Credit portfolio that we have multiple products. These are relationships and that\u2019s what we continue to focus on building out moving from just a provider of our balance sheet to true relationships, supporting our verticals and some of our larger core middle market clients. That\u2019s what it\u2019s about.","John Pancari","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gerard Cassidy from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Steven Duong","Hi. This is actually Steve Duong in for Gerard. Thanks for taking our call. A question on your CET1 ratio. You\u2019re at 10.5 today consistent with the prior quarter even after a pretty large buyback. Is there a target CET1 level that you\u2019re looking to get to? And if so, what is the payout level do you think you need to reach that target?","Tayfun Tuzun","Obviously in the very near term, our CCAR results and guidance dictates where that capital is. In general, we\u2019ve been targeting a 10% type level and we still have three quarters ahead of us in terms of adding more to our buybacks. Over the long term, that target potentially may change. Our peers clearly are talking more about a 9 handle with respect to their capital ratios. And I think roughly 50 basis point type of reduction in capital would equate to about \u2013 if I\u2019m not mistaken a $500 million, $600 million type of additional buyback if we do chose to go there immediately. We clearly believe that the risk profile of our balance sheet and the business composition would dictate a lower capital ratio than what we are carrying today; whether it\u2019s 9%, 9.5%. Time will show.","Steven Duong","Great. Thank you. And just a follow-up question on the technology side. You guys mentioned about your innovation center. As far philosophically, where are you most focused in on the technology development more on the client-facing side or are you more on the backend, or what\u2019s your philosophy on it?","Greg Carmichael","We see the digital transformation really impacting both ends of the back office or for continued optimization which I think we\u2019ve done a nice job of. But there\u2019s opportunities around artificial intelligence, we\u2019re biased, that we\u2019re looking at right now to more streamline our processes and reduce our overall cost which we expect to achieve. So that\u2019s a focus. In addition, our client-facing side of the house would be our advancements in our mobile application, our Web platform and the investments we\u2019re making and payments to help our commercial customers automate their back office. We\u2019ll continue to see that. And also around the distribution channels, how we touch our customers, whether the partnership with GreenSky, as we mentioned before, ApplePie, the new partnership we\u2019ve just established with NRT Sightline is another example of that. So we\u2019ll continue to make those investments on both sides. Once again, it gets back to the return and the value we create for our commercial customers and consumer customers and our shareholders.","Steven Duong","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Terry McEvoy from Stephens. Your line is open.","Terry McEvoy","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Earlier in the call you mentioned international banks being more competitive as it relates to deposits. Is that something new that has emerged over the last quarter? And would you say it\u2019s in market retail consumer competition or more on the national if not international businesses that you operate?","Lars Anderson","It\u2019s not a new phenomenon. It\u2019s been going on definitely over the past year since the Fed really began increasing rates and it\u2019s definitely on the commercial side you\u2019re seeing and plus types of pricing from FBOs.","Terry McEvoy","And then just a follow up to John\u2019s question, could you substitute leverage lending for the SNC portfolio? Was the planned reduction in commercial centered at all on those loans and I\u2019m not sure if you disclosed the size of that portfolio today?","Tayfun Tuzun","You\u2019re asking about the size of the leverage loan portfolio?","Terry McEvoy","That\u2019s correct.","Tayfun Tuzun","It\u2019s been \u2013 for a number of quarters now it\u2019s been going down. It is currently \u2013 we don\u2019t typically disclose it, but we\u2019ve seen now over the last two years it\u2019s fairly significant for us on our leverage lending --","Greg Carmichael","Terry to your question, that was part of our optimization efforts over the last couple of years, leverage loans.","Tayfun Tuzun","Which interestingly enough actually was a headwind with respect to spreads and margins. So our ability to stabilize NII and NIM in light of the reduction in our leverage lending portfolio also points to a pretty decent strength in the way we manage this.","Terry McEvoy","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Vivek Juneja from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Vivek Juneja","Hi, Tayfun and Greg, a couple of questions for you guys. One is the CET1, I want to go back to that. So why not lower \u2013 so why 10% if I heard that correctly? I know you said each 50 basis point would do this, but why not lower given what you\u2019ve done? Is there something that\u2019s holding you back? Are there other plans for which you\u2019re trying to hold on to the capital?","Tayfun Tuzun","Vivek, we need to clearly make sure that we watch where the industry is going. There\u2019s a pure regulatory aspect of this. In the last CCAR, they enabled us to be a bit more flexible with respect to our capital return to our shareholders. But we still are cognizant of that additional dimension of where the peer group is. We are currently right in the middle, maybe a little bit above the middle range of the distribution of our peers. There is nothing on our balance sheet that suggest that we need to keep a 10% plus capital, but we would like to make sure that the progression to a lower range is in line with the way our peer group moves their capital as well. So that\u2019s really the factor that dictates, because ultimately when you think about CCAR, it\u2019s a group exercise. Yes, there is idiosyncratic impact of one\u2019s balance sheet and income statement, but when the Fed looks at it, they look at it as a group and we cannot ignore where the peers are. And also the other piece is in terms of our preferred bucket, we still have room of about $400 million to $500 million in additional preferred issuance. So as we think about the composition of capital, that is also a factor.","Vivek Juneja","Okay. Thanks. One more small question and maybe this goes to Lars. On leasing residual gains, did I hear you right? You said they are \u2013 you\u2019ve taken some gains. Are they to run at this lower run rate, or is that \u2013 or was this just a blip this quarter, because it\u2019s something that can be episodic?","Lars Anderson","It really is episodic. We don\u2019t necessarily have a plan for that line item. It depends on where the portfolio is, where asset values are. We don\u2019t necessarily try to maximize residual gains. And last quarter [indiscernible] strong quarter, so the comparisons for last quarter gets a bit weaker.","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes, and we just have a very robust process where we\u2019re viewing and actively managing that portfolio and we\u2019re taking those gains where we think is appropriate.","Vivek Juneja","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Gokhale, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you.","Sameer Gokhale","Thank you, Melissa. And thank you all for your interest in Fifth Third Bank. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact the Investor Relations department and we will be happy to assist you.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Sameer Gokhale, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin.","Sameer Gokhale","Thank you, Tamiya, good morning and thank you all for joining us. Today, we'll be discussing our financial results for the first quarter of 2017. This discussion may contain certain forward-looking statements about Fifth Third pertaining to our financial condition, results of operations, plans and objectives. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from historical performance and these statements.","We've identified some of these factors in our forward-looking cautionary statement at the end of our earnings release and in other materials and we encourage you to review them. Fifth Third undertakes no obligation to and would not expect to update any such forward-looking statements after the date of this call. Additionally, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures we reference during today's conference call are included in our earnings release along with other information regarding the use of non-GAAP financial measures.","A copy of our most recent quarterly earnings release can be accessed by the public in the Investor Relations section of our corporate website, www.53.com. This morning, I'm joined on the call by our Chairman and CEO, Greg Carmichael; CFO, Tayfun Tuzun; Chief Operating Officer, Lars Anderson; Chief Risk Officer, Frank Forrest; and Treasurer, Jamie Leonard. Following prepared remarks by Greg and Tayfun, we will open the call up for questions.","Let me turn the call over now to Greg for his comments.","Greg Carmichael","Thanks, Sameer, and thank all of you for joining us this morning. Earlier today, we reported first quarter 2018 net income available to common shareholders of $689 million and EPS of $0.97. Our reported EPS included a positive impact of $0.40 from a few significant items including a step-up gain of $414 million recognized from a Worldpay stake.","Our first quarter results were strong and reflect our efforts to enhance the resilience of our balance sheet, capitalize on rate hikes and maintaining tight control over expenses.","Recall that last quarter we revised our ROA and ROTCE targets higher after tax legislation resulted in lower corporate tax rates. Now on year two of Project North Star, our first quarter results showed that we remain on track to achieve the upper-end of our leasing device ROTCE target in the 15.5% to 16% range, an ROA of 1.35% to 1.45% by the fourth quarter of 2019.","Excluding the Worldpay gain, another non-core items are underlying ROTCE for the first quarter was over 30% further adjusting for additional capital generated from the step-up gain or ROTCE for the quarter was 13.7% compared to 9.7% in the first quarter of 2017.","We remain focused on driving improved shareholder returns as we continue to executive on our strategic initiatives under project North Star. We're discussing some of the highlights for the quarter, I'd like to make a few observations about the broader economic environment.","We are closely watching our commercial client activity and remain cautiously optimistic about the outlook for employment and capital investment. For the low level of employment is supportive of a healthy consumer sector we\u2019re also cognizant of elevated consumer debt levels.","Moving on to our first quarter results, our asset sensitive balance sheet allows the benefit from increased short-term interest rates. Our adjusted net interest margin expanded eight basis points sequentially and exceeded our previous guidance primarily reflecting higher interest rates. We also benefited from our focus on maintaining commercial loan pricing discipline.","End of period commercial loans and leases increased 1% sequentially, while the industry balances were reflect. A sequential increase in our commercial portfolio was primarily driven by growth and C&I loans which grew by 1% on both a period end and average basis.","As some of you may recall, we discussed our commercial client experience initiative or TCEI at our Investor Day last December. TCEI is enabling us to significantly improve customer service in our middle market lending business by streamlining origination underwriting process, our relationship manager is able to spend more time on cultivating new relationships and better servicing our existing customers. With all these initiative already paying off and we\u2019re extremely pleased with the implementation.","In the consumer portfolio excluding our loans, average consumer balances grew 2% year-over-year largely driven by continued growth in our unsecured lending portfolio. As we have discussed previously, we would like to achieve a better balance between consumer and commercial loans.","Growth in our unsecured lending portfolio is consistent with this objective and the mortgage space I'm pleased to announce that all distribution channels will rely on new mortgage loan origination system this week. This system will help improve the customer experience, increase employment engagement and support market share growth.","In terms of fee income, we experienced another record quarter in our wealth and asset management business reflecting seasonally high tax credit fees, growth in new relationships and strong equity market performance over the past year. Our corporate banking revenue was negatively impacted by newly market activity. We sold sequential growth in our M&A advisory business and corporate bond fees which was stronger than the - overall industry average.","Although consistent with general market trends for the quarter, we generated lower loans syndication fees. So non-interest income was also impacted by lower equity method income resulting from the Vantiv Worldpay merger.","For the first quarter, we managed our underlying expenses well below previous guidance despite ongoing strategic investments in project North Star. At Fifth Third we appreciate the importance of ensuring that our core expense base is optimized for the realities of our operating environment.","We believe we saw room for improvement and are working with a third-party consulting firm to help identify and execute on additional expense saves throughout 2018 and into 2019. The initiatives we are currently reviewing are in addition to what we had planned under project North Star and could increase our return targets closer to 17%. These are pure expense initiatives and include spend of control design, back to middle office efficiencies and enhanced focus on vendor spend.","In light of evolving customer preferences, we continue to assess the optimal size of our branch network and decide to close nine branches during the quarter. We are also considering opening new branches in our high growth markets where we have opportunities to expand our franchise.. This process is an ongoing exercise and we continue to leverage our newly developed analytical capability, optimize the size of our retail branch network.","During the quarter, credit quality remains strong. Credit size loans declined again reflect the attribute of taken over the past two years to strengthen our balance sheet, net charge-off and nonperforming loans also remained at or near pre-crisis levels.","Our capital and liquidity levels remain very strong with our common equity Tier 1 ratio at 10.8%, while our modified LCR continues to be well above regulatory requirements at 113%. With our strengthened balance sheet and focus on through the cycle credit performance, we continue to believe our optimal CET1 ratio should be significantly below current levels in a 9.5% to 9.7% target range. As a result, we anticipate a total payout ratio over 100% over the next year or so with a continue balance between higher dividends and share buybacks.","We also recently announced additional strategic partnerships, acquisitions and equity investments. Our recent acquisition of Coker Capital Advisors built upon the strength of our healthcare vertical and experience our M&A advisor capabilities.","Turning to our Epic Insurance and Integrity HR acquisitions from last year, we expect this transaction to help support fee income growth. Our strategic approach with fee related acquisitions tends around acquiring and growing within our markets, fully integrating these businesses into the bank and leveraging our unique one bank every mile to grow in a efficient demand.","As many of you know, student debt is a challenge facing our millennial customers. We launched our momentum app last year to help with this problem and we\u2019re pleased to recently announce an equity investment in common bar. One of the largest digital student loan originators and look forward to working with them to bring proper solutions to the market.","We\u2019ve also made significant progress on our commitment to improving the communities we serve. In particular, we recent became the first Fortune 500 Company to sign a power purchase agreement to achieve 100% renewable power. This achievement will help promote a healthy and sustainable environment and help protect our plan for future generations.","I\u2019d once again like to thank all of our employees for their hard work and dedication which is evident in our financial results. I was pleased that we were able to deliver strong results and remain on track to achieve our North Star targets.","With that, I\u2019ll turn over to Tayfun to discuss our first quarter results and our current outlook.","Tayfun Tuzun","Thanks Greg. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Let's move to the financial summary on Slide 4 of the presentation.","As Greg mentioned, during the quarter NII growth and expansion, expense control and ongoing strength in credit quality metrics reflected our commitment to driving improved financial performance and shareholder return. Reported results were positively impacted by the items noted on Page 1 of our release.","The most significant item was the $414 million positive pretax impact of the Worldpay step-up gain which we had previously discussed. This was partially offset by a $39 million pretax charge related to the Visa total return swap and $8 million impairment related to our plan to reduce our branch network by nine branches and an $8 million charge associated with an increase in litigation reserves.","As we had discussed on last quarter's earnings call, our first quarter results were affected by seasonally higher expenses resulting from compensation related item. Despite this headwind, our underlying ROA, and ROTCE metrics improved substantially from the fourth quarter. Core ROA of 1.23% improved 11 basis points sequentially with core ROTCE of 13.4% up 1.7% from adjusted fourth quarter result.","Recall that last quarter we revised our ROA and ROTCE targets to reflect our confidence in retaining the majority of the benefits from recently enacted tax legislation. As Greg mentioned earlier, we are taking a closer look at our expense base in light of the ongoing lack of strength in loan growth and the muted fee environment more on that a little bit later.","Moving to Slide 5, loan growth continues to be challenging in commercial lending. The all end impact of tax reform has been modestly positive for the quarter. Clients have largely maintained their wait-and-see approach and as a result both loan production and payoff activity was relatively temperate.","But based on a very healthy pipeline in commercial lending especially in middle market, we anticipate that we will achieve our targets during the rest of the year. Average total loans were flat sequentially. Growth in C&I and other consumer loans was mostly offset by a continued reduction in our home equity, commercial real estate balances and the planned decline in our indirect auto loan portfolio.","Average C&I loan balances were up 1% or approximately $340 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and were flat year-over-year. While production was relatively tepid during the quarter, we had tailwinds from line utilization and lower paydowns which led to a modest increase in balance.","The sequential increase in average C&I balances was partially offset by a 1% decline in both CRE and commercial leases. We expect commercial leases to continue to decline another $400 million by the end of 2018 mainly in our indirect large ticket leasing portfolio given our focus on driving relationship oriented profitable growth.","Similar to prior quarters, price competition in commercial lending is aggressive but we continue to remain competitive striking an appropriate balance between growth and prudent respect.","Average commercial real estate loan balances declined 1% sequentially in the first quarter with mortgage down 3% and construction flat. We will continue to maintain a cautious approach in commercial real estate given where we are in the cycle. We currently expect our end of period total commercial portfolio to grow about 1% to 1.5% sequentially in the second quarter and about 4% in 2018 compared to end of year 2017 including the impact of the runoff of our national leasing business.","Growth should predominantly come from C&I. Stated differently excluding the runoff in our leasing business, our growth rate is expected to exceed 5%. In consumer including the planned decline in the indirect auto loan portfolio, average loans were flat sequentially and year-over-year. Excluding auto, average consumer loans were up 2% year-over-year.","Auto loans were down 7% year-over-year reflecting the ongoing impact of our decision to curtail indirect originations and redeployed capital. The rate of decline in the auto portfolio should slow as we currently expect the pace of originations to increase in 2018 from 2017 given current returns. We currently expect our total production be closer to $4 billion in 2018.","Average residential mortgage loans were flat sequentially and up 2% year-over-year as we continue to retain jumbo mortgages and arms on our balance sheet. We acquired a $2 billion servicing portfolio during the quarter which will be onboarded in the second quarter.","Since the beginning of last year, we have acquired approximately $12 million in servicing assets. We continue to assess MSR purchase opportunities to take advantage of our scale and enhance our return on capital.","Our average credit card portfolio increased 1% from the fourth quarter supported by our enhanced analytical capabilities. We continue to expect card balance growth in the mid to high single digits for 2018.","Our home equity loan originations were down 3% sequentially and 9% year-over-year as demand for home equity loans remained weak. Across the industry, applications are down over 10% year-over-year. We believe that this highlights evolving borrower preferences for speed and simplicity in consumer lending.","This is the underlying premise behind our efforts to grow our unsecured consumer loan business. Other consumer loans which primarily consists of our personal lending portfolio including loans generated through GreenSky increased 17% sequentially to $1.6 billion. We continue to expect personal lending balances to grow to $2 billion by the fourth quarter of 2019 from approximately $1 billion at the end of the first quarter.","Loan originations will remain focused on high-quality prime customers with GreenSky providing first loss coverage as we have discussed before. In the second quarter, we expect total end of period consumer loan balances to increase approximately 1% relative to the first quarter.","For 2018, we expect end of period loan growth of 1% to 1.5% down from our previous guidance of 2% to 3% impacted by the continued headwinds in home equity. Excluding indirect auto loan balances, we expect consumer growth of about 3%.","Our average investment portfolio increased 3% in the first quarter as market dynamics led to opportunistic purchases. We expect to maintain our portfolio balance at roughly the same level in the second quarter.","We had solid deposit performance and household growth in the first quarter. Average core deposits were up 1% sequentially. The sequential increase in commercial interest checking deposit and commercial money market account balances was partially offset by lower commercial demand account balances.","Typical of rise in rate environments, deposit markets remain competitive. We continue to make rational decisions between pricing appropriately for profitability and maintaining and growing relationship based LCR friendly deposits. Despite the environmental pressures, we believe we have an opportunity to steadily grow the consumer book leveraging our recent success in analytical driven direct marketing efforts. Our modified liquidity coverage ratio continued to be strong at 113% at the end of the quarter.","Taxable equivalent net interest income of $999 million was up $36 million or 4% from the fourth quarter. The prior quarter was impacted by a $27 million leveraged lease remeasurement due to the change in corporate tax rates. Excluding the impact of the remeasurement, NII was up $9 million or 1% sequentially reflecting higher short-term market rates partially offset by a lower day count.","Excluding a non-core, card remediation benefit from the first quarter of 2017 and NII in the current quarter increased $72 million or 8% on a year-over-year basis. This was primarily driven by the impact of higher short-term market rates, and an increase in the investment portfolio of balances.","The NIM adjusted for the same items increased eight basis points from the fourth quarter to 3.18% exceeding the midpoint of our previous guidance by four basis points. The sequential improvement was driven by a six basis point benefit from higher short-term market rates, one basis point from growth in higher yielding consumer loans, and a three basis point benefit from day count.","This was offset by a one basis point drag from the FTE adjustment given the tax law change, as well as one basis point from higher securities balances. The NIM in the second quarter of 2018 should be approximately three to five basis points higher compared to the first quarter. We expect full year 2018 NIM in the 3.22% to 3.24% range exceeding our January guidance including the impact of two more rate hikes this year, one in June and another one in December.","The improvement in our outlook reflects the impact of the elevated LIBOR levels and strong pricing discipline in our lending business. Supporting this outlook, overall deposit pricing so far has remained relatively muted. Our cumulative beta leading up to the March 2018 Fed hike was 25% with consumer in the mid-20s and commercial in the mid-40s.","The December hike resulted in a blended beta of approximately 40% and we expect the March rate increase who also reserve in a beta of around 40%. We are currently forecasting a low to mid 50% beta resulting from June rate increase. As we have said before, if we see betas at lower levels, our margin could exceed our guidance.","We expect our second quarter net interest income to be up approximately 3% from the first quarter's net interest income to $1.025 billion to $1.03 billion which is largely a function of higher market rates and day counts, as well as expected loan growth in the commercial portfolio.","For the full-year 2018 exceeding our previous guidance, we expect NII to grow by approximately 8% from the adjusted 2017 NII and range between $4.14 billion and $4.16 billion. The strategic actions we have taken during the last two years including the reduction in auto loan originations exits some low return commercial relationships and the reduction in indirect large ticket lease origination have led to a redeployment of capital away from loans with lower returns and help us achieve a very good NII and NIM profile.","In addition, over the past few years we have created an interest rate risk profile that allows us to grow deposits at competitive rates while driving greater NIM expansion compared to our peers.","Excluding the impact of the non-core items, noninterest income in the first quarter was $553 million compared to $587 million in the fourth quarter. The sequential change was impacted by $44 million in Worldpay TRA revenue, and a $25 million lease remarketing impairment recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017.","Underlying fee revenue decreased 3% sequentially due to lower equity method income during the quarter resulting from the closing of the Worldpay acquisition and their merger integration costs partially offset by an increase in wealth and asset management revenue. Mortgage banking net revenue of $56 million was up $2 million sequentially. Origination fees were down $8 million sequentially reflecting lower rate lock volumes and tighter spreads.","Originations of $1.6 billion were 18% lower than the fourth quarter with a first quarter gain on sale margin of 189 basis points compared to 206 basis points in the fourth quarter. Gain on sale margins are tighter than we had expected and are likely to remain weak during the remainder of the year.","During the quarter, 57% of our origination mix consisted of purchase volume. Just under two-thirds of our originations were sourced from the retail and direct channels and the remainder through the correspondent channel.","Challenging market conditions weighed on overall corporate banking fees during the quarter. Fees of $88 million were down $14 million sequentially excluding the prior quarter impairment primarily driven by lower loan syndication and business lending fees. This was partially offset by increased corporate bond and M&A advisory fee.","We currently expect corporate banking fees to rebound from the software first quarter driven by a solid pipeline of deals that were pushed out given market factors, as well as the impact of the strategic investments and acquisitions. We expect corporate banking fees to increase between 20% and 25% sequentially subject to market conditions.","Deposit service charges remain relatively unchanged from the fourth quarter. Card and processing revenue was down 1% sequentially reflecting seasonally lower credit card spend volume compared with the fourth quarter.","Full wealth and asset management revenue of $113 million was up 7% sequentially primarily driven by seasonally strong tax-related private client service revenue. Recurring revenues in this business have increased to approximately 85% of fees from the 79% last year.","For the second quarter of 2018, we expect fees to be between $575 million and $585 million or up approximately 5% from our first quarter adjusted noninterest income. For the full year of 2018, we expect fees to be approximately $2.35 billion. Although this guidance is slightly below our January guidance excluding the ongoing weakness in the mortgage business, it still equates to a higher than 4% growth in other fees.","We remain focused on disciplined expense management while continuing to invest for revenue growth. Reported noninterest expenses decreased 2% sequentially. Excluding the onetime items recognized both this quarter and in the fourth quarter of 2017, expenses were up 6% sequentially reflecting seasonally higher FICA payment and unemployment insurance, as well as increased amortization of affordable housing investments resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.","Our adjusted efficiency ratio for the first quarter was 67%. Recall that the amortization of our low income housing investments is recognized in expenses which most of our peers reflect in their tax line. This difference in accounting added over 3% to our efficiency ratio this quarter relative to other competitors.","We expect our efficiency ratio to decline every quarter during the remainder of this year and for the year on an adjusted basis based on our outlook we should get to below 60%. Based on our current forecast, we still expect to achieve the upper end of our ROTCE target range of 15% to 16% at the end of 2019.","Regardless, our intent is not to limit our progress to a given range and challenge ourselves to execute a continuous improvement program. As part of that progression and especially in light of ongoing environmental challenges, the low growth and revenue growth, we are taking a closer look at our expense base with a specific focus on nonrevenue producing parts of our organization.","This review include a span of control study, as well as an evaluation of absolute staffing level. We will also be undertaking another review of potential opportunities in the procurement area with a renewed focus on demand management. We intend to share our expectations on this scale and timing of these deficiencies with you next quarter but we believe that these potential actions may get up closer to a 17% ROTCE level.","In addition as Greg discussed, we continue to evaluate our strategies related to our retail branch network which also has implications for further expense efficiencies. At this time, we expect total expenses to be at the lower end of our January guidance of $4 billion to $4.1 billion in 2018. Some of the new expense initiatives may impact the results and we intend to update you as we make more progress in the announced.","Second quarter expenses are expected to be down about 2% from the first quarter as we come off of seasonally higher first quarter level. We expect expenses to continue to fall throughout the remainder of the year.","First quarter credit results continue to follow a positive trends reflecting low unemployment and the benign economic backdrop, as well as the positive impact of deliberate actions that we took to reduce high risk exposures during the past two years. One of the leading indicators with strong correlation with these decisions to criticize asset ratio continued to improve and at the end of the first quarter was down 100 basis points from the beginning of 2017.","Net charge-offs were $81 million or 36 basis points, up three basis points from the fourth quarter of 2017 and down four basis points from last year. Commercial charge-offs were 21 basis points down one basis point from the fourth quarter and down eight basis points year-over-year.","Consume net charge-offs of 60 basis points were seasonally up nine basis points sequentially and were up four basis points year-over-year. Total portfolio nonperforming loans and leases were $452 million down 34% from last year and up 3% from the previous quarter.","The sequential increase was primarily due to higher C&I NPLs from our most recent SNC review which includes $28 million in RBL loans, current on interest and well collateralized. Our loss provision was $23 million in the quarter down $44 million sequentially reflecting continued low levels of net charge-offs and the improving credit profile of our loan. The reserve ratio declined six basis points to 1.24%. Our reserve coverage overall NPLs remains 250%.","As we remind you every quarter, we remain in a relatively stable credit environment and the economic backdrop continues to support - continue to benign credit outlook. We nevertheless caution you that we could potentially experience some upward pressure in the future.","Capital levels remain very strong during the fourth quarter. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 10.8% of about 21 basis points sequentially. We initiated and settled at $318 million share repurchase which included a $35 million request above our original CCAR period. We currently have approximately $235 million in buyback capacity remaining for the second quarter to complete our CCAR 2017 repurchase.","Recall that we also have another potential $0.02 dividend raise scheduled for June pending approval from our Board. Our tangible common equity ratio excluding unrealized gains and losses increased 20 basis points sequentially. As the end of the first quarter, common shares outstanding was down 9 million shares or 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and down 65 million shares or 9% compared to last year's first quarter.","Book value and tangible book value were up 8% and 7% from last year respectively. Our capital levels are currently higher than what we prudently need given the risk profile and business composition of our company.","In addition, we also have a 4.9% ownership in Worldpay and it\u2019s not fully recognized on our balance sheet. When combined with our ability to generate significant amount of capital organically our current position bodes well for strong level of capital returns to our shareholder. As Greg mentioned our CCAR submission reflected these levels and we will receive the Fed\u2019s response later this quarter.","Barring any environmental changes our capital actions should continue to benefit from the combination of our balance sheet strength and strong earnings beyond 2018. Recent legislation being debated in Washington and proposals for new regulatory rulemaking should further increase our flexibility and capital management. We will share with you any changes to our capital management approach as we get more clarity on these potential actions that are in front of the Congress and the regulatory body.","With respect to taxes our first quarter rate of 15.8% was impacted by the Worldpay step-up gain and other items disclosed in our release. Excluding these items our tax rate was approximately 14.1%. We expect our tax rate for the full year to be in the 16.25% to 16.75% range which is a little higher than our January except excluding the items that are specific to 2018.","We would expect our long-term tax rate to be in the 15.5% range. Our revenue growth outlook the ability to achieve positive operating leverage while maintaining underwriting standards our strong balance sheet and our strategic positioning give us confidence in our ability to create additional shareholder value.","With that let me turn it over to Sameer to open the call up for Q&A.","Sameer Gokhale","Thanks Tayfun. Before we start Q&A, as a courtesy to others, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions. We will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have this morning.","During the question-and-answer period, please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator. Tamiya please open the call up for question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Peter Winter with Wedbush Securities.","Anthony Elian","This is Anthony Elian for Peter. My first question - so with all the uncertainty regarding tariffs, are you guys seeing that this is keeping some borrowers on the sidelines until there is some more clarity or legislation out of Washington?","Lars Anderson","We are hearing some kind of feedback on that, but I would say that number one thing that we're hearing from our clients is really digesting still the tax law changes along with our rising labor cost. I wouldn't say that tariffs are really the number one priority, but it's clearly an issue on their mind and certainly is causing them to - I think take a pause which is what we saw in the first quarter.","Anthony Elian","And then Tayfun maybe one for you. If fee income for the year comes in a little bit stronger than expected, would you expect expenses will come at the low end of 4 billion to 4.1 billion range?","Tayfun Tuzun","Yes, I think, so I mean there may be slight increases in incentive comp related line items, but in general I would expect to be able to hold on to that guidance.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Christopher Marinac with FIG Partners.","Christopher Marinac","When you look at the fintech investment that have outside of Worldpay, would any of these be harvested in the Q3 that would make our CCAR impact or have a meaningful change to that plans?","Greg Carmichael","Not really. Once again our focus on the fintech space is really going to be an additive to all our businesses, business like GreenSky or recent investment in [income bond], the acquisitions we made sort of fintech will be additive to our fee lines and really shouldn\u2019t have an impact on our CCAR and capital distributions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Rob in for Mike. If I could follow-up on that last one, you had a pretty decent jump in the growth rate and technology spend year-over-year. I sort of wondering if this is permanent step-up and where the spending is occurring and how you guys think about your tech budget overall?","Greg Carmichael","First of all we think our tech spend is consistent we are seeing in other businesses. As we go through this digital transformation, it\u2019s important that we make our investments in smart place, it help us to be successful in our businesses. So we\u2019re not to be digital everywhere, we\u2019re not trying to grow everywhere, we\u2019re really focused on our core businesses and be additive to our core businesses.","We have a great technology organization, we continue to enhance our current capabilities and our additive to our current capabilities with new products and solutions for our customers. So we feel comfortable with our tech spend, we think it\u2019s appropriate. We also are always considering opportunities once again to enhance our position.","So our strategy around tech expend is basic buy first than partner and then build. I think the evidence is demonstrated here with our investments in fintech companies and some of the new things we rolled out like a momentum out are reflective of that strategy.","Unidentified Analyst","And if I could just follow-up with a bigger picture question on efficiency. I think a few years ago you talked about in efficiency ratio in the mid-50s with a normalized rate environment. Is the thought still that you could get there or is it more maybe a focus on fees and fee growth that might be lower efficiency but higher return on equity?","Greg Carmichael","As Tayfun mentioned in his prepared remarks, we expect by the year-end to be at below 60% on efficiency ratio but we also believe there is more opportunity there both on the revenue side and on the expense side which is why we've engaged a third-party continue to look at additional items that we could focus on as we move into rest of 2018 and into 2019.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.","Saul Martinez","On your capital guidance at your Investor Day you talked about payouts of 120% to 140% and then your guidance this morning you talked over 100%. So the wording I think it\u2019s a little bit more general than what you had guided to at Investor Day. And so I\u2019m curious, is there any change in thinking in terms of your capital planning and in your capital strategy in light of tougher CCAR examine and the new guidelines of stress capital buffers is this just - if you want to be a little bit more generalizing in your commentary ahead of this year\u2019s CCAR?","Tayfun Tuzun","There really isn't Saul. I think in general our targets remain intact clearly the stress scenario are in the current CCAR exercise was a little bit more stressed than we anticipated which may just slowdown our march towards that sort of mid-9s type of capital number.","But we anticipate that we will get there and also there are some changes that the regulators are contemplated to make which may also have a positive impact, but in general our approach to where we think we can manage this balance sheet has not changed. I don\u2019t know Jamie if you want to add anything.","Jamie Leonard","Sums it up, I guess though the topic I think to touch on this the stress capital buffer in terms of all work we've done that derisk our balance sheet. If you look at the proposed rule and you go back over the last three years of CCAR submissions fourth with third our capital destruction is well below the 2.5% SCB buffer that's being proposed.","So from a derisking standpoint we would certainly be - we would manage our portfolio well below 7% therefore will be subject to the 7% limit. And then from there obviously the benefit of the proposed rules will just allow us more flexibility for our management team and our board to manage capital going forward.","But for now for 2018 CCAR scenario was pretty stressful in terms of the scenario. And therefore want to wait and see what the results look like at the end of June but like Tayfun said, we certainly - we\u2019re targeting over 100% there.","Saul Martinez","And can you just give us an update on how you're thinking about your M&A strategy of the use of capital both from the standpoint of the fee-based businesses and depositories?","Tayfun Tuzun","M&A perspective our position hasn't changed. Our number one focus is on building out our core businesses, making those core businesses and better serving our customers in the markets that we operate in today. So that's job one.","Lot of investments you've seen us make on non-bank M&A are geared towards supporting those businesses from a fee perspective. So we're to continue to look at those opportunities and to be additive to our fee and service products that we offer our customers, and that's job one for us.","Other M&A opportunities that there may emerge we\u2019ll assess those, but once again it's a difficult challenge right now to figure out where those opportunities lie and our ability to capitalize on it. But job one is focusing on building out our core and non-core businesses, non-bank M&A opportunities to be additive to our business lines, if bank M&A materializes it will be because of the best interest of our shareholders.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. ","Matt O'Connor","I just want to follow up on the expenses. If I am doing the math correct, it seems like you're taking in a pretty nice decline and causing the back half of the year versus the first half that is 7% drop on average. So we haven't seen that kind of quarterly progression in the past, I know there is some seasonality in 1Q and I guess I am just trying to get a better sense of, how confident you are in getting that and how much you are kind of bacon in some of these initiatives that you highlighted in your prepared remarks versus just normal seasonality and some upfront investment spend maybe you had this quarter?","Greg Carmichael","There's some seasonality associated with it, Matt. There's also the additional benefit from the FDIC surcharge going away towards the end of the year. So, we are picking that up as well. We feel fairly comfortable with the guidance and there were also some severance expenses in our numbers this quarter.","We're not forecasting those, we don't include those in our outlook for the remainder of the year. So I think, all in all we should be a fairly decent decline on a quarterly basis in total.","Matt O'Connor","And then I guess more broadly speaking, heard like you've been working on expenses for a few years here, you got the project North Star. And I guess, I'm just wondering kind of what made you think that there is more opportunity to increase the urgency, take another look, hire an outsider and take a stab at this?","Tayfun Tuzun","First off the Project North Star, so we have a lot of expense initiatives baked in the project North Star which I chose to embrace, but we've executed well against those initiatives as evidenced by the fact we were roughly flat year-over-year last year under our guidance for the first quarter this year and we just discussed what looks going forward.","So we're very pleased with the initiatives that we put into the initial pipeline. But we're also mindful of this whatever things happening in our business in our industry that creates opportunities for further improvement that we're assessing.","We're also watching what other businesses and banks are doing and we continue to believe in maybe opportunities for us to do a better job of managing our expenses going forward. So we're going to take a look at the next level what opportunities.","Our \u201clow hanging fruit\u201d wide-out was harvested in the first phase of project North Star because it is going to be difficult as you move forward, but we do believe there is opportunities for further improvement. We don't have anything on the table.","So bringing in third party who has done a lot of work in other areas, it could be as it how we\u2019re thinking about our business and want to take that opportunity to assess our position today whatever may look like in the future.","Greg Carmichael","And Matt one clarification that I want to provide is these types of studies take a little time. So we are at the end of the first quarter here in 2018, and it will be some time before we can actually finalize our perspective.","So, I don't want to - we gave you guidance for 2018 total expenses. The results of this study may have some impact at the very back end of 2018, but any changes will most likely come more in 2009. So our guidance for total expenses remains intact as stated our slides as well as in our script.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.","Ken Zerbe","Just going back to the NIM guidance, obviously has increased as positive. How much of that relates specifically to the higher LIBOR spreads? And I guess the question is LIBOR or spreads do decline or go back to where there were a couple months ago, does that pose a risk for your NIM guidance? Thanks.","Jamie Leonard","On the LIBOR OAS spread what we've assumed in our outlook is that spared and for us it's really sensitive to one month LIBOR. So one month LIBOR to Fed funds, we assume a 13 basis point spread level. So that's obviously up from the 5 bps in the fourth quarter and the 12 bps in the first quarter, but a little bit below where we sit today.","We have that at 13 basis points the rest of the year, but then we have it normalizing in December where we revert back to 5 basis points. So is there some risk in the number to the down? Yes, a little bit but the historical spread on one month to Fed funds, I think it's about 10 basis points. I think we're into a new normal, but we don't have that number expanding and there could be some upside if one month LIBOR were to expand.","In terms of our balance sheet on a one month LIBOR basis about 30% of our interest earning assets are tied to one month and only about 1% of our liabilities are. So that certainly carries some benefit to a balance sheet likewise.","Frank Forrest","I think, we also have been able to avoid the basis risk of some of our peers have seen negatively impacting their NIM. So that was a benefit.","Ken Zerbe","And then just a follow up question, in terms of loan growth guidance, obviously starts off - seems like a starting off a little weaker this year. Can you just about the pull through rates because I know you mentioned like good pipelines in commercial they think that\u2019s going to drive higher loan balances to hit your targets later in the year. But like what - I mean how much of those pipelines actually do end up resulting historically in an actual loan growth?","Tayfun Tuzun","There is variation obviously throughout the cycle. And part of it has to do with your competition out there, how much they're structuring in terms of pricing, in terms of structure, in terms of your pipeline pull through.","I would say today though that largely while it's very, very aggressive we've seen structure and pricing somewhat stabilized. So if I look at our pipeline today versus 90 days ago for example, I think we get pretty fairly compare apples to apples. And we see a very robust growth both in our core middle market across almost all of our regions and across almost all of our corporate banking operations.","What the ultimate pull-through will be in the timing will be largely affected by the economic conditions, the confidence level of our clients we're going to stay very close to them.","But I can't give you an exact pull- through number. But I would tell you just throughout my 30 some years of banking, the pull-through, the pipeline tends to be somewhere in the 25% range but I'm not sure that that's meaningful.","I think what's more meaningful is the fact that our pipeline is becoming much more robust and frankly, it's growing in the businesses in the geographies where we would want it to be.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.","Vivek Juneja","Number one, do C&I yields if you could just talk about any recoveries in that number?","Tayfun Tuzun","No.","Vivek Juneja","Secondly, I'm trying to understand a little bit about your efficiency ratio on a core basis, trying to strip out all the non-core items and there's a bunch of them. And if I look at just total revenue growth and look at total expense growth and efficiency ratio, efficiency ratio was essentially flat year-on-year, despite all the stuff you've been doing on the North Star. And if I look at whole growth that also seems to be slightly above where - on a year on year basis.","So any color on sort of what happened this quarter, why it stayed flat and we saw no improvement?","Tayfun Tuzun","So a couple of comments to that, there are some - if you peel all the one timers, there are a couple of items that have impacted the year-over-year change. One of them is, the impact of the change in corporate tax regime on LIH amortization.","There is a little bit of severance expense this quarter in our numbers. And also there is a reduction in fee income related to the closing of both the reduction in percentage ownership in Worldpay, as well as some of their quarterly noise.","So if sort of peel those numbers out, I think there is a relatively decent directional improvement in our efficiency ratio. For the year, our guidance on NII clearly is now getting to from a pure 2017, 2018 comparison perspective to over 8%. And overall total revenues are getting near 6%. And so the combination of the very powerful - has a powerful - very powerful impact on core efficiency ratio.","So, and if you peel down the low income amortization line item, that momentum takes us to below 60% and that is a pretty decent year-over-year total improvement. And we would expect that - going into 2019, we would expect- it's hard to give guidance for 2019, but we would expect that momentum to continue into next year as well.","Vivek Juneja","Any color on sort of numbers around that LIH amortization expense, what are we talking about in terms of how much this year versus a year ago first quarter\u2026","Greg Carmichael","I think I mean - we don't necessarily give out - we give obviously annual guidance. This quarter the number was about $9 million or $10 million above the last...","Vivek Juneja","And you think that's likely to continue at this sort of rate through the rest of the year\u2026","Unidentified Speaker","There is a temporary uptick in that line item because of the change in corporate tax rates but towards the end of I think next year that incremental impact that is borne by the change in the tax rate should start to disappear.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Sandler O'Neill.","Unidentified Analyst","This is actually [Brendon] from Scott's team. Just want to ask the question on the provision here, came in a good deal lower than we were looking for despite charges being pretty consistent with what they've been running at. Do you view this quarter step down and reserve ratio as kind of a onetime step down or do you think given the current credit environment there is the potential for another step-down in the reserve ratio?","Greg Carmichael","So a question with potential two answers, I'm going to answer the quarterly change in the provision and then I'm going to turn it over to Frank to comment on credit. Clearly, it was a sizable step-down from 1.3% to 1.24%. But there were some significant decline on the parts of the portfolio that sort of supported a higher reserve coverage. So that was actually a very good development. There were some specific reserves that tend to impact coverage levels and changes in coverage levels quarter-over-quarter.","But overall really that change was significantly due to an overall improvement in the risk profile of the loan portfolio. And having said all of this, we still remain in the top quartile of coverage levels when you look at our peers. So, Frank any comments on the credit.","Frank Forrest","Not really, we were up guidance for the year still range down to what we've given guidance on - we made various low lumpiness quarter-to-quarter. But our overall portfolio both in the commercial and the consumer side are they managed very well, our criticized assets are 4.8%, continue to come down quarter-after-quarter. There's not a whole lot of room probably left for that, just given where we are in the cycle.","Our non-performing assets have been stable and our - and the upper quartiles relative to our peers we feel very good about that. And our charge-offs again you'll see for the most part a range in the 25 to 35 basis points over the course of the year.","The work that we got over the last few years is paying off for us, we've taken out $5 billion of risk in our balance sheet, 1.7 of that is a leverage lending which had contributed in prior years to some more significant write-downs.","So we've positioned the company as we said consistently to perform exceptionally well through cycles. We're seeing that. We're seeing that in the reserve. And you're going to see that I believe in our results going forward.","Unidentified Analyst","And then one final question just on the tax rate guidance beyond 2018. Just curious as to the change from the prior guidance of 14% to 14.5% up to 15.5%. Is this just the result of kind of digging deeper into the specifics of the tax law change or is there something more specific you want to call out?","Tayfun Tuzun","It's really is more due to the increase in expected income levels because those marginal increases come at all tax rate versus the credit impacted tax rate so.","Operator","And we have time for one additional question. And your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.","Steven Duong","This is actually Steven Duong in for Gerard. Thanks for taking my question. Just a question on GreenSky, can you guys remind us what your first loss protection is on that portfolio? And does it change with the different loss levels?","Jamie Leonard","The protection you get in the GreenSky arrangement is a 1% escrow balance for first loss and then after that there's a lost coverage that's generated from what we call the waterfall the cash flows off the portfolio. And in total that number we ballpark in the 5% range.","So we feel quite good that given the fico in the 760 range and a little bit over a 5% gross yield along with a little bit over 5% loss coverage. So these will be good assets for our return.","Steven Duong","And just curious on that, have you guys modeled out what your losses would be if we had another big recession say on employment 8% to 10%.","Jamie Leonard","So we actually do that in CCAR submission and it really shakes out how we look at the portfolio fairly close to what some home equity products would have been, pre-crisis and in the crisis to that in a base environment, we model a lost range could be around 3%. And then in a stress environment you could get two to three times that in losses. Obviously comfortable with how that plays out last year.","Steven Duong","And just a final question, your construction loan portfolio you had some good year-over-year growth. Can you give us some color on that? What's driving the growth you're underwriting, the property types, where you're seeing the strongest growth et cetera?","Greg Carmichael","So a couple of things, first of all the growth that you did see was really primarily driven with fundings under legacy construction facilities, frankly are beginning this season were coming towards the end of a cycle. In our opinion, we're being much more say prudent about our assets selection, our client selection.","As you may recall, we previously after the great recession really pulled together on expert underwriting group with some talent versus having underwriting done out in the regions that's producing some excellent results, the asset quality and portfolio continues to be very, very strong.","But as you look out this year, I wouldn't expect to see significant growth out of that portfolio's as we've previously shared. But to the last part of your question, we have really pivoted to some other asset classes away from multi-family a year ago, probably half of our production would have been in multi-family, today it's less than a quarter, as we really focus on those assets that we believe will have more economic scale to them and make sure that we are appropriately exposed to the commercial real estate market in the event of a cycle turn.","Operator","And I will now like to turn the call over to Sameer Gokhale for some final comments.","Sameer Gokhale","Great, thank you Tamiya.
