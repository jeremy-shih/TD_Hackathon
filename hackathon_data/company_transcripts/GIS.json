During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded Wednesday, June 27, 2018. Now, I would like to turn the conference over to Jeff Siemon, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Jeff Siemon","Thanks, Stanley and good morning everybody. I am here with Jeff Harmening, our Chairman and CEO and Don Mulligan, our CFO. And I will hand the call over to them in a moment. But before I do, I will cover a few housekeeping items.","Our press release on fourth quarter and full year earnings was issued over the wire services earlier this morning and you can find a release and a copy of the slides that supplement this morning\u2019s remarks on our Investor Relations website. And I will remind you that our remarks this morning will include forward-looking statements that are based on management\u2019s current views and assumptions. Second slide on today\u2019s presentation was factors that could cause our future results to be different than our current estimates.","Included in our press release this morning was a reminder that we will be reporting results of our newly acquired Blue Buffalo business on a 1-month lag to our corporate calendar. We took a similar approach in previous acquisitions, including Annie\u2019s, Yoki and Yoplait International. As a result, our fiscal 2018 financials do not include net sales or operating profit from Blue Buffalo, though our 2018 earnings per share do include the impact of higher shares and interest due to the acquisition financing. Don will provide details on the impact of Blue Buffalo on our 2019 financials later in the presentation.","Finally, I will note that starting with the first quarter of fiscal \u201819 we will be adopting a new presentation of pension, post-retirement and post-employment benefit expenses. This will separate the service costs from other benefit related expenses or income which will be below operating profit. When we report our first quarter earnings in September, we will provide you visibility to how the new income statement presentation will impact our 2019 adjusted operating profit growth rate and related guidance. So, it will not impact earnings per share, or EPS growth.","And with that, I will turn you over to my colleagues beginning with Jeff.","Jeff Harmening","Thanks, Jeff and good morning, everyone. Fiscal 2018 represented an important step in returning General Mills to sustainable top line growth. We finished the year on a positive note in the fourth quarter delivering top and bottom line results that met or exceeded our most recent guidance, including a third consecutive quarter of organic net sales growth as well as strong growth in profit, margins and earnings per share. We made significant progress against our global growth priorities in fiscal 2018. We competed more effectively improving our organic net sales trends by 400 basis points over the course of the year.","We enhanced our capabilities in e-commerce and strategic revenue management and we moved to reshape our portfolio for future growth with the acquisition of Blue Buffalo, a fast-growing, highly profitable business that is leading the transformation of the U.S. pet category. We are pleased with our broad-based top line performance and we know there is more work to do to address rising costs and deliver better results on the bottom line. As we turn to fiscal 2019, we will continue to follow our Consumer First strategy and invest behind our global growth priorities to accelerate our topline growth again. We are also keenly focused on maintaining our efficiency in this more inflationary cost environment, and we have initiatives underway to help protect our profitability and continue to drive cash flow.","On Slide 5, you can see the key financial performance metrics for our fourth quarter. Net sales totaled $3.9 billion, up 2% from last year. Organic net sales increased 1%, driven by a positive net price realization and mix across all four segments. We saw particularly good net sales performance on our accelerate platforms, including Snack Bars, H\u00e4agen-Dazs, and Old El Paso. Importantly, we gained share again in U.S. cereal in the quarter despite a double-digit reduction in merchandising. And we grew our U.S. yogurt market share in the quarter for the first time in 3 years. Segment operating profit in the quarter totaled $727 million, up 7% in constant currency reflecting favorable net price realization and mix, benefits from cost saving initiatives and lower SG&A expenses. Adjusted operating profit margin increased 170 basis points versus last year. In addition, adjusted diluted EPS totaled $0.79, an increase of 7% in constant currency. This result included a 7 point headwind from higher net interest and shares related to Blue Buffalo financing.","Turning to the full year results, fiscal 2018 net sales of $15.7 billion were up 1% as reported and were flat to last year on an organic basis. Organic sales growth in our convenience stores and foodservice and European and Australian segments was offset by declines in North America retail and Asia and Latin America. From a platform standpoint, net sales growth was led by our Natural & Organic, Snack Bars, and H\u00e4agen-Dazs businesses, while yogurt declines moderated significantly from year ago trends.","Total segment operating profit of $2.8 billion declined 6% in constant currency. We delivered another strong year of HMM savings and we reached our restructuring savings goal. However, those results were not enough to offset unexpectedly high freight and raw material inflation, increases in other operating costs and higher merchandising. Full year adjusted operating profit was down 90 basis points. Adjusted diluted EPS were $3.11 essentially matching year ago levels in constant currency. This included a 2 point headwind from incremental interest in shares related to the Blue Buffalo financing.","Finally and importantly, we delivered an excellent year of cash generation with free cash flow up 28% over year ago levels. Earlier this year, we outlined three global priorities to return our business to consistent topline growth; compete effectively everywhere we play across all brands and geographies, accelerate growth on four key platforms we have leading brands, capabilities, and attractive margins; and which play in faster growing categories, and reshape our portfolio for growth through acquisitions and divestitures. We made progress against each of these priorities in fiscal 2018. Most of the improvement in our organic sales growth last year was driven by competing more effectively around the world. At the beginning of the year, we said we would grow our global cereal business in fiscal 2018 and we accomplished that goal.","We grew retail sales and market share in the U.S. behind strong marketing campaigns like Good Goes Round on Cheerios and Unicorn Marshmallow news on Lucky Charms. We secured increased in-store displays at higher price points resulting in improved merchandising performance, and we launched the biggest innovation in the U.S. category this year with chocolate peanut butter Cheerios. CPW net sales were flat in constant currency in fiscal 2018 with growth in Asia and the Middle East offset by declines in the Western Europe and we grew cereal in our Convenience Stores & Foodservice segment, including K-12 schools and colleges and universities leveraging our strong taste brands like Cinnamon Toast Crunch, our broad portfolio of gluten-free cereals, including Cheerios and Chex and our granola brands led by Cascadian Farms.","In U.S. yogurt, our goal was to significantly improve our performance by innovating in faster growing segments of the category. Thanks in large part to our Oui by Yoplait and Yoplait Mix-in innovations, the two biggest launches in the category in fiscal \u201818, we dramatically reduced our net sales declines and drove share growth in the fourth quarter. We also competed more effectively in fiscal \u201818 across a number of regional businesses. We got in the zone on merchandising in the key seasons on our U.S. soup, refrigerated dough and dessert businesses, and we supplemented that with targeted investment, including a new advertising campaign on Pillsbury and a new line of Progresso organic soups. As a result, we saw significant improvement in retail sales performance and we grew market share in aggregate on these businesses for the year. Also on our Wanchai Ferry frozen dumplings business in China, we launched premium innovation and expanded distribution, helping drive double-digit top line growth in 2018.","As consumers rapidly evolve the way, they buy their food our e-commerce capability is becoming increasingly critical to our ability to compete successfully and we are continuing to leverage our advantage in this space. Our global e-commerce business grew at almost 50% in fiscal 2018, including nearly 70% in North America. Our full basket market shares online continue to over-index relative to the fiscal stores in both the U.S. and Europe, and General Mills is seen as the key strategic partner for our e-commerce retail customers bringing differential insights and solutions to drive growth. On our four accelerate platforms, H\u00e4agen-Dazs, Snack Bars, Old El Paso and Natural & Organic, we expanded distribution, launched innovation, and increased brand awareness in fiscal 2018, laying the foundation to accelerate their growth in 2019.","H\u00e4agen-Dazs retail sales were up double-digits in 2018 as we broadened distribution of mini-cups and stick bars across Europe and Asia, modernized the brand with the rollout of new packaging and a global advertising campaign and continue to launch remarkable innovations like Green Tea Mochi, peanut butter flavors and limited edition flower flavors. Retail sales for our snack bars were up low single-digits in fiscal 2018 with growth across all geographies, including North America, Europe, Asia and Latin America. New layered bars and soft baked filled squares generated growth for Nature Valley in the U.S. and our businesses in Europe and Mexico leveraged our U.S. product pipeline to accelerate Nature Valley sales. Fiber One has been a drag on results in the U.S. as we right-sized the business and focused our shelf presence on the best turning items. But we saw excellent growth for Fiber One in Europe and Australia, where the brand is relatively new by expanding distribution and driving brand awareness with increased media support and increased availability and awareness drove strong double-digit growth for L\u00e4rabar in the U.S. and our Pillsbury snack bar business in India.","Old El Paso performance in 2018 was mixed, with overall retail sales up low single-digit digits. Retail sales in Europe and Australia were down modestly as more competitive category dynamics in France and Australia offset good performance in the UK and Nordics. We drove retail sales growth in North America behind our Anything Goes In campaign as well as execution of initiatives to secure front of store display allowing us to reach the Old El Paso consumers before they pass the produced aisle. For our North American Natural & Organic portfolio, retail sales were up mid single-digits in 2018, which represents a slowdown from the prior year as we exited some tail SKUs and channel-specific product lines. We continue to see stronger growth in our core products such as Annie's Mac and Cheese and bunny grahams, Cascadian Farm\u2019s cereal and EPIC meat snacks. Beyond measured channels, our Natural & Organic brands are driving our growth in e-commerce as early adopters for food online tend to over-index toward Natural & Organic brands. Overall, these four platforms led our growth in fiscal \u201818 and I am confident we will see them accelerate in 2019 as we invest a lot of innovation, expand distribution and increase brand awareness.","Our third global growth priority is reshaping our portfolio for growth and we took a major step in this direction in fiscal 2018 with the acquisition of Blue Buffalo, the leading brand in the fast-growing wholesome and natural pet food category in the U.S. The transaction closed on April 24 and we are moving full steam ahead with our transition plans working to bring General Mills expertise to bear where it\u2019s needed and ensuring we stay out of their way when it is not. I am very pleased to report that Blue Buffalo\u2019s solid business momentum has continued. Year-to-date through April, net sales continue to grow double-digits driven by expansion in the food drug and mass channels and aggressive growth in e-commerce, which are more than offsetting declines in the pet specialty channel that are in line with our expectations. This spring, we successfully started up our new treat facility in Joplin, Missouri and we expect to start production at the new Richmond, Indiana factory at the end of the summer, which will help us fuel further distribution expansion. I am confident in our ability to deliver on our plans for continued growth for Blue Buffalo in fiscal 2019. Billy Bishop will share more about those plans at our Investor Day event in two weeks.","On that note, let me review our company\u2019s three key priorities for fiscal 2019, which are summarized on Slide 11. First, we plan to grow our core by competing more effectively and accelerating our differential growth platforms. We expect to deliver further improvement in yogurt in 2019 as we continue to drive innovation in faster growing spaces in the category. We are launching some fantastic new products around the world this year, including a new platform in the U.S. that offers consumers a modern approach to weight management by delivering a simply better yogurt with high protein and less sugar. We will continue to compete more effectively in cereal in 2019 behind great consumer news and innovation like Cheerios Oat Crunch, that\u2019s hitting the U.S. shelves this month.","We have strong plans across many regional brands, including new product news on Totino's hot snacks, Progresso soup, Betty Crocker desserts and Wanchai Ferry dumplings. In total, we expect to grow our global net sales from innovation in fiscal 2019. We also expect to improve our growth in emerging markets, which underperformed in fiscal 2018. With lingering effects from Brazil\u2019s enterprise reporting system implementation now behind us, we expect to see better results in Latin America in 2019 and we are investing in accelerate plans for H\u00e4agen-Dazs and Snack Bars in Asia. On Old El Paso, we will build on the strong 2018 fourth quarter in Europe and Australia driven by new gluten-free tortillas and will strengthen our Natural & Organic business with news on Annie\u2019s Mac and Cheese as well as increased distribution on core EPIC meat bars and new EPIC performance bars. We will tell you more about all of these and other 2019 accelerate initiatives at Investor Day.","Our second key priority is to successfully transition Blue Buffalo into the General Mills portfolio. Our focus in fiscal 2019 is on continuing the expansion into the food, drug and mass channel, while pressing our advantage in e-commerce and maintaining our strength in the important pet specialty channels. We will also ensure smooth startup of the Richmond facility and we will grow the BLUE brand\u2019s relevance with pet parents behind superior communication and brand building support. We are confident that by leveraging the best of Blue Buffalo and General Mills will continue this business\u2019 track record of double-digit top line growth and even faster bottom line growth in fiscal 2019.","Our final priority for 2019 is to deliver our commitments on profit and cash by executing with excellence across the organization. To combat elevated input cost inflation, we will increase our cost of goods HMM savings this year driven by full year benefits from our new global sourcing initiative. We will also begin the process of streamlining our North American logistics network, taking miles out of our system and optimizing inventory levels. Beyond HMM we will look to drive price realization by leveraging our strategic revenue management capability. We came a long way in fiscal 2018 to build our SRM expertise. We hired an expert in the beverage industry to lead this effort, we brought in other external hires and combined them with internal talent who knows General Mills and our categories and we have developed systems, analytical tools and consistent methodology for identifying the best opportunities for price realization by brand and geography. In fiscal \u201819 we are taking actions against these opportunities leveraging a wide range of SRM levers including price pack architecture changes, trade optimization, mix management and list price increases.","As we expect slightly higher benefits from assets, we expect slightly higher benefits from price mix in fiscal 2019 compared to last year. We will also look to build on our track record of cash generation by capitalizing on opportunities to further decrease our core working capital. With those priorities in mind and including the addition of Blue Buffalo, we expect to deliver on the fiscal 2019 targets laid out on Slide 12. Namely, we expected net sales to increase 9% to 10%. We are targeting 6% to 9% growth in adjusted operating profit and constant currency and we expect constant currency adjusted diluted earnings per share to range between flat and down 3% reflecting the investments we are making to build capabilities and accelerate growth as well as the impact of purchase accounting from the Blue Buffalo acquisition.","With that, I will turn it over to Don Mulligan to review our fiscal 2018 results and 2019 outlook in more detail.","Don Mulligan","Thanks Jeff and good morning everyone. Jeff provided a summary of our fourth quarter financial results and I will share a few additional details starting with the components of net sales growth on Slide 14. Organic net sales increased 1% driven by positive net price realization and mix across all four segments, partially offset by lower contributions from organic volume growth. Foreign currency translation was a one point benefit to net sales.","Turning to our segment results on Slide 15, North America retail organic net sales were down 1% in the fourth quarter and for the full year. This represents a 400 basis point improvement over our fiscal \u201817 growth rate driven by solid fundamental execution including better innovation, more compelling marketing and consumer news and stronger in-store merchandising. These efforts translated to market share growth for 7 of our top 9 categories in the U.S. in fiscal \u201818.","At the operating unit level, U.S. snacks posted 2% net sales growth in the quarter and for the full year driven by Nature Valley innovation and product news on L\u00e4rabar and fruit snacks. U.S. cereal grew net sales 2% in the quarter behind effective consumer news on core brands, including Lucky Charms and seasonal varieties of Cheerios and Reese\u2019s Puffs. Full year U.S. cereal net sales were flat while we estimate retail sales grew 1% including non-measured channels. On a constant currency basis, Canada net sales declined 5% in the quarter or down 1% for the full year. U.S. meals and baking net sales were down 2% in the quarter and were flat for the full year with increases in Annie\u2019s Mac and Cheese, Totino\u2019s hot snacks and Betty Crocker desserts offsetting declines on Helpers and specialty potatoes.","U.S. yogurt net sales were down 5% in the quarter marking the fourth consecutive quarter of improvement as declines on Greek and [indiscernible] segments were partially offset by contributions from Oui by Yoplait and Yoplait mix and innovations. Constant currency segment operating profits increased 7% in the fourth quarter due to positive net price realization mix, increased HMM savings from global sourcing and lower SG&A expenses partially offset by input costs inflation. Full year segment operating profit declined 4% in constant currency driven by input cost inflation, higher operational costs and increased merchandising partially offset by lower SG&A.","In Convenience Stores & Foodservice fourth quarter organic net sales were up 5% led by strong performance on our frozen meals, cereals and snacks platforms. Fruit snacks in our Pillsbury stuffed waffle performed well in C-stores while our cereal offerings continue to generate good growth in foodservice channels. Full year organic net sales were up 3% driven by growth on the focused six platforms and benefits from index pricing on bakery flour. Segment operating profit increased 11% in the fourth quarter driven by benefits from net price realization and cost savings initiatives partially offset by higher transportation costs and commodity inflation.","Full year segment operating profit declined 2% reflecting higher input cost partially offset by positive net price realization and benefits from cost savings initiatives that accelerated in the back half of the year. Our Europe and Australia segment finished the fiscal year with positive momentum and delivered a solid year on the top line. Organic net sales increased 4% in the fourth quarter driven by strong growth on snack bars, H\u00e4agen-Dazs and Old El Paso. Full year organic net sales were up 2%. Constant currency segment operating profit increased 37% in the quarter due to favorable sales mix, net price realization and benefits from cost savings initiatives. Full year segment operating profit was down 22% in constant currency driven by significant raw material inflation and currency driven inflation on products imported into the UK.","In our Asia and Latin America segment, organic net sales were flat in the fourth quarter and down 2% for the full year. Remember that last year\u2019s fourth quarter included an extra month of results in Brazil as we aligned net business to our fiscal calendar. Excluding that difference, organic net sales would have been up double-digits in the quarter led by continued growth in H\u00e4agen-Dazs in Asia, Wanchai Ferry in China and our snacks businesses in India and Latin America. Segment operating profit declined $13 million in the quarter driven by higher input cost and SG&A expenses as well as the impact of the reporting difference. For the full year, segment operating profit was $40 million compared to $84 million a year ago.","Turning to margins on Slide 19, we delivered 70 basis points of improvements in our adjusted gross margin and a 170 basis point increase in our adjusted operating profit margin in the fourth quarter driven by positive net price realization in mix, increased benefits from cost savings initiatives and lower SG&A expenses. Full year margins were down year-over-year due to higher input cost inflation, operational cost and merchandising partially offset by HMM savings, positive net price realization and lower SG&A expenses, including an 8% decline in media.","Slide 20 summarizes our full year joint venture results. Jeff already shared fiscal \u201818 sales results for CPW. H\u00e4agen-Dazs Japan constant currency net sales were up 1% for the full year driven by volume growth on core mini cups. Combined after-tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $85 million for the year, down 3% in constant currency, primarily driven by input cost inflation, especially on vanilla for HDJ and a restructuring charge on CPW.","Slide 21 summarizes other noteworthy income statement items in the fourth quarter. Restructuring and impairment charges totaled $151 million, including $97 million of impairment charges related to the Yoki, Mountain High and Immaculate Baking brand intangible assets. Corporate and allocated expenses, excluding $30 million related to acquisition transaction cost as well as other items affecting comparability, decreased $23 million from a year ago driven by various non-recurring items. Net interest expense increased $68 million. Approximately half of that increase was due to incremental interest paid on newly issued debt and the remaining portion was related to the bridge term loan financing of the Blue Buffalo acquisition, which was excluded from adjusted earnings. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 26.7% compared to 26.8% a year ago and average diluted shares outstanding increased 1% in the quarter reflecting the additional equity raised in March as part of the Blue Buffalo financing.","Slide 22 provides our balance sheet and cash flow highlights for fiscal \u201818. Our year end core working capital balance totaled $580 million, down 27% versus the prior year as benefits from our terms extension program more than offset higher receivables and inventory balances from consolidating Blue Buffalo\u2019s assets acquired in the fourth quarter. Full year operating cash flow was $2.8 billion, up 18% from a year ago primarily driven by improvements in working capital. Fiscal \u201818 capital investments totaled $623 million or 4% of company net sales. Full year free cash flow grew 28% to $2.2 billion, which represents a 120% conversion rate on our adjusted after tax earnings and we paid $1.1 billion in dividends in fiscal \u201818.","Slide 23 highlights some key financial assumptions for fiscal \u201819. We expect input cost inflation to be approximately 5%, 1 point higher than fiscal \u201818 levels. We are roughly 40% covered on our global commodity positions at this point in the year. We are targeting cost of goods sold, HMM savings of approximately $450 million, which is ahead of year ago levels driven by a full year benefit from our global sourcing initiatives. We planned significant growth investments in our accelerate platforms, especially H\u00e4agen-Dazs and snack bars as well as in global capabilities like e-commerce. These initiatives will enhance our growth in fiscal \u201819 and will drive further acceleration in 2020 and beyond. Below the profit line, we expect net interest expense to total approximately $550 million driven by higher debt levels resulting from the Blue Buffalo financing. We are planning for an adjusted effective tax rate of 23% to 24%, reflecting a full year impact of U.S. tax reform. We anticipate average diluted shares to increase roughly 4% driven by our equity issuance. And we expect the Blue Buffalo deal to be approximately $0.04 dilutive in fiscal \u201819 adjusted diluted EPS. This includes $0.09 of non-cash expenses from the inventory stepup and purchase price amortization charges.","Based on these assumptions Slide 24 summarizes our fiscal 2019 outlook for our key financial metrics. As Jeff noted reported net sales were expected to increase 9% to 10% including the additional of Blue Buffalo. We project organic net sales to range between flat and up 1%. On operating profit we have made a change to our historical practice of guiding to total segment operating profit and instead we are providing guidance on adjusted operating profit which includes corporate items. For fiscal \u201819 we estimate cost and currency adjusted operating profit will increase 6% to 9% from the base of $2.7 billion reported in fiscal 2018 with 11 points of growth coming from Blue Buffalo inclusive of the purchase accounting effect. Constant currency adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range between flat and down 3% from the base of $3.11 earned in fiscal \u201818. We are targeting free cash flow conversion of at least 95% of adjusted after tax earnings. And as Jeff noted earlier these targets include another year of double digit top line and even stronger bottom line growth for Blue Buffalo in fiscal \u201819 excluding the impact of purchase accounting.","Let me also comment briefly on our view of phasing for the year. Blue Buffalo purchase accounting will be a $0.07 drag in EPS in Q1 driven by the inventory step up. In addition, while we entered the year with the high levels of input cost inflation we expect price mix benefits from SRM will build over the course of the year. As a result, we expect constant currency adjusted diluted EPS will be down double digits in the first quarter and will strengthen through the rest of the year.","With that let me turn it back over to Jeff for some closing remarks.","Jeff Harmening","Thanks, Don and let me close with some final thoughts. We took an important first step in fiscal 2018 returning our business to sustainable top line growth and we are leveraging our compete, accelerate and reshape growth priorities to further improve our growth profile going forward. In 2019, we are investing behind capabilities and accelerate platforms to get our core business back to growth and we will successfully transition Blue Buffalo into the portfolio and there is more work to do on reshaping the portfolio, including divestitures from some growth dilutive business. We are taking actions on our margins as well.","In fiscal 2019, we will deliver higher HMM savings and we will see increased benefits from strategic revenue management and administrative cost savings actions announced last quarter. Still, those won\u2019t be enough to fully offset higher inflation and the incremental growth investments we are making this year. So, we are also working on additional initiatives that will primarily drive efficiencies beyond 2019, including our logistics network reorganization, further enterprise process transformation efforts and initiatives to improve our international margins. And we continue to see opportunities to reduce working capital and drive free cash flow growth. In summary, we are committed to our consumer for strategy and our global growth priorities. We are also confident that we are on the right path to consistently generate profitable growth and top tier returns for our shareholders.","With that, we will wrap up our prepared remarks and open the call for questions. Operator, can you please get us started?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much. [Operator Instructions] And we will get to our first question on the line from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bryan Spillane","Hey, good morning everyone.","Jeff Harmening","Good morning.","Bryan Spillane","Just had, I guess, a question about gross profits in fiscal \u201819. And I guess two questions. One, I think if I did the HMM math correct, it seems to imply that you will need about a point or little more than \u2013 or between 1 point and 2 points of price mix in order to sort of hold gross margins flat for the year, is that the right way to think about it?","Jeff Harmening","Yes, Bryan, it is. As we have said with higher inflation even at 5%, given our HMM pricing of 1% or 2% is enough to combine with HMM to offset that level of inflation. That\u2019s the way to think about our FY19 gross margin.","Bryan Spillane","Okay. And then I guess so as we are modeling it out, is -- we are looking at the operating profit growth expectation for the year, is the assumption that you will be able to get -- hold gross margins flat for this year or might that not be the case?","Jeff Harmening","Well, we would expect it to be flat or better, especially with the inclusion of Blue Buffalo, with the increase we will get from Blue Buffalo in the year.","Bryan Spillane","Okay, alright. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. We\u2019ll get to our next question on the line from the line of Ken Goldman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Ken Goldman","Hi, good morning. Jeff Harmening, I guess, I was curious for your take on this. One of the questions I get on this space in general is how do we get out of the pendulum cycle, where for a certain period of time, companies in the food space focus on margins and then for a certain period of time they focus on sales, and they may have to invest to get those sales, it feels like from a General Mills\u2019 perspective, right now Mills is focusing more on the topline willing to sacrifice some margin in the short term, when do we, in your view, get to the period where we have sustainable topline growth and margin growth where you are not necessarily investing more every year to get to that topline growth. Is that a late 2019 thing, I am just trying to get a sense of your timing for that, because without that, it\u2019s hard just for you to get that bottom line growth that the space used to have?","Jeff Harmening","Yes. I think, Ken, I think it\u2019s a fair question. What I would say is that the key for us as I have talked about is to try to get to the middle of the boat. On the one hand, on the one side of the boat, all we are going to do is drive cost savings, and the other side of the boat is driving growth without regard to what your profit is. I think the key for us is to get to the middle of the boat. And what you\u2019ve have seen from us over this last year and what you will see next year is a greater emphasis on top line growth than we have had, but it\u2019s certainly not at the expense of efficiency. And so, we are driving better topline growth across all of our four segments, and we are planning to do that in fiscal \u201819. At the same time, we are continuing to drive efficiencies. I think that\u2019s why I laid out that HMM is going be increasing next year. We took some administrative actions in the fourth quarter to reduce our admin load and we are looking at redoing our logistics network. And so for us the key is to get in the middle of the boat. As we look at 2019, one of the things that we realize that we will have to do is we will have to make some investments in growth capabilities in order to drive that continued growth. I am really pleased with the 400 basis point improvement that we made this year, if we can make another 100 basis point improvement next year that will give us a long way to get back to sustainable growth. And if you add on top of that, another maybe 75 points of organic growth from the growth of Blue Buffalo, you start to get to a place where you are between 1% and 2% growth. So, we feel like we have made significant improvements in \u201818. We will take another big step forward in \u201819. And my hope is that in the next year or after that, we can get back to a sustainable level, which is about 3% topline growth. So, we feel like we are making good progress on that front and the key for us is to invest in the right capabilities whether it\u2019s e-commerce or growth things like capabilities and H\u00e4agen-Dazs for driving freezers or things like that and to make sure we are doing that while maintaining our efficiency.","Ken Goldman","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. We will get to our next question on the line from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please go ahead with your question.","Chris Growe","Hi, good morning. I just had a question for you, if I could first of all on \u2013 one of the things that was a big factor here for the fourth quarter was freight inflation, so I want to understand perhaps to Don, how much of that 5% inflation would you say is driven by freight cost being up year-over-year?","Jeff Harmening","Yes, our logistics costs, we expect to be higher than that 5%. So, it is driving it up. We also expect to to see the heavier weight of that in the first part of the year because it accelerated and F18 unfolded, so both expected to be one of the key drivers of our inflation and to be just a little bit more frontloaded.","Chris Growe","Okay. And just a quick question if I could ask in relation to Blue Buffalo, you have a lag in the way you are reporting that business, is there an extra month that comes through in the year in terms of the way you report that extra month that take us to kind of the month of May, if you will?","Jeff Harmening","Yes, not in fiscal \u201819. At some point, we would expect it to align with our reporting calendar, but that\u2019s not baked into our fiscal \u201819 plan or guidance.","Chris Growe","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. We will get to our next question on the line from Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.","Lubi Kutua","Good morning. This is actually Lubi on for Akshay. Apologies if I missed this earlier, but how should we think about organic sales growth in the North American retail business for fiscal \u201819, are there any sort of puts and takes that we should be thinking about here in the new year?","Jeff Harmening","We didn\u2019t give any guidance for segment growth and we will talk more about what we expect out of our segments at our investor meeting in a couple of weeks. What I will say is that if you look at our business next year, not only for North America retail, but in general, I would expect it to get incrementally better again on yogurt in the U.S. I mean, we were down over 20% in the first quarter and reduced that to minus 5% in the fourth quarter and we like our innovation coming out and Oui is doing well. And so I would certainly hope that and plan in the coming year that our yogurt business will continue to get better. We actually gained share in the fourth quarter. And I think more broadly as we look at this as an organization, we had a rough first half in Brazil and not great in Asia, but we really accelerated growth in the back half of the year in those geographies behind our growth platforms, namely snack bars like in India and in the Middle East and H\u00e4agen-Dazs and Wanchai Ferry in China and so I would expect incremental growth for us to come in our emerging markets, particularly with Brazil as we are lapping the systems implementation and in China where we saw lot of growth coming in the second half of the year.","Lubi Kutua","Yes, thanks. But so just to follow-up on that in North America, obviously the organic sales growth trends over the last several quarters have improved quite a bit, would you do expect in fiscal \u201819 to see positive organic sales growth in North America?","Jeff Harmening","Well, look we will talk about that in detail in a couple weeks. I don\u2019t mean to dodge the question, but I guess I will dodge the question only to say that we will talk more about that. What I will say is that one of the things I am really pleased about in our North America business is how broad our growth was. I mean, we gained share in 7 out of 9 categories this year, including on many of our \u2013 most important categories, those categories represent 80% of our business. And I think when some folks talk about the year we had, they talk about kind of lapping a tough year, a year ago, which is certainly true and we gained share in soup and we did better on refrigerated baked goods, but the really the gains were broad-based, if you look across our bars business, you look across yogurt we improved, you look across cereal we improved. And so that momentum I think will carry into next year in particular, I think we get underestimated is that we came in the year with a distribution drag. We are down about 4, 5 points of distribution and we are exiting the fourth quarter with distribution relatively flat. We have been gaining distribution, in fact, we have been gaining distribution in categories like cereal and so that will be a tailwind for us that Jon Nudi will speak more about in a couple of weeks.","Lubi Kutua","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. I will get back in queue.","Operator","Thank you very much. We will get to our next question on the line from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jason English","Hey, good morning folks. Thank you for letting me ask a question. I am actually going to try to jam two questions in here. First, we obviously we came into the year with a lot of talk about this transitory paying on trade spend accrual with this anticipation of a sizable reversal late this year. You didn\u2019t make any comments about it. So can you comment now and maybe give us some quantification of how much of that reversal benefit was evident in fourth quarter results?","Don Mulligan","Yes, Jason, this is Don. We came through as we had indicated again with a year-over-year comparison, so it wasn\u2019t so much what we had to do in \u201818 is what the quirk of our \u201817 recognition. So we through as we expected, that\u2019s what allowed us to bring our operating profit or segment operating profit in on guidance. So it came in at the magnitude we had guided before.","Jeff Harmening","Yes, so we said about \u2013 it was about 100 basis points in the first half of the year, a negative about 100 basis points positive in the second half and you see that flow through as we saw little bit better price mix appreciation in the third quarter. That was a piece of it.","Jason English","That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And the question on the guidance, you are guiding to sort of ex-Buff, EBIT down 4% to 5% I think for the year, but you are guiding organic sales flat to up, you are guiding to in response to Spillane\u2019s question for flattish gross margins, what\u2019s driving the underlying standalone EBIT decline?","Don Mulligan","Yes. So, our guidance for EBIT in total is 6% to 9% growth, 11 points of that coming from Blue Buffalo, so you can do the math on what the base business is going to do down low single-digits, so maybe 5%. So, what\u2019s driving that, we already see it in total, getting the benefit of accretion from Blue Buffalo. We are getting benefit from HMM, from increased HMM and from our pricing as well. But the headwinds are higher level of inflation. We are seeing \u2013 be embedded in that of course is the purchase price accounting for Blue Buffalo. That\u2019s part of the 11% from Blue Buffalo. But most importantly below the gross margin, we are seeing increase in growth driving capability investments and accelerate investments. Jeff talked about many of these as we think about driving and putting additional investment behind H\u00e4agen-Dazs, Snack Bars, Old El Paso, e-commerce continuing to build our data analytical capabilities to drive SRM. All those are embedded in below the gross margin line. We also frankly have about $40 million incentive true-up year-over-year and then I mentioned a couple of discrete favorable non-recurring items in our Q4 corporate items that will lap as well.","Jason English","Okay, thank you. I will pass it on.","Operator","Thank you very much. We will get to our next question on the line from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow","Hi, thank you Jeff and Don. There was a comment during the script saying that your merchandising levels were actually down in fourth quarter and I guess that means like in terms of retail activity, can you help explain why that was year-over-year and then what kind of merchandising activity do you expect in fiscal \u201819 do you expect to have equal amounts, more amounts trying to understand that? And then just one little thing I think you said your inflation number embeds the purchase accounting increase, this didn\u2019t sound like real, like commodity inflation. Did I hear that right? Thanks.","Don Mulligan","No, you did not hear that right, 5% doesn\u2019t include any impact from the purchase accounting.","Jeff Harmening","Don was saying it will be 11 points of impact of EBIT growth includes the purchase accounting for Blue Buffalo.","Robert Moskow","Okay, thank you.","Jeff Harmening","Rob, you had a question about merchandising in Q4, I think the reference I had in the script was to our cereal merchandising, which was down double-digits. And I mentioned that only because there has been a lot of commentary about have we just bought share in cereal merchandising up, I think it\u2019s really important that people listening this call understand that we actually drove share growth in cereal in the fourth quarter with merchandising being down double-digits, which really speaks to our baseline or our non-promoted business, which was up over 2% during the quarter. And the reason why that\u2019s important, I mean, we had really good new products, our marketing is terrific, I highlighted Lucky Charms and Cheerios. I could also highlight Cinnamon Toast Crunch or Reese\u2019s Puffs. And so as we look at this year, we are really pleased with our cereal business and the fact that we could grow share in the fourth quarter with merchandising being down double-digits, I think speaks to what we have been talking about, which is the strength of our marketing ideas and our marketing execution in cereal. As we look at next year, Jon Nudi, you will talk more about that in a couple of weeks, so I will leave that to him. But I think we will see some tailwinds from new products on our U.S. business as we will for our business in general. And also distribution, I think that\u2019s probably something that people underestimated that we came in this year with some distribution gaps, because we discontinued a lot of SKUs. And as we look at fiscal \u201819 we look to either hold steady or grow our distribution just on the basis of our broad top line momentum. And so Jon will talk more about that in a couple of weeks.","Robert Moskow","Yes, just to follow-up, when you grow your distribution, does that come with higher slotting fees also?","Jeff Harmening","In the U.S., slotting fees are not a huge expense in general. They come with some slotting fees, but that\u2019s not a huge cost driver for us.","Robert Moskow","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. We will get to our next question on the line from Pablo Zuanic with SIG. Please go ahead with your question.","Pablo Zuanic","Thank you. Just two questions. So Jeff on the pricing front obviously significant improvement globally and also in the U.S. can you just put some context for that, you know we hear all this commentary about tough retail environment, retailer pressures being difficult for CPG companies to get pricing through and obviously pricing was a big labor for your company\u2019s quarter in terms of improving gross margins. So just help us understand that what has changed or maybe nothing has changed and the pricing power was there all along, it was just a matter of timing? And then the second very brief question just on Blue Buffalo, can\u2019t you \u2013 I am trying to do a math in terms of the underlying sales growth you are projecting and obviously you are adding \u2013 it\u2019s adding 9% of sales in fiscal year \u201819 but we don\u2019t know exactly what the base is? So just some comments in terms of underlying growth there and bearing the projection, and if you can any comments in terms of is the Indiana plant on Cheerios, I know you said late summer how aggressive can the entry be into FDM in fiscal year \u201919, i.e., Walmart. Any color you would give there in terms of sales trends and outlook for Blue Buffalo would feel? Thanks.","Jeff Harmening","Alright, Pablo. Let me try take those one at a time and if I miss one, it\u2019s not on purpose, but as we look at Q4 and pricing, I think the first thing to recognize when it comes to strategic revenue management, you see this in our first quarter, if you talk about pricing, there really are a lot of levers, including mix. And in our fourth quarter, we drove a lot of positive mix and I give you a couple of examples in Europe, these accelerators that we have talked about like H\u00e4agen-Dazs and Old El Paso and bars, not only are they in fast growing categories, but they are also mix accretive. And so to the extent we accelerate growth on those, you see come through in the pricing, you come and see it come through on our margins you see it come through in profitability. And so in our fourth quarter in Asia and in Europe, you saw quite a bit of mix. And so you will see that in the \u2013 in the U.S. you will see a pullback in merchandising a little bit in the fourth quarter and that drove about a point of pricing for us in the fourth quarter. And so as we talk and think about pricing, it really is pricing and mix. So, there are lot of different levers associated with that.","In terms of the commentary on what\u2019s changed, if you look more broadly, I mean we saw in 2018 about 2% pricing across our categories in North America as opposed to 1% pricing the year before. So in our category themselves, we have seen again product mix as a part of that, but we have seen some pricing appreciation. I think it\u2019s because the external environment has changed and we are all seeing higher inflation whether it\u2019s on logistics or whether it\u2019s on labor cost and manufacturing or whether it\u2019s on input cost. And no one wants to lead with pricing we are all trying to become more efficient just like we are with our logistics network and HMM. That\u2019s certainly the first line of defense, but when you get to \u2013 when you get to levels of inflation for us that reached 4% and in this current fiscal year and we are projecting at 5%, you need a little bit of pricing in addition to all those other cost levers to offset it and I think we are seeing that broadly. The other theme and I am not sure that you asked us, but I want \u2013 I think it\u2019s important is that there has been a lot of commentary about retailer competition. There certainly is a lot of retailer competition and particularly about e-commerce and I don\u2019t want this point to go by, but we grew our e-commerce business by 50% globally this past year and 70% in North America and we over-index in the categories we compete, including about a 120 index on our full basket sales relative to what we have in brick-and-mortar. And so there has been a lot of talk in the industry about kind of e-commerce being the death of brands and especially food brands and all we keep doing is growing our e-commerce business and growing our share within it. And so we are particularly pleased about that and that\u2019s why we are going to continue invest in that capability as we look into F19.","Then you asked a question about Blue Buffalo and I am not going to give specifics about our distribution plans, Billy Bishop will talk about Blue Buffalo later. What I will say is that when it comes to supply chain that we got a treat facility up online, a little bit ahead of schedule and the Richmond facility is due to come online later this summer. That Blue Buffalo had been really impressed with their supply chain team. They have got really high-quality supply chain team. We are going to add to that capability, because we have more high-quality supply chain folks. And I think for us the key is that with Blue Buffalo, I am not sure we are going to speed up their acceleration into the channel. I think what we are going to help them do is execute with excellence, not because they don\u2019t have good people, because we just have \u2013 they have a lot of good people and we have a lot of good people together. We have enough people to get the job done. And so we are confident in our FDM expansion plans, at the same time, we think we are growing our share in e-commerce and that business is growing really quickly. And we haven\u2019t forgotten about the pet specialty channel and even though that channel is declining, it\u2019s still a very important channel for us and we will have to distinguish ourselves across the different channels on Blue Buffalo.","Don Mulligan","And Pablo, this is Don. Just in terms of the baseline, obviously you have the BLUE\u2019s reported results through calendar \u201817 think about the increase you would expect in Q1 for them and that probably is a pretty good base. We will be issuing an 8-K with the pro forma results for the combined company in just a handful of days and that will give you better line of sight.","Pablo Zuanic","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you very much. We will get to our next question on the line from the line from John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","John Baumgartner","Good morning. Thanks for the question. Jeff, can you speak a bit more to the reinvestment plans for fiscal \u201819 and how does that F19 plan differ from what was undertaken in F18, what did you learn from this past year\u2019s reinvestments in terms of what worked to maybe what was less successful versus expectations?","Jeff Harmening","Well, what I would say is that we have increased confidence going into F19, but some of the things we put in place if we double down those investments that they will work and I will use e-commerce in an example of that, we are going to increase our investment in e-commerce this coming year, because we saw the investments payoff and that is indicated in our growth rates, but beyond that, I would say that we saw acceleration in the back half of this year, especially the fourth quarter we put some money against acceleration on H\u00e4agen-Dazs and on bars and we really saw some really strong results in both Asia and in Europe. And I give you a couple of examples. We turned on advertising for the first time on Fiber One bars in Australia and saw really good results. And so we decided to turn that advertising on in the UK and my guess is we will see good results there as well. And on H\u00e4agen-Dazs, we have doubled down on some of our new product efforts when I am particularly pleased with how we progressed in Asia behind our growth at H\u00e4agen-Dazs and in the fourth quarter accelerated growth in Europe on H\u00e4agen-Dazs behind increased marketing spending as well as increased new product introductions. And so we will spend more on R&D for example on those businesses we look in the coming year. And then finally I will highlight India. We don\u2019t talk a lot about India, but we had tremendous growth in bars in India and the Middle East. And we look to continue that this next year. And so what we have done at the end of fiscal \u201818 which as you start to see in our fourth quarter, we will continue on to next year. And what I will also tell you is that there will probably be some things that don\u2019t work as well as we want and we are keeping a close eye on all of our investments and we will double down on the things that really work well and if things don\u2019t work as well as we want, but we will shift those resources and put against things that are higher return. But what I will say as we have increased confidence based on what we saw in the fourth quarter that we are accelerating on the right platforms and the things that we are doing are making the difference.","John Baumgartner","Great. And then Don, how should we think about advertising spend in F19, is that up and by how much, not sure if I missed that?","Don Mulligan","Yes, for our media spend, for next year, we really talk about it total brand reinvestment and we do expect it to be up in \u201819. Media will for our base business will likely be flattish, but we will have additional investment in customer activation and e-commerce things that don\u2019t necessarily the media line. Obviously, our total brand investment will be up significantly when you roll Blue Buffalo in. So, we have a lot \u2013 we have a number of tools that we used to grow our sales. They don\u2019t all weigh in, in the media line as we talked about in the last few calls, but in total, we expect our media to be roughly flat in our base business.","John Baumgartner","Okay, thanks for your time.","Operator","Thank you very much. We will get to our next question on the line from Steven Strycula with UBS. Please go ahead.","Steven Strycula","Hi, good morning. Two part question. First part for Don, want to dig into the inflation a little bit in HMM productivity, what were the total HMM savings for calendar or fiscal \u201818?","Jeff Harmening","They are about $400 million, Steve, this is Jeff.","Steven Strycula","Okay, got it. And then in terms of for your input cost inflation for 5%, is that just for raw materials and packaging or does that include the logistics inflation that was up significantly this year, I just wondered if those are two separate pieces?","Don Mulligan","No, that\u2019s all in, 5% is everything against our COGS.","Steven Strycula","Okay, got it. Alright, that\u2019s helpful. And then for Jeff just to understand the core U.S. business and you have realized you are not going to guide to organic sales for next year until maybe the Analyst Day, but can you give us a little bit of texture as to the different big businesses whether cereal yogurt, should we think about these businesses for the full year next year, how should this trend relative to how we exited the fourth quarter just because the first half of 2018 was a little bit soft. So I just want to understand how does the go forward trend stack up versus how we kind of exited 4Q? Thanks.","Jeff Harmening","Yes. I would say one of the \u2013 I mean, I am at the risk of repeating myself, I appreciate the question. I think the thing I am most pleased about is the broad-based improvement and what I would hope for next year is that we continue to have broad-based improvement. As I mentioned, I mean yogurt is the one that improved the most throughout the year and we will look for that to continue. The business we probably had outsized growth this year was on soup, because we had a really tough year, the prior year. We made some investments in our soup business. Our competitors didn\u2019t have the best year. So in 2018 we probably had some outsized growth on our soup business and maybe we will repeat that and maybe we won\u2019t, but that one I wouldn\u2019t look for outsized growth on that one only, because we had a particular poor year the year before when we came back with a particularly good year. On the rest of it, I think the key is that we really like our marketing efforts and our new product efforts. And to the extent that your marketing is good and your innovation is good, those things are repeatable. And I think what you will see for us next year is that broad-based we think our new product innovation is good. Our retailers think it\u2019s good which is also important and it\u2019s really good in our big categories, so cereal and snacks and yogurt and reveal those plans in more doubt, but we have good new product innovation at the end of last year, we have good new product innovation this year and that will help us drive distribution growth, which will be a tailwind for us as opposed to a year ago. And I will save the rest for Jon Nudi in a couple of weeks and he can give you some more detail.","Steven Strycula","Alright, thanks.","Jeff Siemon","Yes, Tommy, I think we will try to get one quick one in here, I know everybody is going to transition to another call in a couple of minutes, so maybe time for one more.","Operator","Certainly. We proceed with our final question from the line of David Driscoll with Citi Research. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is [indiscernible] for David this morning. Just a quick one how did the truck strike in Brazil affect your fourth quarter if at all and how might it flow into next year?","Jeff Harmening","Well, as we think about the fourth quarter, I think first of all, Brazil is less than 3% of our entire business. And it had a little impact in the last few days of the last quarter and it will have a little impact on the first few days in the next quarter, but overall as an organization it\u2019s not going to be a huge factor for us certainly, the SAP implementation from last year was a much bigger factor than what we are seeing in the trucking so far this year in Brazil.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay thank you.","Jeff Siemon","Quick one. Thanks Tommy. Thanks everybody for your attention feel free to reach out over the course of the day if you have more questions, I will be on the phone all day.

Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, March 23, 2016.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Jeff Siemon, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Jeff Siemon","Thanks, Denise, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m here with Ken Powell, our CEO; Don Mulligan, our CFO; and Jeff Harmening, Chief Operating Officer for our U.S. Retail Segment. I\u2019ll turn the call over to them in just a minute, but first let me cover my usual housekeeping items.","A press release on third quarter results was issued over the wire services earlier this morning, is also posted on our website, and you can find slides on our website that supplement this morning\u2019s presentation. Our remarks will include forward-looking statements that are based on management\u2019s current views and assumptions. And the second slide in today\u2019s presentation lists factors that could cause our future results to be different than our current estimates.","And with that I\u2019ll turn you over to my colleagues, beginning with Don.","Don Mulligan","Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. As noted in our press release, General Mills\u2019 third quarter results were in line with our expectations. Net sales, total segment operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS results declined, reflecting the effects of foreign exchange and the Green Giant divestiture. Net sales growth continues to be impacted by high levels of competitive activity in U.S. Yoghurt and lower display merchandising for U.S. Retail.","However, our effort to drive more from the core is leading to improved sales trends across a number of key U.S. Retail businesses, which Jeff will expand upon in a moment. We continue to maintain strong margin discipline as evidenced by our fifth consecutive quarter of adjusted operating profit margin expansion. Based on our results through nine months, we are reaffirming our fiscal 2016 growth targets.","Slide 5 summarizes our results for the third quarter. Net sales totaled $4 billion down 8% as reported and down 4% in constant currency. Total segment operating profit totaled $679 million down 1% on a constant currency basis. Net earnings increased 5% to $362 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.59 as reported. These results include $44 million of restructuring, and project related expenses and mark-to-market valuation effects. Adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes certain items affecting comparability, were $0.65, down 7% from last year\u2019s third quarter. Constant currency adjusted diluted EPS decreased 6% compared to a year ago.","Slide 6 shows the components of total company net sales growth. Pound volume reduced sales by 5 percentage points. Positive sales mix and net price realization increased sales by one point while foreign currency exchange reduced sales by 4 points. The Green Giant divestiture reduced contribution from volume growth by 4 points and reduced net sales growth by 3 points in the quarter.","Turning to our segment results, Slide 7 summarizes U.S. Retail performance. U.S. Retail net sales decreased 7% in the third quarter driven primarily by the Green Giant divestiture, which had a 5 point negative impact on the segment\u2019s net sales growth and accounted for the entirety of the meals operating unit decline. Year-to-date net sales were down 2% including a one point decline from the net impact of the Green Giant sale and the Annie\u2019s acquisition.","In our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment, net sales declined 2% in the third quarter. Our six focus platforms posted combined net sales growth of 8%, with the strongest growth in frozen meals and Yogurt. Net sales declined in the remainder of the business driven by market index pricing on bakery flour as well as the exit of some low margin businesses in the fourth quarter of last year. Year-to-date net sales were down 2% with 6% growth on our six focus platforms.","Slide 9 summarizes our International segment net sales results. On a constant currency basis, third quarter International segment net sales were flat to last year, driven by Latin America, where sales grew 16% including double-digit growth in Mexico, sales were up high single-digits in Brazil with good performance on snacks, benefits from pricing, and incremental contributions from the addition of the Carolina Yogurt business.","Net sales in the Asia\/Pacific region increased 4% including double-digit growth in India and low single-digit growth in China. In Europe, sales were down 2% as dairy deflation contributed to unfavorable net price realization for our Yogurt business. In Canada, sales were down 14%, reflecting the Green Giant sale. In total, the Green Giant divestiture reduced International segment net sales growth by 2 points in the third quarter.","We continue to make good progress on gross margin. Slide 10 shows that third quarter adjusted gross margin, excluding certain items, increased 160 basis points. This was primarily due to cost savings initiatives more than offsetting modest input cost inflation. Our latest estimate of input cost inflation now rounds down to 1% for the full year. As of February, we\u2019re roughly 85% covered on our fiscal 2016 commodity requirements and we now expect full year gross margins to expand by approximately 100 basis points.","Turning to Slide 11, total segment operating profit was down 1% in constant currency. U.S. Retail third quarter profit essentially matched last year with continued cost savings more than offsetting the divestiture impact. Constant currency International profit declined 24% in the quarter due to currency-driven inflation on imported products in certain markets and the impact of the Green Giant divestiture.","In Convenience Stores and Foodservice profit was up 31%, driven by increased grain merchandising earnings, favorable product mix, and our cost saving efforts. After-tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $16 million in the quarter, up 19% in constant currency due primarily to volume growth from H\u00e4agen-Dazs Japan. Third quarter constant currency net sales declined 1% for CPW, primarily due to lower sales in developed markets. H\u00e4agen-Dazs Japan constant currency net sales increased 22% for the quarter, driven by excellent results on a new seasonal, Hana Mochi, which combines H\u00e4agen-Dazs Ice Cream with a traditional Japanese rice cake dessert.","Slide 13 summarizes our noteworthy income items, other noteworthy income items in the quarter. Corporate unallocated expenses, excluding certain items affecting comparability, increased by $12 million in the quarter. We incurred $44 million in restructuring and project-related charges in the quarter including $27 million recorded in cost of sales. Net interest expense decreased 4% from the prior year, driven primarily by a lower average debt balances, partially offset by changes in the mix of debt.","We continue to expect interest expense will be down mid-single digits for the full year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 31% as reported, 5.5 points higher than the prior year period. Excluding items affecting comparability, the tax rate was 30.8% this year compared to 27.5% a year ago. We continue to expect our full year tax rate to be comparable to last year. Average diluted shares outstanding declined 1% in the quarter in line with our full year expectations.","And one additional item to mention here as noted in this morning\u2019s press release, we sold our Venezuela business after the close of the third quarter. The business primarily manufactures and sells canned meats under the Underwood brand. We expect to incur a non-cash charge of approximately $35 million pre-tax in the fourth quarter related to this sale. This charge will be excluded from adjusted earnings and we anticipate the tax loss on this transaction will unlock approximately $20 million in incremental cash flow in fiscal 2016.","Now let me briefly summarize our nine month financial performance of stated in constant currency. Net sales were down 1% reflecting the net impact of acquisition and divestitures. Segment operating profit increased 8% and adjusted diluted EPS were 10% above the prior year. Slide 15 shows that our core working capital declined 40% versus last year\u2019s third quarter. Half of the decline is due to Green Giant divestiture and foreign currency exchange effects. And the other half reflects continued operational improvements across our businesses. This is the 12th consecutive quarter we reduced our core working capital versus the prior year.","We continue to generate healthy levels of free cash flow. Year-to-date free cash flow is $1.4 billion, up 29% versus last year. We\u2019re on track to convert at least 95% of adjusted net sales into free cash flow this year in line with our long-term goal. We also continue to return significant cash to shareholders. During nine months, we repurchased 10.6 million shares at an aggregate price of $602 million and we paid $795 million in dividends. On March 8, we announced a dividend increase of 4.5% payable on May 2. This marks the seventh time we\u2019ve increased our quarterly dividend rate since 2010. For the full fiscal year, we expect to return at least 90% of free cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.","Cost savings from holistic margin management, or HMM, and our incremental cost reduction projects represent an important component of our earnings growth in fiscal 2016. We have good visibility to achieving $400 million in cost of goods sold HMM savings this year and we continue to make progress toward our goal of $500 million in savings from incremental projects by fiscal 2018. For the full year, we\u2019re reaffirming the guidance we updated on the second quarter earnings call. Specifically, we expect a low-single-digit decline in net sales from the 2015 level that included a 53rd week at a full year of Green Giant.","Total segment operating profit matching last year\u2019s levels, and a low single-digit growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share all in constant currency. We now expect the impact of currency translation to result in an $0.08 headwind. The full-year adjusted diluted EPS growth in 2016.","Included in this guidance is the fourth quarter where we expect low single-digit comparable sales growth. Our reported results will reflect unfavorable foreign exchange, the impact of Green Giant sale and comparison to an extra week in the year-ago period.","We anticipate adjusted gross margin to be below last year, reflecting our highest quarterly inflation rate compared to our lowest quarter inflation rate a year-ago. And we expect media expense will be up as reported, and up double-digits excluding currency effects, 53rd week comparison in Green Giants.","With that I\u2019ll turn the microphone over to Jeff.","Jeff Harmening","Thank you, Don. And, good morning, everyone. I appreciate the opportunity to give you an update on our U.S. retail performance. On Slide 20, I\u2019ve summarized three main messages, I want to leave you with today. First, we delivered strong profit growth and marginal results so far this year.","Second, we\u2019re continuing to experience headwinds in our Yogurt business, and in Display Merchandising, that are dampening our sales results. And we\u2019re actively working to address these headwinds.","And third, we\u2019re encouraged by the progress we\u2019re making with our Consumer First Efforts in a number of key businesses. Now let me go a bit deeper on each of these areas. Through nine months, U.S. retail and net sales of $7.8 billion are down 2%, including one point of decline from acquisitions and divestitures.","Year-to-date segment operating profit of $1.7 billion is up double-digits versus the prior year. This significant profit performance reflects our continued focus on cost savings. We\u2019re generating strong cost of good HMM savings, in addition to the benefits from incremental cost savings projects including Project Century. This gives us even greater confidence that our Century initiative will help unlock future HMM opportunities.","And importantly, we\u2019re expanding our margins while we\u2019re in a \u2013 make consumer first investments on our products, our brands and our capabilities to drive improved sales growth. We will give back margin in the fourth quarter for the reasons Don explained. But we still expect to expand U.S. Retail operating profit margin by more than 100 points for the full year.","We continue to see growth in our categories with aggregate Nielsen measured retail sales up for the fourth consecutive quarter. We estimate that our categories grew more than 1% in the third quarter, when including faster growing non-measured channels. Our net sales results have not kept pace with category of growth.","As I mentioned, our year-to-date net sales declined 2%. The Annie\u2019s acquisition and the Green Giant divestiture combined to contribute one point of that sales decline, with the impact falling most significantly on the Meals, which would up excluding our M&A activity.","Net sales for our Yogurt operating unit have been impacted by high competitive activity, while reduced display merchandising has particularly impacted our cereal and snacks results.","On Yogurt, we continue to see high levels of competitive investment as dairy prices remain near 20-year lows. Merchandise volume is up double digits for a key competition in the category, with significant increases in merchandising frequency as well as lower price points in certain channels. In addition, we\u2019re seeing competitive advertising spending more than twice the level of a year ago.","On the second quarter earnings call, we mentioned that to address these headwinds, we would increase our competitiveness in Yogurt in the second half of the year and we will. However, given the increased competitive merchandising levels, it has taken us longer than expected to secure additional in-store activity.","We also said that, we would remain disciplined and not chase unprofitable volume and we will remain committed to that principle. For USRO, our display merchandising was down more than 30% at a key customer in the third quarter, with the impact falling most significantly on our cereal and snacks businesses. We\u2019ll begin lapping these reductions at the end of the fourth quarter and we\u2019ll fully lap them after the first quarter of fiscal 2017. And these two factors combined to reduce our retail sales growth by more than two points in the third quarter.","Despite these headwinds, I am encouraged by the progress for making to expand the impact of our consumer first strategy across a number of important businesses. We gained share in five of our top six categories in the third quarter. Let me share some quick examples, starting with cereal.","Retail sales trends in the cereal category have been improving this fiscal year. And we have returned to share growth in recent months behind consumer first product renovation on trend innovation and effective messaging. Our product renovation initiatives are working in our cereal business. Retail sales of gluten-free Cheerios varieties are up 2% since we launched, after declining high single digits last year.","As of January, 75% of our cereals, no longer include artificial flavors and colors. The seven cereals that received recipe changes in January have posted 6% retail sales growth, since launch, after posting a 6% decline, last year. And last year\u2019s largest Consumer First renovation news more Cinnamon and Cinnamon Toast Crunch is delivering 8% retail sales growth this year, on top of 8% growth, a year ago.","Nature Valley has been a key focus for our cereal innovation efforts in recent years. Initially we launched the brand, as a protein Granola and have since extended it, to ready-to-eat cereal Muesli, Granola bites and oat meal. Retail sales for this franchise increased 44% last year and are up 35% so far this year, through a combination of new product news, media support and sampling. The ready-to-eat cereals that we launched in January are performing well. And we will keep the momentum going next year, with more news on the business.","So I am bullish on our prospects for cereal growth, we will start to lap some of the display headwinds in the fourth quarter. But more importantly, we will continue to expand the impact of our renovation and innovation news. And we will invest higher level of advertising in the fourth quarter. We believe that Yogurt is an attractive growth category, now and for the long-term. We are focusing on initiatives that help drive category growth by generating news, expanding usage occasions and bringing new consumers to the shelf. Overtime, innovation and great marketing will be the key factors to winning, in this category.","In January, we launched the whole milk organic Annie\u2019s Yogurt into the fastest \u2013 one of the fastest growing segments in the category. We think Annie\u2019s all family appeal and strong organic brand equity will bring new consumers to the shelf. And we will have more news to bring to organic yogurt segment this summer. We are expanding our usage occasions with our One Up Your Cup campaign, which encourages consumers to incorporate yogurt in to their snacking routine. Nature Valley bars, our largest business in snacks has been impacted by reduced display and merchandizing in certain channels. But in the tradition of grocery channel, where merchandizing has been more consistent, we have driven growth behind Consumer First Renovation and innovation.","Our Nature Valley Crunchy bar product renovation and our no artificial colors, flavors and sweetness advertising are working. And we have seen excellent early results on our new Nature Valley nut, butter biscuit products. As a result, year-to-date retail sales for Nature Valley grain snacks are up mid-single digits in the grocery channel. Larabar has delivered double digit annual growth since we acquired the business, almost eight years ago. And we believe there is still an opportunity to broaden penetration and accelerate the brands growth.","We\u2019ve recently began testing Larabars first ever TV Campaign supplemented with digital advertising coupons and in-store merchandising. Since the campaign began airing retail sales for Larabar are up more than 40%. We were also maintaining positive momentum on Annie\u2019s. Retail sales were up double-digits in the third quarter and distribution is up double-digit this year in each of Annie\u2019s heritage categories.","As we told you at our Investor Day, there is still a great deal of distribution upside for this brand. So that will continue to be an area of focus for our sales teams. Platform expansions also play a key role on growing Annie\u2019s. We enter the soup and yogurt categories earlier this year and will launch three new cereals in the coming months.","We\u2019re encouraged by early feedback from consumers and customers on these launches and will continue to evaluate other new platforms to further expand the Annie\u2019s business. These strong results on Larabar and Annie\u2019s have contributed to double-digit net sales growth for our U.S. natural and organic business in the third quarter.","We have completed our soup and baking seasons and we\u2019re pleased with our performance. In Ready-To-Serve soup we grew two points of share driven by successful merchandizing, product renovation news and good advertising. Our refrigerated dough business had a good baking season with growth in retail sales and market share up 1.8 points.","These results were driven by distribution gains on our top selling products. And we grew dessert mix dollar share during the key baking season this year by aligning our prices more closely with our competition. Next year we plan to bring news and innovation to help grow the dessert mixes category.","As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, there are number of factors that will affect our U.S. retail performance. We\u2019ll benefit from positive momentum on our renovation efforts and from increased media investment. We\u2019ll also begin to lap display merchandising reductions in the quarter and while we still expect Yoghurt to be a headwind we expect that headwind to moderate.","As a result, we expect to improve fourth quarter sales performance on a comparable basis, although reported results will be impacted by the Green Giant sale and by a comparison to an extra week a year ago. ","To summarize my U.S. retail comments, we are seeing strong year-to-date profit and margin performance driven largely by cost savings realization. Although we continue to experience headwinds in display and merchandizing we\u2019re encouraged by positive momentum we\u2019re seeing across a number of our businesses such as Cereal, Grain Snacks, natural and organic, soup, refrigerated dough and desserts.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Ken.","Ken Powell","All right. Well, thank you, Jeff and good morning everybody. You just heard about our performance in our U.S. Retail segment. So let me give you an update on our other two business segments starting with Convenience Stores and Foodservice.","Net sales for our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment are down 2% so far this year due to index pricing on bakery flour and business exits. However, our six focus platforms of cereal, snacks, biscuits, mixes, yogurt and frozen meals continue to deliver excellent sales growth with combined net sales up 6% year-to-date. This sales performance combined with continued benefits from cost savings initiatives is translating into margin expansion for our Convenience Stores and Foodservice business.","Segment operating profit is up 8% so far this year increasing this segments profit margin to 19%. Frozen meals are leading our performance in Convenience Stores and Foodservice with strong double-digit-sales growth year-to-date. Mini Bagel continues to grow as part of school breakfast programs and we applied our consumer first approach to product development in this channel when we introduce products for school lunches a year ago. Pillsbury, Cheesy Pull-Aparts are our most recent introduction launched in November these individually rapped versions of cheese stuffed bread are heating and served right in their packaging, saving labor costs and waste.","Our bulk packs in schools are driving mid-single-digit growth for our cereal business fiscal year-to-date. As we\u2019re leveraging our no artificial colors or flavors messaging with food service operators. In our Yogurt business also is posting mid-single-digit net sales growth so far this year on the strength of Yoplait Parfait Pro in a verity of food service channels from colleges to hospitals.","We also saw good momentum on our Kid Yogurt in the third quarter as we gain distribution for our Simply Go-GURT products in K-12 schools. So we continue to like the performance we\u2019re driving from this segment by focusing on the most profitable products, in the most attractive food service channels.","Turning to our international segment, net sales are up 2% so far this year on a constant currency basis. The Green Giant divestiture reduced international sales growth by one point this fiscal year-to-date. Constant-currency segment operating profit declined 1% to the first nine months of the year, primarily due to currency driven inflation on imported products in certain markets and a comparison to the year-ago period when profit increased 8%.","In Canada constant-currency net sales are down 2% so far this year, with growth in a number of business lines offset by the impact of the Green Giant divestiture. Our Grain Snacks business continues to deliver good results. Retail sales are up 11% year-to-date on the strength of new product launches like Nature Valley Nut and Seed bars and Fiber One Crumble bars and innovation on our Old El Paso Mexican meals is contributing to 2% retail sales growth for this leading brand of Mexican foods.","In Europe, net sales are up 1% fiscal year-to-date on a constant currency basis, led by good performance on ice cream and meals. H\u00e4agen-Dazs premium ice cream bars are driving 13% retail sales growth so far this year. We\u2019re introducing two new flavors this month and have plans to expand these bars into additional markets. Innovation also is contributing to 1% retail sales growth for Old El Paso dinner kits, driven in large part by increased in-store events and higher levels of advertising support.","In Yogurt, retail sales are down year-to-date as dairy deflation has led to unfavorable net price realization. However, we posted modest share growth so far this year in Europe with good performance on Yop yogurt beverages, Perle De Lait varieties in France.","Our focus on execution on the fundamentals drove improved net sales performance in emerging markets in the third quarter. Year-to-date net sales in Latin America are up 11% on a constant currency basis. We posted high single-digit net sales growth in Brazil in the third quarter, with good performance on our Snacks business benefits from pricing and incremental contributions from Carolina Yogurt. As we mentioned at CAGNY last month, we acquired the Carolina business in December along with the manufacturing and distribution infrastructure for dairy products. And we\u2019re excited about our growth prospects for yogurt in this market.","We also continue to post excellent sales growth in Mexico, led by solid performance on snack bars, Fiber One bars in particular. We introduced the Fiber One brand in Mexico a little over a year-ago and retail sales for our wholesome snacks are up double-digits so far this year.","Now, as you can see on Slide 42, constant currency net sales for our Asia\/Pacific region grew 3% year-to-date. We saw improved performance in China in the third quarter with net sales up low single-digit. Wanchai Ferry contributed to this growth, with good performance on our new Rainbow TangYuan Dim Sum Products during the Chinese New Year. And Yoplait yoghurt continues to perform well with market share in Shanghai at 10% in the third quarter. We saw good growth on the Perle De Lait Bonus Packs, launched in conjunction with the Chinese New Year. And we\u2019re increasing our marketing and promotional activities on the Yoplait brand to drive increased consumer awareness.","Finally, we continue to generate double-digit sales growth so far this year in the Asia, Middle East and Africa region. Sweet snacking is leading that growth. This year we launched new fruit flavors of H\u00e4agen-Dazs ice creams, which has driven high single-digit net sales growth. Betty Crocker cookie cakes, launched last fall, contributed to double-digit snacks growth in the region fiscal year-to-date. We\u2019re also posting strong double-digit net sales growth in India, where we\u2019ve been increasing distribution on our cake mixes and recently launched a line of chocolate spreads.","Overall we\u2019re pleased with the improvement we saw in emerging markets this quarter, and we remained focus on innovation and fundamental execution to drive continued growth in these markets going forward. So that completes the highlights from our three business segments.","I\u2019ll wrap up this morning remarks with this summary. Our third quarter results were inline with our expectations. Foreign currency exchange and the Green Giant divestiture are impacting our reported figures. Our financial discipline is driving operating profit margin expansion, while still allowing us to invest in Consumer First renovation and innovation and we are confident we will deliver our 2016 growth targets.","So that concludes our prepared comments this morning. I\u2019ll ask the operator now to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citigroup. Please proceed.","David Driscoll","Great, thank you, and good morning.","Ken Powell","Hi, David.","Don Mulligan","Good morning.","David Driscoll","Great, thank you and good morning.","Ken Powell","Hi David.","Jeff Harmening","Good morning.","David Driscoll","Wanted to ask a little bit about the sales growth expectations in the Fourth Quarter. So what you guys wrote in the press release and stated on the call is that you expect fourth quarter is expected to be positive on a comparable basis for sales but can you discuss kind of what has to happen for the guidance to work out as recent U.S. and European Nielsen data shows some fairly significant declines.","And then maybe related to this, could you also comment on what your take is on the February Nielsen data which showed a market decline from the trend line that we were seeing and this doesn\u2019t just relate to General Mills, it relates much more broadly to all U.S. food. Thank you.","Don Mulligan","Thanks. Well I would say David for our U.S. business, what has to happen and what we\u2019re expecting to happen in the Fourth Quarter is for our sales growth to accelerate. And we expect behind a couple of important businesses. One is Cereal and the second is Snacks. And we expect that because we are starting to lap the merchandising headwind we\u2019ve seen as one of our biggest customers in the fourth quarter and because our advertising is going to be up significantly on both Grain and Cereal because we really believe in what we\u2019re seeing, the results from our renovation efforts. ","We also think even though Yogurt will continue to be a head wind in the fourth quarter, that that business will improve behind the merchandising we talked about in the second quarter. So for us to see improved U.S. sales results really it is a matter of cereal and snacking behind things we understand in the merchandising area and behind great advertising.","Jeff Harmening","And I\u2019ll just comment on the other two segments because we expect all three segments, David, to improve and accelerate in Q4 versus year-to-date or versus Q3 in particular. As Jeff alluded to higher advertising we\u2019re going to see it in USRO, we\u2019re also to going to see it in international. International, also which Ken alluded to, has a number of new products both innovation and renovation in the marketplace and that will continue to build in the quarter.","In addition there\u2019s some other things that we are lapping similar to the merchandise in USRO. We had business exiting in our C&F business in Q4 last year that will lap the index pricing we talked about in basically flour in C&F that is profit neutral because we price with the market. But the grain price has really started coming down last year in Q4 so we will begin lapping that it will be less bad in Q4 which will help our comparable sales growth. And then we\u2019ll have continued growth acceleration in our emerging markets, including some pricing in Latin America.","So there\u2019s a number of factors that go into improved performance in Q4. ","David Driscoll","Ken or Jeff, can you guys just comment on that, that February\u2026","Jeff Harmening","Yes.","David Driscoll","Question I had about macro U.S. the big picture, thank you. ","Jeff Harmening","Yes, yes. We\u2019re going to do that.","Ken Powell","Happy to do that. As we look at it, what I would say in general Nielsen data was up more than it had been in the month of January and it was down more than we had seen in the month of February. And there is nothing fundamental that we see that has changed between January and February. Certainly it could be the effects of weather at the end of January and stock effects that happened this year, whereas last year we had a couple of big weather events in the northeast in particular in February.","So there could be some weather related activity and we certainly see that. But there is nothing fundamental that we see and that would have changed the categories from January to February. And our focus remains clearly on the things that we can control, which are marketing and innovation activities. ","David Driscoll","Thank you.","Ken Powell","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Matthew Grainger","Great. Thanks, good morning everyone.","Jeff Harmening","Hi, Matthew.","Matthew Grainger","Jeff, I wanted to come back, I think we\u2019ve kind of talked about this Cagny in recent quarters. But just to the big picture on your merchandising levels in the U.S. and then even though they are down at the key customer you mentioned. Your levels of trade promotions still appear to index fairly high relative to the industry average in a lot of your key categories and I know you\u2019re planning to take some of these higher. So given that the industry trend is typically going in the other direction, how are you thinking about the right level of merchandising going forward? Is there really room to cut in the scope of how you plan to run the business or is that less feasible given that you need to support the categories in your competitive positions?","Jeff Harmening","Yes, thanks for the question, Matthew. Let me start by kind of saying that this fiscal year we\u2019ve actually seen price appreciation. As we\u2019ve seen in our categories and we\u2019ve also seen the effectiveness of our merchandising improve as we cut back lower ROI trade activities and focus on high ROI activities. As I think I\u2019ve mentioned, we view how we look at trade as we do HMM and other areas and we\u2019re always looking to get more effective than we are right now and we\u2019ve seen good gains in HMM on our trade which is why we see the less improving in the ROIs improving in our area of trade. But that will continue to focus on that area because one of the things we find with HMM is that the more we look the more we find and I am certain with as big and complex as the trade bucket is that we will continue to find opportunities to further improve our effectiveness and our efficiency in the area of trade.","Matthew Grainger","Okay, thanks, Jeff. And just one follow-up I probably for Don. I just wanted to ask about the margins and convenience in foodservice they\u2019ve been pretty strong in the past two quarters surprised to see 20% margins. And so those recent months, so how should we think about the sustainability there? Is there a big benefit from grain merchandising in that number or are we at the stage where just the mix of the portfolio has really improved that much in that operating segment?","Don Mulligan","Yes, very pleased to say it\u2019s the latter. Grain merch will have a quarterly impact year-on-year but if you look overall business, the fundamental change in the margins because of the business structure and the improving you\u2019re seeing this year is primarily driven by the fact that we\u2019re seeing 6% year-to-date growth on our focus six platforms which all have higher than average margin, higher than segment average margins, higher than company average margins as well.","And combine that with the cost savings initiatives Catalyst and Century that we initiated last year we had some benefit to CNF as well. So, very much a substantial and sustainable change in the margin structure for that business?","Jeff Harmening","I would just maybe to gild the lily a little bit here Matthew, if you go back five or six years in this business, we\u2019ve nearly doubled the margins I mean it\u2019s been more than the last couple of years it\u2019s been continuous improvement over a long period of time as we\u2019ve completely restructured that business so that it\u2019s, as Don said, I\u2019m very, very focused on the best channels in our most profitable categories.","Don Mulligan","In this year similar, Jeff talk about his business increasing margins by over 100 basis points, we\u2019ll see the same thing in our CNF business this year.","Matthew Grainger","All right. Great, thanks again everyone.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Ken Goldman","Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Jeff, you highlighted your \u2013 this is my phrase, you\u2019re sort of lack of interest in chasing yogurt prices lower. But looking forward milk remains cheap. One of your competitors, I think continues to have a capacity utilization issue and I guess they\u2019re incented to drive volumes. So, how do you \u2013 unless you\u2019re paying more to get that promotional space you get \u2013 you\u2019re expecting to get how do you \u2013 how should we have confidence that this will really turnaround for you and how should we have confidence that you\u2019ll get that merchandising that you didn\u2019t get as you expected this past quarter?","Jeff Harmening","Well, look we\u2019re always looking to balance growth and return as we talked about at Cagny. And our yogurt returns have been pretty good as we have been very disciplined. And what we need to do is make sure we balance that out with some growth as well and that\u2019s what Ken mentioned in the second quarter when he said our merchandising activity will improve in the second half and we\u2019ll see that in the fourth quarter.","And so as we look into the fourth quarter, we will improve our merchandising competitiveness because we need to improve our growth. At the same time, we\u2019re also mindful of maintaining our returns and so we will balance that out a little bit in the fourth quarter. But we\u2019ve got a good line of sight now to win our merchandising is going to occur and what merchandising is going to occur and have high level of confidence that will improve in the fourth quarter.","Ken Goldman","But I guess that means, if you\u2019re rebalancing a little bit that you have to pay a little bit more and perhaps you should expect a little bit better sales growth but a little bit worse margin on the yogurt business in the fourth quarter or is that the wrong way to look at it?","Jeff Harmening","No, I think that\u2019s a fair way to look at it. I think that is a very fair way to look at it and we\u2019ll still see good margins because of the dairy pricing but maybe not as high as they are right now. And we expect our growth to improve.","Ken Goldman","Can I ask a quick follow-up? There\u2019s sort of a growing assumption among industry observers that food producers over time will sort of follow the 3G model slash promo spending and not really spend much back to offset it but you\u2019ve talked in the recent past about I guess higher in-store marketing and you said today you\u2019re not just cutting trade you\u2019re really looking to shift that to better ROI projects. Is that the right way to look at it? Do you think that maybe some observers were calling for massive trade promo that all flows to the bottom line? Is that true, is that overstated at this point as people look at the whole food industry. I know you can\u2019t answer for everyone else, but you guys are obviously one of the larger cap ones out there. I\u2019m just curious how you think about that whole balance there.","Jeff Harmening","So we think about it. Ken, in the following terms. We think that a sustainable business model needs to have both margin expansion and top-line growth. So we are very, as we said many, many times we are very focused on both clearly, we acknowledged that the bar is higher now than it used to be on expectations for margin. And we\u2019re addressing them very diligently through HMM, which we\u2019ve had going for many years and the many other restructuring initiatives and other cost savings activities that you\u2019ve seen us initiate over the last several years.","So we are very highly focused on the margin piece and you\u2019re seeing that this year with good gains and we expect that to continue once we go forward. But the additional part for us is that you got to have top-line growth. And so we\u2019re very focused on innovation and being responsive to the consumer by keeping our core brands relevant advertising that works. And to drive growth and where we\u2019re getting that formula right, we\u2019re seeing good growth in our core category. So for us it\u2019s finding that balance both we think that\u2019s the key to sustainability in this environment. And in particular the focus on innovation and consumer first we think is critically important in an environment where consumer attitudes and values about food as you guys all know are changing very, very rapidly. So that\u2019s really how we approach it.","Ken Goldman","Thank you. That\u2019s helpful.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with CLSA. Please proceed.","Michael Lavery","Good morning.","Jeff Harmening","Good morning.","Don Mulligan","Good morning.","Michael Lavery","Just looking at cereal, you talked about how you\u2019re seeing the lift from gluten-free Cheerios or some of the renovation on the other big brands but in total on the quarter it still was down 2%. So what\u2019s the offset there and how big are those declines and what\u2019s the outlook for where that can go, have you seen it stabilize or is there improvement on the way?","Jeff Harmening","Yes, Michael, look the biggest offset by far is one that I mentioned earlier which is our cereal merchandising at one of our biggest customers and we\u2019ve got a good line of sight to seeing that improve in the fourth quarter. So by far that is our biggest headwind in cereal because we feel great about the renovation initiatives that we have and the innovation we\u2019ve just launched in the third quarter so we\u2019re confident we will see that business continue to improve as it did in the third quarter, continue to improve in the fourth quarter as we lap that merchandising.","Michael Lavery","Well, I guess I understand that but I guess I\u2019m looking at it when you\u2019re talking by brand you\u2019re seeing Cheerios and they are not all third quarter on Slide 26 for instance but Cheerios is up 2% the other seven are up six and you still have momentum it looks like on Cinnamon Toast Crunch. So regardless of channel that\u2019s your whole business I assume, is that correct and so if that\u2019s the case then which brands are the drag is Chex or Wheaties down double-digits or what\u2019s the total picture look like?","Ken Powell","We don\u2019t have. Michael, we don\u2019t have any one brand that\u2019s dragging it down, so there\u2019s not a smoking gun of one particular business. If you look at particular brands, there are a couple businesses in particular. One we\u2019re lapping a lot of Cheerios protein from a year earlier which is of course is not gluten-free and the second is our adult brand Fiber One is not performing particularly well. And our Chex business is down a little bit but there is not one of those that you point to and say look that is, yes, it\u2019s a biggest challenge we have is certainly the merchandising but within our brand portfolio those are ones that are not performing as well as they did a year ago.","Michael Lavery","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then just on Venezuela with that divestiture would that have been a material contributor to the double-digit sales growth in Latin America from the third quarter?","Jeff Harmening","No. Venezuela is 0.1% or 0.2% of our sales so very small it will be immaterial.","Michael Lavery","Okay. Perfect. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Jason English","Hey, good morning folks.","Ken Powell","Hey, Jason.","Jeff Harmening","Good morning.","Jason English","Thank you for \u2013 let me ask the question. I want to come back to Jeff if you have the U.S. retail trends. You guys have kind of condition just over the years to focus on base trends and say kind of ignore the incremental, its noise and you\u2019re chalking up the weakness this quarter to some of that incremental noise merchandising, competitive dynamics. But when you look at base trends they are eroding pretty hard and pretty fast for your overall U.S. retail portfolio. So can you talk more about the drivers of the underlying base sales weakness in your portfolio probably speaking?","Jeff Harmening","Yes, Jason, as we look at our third quarter baseline results, remember there are two things that we talked about one was the merchandising, one of our key customers, the other is yogurt. And our base sales trends on yogurt are really driving the negativity for our baseline sales for the U.S. RO categories in the third quarter. And that is largely due to the competitive activity we talked about it earlier. So we\u2019ve seen double-digit baseline declines on our yogurt business, which is due to competitive activity, which has served to bring down the \u2013 if you look across the baseline performance of the portfolio.","Jason English","Okay. And another question for Don then, gross margins, Don, you\u2019re calling for a negative inflection in the fourth quarter. By our math maybe Green Giant divestments adding 30 bps to 40 bps of gross margin, is that fair? And if so sort of the implied underlying weakness in the fourth quarter is even more substantial. Is this really an inflection that we should expect as we lean into next year or is it just a blip due to timing factors?","Don Mulligan","Yes, it\u2019s a later, as we\u2019ve \u2013 as the years unfolded in the fourth quarter, we\u2019re still going to benefit obviously from strong HMM, but the merch timing that we talked about and particularly what we\u2019re lapping a lower merch period last year was higher this year. The inflation which is actually the single biggest factor, because last year Q4 was our lowest inflation of the year, this year it\u2019s our highest inflation of the year. Last year is really when \u2013 in the fourth quarter is when dairy and grains came down, and while they\u2019re still down, there are decelerating more, so we\u2019re lapping there.","And we have continued inflation in our manufacturing logistics, sugar, nuts, fruit, eggs, and obviously I\u2019d say more broadly just in the Latin American region, and again more broadly. So, it is \u2013 it\u2019s very much an inflation story in the quarter. That just \u2013 the phasing of it is different this year than last year with a low point last year and a high point this year. I wouldn\u2019t read anything into it as we look into F 2017, and we\u2019ll share more full guidance with you for F 2017 in a couple of months. But as we\u2019ve talked about at Cagny, we are projecting 200 basis points of margin expansion by 2020 and we expect the majority of that calls [ph] to come through cogs and come through gross margin.","Jason English","Very good. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Eric Katzman","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Don Mulligan","Hi, Eric.","Ken Powell","Good morning, Eric.","Eric Katzman","Two questions if I could, I guess, one is question for Ken. I\u2019ve heard from a number of other CEOs both currently in the industry and formerly in the industry who are getting more concerned about the pressure to cut costs and the risks to food safety and quality. I know you guys have done a very good job over time, but even you had to recall earlier. And so I\u2019m wondering if you could maybe speak with an industry had on about the choices that are being made as the \u2013 as the market pressures the industry to cut costs.","And then second around I think at Cagny, last couple of years, Ken, you\u2019ve talked about kind of how some of these companies get distribution to a certain point they hit a wall and that\u2019s \u2013 that wall is where the large cap companies such as yourself can really leverage that capability. But it seems like in yogurt, it just keeps going the other way. There are so many brands out there now. It doesn\u2019t seem like they are hitting that wall, I mean it seems like the only company that pulled back was actually the PepsiCo, M\u00fcller joint venture. Otherwise, there is just more, more brands being added to the category and Annie\u2019s is just another example of that. And how long does it take for scale to really I guess wind out if it does. Thanks.","Don Mulligan","Okay. So well, let me \u2013 I\u2019ll answer the first one first, and I can\u2019t really \u2013 I understand the observation Eric and the concern that you might hear. I can\u2019t speak for the industry. I can only speak for us. And clearly we are very, very focused on product safety and product quality. It\u2019s sort of central to our mission and that\u2019s the kind of capability that we would maintain and actually build upon even in this environment, because we just think that consumer trust is sort of is job one for us.","So but it goes to \u2013 your question goes to the earlier question as well about what are we trying to do, and we\u2019re trying to do two things. We\u2019re very, very focused on margin expansion, and we think we have a good line of sight, and we\u2019ve performed well there over the last couple of years. We have a good line of sight on other things we can do to continue to \u2013 continue that good work. But we\u2019re equally focused on maintaining the capabilities that we need in order to drive top line growth. And so we\u2019re preserving. We\u2019ve got a very strong marketing organization in CI. We\u2019ve got excellent R&D.","And so those are very important things and our product quality organization has been maintained at a very high level. So that\u2019s how we look at it. I understand the question and I understand the concern, but that is the sort of \u2013 we would not compromise in that area.","To your comments on yogurt, there is \u2013 I don\u2019t have the numbers in front of me \u2013 from what\u2019s come in and what\u2019s has gone out over the last couple of years, Jeff may have those. And so there is a tremendous amount of new product activity in the yogurt area, lots of them don\u2019t stick around for very long. So it is \u2013 there are a lot of them though and its become a more competitive category.","But again, where we focus on the right innovation and the right \u2013 the right renovation, like expanding Annie\u2019s into the yogurt dairy case, and other yogurt innovation initiatives that we will announce this summer, where we have good ones. We are able to succeed, because of the scale and the distribution power that we have. So we are confident that we can continue to grow there, it is an exciting space, it is a huge category globally, we have very high capability.","And so we are just going to stay focused on the kind of innovation that will work in the category. I can come back to you, Eric, we can get some numbers maybe on how many have come in and how many have gone out. But your observation that there is a lot more in yogurt, I think is correct. I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything Jeff.","Jeff Harmening","Yes. The observation that there are a lot of players in yogurt is extremely correct. And it is also true that we\u2019ve grown distribution over this time as well. But if we think more broadly about the kind of capabilities, a big company in the scale that General Mills can bring. I don\u2019t think you have to look further than Annie\u2019s. We have driven double-digit distribution increases on Annie\u2019s over the last two years in the grocery trade.","But even beyond that, looking at the club channel, we have grown distribution in our foodservice area. We are growing Annie\u2019s in our foodservice channels. And so broadly speaking we see the kind of capability that General Mills can add to some of these smaller players and when they hit the wall, how much better we can do.","And you were starting to see the same thing with EPIC even though we just bought that business. And we have a high degree of confidence that we will be able to do a lot more faster than the founders alone could have done with their limited resources.","Eric Katzman","Thank you. That\u2019s all.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","John Baumgartner","Good morning. Thanks for the question. Jeff, I\u2019d like to ask in terms of the U.S. retail business the top 450 SKUs that you\u2019ve isolated first in past. Maybe if you could update your progress in building distribution for that group, how the increasing merchandising plays into that and maybe how we should thinking about the magnitude of those SKUs on sales for the next two quarters?","Jeff Harmening","Yes. Look, we\u2019re really pleased with what we\u2019ve seen with developing the distribution of our top 450 SKUs. We\u2019re right on track where we thought we would be. We\u2019re up over 5% and distribution of top 450 SKUs and really pleased with that performance. And it\u2019s pretty broad performance over a number of categories. And we\u2019ve even seen the benefits of things that we\u2019ve discontinued.","We discontinued a line on Hamburger Helper. And we\u2019ve seen the distribution there decrease, but we\u2019ve seen the increase on our top SKUs. And as a result, we are actually starting to see our turns increase on Hamburger Helper. We\u2019ve also seen the benefits of distribution on our Pillsbury Doughboy. And one of the things that\u2019s driving growth on our Pillsbury business is getting out of SKUs that were relatively unproductive and getting into more SKUs are relatively productive.","And so we\u2019re really pleased with the progress we\u2019ve seen, we have more to do. We\u2019ll keep that as a multi-year plan to get all of our distribution on our top items, but we\u2019re progressing as we thought we would, and we see more room to go. The more we see that we can do, the more we like this initiative.","John Baumgartner","Great. And then just a follow-up in terms of Yogurt and the comments around the innovation in the category and the competition there. Aside from the merchandising increase in Q4, can you speak to any opportunities you\u2019ll see to maybe improve your mix or maybe where you\u2019re under mixing right now? And why we should be comfortable that we\u2019re not seeing the beginning of another kind of 2011, 2012, given performance there.","Don Mulligan","Well, on the innovation front, we feel good about some of the innovation that we have launched. And we see some more good innovation on the way. So for example, our Greek Whips! which we launched a year ago are doing quite well. And we see an opportunity to expand those further. We have seen good initial results from our Annie\u2019s organic Yogurt and we see an opportunity to expand Annie\u2019s further and yogurt, as well as expanding into some other organic areas.","So we feel good about the innovation we\u2019ve done, but as we look ahead \u2013 actually we see even greater potential for innovation in some faster growing segments and whether that\u2019s building on things like Whips or getting into even further into organic. There is certainly a runway ahead of us for innovation. And we know in a category like Yogurt just like in cereal, it is going to be the innovation and the marketing that drives long-term growth. Because dairy prices are 20-year low and we\u2019ll see how long they stay there, but eventually they will go back up. And it will be a matter of innovation and marketing is going to win the day in Yogurt.","John Baumgartner","Great. Thank you very much.","Ken Powell","I think we have time for one more question, Denise.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please proceed.","Chris Growe","Hi, good morning. ","Don Mulligan","Hey, Chris. ","Chris Growe","Hi. Sort of a question for you if I could on, as you think about all the incremental cost savings coming through this year from all the various programs, Catalyst and all those programs, just should we still expect about half of those to be reinvested back in the business is that occurring. It sounds like you\u2019re going to have an increase in overall investment in the fourth quarter. Are you kind of really accelerating the investment and should that continue into 2017 as well?","Don Mulligan","Yes, Chris this is Don. Yes, I think the mix that we talked in beginning of the year about reinvesting roughly half of our savings is still where we\u2019re at. It is facing a little bit differently. As we said, I think advertising some of merchants a little more back loaded than we had originally anticipated, but for the full year it will be in that same range. And next year \u2013 obviously we haven\u2019t completed our plans for next year, so I can\u2019t give you an exact figure, but you would expect that we\u2019re going to be continuing to reinvest some of those savings back and next year we also expect to have a little more leverage from higher top-line growth to add to the margin expansion.","Chris Growe","Okay. And I just have a follow-up question if I could on the International topics. We\u2019re a little bit softer at this quarter underlying what I expected. Can you talk about some of the key factors involved in that you gave a little bit of an overview early on in the discussion, but maybe from just to give an idea like in the fourth quarter, you will see those profits improved and maybe some of the key factors in area that are leading to that weakness in this quarter?","Don Mulligan","Yes, sure. First off our International business, in total, we feel good about where the top-line has moved solid growth in developed markets really at that low-single digit level that will continue even if it\u2019s tempered by some of the Yogurt pricing in Europe. Encouraging acceleration in emerging markets that Ken took you through, which is both innovation, our execution and some pricing. And as with other segments, we expect that to strengthen in the fourth quarter.","In terms of the margins, there are a couple of things that are at play. One is obviously Green Giant does impact our profit in International. We sold the North American business, so Canada you\u2019re seeing the impact of that. And that\u2019s a low-to-mid single digit drag on the earnings for International. The other you see, we mentioned that the currency driven inflation on certain products I mean that\u2019s a long way of saying we have some transaction FX impact for businesses that we source across border. So, for example, much of our Canadian product is sourced from the U.S., so as the Canadian dollar weakens that increases the cost in Canada and we have the same thing across some borders in Europe.","And that has been a larger drag in the second half just due to currency movements and some hedge positions that we had. And that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing in the quarter and it will continue into the fourth quarter as well. But if you strip out Green Giant in some of the transaction FX, the underlying growth, profit growth, we\u2019re seeing at International is holding up quite well and that\u2019s what we would expect to continue to see as we move into 2017.","Chris Growe","Thank you. Don, just to be clear, is the $0.08 FX drag that you have outlined, does that include \u2013 that\u2019s exclusive of the transaction FX?","Don Mulligan","No, that does not include any transaction, that\u2019s all translation FX.","Chris Growe","Okay.","Don Mulligan","Thank you for asking that to clarify.","Chris Growe","Yes, I just want to make sure. Thanks for the clarification.","Don Mulligan","The $0.08 is all translation.","Ken Powell","Okay. Denise, I think that\u2019s all the time we have. So, I know some of you were queued up and we couldn\u2019t get to your question. So, I\u2019m available all day on the phone, so please give me ring. And thanks so much for your attention and questions this morning.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines."],"10263":["General Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS) Q1 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call September 18, 2018  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Jeff Siemon - VP, IR","Jeff Harmening - Chairman and CEO","Don Mulligan - CFO","Jon Nudi - Group President, North America Retail","Analysts","Andrew Lazar - Barclays","David Driscoll - Citi","Chris Growe - Stifel","Michael Lavery - Piper Jaffray","Alexia Howard - Bernstein","Dara Mohsenian - Morgan Stanley","Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the General Mills First Quarter Fiscal 2019 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Tuesday, September 18th of 2018.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Jeff Siemon, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Jeff Siemon","Thanks, Celina, and good morning, everybody. I am here with Jeff Harmening, our Chairman and CEO; and Don Mulligan, our CFO. In addition, Jon Nudi, who leads our North America Retail segment, is also with us for the question-and-answer portion of the call. And I\u2019ll turn things over to them in a moment, but before I do, let me cover a few housekeeping items.","Our press release on first quarter results was issued over the wire services earlier this morning, and you can find the release and a copy of the slides that supplement our remarks this morning, on our Investor Relations website. Please note that our remarks this morning will include forward-looking statements that are based on management\u2019s current views and assumptions and the second slide in today\u2019s presentation was factors that could cause our future results to be different than our current estimates.","In addition, you\u2019ll note in the release that this is the first quarter we are incorporating operating results for Blue Buffalo, which we are reporting in a new Pet operating segment. And as we mentioned on our fourth quarter call, we are reporting Blue on a one month lag to our corporate calendar, which means the Pet segment\u2019s first quarter includes results through July.","Finally, I\u2019ll note that beginning this quarter, we\u2019ve adopted the new accounting requirements for the presentation of pension, post-retirement and post-employment benefit expenses. This change separates service costs from other benefit-related expenses or income, which have moved out of corporate items and into a new line below operating profit. Just to be clear, there is no impact to net earnings attributable to General Mills. For those of you looking to update your models, we posted a revised fiscal 2018 quarterly income statement to our Investor Relations website, yesterday.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn you over to my colleagues, beginning with Jeff.","Jeff Harmening","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m pleased to say that we\u2019re off to a good start in fiscal 2019. We drove organic net sales growth for the fourth consecutive quarter, nearly 0.5%, which in this presentation rounds down to flat. The Blue Buffalo transition is progressing well. And we continue to expect double-digit top and bottom line growth for that business this year, excluding the acquisition-related charge. First quarter adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS results finished ahead of our expectations. And we remain on track to deliver our full-year fiscal 2019 targets.","Slide five summarizes General Mills\u2019 first quarter financial performance. Net sales totaled $4.1 billion. Organic net sales were up modestly, driven by positive net price realization and mix across all four legacy operating segments.","Adjusted operating profit of $641 million was up 3% in constant currency including an 8-point headwind from a onetime purchase accounting charge related to the Blue Buffalo acquisition.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.71 were in line with year ago levels in constant currency, despite a $0.06 negative impact from the purchase accounting charge. As I mentioned, these results were ahead of our expectations on the bottom line.","We\u2019re making good progress against the three key fiscal 2019 priorities we outlined on our Q4 earnings call. As a reminder, those priorities are, first, to grow our core by continuing to compete effectively through compelling consumer news, innovation and in-store support, and by accelerating our differential growth platforms; second, to successfully transition Blue Buffalo into the General Mills family; and third, to deliver on our financial commitments, leveraging our holistic margin management program to drive efficiency, increasing our price mix through our enhanced strategic revenue management capability and maintaining a sharp focus on working capital and cash flow.","Let me share a few highlights of our first quarter progress against each of these priorities, starting on slide seven.","Growing our core in fiscal 2019 represents a step-up from our fiscal 2018 organic growth rate. And we\u2019ve identified a few specific areas where we expect to deliver improved performance in 2019. These include improvements in our U.S. Yogurt and emerging market businesses, greater contributions from innovation, stabilization of U.S. retail distribution trends, and increased price mix benefits as we leverage strategic revenue management.","Through the first quarter, we\u2019ve seen improvements in almost all of these areas. U.S. Yogurt and our emerging markets posted better net sales results compared to fiscal \u201818.","Our first half new product launches are off to a good start, including our new YQ and petite Oui yogurt launches in the U.S. and new H\u00e4agen-Dazs cups and stick bars in Europe and in Asia. And our U.S. distribution was down just 1% in Q1 after declining mid single digits in 2018.","Our organic price mix was up 1% in the quarter, which was in line with last year\u2019s results. And we expect our SRM actions will generate increasing price mix benefits as fiscal 2019 unfolds.","One of the reasons we believe we can achieve our price mix goals in fiscal \u201819 is that we\u2019re seeing price mix contributions building and the broader industry in recent quarters.","As you can see on slide eight, total U.S. food and beverage retail sales were up nearly 3% in the first quarter in Nielsen measured outlets, almost 2.5 points better than a year ago. And that\u2019s being driven by more than 2 points of positive price mix. In fact, price mix in the industry has increased in each of the last four quarters, which isn\u2019t surprising given the uptick we\u2019ve seen and input cost inflation. What\u2019s even more encouraging is that the industry volumes have improved a bit over that time. At the same time, as industry trends have improved, we\u2019ve seen our competitiveness improved significantly, as measured by our market share performance. ","Slide nine shows our market share evolution in our nine largest U.S. categories, which collectively represent more than 80% of our U.S. retail sales. After gaining share in only 2 of 9 categories in fiscal 2017, we significantly improved our competitiveness over the last 15 months through stronger news, innovation and in-store execution, resulting in steady share improvement in fiscal 2018 and market share gains in 8 of the 9 top categories in the first quarter of 2019.","Let me give you a few specific examples of how we\u2019re competing effectively across some of our key platforms around the world. We grew our cereal business in fiscal 2018 in the U.S. retail and away from home channels and outside North America through our CPW joint venture. Our U.S. Cereal business grew market share yet again in the first quarter, driven by continued strong performance on our taste brands. Trix posted and more than 60% retail sales growth behind the relaunch of our classic tricks colors and marshmallow news helped Lucky Charms post 9% retail sales growth on top of last year\u2019s 16% growth rate.","Our new Cheerios Oat Crunch offering already captured a half a point of share in the category in August as we continue to deliver news benefits on the country\u2019s largest cereal brand. And our first quarter success extended to away-from-home outlets with cereal net sales in our Convenience Stores & Foodservice segment up low single digits, given by continued strong performance and K-12 schools and colleges and universities.","U.S. Yogurt continues to improve behind our strategy to expand into faster growing segments of the category. We entered the simply better segment in fiscal 2018 with the introduction of Oui by Yoplait. Distribution on Oui is still growing this year, driven by new varieties of our core Oui platform and our launch of Oui Petites, a new sub-line featuring indulgent flavors such as Milk Chocolate and Sea Salt Caramel.","In July, we added our presence in simply better yogurt with YQ, a new yogurt made with ultra-filtered milk that appeal to modern weight managers, seeking high protein, less sugar, simple ingredients and great taste and is 99% lactose-free. And as yogurt consumers increasingly shift away from Greek, we\u2019ve seen considerable improvement for Yoplait Original, including growth on our single unit cup business and we\u2019re also growing our largest kids\u2019 yogurt business Go-Gurt behind fun news and engaging brand messaging.","We\u2019re bringing our U.S. innovation strategy to Europe this year with the introduction of simply better glass pot offerings in both the UK and France under the Libert\u00e9 and Panier brands. And we continue to innovate in high growth areas such as organic and non-dairy yogurts.","In addition to our global platforms, we\u2019ve driven good performance on our regional businesses so far in fiscal 2019. In the U.S., we\u2019ve entered the soup season with good momentum on Progresso including low-single-digit retail sales growth and market share gains in the first quarter.","Retail sales for fruit snacks were up mid single digits in Q1 as we\u2019ve shifted the focus of our messaging to a teen target. And Totino\u2019s hot snacks posted high single digit retail sales growth, thanks to brand building and innovation that connects with our millennial male consumer. We\u2019re also growing in China on our Wanchai Ferry dumplings business. We\u2019ve had good success with our new premium dumpling offerings and our advertising campaign focused on Wanchai Ferry\u2019s superior taste.","And we\u2019re encouraged by the improved performance we saw in Brazil in the first quarter across our Yoki snacks businesses, especially popcorn, where we gained record share behind our seasonal brand campaign and stronger in-store execution.","In addition to competing effectively, the second component of our growing our core in fiscal \u201819 is accelerating our four differential growth platforms. We generated 3% year-to-date global retail sales growth on Old El Paso, led by our performance in the U.S. On this base0driven, non-seasonal business year-round consumer support is critical. So, we added incremental media behind our Anything Goes In Old El Paso campaign, and it\u2019s working. Retail sales were up 6% and baseline sales grew high single digits in the U.S. in the first quarter. We\u2019re also benefiting from strong new items including our new hint-of-lime shells, crispy taco seasoning and mini tortilla bowl kits which have helped grow distribution for the Old El Paso brand.","In our natural and organic portfolio, we continued to optimize our assortment through SKU rationalization. While this has dampened total growth, we are seeing strong performance on our core products including 13% retail sales growth on Annie\u2019s Mac and Cheese and mid-single-digit growth on Annie\u2019s organic fruit snacks and graham crackers in the first quarter. We\u2019re seeing good performance elsewhere in this portfolio too, including EPIC snack bars and Cascadian Farm frozen products which are both growing double digits.","Year-to-date measured channel retail sales for our global snack bars business were in line with last year with stronger growth in non-measured markets and channels. Outside North America, Nature Valley and Fiber One innovation and distribution expansion drove strong double digit retail sales growth in Europe and Australia. Our Pillsbury Cookie Cake bars are growing rapidly in India. And we\u2019re expanding brand penetration and growing distribution in Mexico and other parts of Latin America.","Within the U.S., L\u00e4rabar posted another quarter of double-digit retail sales growth, while Nature Valley retail sales were down 1%. Fiber One on the other hand has underperformed our expectations with retail sale down more than 20%, driven by intense competitive pressures and distribution declines. We have more work to do on Fiber One in the U.S. and we expect improved performance in our U.S. snack bars business in the back half of the year, leveraging media and innovation to support Nature Valley, L\u00e4rabar, EPIC as well as Fiber One.","H\u00e4agen-Dazs ice cream, our final accelerate platform, posted 8% global retail sales growth on top of double-digit growth in the same period last year. In the UK, our second largest H\u00e4agen-Dazs market in the world, we drove 26% retail sales growth and achieved record sales and penetration behind our Wimbledon activation.","Globally, we\u2019re benefiting from good innovation such as our new peanut butter flavors and sticks and pints, as well as in our new packaging, design and other brand building support.","So, while our year-to-date performance across key platforms has been mixed, we feel good about our ability to improve our top-line performance over last year in total, and to grow our core in fiscal 2019.","Now, let\u2019s shift gears and talk about our second key priority for fiscal \u201819, successfully transitioning Blue Buffalo into the General Mills family. I am pleased to say that the combination of the two organizations has gone smoothly so far. And I\u2019ve been impressed by the quality of the Blue team in Wilton, Connecticut and across the country.","Our transition philosophy has been clear from day one, bring General Mills capabilities to bear where they can add value and stay out of the way where they\u2019re not needed. We\u2019re seeing early wins across key areas including supply chain, sales, innovation and strategic revenue management.","From a sale in standpoint, net sale for Blue Buffalo were up 40% on a pro forma basis in Q1, including a stub period at the end of April after we close the acquisition. Excluding those additional days, pro forma net sales were up mid single digits.","Looking at in-market performance. We continue to see strong pet parents sell-through on a like-for-like basis with total retail sales up 9% in the quarter. We expect the timing of channel expansion will continue to drive variability in our quarterly net sales results this year. For example, at this time last year, Blue Buffalo was launching their initial wave into Food, Drug and Mass customers. We saw a dramatic growth as they filled the customer pipeline. We\u2019ll lap that growth in the second quarter of this fiscal year. However, even with the variability of the year, we continue to expect Blue Buffalo will deliver double-digit top and bottom-line growth for the full year, excluding the impact of purchase accounting.","On slide 16, you can see the key components of our 9% retail sales growth and how they break down by channel. Our expansion into the Food, Drug and Mass channels is progressing well with retail sales for Blue up 20% since May. And Blue\u2019s market share continues to grow, reaching high single digits for initial way of customers and double digit set of few customers who have really gotten behind the Blue brand. Pet food category retail sales declined mid-single-digits in the Pet Specialty channel in the first quarter as pet parents continue to shift to e-commerce in the Food, Drug and Mass channels. And with less support from some retail partners, Blue\u2019s retail sales were down double digits, lagging the category. And Blue continues to win in the rapidly evolving e-commerce channel with retail sales up more than 35% in the quarter and market share increasing as well.","As we look ahead to the rest of fiscal 2019, we have plans to accelerate our growth in pet, while maintaining our channel-specific approach. We\u2019ll continue to execute our Food, Drug and Mass expansion in a thoughtful way, ensuring we\u2019re learning from each new customer launch. We\u2019re also focused on improving our trends in Pet Specialty. Billy Bishop and his team have recently held top-to-top meetings with the new CEOs at our largest customers in the channel and have reinforced our commitment to their business.","Looking ahead, we think there\u2019s an opportunity to drive improved performance for Pet Specialty and for Blue by improving in-store execution, continuing to support our Pet Detective program and maximizing visibility of exclusive innovation that we\u2019re launching in the specialty channel this year. And we think we can help our customers\u2019 categories as we do this.","Finally, we\u2019ll continue to drive robust growth in e-commerce. We\u2019re partnering with the biggest e-commerce pet retailers to drive visibility for Blue on the digital shelf, which will help solidify its position as the number one pet food brand online.","Our third key priority this year is to deliver our financial commitments, and we\u2019re off to a good start here as well. We\u2019re on track to deliver $450 million of cost of goods HMM savings, led by benefits from our global sourcing team. We\u2019re capitalizing on opportunities to drive improved price mix, leveraging the analytical insights generated by our strategic revenue management group. We continue to maintain a sharp focus on cash, resulting in another reduction in core working capital in the first quarter. And as I said earlier, we finished the quarter ahead of plan on the bottom-line.","With that as an overall summary, let me pass it to Don to provide more details on our financials and our segment level results.","Don Mulligan","Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone.","Jeff provided a summary of our first quarter financial results. Now, I\u2019ll share a few additional details, starting with the components of net sales growth on slide 20.","Organic net sales rounded down to flat versus year-ago, driven by positive net price realization in mix across all four legacy segments, offset by lower contributions from volume.","Foreign currency translation did not have a material impact on net sales. And the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures yielded a 9-point benefit to net sales.","Turning to our segment results, on slide 21. North America retail net sales declined 2% as reported and were down 1% on an organic basis. Consumer takeaway was a bit stronger, with Nielsen measured retail sales flat in the quarter.","Net sales in the U.S. snacks operating unit were down 4% due to declines on Fiber One snack bars, partially offset by strong innovation performance on L\u00e4rabar and EPIC bars.","Canada net sales were down 4% as reported and 2% in constant currency. Net sales for U.S. Meals & Baking were down 2%, primarily driven by the comparison to last year\u2019s first quarter that included co-packing sales related to the Green Giant divestiture.","U.S. Yogurt net sales were also down 2% as declines on Greek and Light were partially offset by Oui and YQ innovations in our simply better segment, and solid performance Go-Gurt and original style yogurt. Retail sales results for yogurt were stronger with Nielsen measured takeaway nearly flat in the quarter.","U.S. Cereal posted 1% net sales growth behind effective product news on Lucky Charms, Trix and other core brands.","Constant currency segment operating profit increased 3% in the first quarter due to benefits from net price realization mix, lower SG&A expenses and benefits from productivity initiatives, partially offset by higher input cost inflation.","In Convenience Stores & Foodservice, first quarter organic net sales increased 4%. Our Focus 6 platforms delivered 4% net sales growth led by Chex Mix snacks and Pillsbury Stuffed Waffle in convenience stores as well as frozen pot breakfast and bullpen cereals in K-12 schools.","Segment operating profit increased 14% in the quarter, driven by net sales growth from the higher margin Focus 6 platforms and increased cost savings, partially offset by higher input cost inflation.","Organic net sales for Europe and Australia segment were up 1% in the first quarter, driven by strong performance at our ice cream snack bar platforms.","At H\u00e4agen-Dazs, net sales were up double digits as we continue to expand our distribution in Australia and Europe with snack bar, with stick bar, MiniCup and pint innovation, and as we execute local brand activations in key markets to better engage with consumer and drive trial. Snack bars also grew double-digits. Thanks to excellent performance on our Nature Valley and Fiber One brands as we continue to increase household penetration behind distribution gains, effective messaging and strong innovation.","First quarter segment operating profit increased 12% in constant currency due to favorable sales mix and lower SG&A expenses, partially offset by raw material inflation and currency-driven inflation on products imported into the UK.","Our Asia and Latin American segment posted an 8% increase in organic net sales in the first quarter with good growth in Brazil, China and India, the segment\u2019s 3 largest markets. Our performance in Latin America has improved dramatically from last year, as we\u2019ve transitioned past our Brazil enterprise reporting system implementation and benefited from our new Yoki brand campaign and terrific performance on snack bars.","In Asia, H\u00e4agen-Dazs posted strong growth by the effective consumer activation including our Let\u2019s Peach Party campaign in key markets. Wanchai Ferry in China strengthened due to innovation on core dumplings and improved in-store execution. And our snack bars platform continued to deliver excellent results in India and the Middle East.","Segment operating profit in Asia and Latin America was $12 million compared to $16 million a year ago, due to input cost inflation and higher SG&A expenses.","For our Pet segment, first quarter net sales totaled $343 million. Jeff mentioned that this was up 14% on a pro forma basis, including 7 additional days from the stub period in April. It was up mid-single-digits without the extra days. We expect pro forma net sales growth to accelerate in the second half of the fiscal year as we execute against our growth plans in FDM, Pet Specialty and e-commerce channels.","Segment operating profit of $14 million was $62 million below prior year on a pro forma basis, driven by $56 million of non-cash purchase accounting charges including an inventory adjustment and intangible amortization, as well as significant input cost inflation and start-up costs related to two new production facilities. Year-to-go Pet segment operating profit will be driven by accelerated top-line performance, positive mix, benefits from a recent price increase, HMM initiatives and the ramp-up of acquisition synergies. Finally, as Jeff mentioned, we continue to expect double-digit top and bottom-line growth for the Pet segment in fiscal \u201819 excluding purchase accounting charges.","Turning to margin results on slide 26. First quarter adjusted gross margin and operating profit margin were below last year, driven by input cost inflation and the one-time purchase accounting inventory adjustment, partially offset my positive net price realization and mix, COGS HMM savings and lower SG&A expenses. Excluding the one-time purchase counting charge, adjusted gross margin was down 30 basis points and adjusted operating profit margin increased 50 basis points. For the full-year, we continue to expect input costs inflation will be 5% of cost of goods, 1 point above fiscal \u201818 levels. And we expect price mix benefits from our SRM actions will build in the coming quarters.","Slide 27 summarizes our joint venture results in the quarter. CPW net sales were down 2% in constant currency due to declines in Latin America partially offset by strong performance in the Asia, Middle East and Africa region. H\u00e4agen-Dazs Japan net sales declined 14% in constant currency, driven primarily by declines on core mini cups and the comparison against 14% growth in the year-ago period. Combined after-tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $18 million compared to $24 million a year-ago, primarily driven by our $5 million after-tax share of a restructuring charge at CPW, which is excluded from our adjusted earnings.","Slide 28 summarizes other noteworthy income statements items in the quarter. Corporate unallocated expenses excluding certain items affecting comparability increased by $22 million in the quarter. Benefit plan non-service income totaled $21 million, compared to $20 million in the same period last year. Net interest expense increased $61 million, driven primarily by debt raised to fund the Blue Buffalo acquisition. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.7% compared to 30.5% a year-ago, primarily driven by net benefits related to U.S. tax reform. We continue to expect our full-year adjusted effective tax rate will be in the range between 23% and 24%. And average diluted shares outstanding were up 3% in the quarter.","Slide 29 provides our balance sheet and cash flow highlights in the quarter. Our core working capital balance totaled $671 million, down 31% versus last year\u2019s first quarter as benefits from our terms extension program, more than offset higher receivable and inventory balances from Blue Buffalo\u2019s addition to our balance sheet.","First quarter operating cash flow grew to $607 million, primarily reflecting net improvements in working capital. Capital investments totaled $113 million and we paid $294 million in dividends in the quarter.","Let me close today\u2019s remarks by reiterating that we remain on track to deliver the fiscal \u201819 guidance we outlined at our Investor Day in July. Reported net sales are expected to increase 9% to 10% in constant currency, including the addition of Blue Buffalo. We expect organic net sales to range between flat and up 1%.","We estimate constant currency adjusted operating profit will increase 6% to 9% from the base of $2.6 million reported in fiscal 2018. As Jeff Siemon mentioned upfront, this 2018 base has been revised to reflect the change in presentation of benefit plan non-service income.","Constant currency adjusted diluted EPS is expected to range between flat and down 3% from the base of $3.11 earned in fiscal \u201818. We currently estimate foreign currency to be immaterial to full-year net sales, operating profit and EPS. And we\u2019re targeting free cash flow conversion of at least 95% of adjusted after tax earnings.","With that, let me open the lines for questions. Operator, can you please get us started?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Please go ahead with your question. ","Andrew Lazar","Good morning, everybody.","Jeff Harmening","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar","Just two quick things. And if I missed this, I apologize. I think -- was there anything, I guess, in 1Q that perhaps helped lower relative SG&A a bit more than we all on the outside might have thought? And if so, maybe how much of that might be timing related and when do you think that comes into play to impact SG&A as we go through the year? And then, second, I think Don, last quarter, you\u2019d mentioned that perhaps you expected gross margin to be roughly flattish year-over-year for the full-year. Is that still an expectation that you think makes sense here, given what we saw in the first quarter? Thank you.","Don Mulligan","Yes. Sure, Andrew. I\u2019ll tackle both of those. For SG&A, -- I guess, I\u2019ll back up and just talk about the results more broadly versus our expectations. And as Jeff said, we were pleased to start the year with a stronger profit performance than our expectations. Frankly, I think it\u2019s a testament to the organization\u2019s focus on cost discipline while we drive improved top-line. Just to set the stage, the sales did come in where we expected. The mix by business is different, but in total, we were on plan. So, our overperformance on the bottom-line was across P&L, many P&L items including SG&A. Gross margin was better due to favorable mix, project timing and inventory absorption.","Andrew, to your question, SG&A benefited from lower corporate spending, some of our departmental spending, which will be phased later in the year, some stock-based comp being lower and media being slightly lower than planned. And plus, below that the tax rate came in a bit favorable to our plan, it was clearly under our 23 to 24 range for the full-year.","So, we feel good about how we came out of the first quarter with the lead. But we know it\u2019s a dynamic environment and that really did factor into our thinking about the full-year -- the full-year guidance. So, if we go back to SG&A, the key factors were the phasing of our corporate spending, which will phase more in the back half of the year or the back part of the year now in the stock-based comp and media. Of those, I think the stock-based comp will stick for the year, but the others I think will tend to unwind is a year unfolds.","In terms of gross margins. What we saw in the quarter was that it reflects higher inventory levels -- or higher inflation levels, excuse me, that haven\u2019t yet been fully offset by benefits of price mix and HMM. And as I mentioned in my comments, we expect price mix to improve as the year unfolds and we also expect HMM to increase as we get continued and incremental benefits from our global sourcing activity. That all said, I think as per our guidance at the beginning of the year, our operating margins will be down somewhat for the year, if you look at what our guidance for sales versus our guidance for operating profit would indicate. And I think just based on how we\u2019re seeing some of the investment against the business, Andrew, I think there\u2019s probably going to be a little bit more pressure on gross margin than we originally anticipated. As we look at what investment, what growth vehicles are working for us, as we look through the frame of our total brand investments, we\u2019re seeing some activity that\u2019s probably going to put a little bit of pressure on our gross margin. But we think it\u2019s going to have a good payback on the top-line for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line David Driscoll of Citi. Please go ahead with your question.","David Driscoll","Just a quick follow-up on Andrew\u2019s question on gross margin. So, I understand your full-year comments, but wouldn\u2019t the second quarter maybe somewhat negatively impacted by the factors that you described? So, the price mix benefits more back half of the year, but the inflation I think is relatively even throughout the year. So, gross margin down in second quarter and then it gets positive in the back half. Just that little modeling clarification would be would be helpful. And then, I have a question on Blue Buffalo, please.","Don Mulligan","Yes. I think that you\u2019re right, David. The flow will be such that we\u2019ll see a larger benefit both from HMM and price mix in the back half of the year. So, we expect to see some of the gross margin pressure continue in the second quarter.","David Driscoll","Okay. And then, on Blue Buffalo, you reiterated your double-digit sales growth guidance. Takeaway was up 9%. So, can you just talk a little bit about why you\u2019re so confident in the double-digit sales growth? And then maybe within that answer, just talk a little bit more about Pet Specialty and why you think you can improve the trends there?","Jeff Harmening","Yes, David. So, this is Jeff. I\u2019ll take that. I mean, there are a lot of moving parts in our business in general and specifically to Blue Buffalo with extra weeks and sell-ins and sellouts. But the key for me and I think in all of that, you hit the nail on the head which is 9% takeaway. And when consumers are buying it, usually good things follow, and we have 9% growth. And I\u2019m confident, because we\u2019re generating that kind of growth and we still only have 3% household penetration among pet parents. We have a lot of room to expand in Food, Drug and Mass. We\u2019re only at 30% distribution. And in Pet Specialty, we think that we can not only improve our business, but in the process, help our retail customers. And we\u2019ll do it -- the way that General Mills builds categories, look, the more we look at this category, the more we like it, the more it feels like categories, we understand and know how to drive and will improve in Pet Specialty food through things like innovation, through shelf management, through merchandising, through consumer promotions, all the levers that we know in the rest of our food business. They all apply to Pet, and they all apply to the Pet Specialty channel. And so, we feel like we know how to do this. And we\u2019re committed to working with the new leadership in the Pet Specialty channel, to help Blue Buffalo, which we think -- we think, in turn can help their business as well.","David Driscoll","And then, Jeff, just one follow-up on your comments here. In the second quarter, I think you called out in your script, the year-ago sell-in from the initial FDM customers. Does that mean that Blue Buffalo sales will be flattish in this upcoming second quarter because of that real tough compare, could they actually be down? Just any magnitude of guidance would be helpful.","Jeff Harmening","Yes, David. I think when we think about the Blue Buffalo business, we do have confidence and a line of sight to the growth for the whole year, double-digit top and bottom line. But, one of the things that\u2019s also very clear to us is it\u2019s going to be variable, both on the top line and the cost side. On the top line due to changes in sell-in and inventory, and if you look at the quarterly results from last year, you\u2019ll see that our second quarter was a big one for Blue Buffalo because they had a lot of sell-in. So, I would anticipate that in the second quarter, I\u2019m not going to give the absolute level of sale, but I would anticipate that our sell-through to consumers will far, far outpace our RNS realization that we show in the income statement. And as we continue to expand in the Food, Drug and Mass channel, I think that will reverse over time.","And then, the same will be true on the cost side, as we\u2019re building new plants in Richmond, as we have a new treat facility up and going in Joplin, as we\u2019re building new distribution centers. The timing of those costs isn\u2019t always associated with the revenue. And so, we\u2019ll see a lot of variability and we\u2019ll just have to get used to that as we continue this expansion. It\u2019s all part of the expansion. We saw similar things with Annie\u2019s, Annie\u2019s which just happened to be a smaller business. And so, we\u2019ll make sure we flag to you. But, I think you have the general sense of how things are going to flow right.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Chris Growe of Stifel. Please go ahead with your question.","Chris Growe","Hi. Good morning. I just had a question for you, if I could. In relation to the U.S. where your sales were down in North American retail, 2%, but you gained share in the majority of your categories. So, it just seems that you need stronger sales growth across your categories to really accelerate your revenue growth. I guess, my question would be, do you expect your categories to grow in fiscal \u201819? And I guess, what are the initiatives you have in place, I\u2019m sure, it\u2019s innovation-driven, marketing-driven to help accelerate the growth of these categories which seemed a bit of a impediment to your sales currently?","Jon Nudi","Hey, Chris. It\u2019s Jon Nudi. So, we saw our categories in Q1 grow about 1%. We were flat. So, if you put non-measured channels on top, we expect -- we believe that we grew about 1% in total consumer movement. So, as we look forward, we think the categories will continue to grow. We feel really good about our plans as we move through the rest of the year. It really starts with supporting our big brands. And we feel good about our media plans and are above the line promotions as well. I feel really good about innovation. In fact, in Q1, we saw 15% more innovation or RNS coming from innovation in the year prior. We believe that our plans would get even stronger as we move through the year. And then, distribution will continue to build as well. So, Jeff mentioned, we\u2019re down about 1 point from a distribution standpoint in Q1. We expect to get back positive as we move throughout the year. And even in Q1, our share of distribution was actually positive as retailers are cutting back the number of SKUs, not shelves. So, we feel good about our plan for the year.","In Q1, we saw about 2-point gap between total movement and RNS. And really that was related to pipeline and inventories at our customers. In fiscal \u201818, we saw about a 1-point gap. We expect that to be the case again in fiscal \u201819. So, you\u2019ll see some of that work back our way as we move throughout the year. So again, we feel that our categories are going to grow. We feel good about our ability to compete on and believe that we can deliver for the year.","Chris Growe","And just one other question, if I could. And forgive me if I missed this, Don. But, how much was inflation up in the quarter? And then, I\u2019m just curious on your SRM initiatives. Price mix was positive this quarter. Are there more price increases that go into place, something you want to get in each of those and not looking for that. But just to understand, is it that, is it more around reduced promotional spending or wait outside kind of things to help achieve stronger pricing through the year?","Don Mulligan","Yes. Inflation is fairly leveled through the year. So, the 5% is pretty consistent. It may move a couple of basis points from here there, but pretty steady through the year. As I said, HMM will grow as global sourcing initiative to contribute. So, the gap between inflation and HMM will diminish as the year unfolds. SRM will be other driver of price realization and mix. And we\u2019re looking at all the levers, whether it\u2019s list price or price-pack architecture, the trade optimization and mix. And as we look at the year, I think we talked about this in July, we see each of those contributing about equally as the year unfolds. And you will see an increasing contribution from that as well as the quarters past.","Jeff Harmening","I\u2019d like to build on Don\u2019s comment, just to remind you. I mean, we saw good, price mix -- net price realization on all four of our legacy segments, as well as Blue Buffalo. And so, the strategic revenue capability management that we\u2019re rolling out is we\u2019re really taking it global and I like what we\u2019re seeing across all of the different segments.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead with your question.","Michael Lavery","When you look at the distribution losses, can you give us a sense of where -- in what categories you think that should turn and become a positive tailwind, and how to think about the timing for something like that?","Jon Nudi","Michael, it\u2019s Jon. In the U.S., again, we\u2019ve made big strides over the past year. We were down 5 points of distribution in fiscal \u201818; in Q1, we were down 1, but share of distribution actually grew. So, if you look at the categories that we\u2019re lagging right now, the biggest one is yogurt. And as Jeff mentioned, we\u2019re actually seeing much improved trends, in fact grew share half-point in Q1. So, as we continue to build momentum and really prove that we can deliver in the category, particularly bring innovation and segments like simply better, we expect our distribution to build in yogurt and improve as we move throughout the year. So that would be the biggest delta that we see as we move forward.","Michael Lavery","And when you mention the innovation, obviously you\u2019ve had some launches early fiscal \u201819 already. If you\u2019re looking at distribution from gains from innovation, would you have a similar amount of innovation coming or is it a step-up? What\u2019s the right way to think about the back half?","Jon Nudi","Yes. So, if you think about our yogurt launches, the biggest one was YQ by Yoplait which is off to a good start. That\u2019s just launched in July. So, we\u2019re still building distribution. I think at this point, we\u2019re still only around 30% or 35% ACV. So, we expect that to continue to build. Oui Petites is another one that will build too. So, we expect both of those to continue to build throughout the quarter and throughout the rest of the year.","Michael Lavery","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And just the last one on the pricing. I know last year there was some accrual timing that distorted a little bit of the pacing or made the optics a little bit funny. Is there anything going on in this quarter that is similar to that?","Don Mulligan","Nothing material to note.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard of Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.","Alexia Howard","Hi. So, can I just ask about the Blue Buffalo profitability track here? It looks as though on an underlying basis, when you strip out the onetime items, it was probably down a bit in the first quarter. Is it mainly that the plant start-up costs really pressured profitability in the first quarter, and that that will improve as we move through the year? And then, can you quantify exactly how much Blue Buffalo benefited overall EBIT for the quarter as well? Thank you.","Don Mulligan","Alexia, let me get the first question. If you strip out the purchase accounting impacts, both the inventory and the ongoing amortization, the profit margins for Blue Buffalo will be about 20% and that\u2019s versus a full year number last year about 23%. There\u2019s about a point or so from plant startups embedded in there. So, the profitability as a percent of sales is actually pretty close to what it was for the full year last year.","Now, we think that\u2019s going to improve as the year unfolds. I mentioned, the driving factors, we\u2019re going to see increased price mixed benefits. We\u2019ve announced some pricing a couple months ago. And as we expand further FDM, we\u2019ll get the product mix benefit of more wet and treat products. HMM and synergies are weighted to the back half. That includes opening a new warehouse that\u2019s going to help offset some logistics inflation. And we expect stronger volume growth as well which will leverage fixed costs. So, all those will benefit the margins as we -- as the year unfolds.","Jeff Siemon","Let me just -- this is Jeff Siemon. I\u2019ll just jump in your second part of your question. So, Pet segment was $14 million in profit. That\u2019s about a little over 2% of the operating profit growth for the quarter, off of the base of a little over 600 last year.","Alexia Howard","Great, thank you. And just as a quick follow-up with marketing spending down year-on-year in the quarter, is that expected to continue? And then, I\u2019ll pass it on. ","Don Mulligan","Yes. Media spend, the advertising spend was down in the quarter. And Alexia, that\u2019s part of as we talked about our total brand investment where we\u2019re looking at a number of different vehicles and it\u2019s really by brand. And I think the testament to the fact that that\u2019s working is that we\u2019ve had four quarters of organic sales growth. And so, we\u2019ll continue to make sure we\u2019re using the right vehicle for the right brand.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian, please go ahead with your question from Morgan Stanley.","Dara Mohsenian","So, Jeff, just at a high level, following up on that question. A&M levels have been down pretty significantly, in aggregate, year-over-year over the last few quarters, if you go back to the back half of last fiscal year also. And I\u2019m a bit surprised by that, just given the shift back to top line focus and a desire to drive accelerating organic sales growth going forward. So, help me understand what sort of driven that drop in the last few quarters? I understand, some of it\u2019s going to other areas? But also, as you look out over the next couple of years, should that line item move up? Do you expect to continue to get leverage? What are you thinking going forward? And why has there been such a big drop in the last few quarters there? Thanks.","Jeff Harmening","Yes. Thanks for the question. I mean, I think -- let me start with the answer from a little different perspective, which is, look, our focus is on driving organic sales growth and driving that in most efficient effective way possible. And sometimes that\u2019s through media spending, sometimes that\u2019s through other types of commercial spending, things like in-store displays or coolers or adding to the sales organization in India. But, in this current year, what I\u2019m pleased is in the first quarter, we kind of grew as I thought we would, which is we\u2019ve improved our distribution here in the U.S., we\u2019ve improved our new products as a percentage of sales, we\u2019ve grown in all 3 of our top emerging markets in India and Brazil and China. And so, there are a lot of paths to growth. And we\u2019re focusing on doing it the most efficient and effective way possible. It just turned that out in the first quarter of this year our media spending was down a little bit, even if our commercial spending was solid and we had good new product programs.","And so, as we look out into the future, we\u2019ll continue to -- we\u2019re pretty pragmatic. And we\u2019re looking to grow the most efficient and effective way possible. And if that\u2019s media spending, we\u2019ll spend more on media; if it\u2019s more on in-store support on freezers for H\u00e4agen-Dazs, we\u2019ll do that; if it\u2019s building distribution or new products, we\u2019ll do that. So, you\u2019ll see a full variety of levers. And so, as we look out, I\u2019m not going to give an advertising and media perspective, only because I think what we need to do is provide a growth perspective and then provide the means to get there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney from Consumer Edge Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Jonathan Feeney","I apologize for the deep, detailed question, but I think it\u2019s important; I want to understand what\u2019s going on in Blue Buffalo. You gave us a lot of real helpful data. With the shift, the comparison from the period where they -- last year, they reported at June end and September end obviously gets a lot to tougher as you pointed out in your remarks. But I\u2019m trying to understand how -- I guess how that extra month compares, like how much more difficult this comparison is Q2 versus Q1? And any comments you can make? Obviously, everything\u2019s one month shifted forward, October comes in. How big was that and what was the kind of trend with that we can think about right now?","Jeff Siemon","Jon, this is Jeff Siemon. I\u2019d just tell you that, if you think about the sell-in last year to the first wave of FDM customers, that really peaked in August, September, which are the first two months of Q2 for Blue Buffalo, because they\u2019re on a month lag on our calendar. So, our first quarter for Blue Buffalo ended in July, sell-in in that first pipeline fill was really August, September. So, we\u2019ll get the brunt of that difficult comparison here in Q2. ","Don Mulligan","And Jonathon, this is Don. To put some numbers to it, as Jeff Siemon noted upfront, we posted the pro forma results for Pet, for our F18. And what you\u2019ll see in that, Q1 sales last year for Blue Buffalo were $302 million, in Q2 jumped to 360; and then in Q3 it was 330. So, clearly, there was a pretty significant shipment to the customers, but it\u2019s now our second quarter.","Jonathan Feeney","Right, which is -- I guess, which tells us, it\u2019s right about in line with what the reported numbers were for Blue Buffalo independently. There isn\u2019t much monthly shift there.","Don Mulligan","Yes.","Jonathan Feeney","And can I ask one follow-up, Don. As far as the total, where are you as far as the total channel ACV expansion? If anywhere, if you can comment on that plans, uptake, progress report as to where we stand as far as total distribution growth? Thank you.","Jeff Harmening","Yes. So, this is Jeff. Let me intercept that question from Don and take that. We\u2019re -- if you look at the Food, Drug and Mass channel, we are about -- we only have about 30% ACV, and we only have it with Life Protection Formula only, roughly half of the Blue Buffalo product line. So, as we look ahead, there is a tremendous amount of expansion in front of us in the Food, Drug and Mass channel. And we think we can perform better in specialty and we\u2019re performing really well in e-commerce. So, we see a lot of -- we think that we can drive growth in all 3 of those channels for the -- we can drive for improved performance in all 3 of those channels, certainly drive growth in Food, Drug and Mass and e-commerce for the rest of this year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.","Robert Moskow","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the question. I guess, two questions. One is, just very broadly, it\u2019s surprising to me to see such a big difference between your reported sales and the Nielsen trends. Given that you launched a lot of new products, which I\u2019d expect would fill the pipeline and also you have the e-commerce growth which I guess is not captured by Nielsen. You\u2019ve mentioned some distribution kind of differences. Is that really the answer, it\u2019s really like yogurt distribution, is that really what the difference is? And then, I have a quick follow-up.","Jon Nudi","Hi, Rob. This is John. I guess, again, for the U.S., we are planning for, and you\u2019ve seen historically, about a 1 point gap between movement and RNS, and in Q1 it was 2 points. So, again, it was about a point different than what we\u2019ve seen and what we expect to see for the year. So, again, we think that\u2019ll come back to us. But beyond that, as retailers continue to draw down inventories and focus on working capital, we do expect to see that 1 point gap for the year.","Robert Moskow","Okay. And then, follow-up, I think Don, you said that you would expect, given the performance of new products, you expect a bigger investment behind them in second quarter that will pressure gross margin. Can you give me a sense of what that means? Is that more marketing support, or is it that these new products are lower gross margin mix in nature? Is it pricing? What kind of investment?","Don Mulligan","So, it wasn\u2019t necessarily related to new products, I was talking about the gross margin, it was really the flow HMM versus inflation and our pricing build over the course of the year.","Robert Moskow","Okay. But, I think you said a bigger investment also in your response to Andrew Lazar\u2019s question?","Don Mulligan","No. The point was, as we think about our total brand investment that you\u2019re going to see it hit numerous places in the P&L, not just in media. And I referenced the fact that packaging forward would be an example of something that would hit gross margin, and certainly as we talked about, Oui has been one of the strongest marketing aspects of it.","Jeff Harmening","One of the others is customer activation funds, and where we\u2019re getting in-store taco truck visibility, or other activations we\u2019re getting brand as one in-store, that falls above the net sales line, which should also obviously pressure gross margin.","Don Mulligan","Yes. That wasn\u2019t necessarily unique to Q2; that was just more of a comment as we think about the full-year.","Robert Moskow","Okay. So, maybe it\u2019s a shift in media -- lower media and more towards these types of activities?","Don Mulligan","Yes, for sure. Year-over-year, we\u2019ll see that. Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bryan Spillane","Two questions for me. One, just related to the pricing, the comments you made about price mix will build through the balance of the year. So, I guess, one, just how much of that has already been, I guess discussed with and sold in, and how much still has to sort of be negotiated or sold in? If we can get a sense for that. Just trying to get a sense for, how much could still be open to, I guess, some variability. And then, the second related to that is just, you kind of made a commentary about, just in general, there\u2019s the retailers -- at retailers, there\u2019s more price mix going in. And just why -- what factors are sort of allowing that to happen? Is it that more companies are coming through with SRM tools and being smarter about the way they can sort of negotiate pricing or if there\u2019s some other factor that\u2019s sort of enabling that to -- sort of go into the market?","Jeff Harmening","As we look at the broader food and beverage trends, I think, there\u2019s been a lot written about pricing, and particularly, about how tough it is to get pricing in this environment with everything being so competitive. And it is a competitive environment. But, I think that\u2019s only part of the story. The other part of the story is we\u2019re actually seeing quite a bit of inflation for the industry, and we\u2019re seeing it in a number of areas. So, we\u2019re seeing it in raw materials; we\u2019re seeing it in logistics; we\u2019re seeing it in wage increases. And our retailers are saying the same things. And so, I think that to be honest, in some cases, part of the conversation that had been lost -- the part that it\u2019s a competitive environment, has not been lost. But the part that there\u2019s inflation across a wide spectrum of types of input costs, I think has been lost a little bit. And we all see that and our competitor see that and retailer see that. So, I think that the pricing mix we\u2019ve seen in the marketplace -- and a couple of points of pricing is not a tremendous amount, and it\u2019s certainly not egregious as -- when it comes to the kind of inflation that we\u2019re seeing overall. And so, I think that actually explains why we\u2019re seeing a little bit of pricing in the market, because both we, as manufacturers and our retail customers are all seeing their costs go up on a variety of fronts.","As we look at our price -- as we look into the future, we\u2019ll continue to work all four levers of price realization. So, whether that\u2019s list pricing or trade or sizing or what have you, we will look at all the different elements. And we\u2019ve sold a lot in already. And I\u2019m sure there may be some to come, but we\u2019ve sold a lot of them already all over the globe. And so, we\u2019ve got a pretty good line of sight as to what to expect for the rest of the year.","Bryan Spillane","And I just had one follow-up. There was a couple of comments made about to 2Q, I guess with regard to spending and margins. And so, just as we\u2019re looking at sort of the bottom-line, would we expect that the earnings growth or the earnings performance in the second quarter would still be -- the expectation would be that it would be suitable be below the full-year range or does it all net out to being something close to what you\u2019re expecting for the full-year in terms of earnings growth?","Don Mulligan","Yes. But, we\u2019re not going to forecast in the quarter. I think, we gave some sort of guidance on, some of the Q2 factors we see in response to David\u2019s question on how Q2 will unfold on gross margin versus what we saw in Q1 and then some comments on Blue. I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re going to go any further than that in terms of discussing the quarter.","Bryan Spillane","All right. I figured, I\u2019d give it a try at least. All right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Jason English","I guess, I wanted to come back with another question on the media horse, because I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve beaten it to death just yet. Can you quantify how much you\u2019re A&P was down this quarter, both all-in with Buff and on a base business perspective?","Don Mulligan","Yes. All-in, it contributed to SG&A, it was down mid to high single digits, all-in and double digit on the base business. Again, I would just make sure that we also put that in the context of that we grew organic sales growth for the fourth consecutive quarter. So the levers that we are investing are paying off for us.","Jason English","No doubt, no doubt. And to a couple of questions, or in response to a couple of questions. I think you referenced a bit more trade spend going in and maybe you initially planned for the year in terms of customer activation. As we think about the full year and we think about the totality of your consumer facing spend, both from a trade perspective and from an A&P perspective, is this still tracking in line what you initially expected, or is it going to be higher or lower than what you set up as your initial expectation coming to the year?","Don Mulligan","Yes. Jonathan, it\u2019s in the same range as we have planned, instead of maybe in different buckets. And again, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call it customer activation trade, it may hit that line but it\u2019s different than -- the promotional spending, or the price discounting that most people associated with trade. But, I just want to make sure that that\u2019s clear. But the total brand investment is going to be very near to what we had in the plan, in the same range of the plan and that was obviously informed part of our reaffirmation of our guidance.","Jeff Harmening","Let me build on Don\u2019s point, as we roll around in the details of media spending and trade by quarter and so forth. I mean, what I feel great about is that we did what we said we were going to do in the first quarter. And we said we are going to grow organically, and we did. We said we we\u2019re going to grow Blue Buffalo, we did. We said we\u2019re going to meet our financial commitments, we did. We grew 8 of the top 9 categories in the U.S. We grew in Brazil, despite the trucking strike. We grew in China. We grew in India. We grew in Europe. We grew in C&F and across our core categories and we realized pricing. And so, I do appreciate the specific nature of questions about media. But the fact is that we deliver what we said we\u2019re going to deliver in the first quarter of issue, both in the top line and the bottom line across our established business across Blue Buffalo. And if we can do that for few more quarters, we\u2019re going to have a good year.","Jason English","I hear you. I asked just to understand, not to critique. Thank you very much for the time. I\u2019ll pass it on.","Jeff Siemon","All right. Celina, I think that\u2019s probably all the time we have, given that we\u2019re at the bottom of the hour. So, thank you, everybody for joining us this morning. I appreciate the engagement. I\u2019m available. I know we probably didn\u2019t get to everybody quite on the queue. So, please don\u2019t hesitate to reach out with additional questions today. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the conference call for today.

Welcome to the First Quarter Earnings Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, September 17, 2014. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kris Wenker, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Kris Wenker","Thanks, Operator. Good morning, everybody. I\u2019m here with Ken Powell, our CEO; Don Mulligan, our CFO; and John Church, Executive Vice President of our Global Supply Chain, and I\u2019ll turn the call over to them in just a minute.","Our press release on first quarter results was issued over the wire services earlier this morning. It\u2019s also posted on our website, if you need a copy. You can also find slides on our website that supplement this morning\u2019s presentation.","Our remarks will include forward-looking statements that are based on management\u2019s current views and assumptions. The second slide in today\u2019s presentation lists factors that could cause our future results to be different than our current estimates.","One last housekeeping item, beginning this quarter we reclassified the balance sheet re-measurement impact from hyper inflationary economy, out of International segment operating profits and into an allocated corporate item. The last slide in today\u2019s material will give you prior year results consistent with the new presentation.","So, with that, I\u2019ll turn you over to my colleague beginning with Don.","Don Mulligan","Thanks, Kris, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Slide four summarizes our results for the first quarter. Net sales totaled $4.3 billion, down 1% in constant currency. Segment operating profit totaled $690 million, 15% below prior year due to results in our U.S. Retail segment where lower volume and higher merchandising expense depressed net sales and margin.","Net earnings declined 25% to $345 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.55 as reported. These results include mark-to-market valuation effects in restructuring expense. Excluding these items affecting comparability, adjusted diluted EPS was $0.61, compared to $0.70 a year ago. This was a 13% decline on a constant currency basis.","Slide five shows the components of total company net sales growth. As reported, net sales declined 2% due to lower pound volume, mix and net price realization added 1 point of sales growth. That was offset by foreign exchange which reduced sales growth by 1 percentage point.","U.S. Retail net sales for the first quarter were 5% below last year, reflecting weak industry trends, along with higher trade merchandising expense for us in this period. Our pound volume was down 2%, primarily driven by declines in meals and baking products. We saw pound volume growth in our Snacks, Small Planet Foods and Yoplait divisions for the quarter.","The higher merchandising expense reflects several factors. We launched 145 new products across U.S. Retail, almost 20% above last year's number. We are experiencing less effectiveness for merchandising programs. This is an issue we and others in the industry have noted previously. And we had a difficult comparison. Last year\u2019s first quarter had the lowest quarterly trade expense of the year.","It\u2019s important to note, however, that the increased trade expense in the quarter does not reflect greater depth of discount. Merchandising frequency was up in the quarter. The depth of discount was actually less than the prior year. We expect year-to-year differences in merchandising expense phasing to have less impact on subsequent quarters in fiscal 2015.","In our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment, net sales increased 1% in the first quarter led by our high margin priority platforms. In total, these six platforms, yogurt, frozen breakfast, snacks, biscuits, cereal and mixes posted combined net sales growth of 4%. Favorable products and channel mix combined with lower input cost helped to drive an 18% increase in segment operating profit in the quarter.","Slide 10 summarizes first quarter results for our International segment. Constant currency net sales grew 6% overall. Sales in Canada declined 2%. Excluding some small exits and addition of business lines, sales would have been up modestly in the quarter.","Latin American sales increased 20% driven by another quarter of strong double-digit growth in Brazil. In the Asia-Pacific region, sales increased 4% led by greater China and Korea. And sales for our Europe region also increased 4% with good growth in both the U.K. and France.","Slide 11 details our segment operating profit results in the first quarter. The total operating profit decline was driven by U.S. retails results. International profit was 16% above year ago levels and up 17% on a constant currency basis. In Convenience Stores and Foodservice, profit increased a robust 18%.","After-tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $26 million in the quarter, up 5% in constant currency. CPW sales were 1% below year ago levels in constant currency with growth in Brazil, Chile and Southeast Asia offset by category weakness in Western Europe. Constant currency sales for H\u00e4agen-Dazs Japan grew 3%.","Completing our review of the income statement, corporate unallocated expense excluding mark-to-market effects were down $3 million in the quarter. During the first quarter, we approved a plan to combine certain Yoplait and General Mills\u2019 operational facilities in our International segment to increase efficiencies and reduce costs.","We expect to incur approximately $15 million of net expenses related to these actions and we booked $14 million of this amount in restructuring charges in the first quarter. In a moment, John Church will update you on our plans to increase efficiency and reduce costs across our North American supply chain network.","This initiative will result in additional restructuring charges this year. All of our 2015 restructuring charges will be excluded from adjusted diluted EPS. Effective tax rate for the quarter was 31.8% as reported. Excluding items affecting comparability, the tax rate was 32.3% this year compared to 32.2% a year ago, an average diluted shares outstanding declined 5% in quarter. For the full year, we continue to target a 3% to 4% net reduction in average diluted shares outstanding.","Turning to the balance sheet, slide 14 shows our core working capital declined 6% versus last year\u2019s first quarter driven by improvements in accounts payable. Operating cash flow totaled $329 million in the quarter below last year's results due to lower net earnings. We invested $149 million in fixed assets and we returned more than $700 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Last week, we were pleased to announce plans to acquire Annie\u2019s, a leading company in the U.S. natural organic industry. We have offered to buy Annie's for $46 per share in cash. We plan to fund the acquisition with debt. So this transaction is not expected of any impact on our fiscal 2015 share repurchase plans.","We do expect the Annie\u2019s transaction to be accretive to our earnings in the first 12 months after closing, excluding certain purchase accounting adjustments and transaction integration expenses. Our offer is subject to tender of the majority of the Annie\u2019s shares and certain other customer closing conditions including regulatory approval. We expect the transaction to close later this calendar year.","Our key financial targets for full year 2015 fiscal year have not changed. We expect mid-single-digit growth in constant currency net sales, including the benefit of the 53rd week. We are also targeting mid-single-digit growth in constant currency segment operating profit. We plan to reinvest the benefits of the 53rd week in growth driving activities. On the bottom-line, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to grow at a high-single-digit rate in constant currency from the base of $2.82 per share achieved in fiscal 2014.","And with that, I will turn the microphone over to John Church. John?","John Church","Thanks, Don. Hello, everybody. It\u2019s great to be with you on the call this morning to talk about General Mills\u2019 approach to continuously improving our global supply chain. Our supply chain strategy is centered on the engagement of our 25,000 supply chain employees around the world. We leave that engagement with safety in our products and in our operations. We protect our consumers and our people by establishing systems and processes that ensure the reliability of our operations.","Our supply chain helps grow our business with customer service excellence and increasingly by partnering with customers to drive out waste in our combined value chains, and we prioritize return on capital by reducing inventory levels, creating capacity through operational improvements, and by extending payment terms. Additionally, return on capital is driven by our long-standing practice of holistic margin management or HMM.","HMM has been a defining characteristic of General Mills for nearly 10 years now. HMM in a mindset of looking at our end-to-end processes to identify waste -- to identify costs that are not valued by our customers or our consumers. Those costs are waste. We find ways to reduce or eliminate waste from our process allowing us to deliver more value to the consumer. HMM is truly holistic. It encompasses cost of goods savings, mix, and pricing. We also work to drive waste out of our marketing programs and our admin processes. The savings we realized through HMM are used to offset inflation -- and fuel -- and provide fuel to our brand building efforts.","We believe the demand driven increases in input costs will be a reality for our business for this foreseeable future. We expect inflation to average 4% to 5% per year. We are currently estimating input costs inflation of 3% in fiscal 2015, and we're roughly 55% covered for the year at this point. Clearly, the demand for HMM to offset inflation is not subsiding.","We're continuing to deliver strong HMM levels each year. Back in fiscal 2010, we set a goal of achieving a cumulative $4 billion in COGS HMM through fiscal 2020. I'm pleased to say that we\u2019re already halfway to our goal. We are targeting another year of strong HMM delivery in 2015, with more than $400 million in COGS HMM in this year\u2019s plan. I have great confidence that by the time we get to 2020 we will have met or possibly exceeded our $4 billion goal.","Our HMM plans for 2015 include contributions from all areas of our supply chain. We are taking the same expertise we\u2019ve developed in our internal supply chain to our external partners through an initiative we call GEOS or General Mills End-to-End Optimization Solutions. By broadening our HMM scope up and down the value chain to suppliers and customers, we expect GEOS to deliver an incremental $10 million in savings for General Mills this year.","In International, we reengineered our factory in Pouso Alegre, Brazil. We streamlined a number of ingredients that we use in the facility going from six types of salt to two types of salt for example. We have improved production scheduling by removing small volume skews that created significant changeover downtime and we automated many of the packaging systems. In total, these initiatives will save more than $5 million annually for our Brazil business, and we\u2019re globalizing our sourcing capabilities allowing us to leverage purchasing scale and expertise across our domestic and international businesses on inputs like packaging, sugar, fruit, and cocoa. These efforts are expected to deliver $10 million in savings this year.","Our HMM efforts have enabled us to hold our overall gross margin relatively steady in recent years, despite inflation and volatility in our input costs. In fact, our reported gross margin in fiscal 2014 is in line with the levels from 2008 and '09.","That\u2019s despite adding Yoki in Yoplait International to substantial businesses with lower than company average gross margins and despite cumulative input cost inflation of 30% over that time.","We are confident that HMM will be an ongoing source of cost savings and efficiency for our supply chain. But we have also launched a review of our North American manufacturing and distribution network to look for additional opportunities to reduce cost.","This effort which we\u2019ve renamed Project Century has the objectives of streamlining and simplifying our North American operations and positioning our supply chain for future growth. We\u2019re relocating production to make our network simpler and more responsive and we will capture cost savings in the process.","We\u2019re targeting $100 million in cumulative cost savings by fiscal 2017 with material savings realized in beginning of fiscal 2016. We\u2019ll be announcing specific actions related to Project Century in the very near future. I'm confident this initiative will increase our efficiency, generating more fuel that we can use to reinvest behind our brands and fund future growth initiatives.","Thank you for your time this morning. I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ken Powell.","Ken Powell","Thank you, John, and good morning to one and all. I\u2019ll begin my remarks by acknowledging that the operating environment in several of our markets has grown more challenging. For our U.S. Convenience Stores and Foodservice business, I would say, trends are stable. We\u2019re seeing low single-digit nominal growth in our channels.","U.S. Retail industry trends are a bit weaker. Last year we saw aggregate retail sales for our U.S. categories increase one half of a percent in Nielsen measured outlets. In the latest quarter, measured sales for our categories declined 1%.","International developed markets were a bit softer too. Retail sales for our categories were flat in both Canada and Europe in the first quarter, after growing at low single-digit rate last year.","In emerging markets, we\u2019re still seeing sales growth for our businesses, but the pace of growth in China did slow a bit this quarter. So with that as a backdrop, let me give you an update on performance in each of our three business segments.","For U.S. Retail, Don told you, our pound volume in the quarter was down 2% and three businesses really drove that decline, dessert mixes, meal products and frozen vegetables. Competitive dynamics in these categories were particularly difficult and if you follow Nielsen or IRI, you see that reflected in our market share results. We\u2019re tactically adjusting our plans to make sure we\u2019re competitive in these categories and I expect these actions will result in improved sales trends in the coming months.","We did make good progress on the U.S. priorities that Jeff Harmening outlined at our Investor Day back in July and those were continuing to lead performance in U.S. cereal, returning U.S. yogurt to growth and maintaining strong snacks momentum. I\u2019ll give you some details on each of these starting with cereal.","The U.S. cereal category continues to be challenged with retail sales, including our estimate of non-measured channels down 4% in the first quarter. We believe that returning the cereal category to growth will require more product news, better innovation and increased investment behind consumer-directed marketing from all the branded players. We are working hard across each of these areas.","For instance, consumers love great tasting cereals. We renovated Cinnamon Toast Crunch this year adding more cinnamon taste and retail sales for this brand were up 7% in the quarter.","Today's consumers are seeking more protein options for breakfast. We introduced two flavors of Cheerios protein in June. It still early but the initial results are encouraging. This new line reached a nearly 1% market share in August.","We continue to increase our media investment. For example, Honey Nut Cheerios, the largest brand in the category recently launched a great new advertising campaign featuring Usher. In total, our cereal market share was up 30 basis points to 31% in the quarter.","Our second priority for U.S. Retail is to renew sales momentum for our U.S. Yogurt business and we did that in the first quarter with net sales up 1%, retail sales up 3% and market share up a 0.5 point.","Yoplait Greek and Greek 100 remained key growth drivers for this business. This quarter our share in the Greek segment was up 240 basis points versus last year and retail sales for original Yoplait were up 12% in the first quarter. We have some exciting product news coming in the second half of the year to keep this momentum going.","We still have work to do on our Yoplait Light business. It was the most directly impacted by the growth of Greek yogurt over the past few years. We recently removed aspartame from this line and we\u2019re connecting with consumers behind the new outsmart temptation campaign. So some good progress on yogurt this quarter, and our U.S. Snacks division is off to a nice start.","New Fiber One Streusel bars and new Nature Valley items are helping to drive 6% retail sales growth for our grain snacks business. We picked up almost three additional share points, increasing our leading position in grain snacks to nearly 44% of the category. In fruit snacks, continued investment behind our Mott\u2019s and Fiber One lines led to retail sales growth of 5% and a two point share increase in the first quarter.","Our natural and organic snacks also are doing well. Retail sales across L\u00e4rabar nutrition bars, Food Should Taste Good savory snacks, and Cascadian Farm granola bars were up a combined 17% in the first quarter. This reflects growth on core established products as well as strong new innovations like L\u00e4rabar Renola, a grain-free granola and Food Should Taste Good gluten-free brown rice crackers. Cascadian Farm recently launched a bee-friendlier campaign to raise awareness and money for bee colony research. As part of a campaign, we are selling a limited edition Buzz Crunch Honey Almond cereal.","The acquisition of Annie's will significantly expand our presence in the U.S. branded, organic, and natural food industry, where sales have been growing at a 12% compound rate over the last 10 years. Annie's competes in a number of attractive food categories, with particular strength in convenient meals and snacks to General Mills priority platforms. Consumers know and trust Annie's purpose-driven culture and authentic brand. We believe that combining the Annie's product portfolio and go-to-market capabilities with General Mills supply chain, sales and marketing resources will accelerate the growth of our organic and natural food business.","Two others U.S. retail businesses deserve a quick mention. Retail sales for Totino\u2019s Pizza were up 7% in the quarter and sales for Totino's Pizza Rolls grew more than 3%. The brand posted share gains of roughly one point in both categories.","For Old El Paso Mexican products, new burrito balls in the freezer case and flavor blasted taco shells in the shelf-stable Mexican aisle helped drive retail sales growth of 7% in the first quarter.","And slide 35 shows our first quarter market share results in key U.S. retail categories. In total, consumer takeaway was better than our net sales results in the quarter and we recorded market share increases in categories, representing two-thirds of our Nielsen measured sales.","Let\u2019s shift to our Convenience and Foodservice segment where our six priority platforms led topline growth. Net sales for yogurt increased 34% due to good growth from our Yoplait Greek and ParfaitPro lines as well as the July introduction of Yoplait Go-GURT as an option in McDonald's Happy Meals. Sales for our snack business were up 6% led by expansion of Chex Chips and good growth on Nature Valley.","Finally, we saw double-digit net sales growth in frozen breakfast where we\u2019re leveraging a full line of heat-and-eat whole grain breakfast offerings for K through 12 schools.","For our International business, the Europe and Australasia region posted mid-single-digit net sales growth in constant currency in the first quarter. It was a good summer for H\u00e4agen-Dazs with retail sales up 5%, fueled by our new triple sensations line.","Old El Paso's line of Stand 'N Stuff Tortillas and Dinner Kits is off to a great start around the region. Retail sales for the brand were up 12% in the latest quarter and Yoplait continues to grow led by Libert\u00e9 Greek-style yogurt in the U.K. and Yopa! high protein yogurt in France. Yoplait\u2019s year-to-date category share is up almost a [four point] (ph) in both markets.","Turning to our Asia Pacific region, constant currency net sales for H\u00e4agen-Dazs increased 9%. This was driven by unique to Asian varieties like classic milk and blueberries and cream, and by continued retail expansion into new cities in China. Sales of Wanchai Ferry frozen dim sum also increased in the first quarter. Thanks to expanded distribution, as well as new flavors of dumplings.","There is a slowdown in the macro environment in China, which combined with government driven changes in gifting policy is having some impact on our business there. Despite these factors, our first quarter constant currency sales in Greater China grew at a mid single-digit rate with an exciting lineup of new products coming in the second half, we expect Greater China sales growth to strengthen in the remainder of the year.","In Latin America, constant currency net sales increased by 20% in the first quarter, powered by another quarter of strong results in Brazil. Yoki's Festa Junina merchandising event, which coincided with the world soccer championship this year was a great success. A great deal of credit goes to the Yoki\u2019s sales force who secured a record number of in-store displays during this period.","As a result, constant currency net sales for Yoki Popcorn, already the market leader with over 70% share, increased by more than 30% in the quarter. And though it's still early, our launch of Betty Crocker dessert mixes in Brazil are off to a good start with positive consumer and retailer feedback.","We have plenty of activity coming in the second quarter, Soup Season is fast approaching and our distribution is up. Thanks to new items like cream-based light soups and great tasting traditional soups. We are increasing our media support this quarter, leveraging Weight Watchers digital media and our taste-focused national TV campaign.","And we have great plans for the baking season too. We are launching 11 seasonal items such as Candy Corn and Gingerbread Cookies. We are increasing TV support for Betty Crocker and we will continue to engage consumers through our digital media efforts.","We have exciting plans for our International business. We have quickly gained distribution on Old El Paso Stand \u2018N Stuff tortillas throughout our Europe region and we are now turning on TV support in U.K., France and Australia. We are continuing strong media support for Libert\u00e9 Greek yogurt in the U.K. and Yopa! in France and we are launching four new Yopa! items to extend our range.","In the Asia-Pacific region, we are introducing new varieties of Betty Crocker mixes in the Middle East and a Belgian chocolate macadamia nut flavor of H\u00e4agen-Dazs for our Retail business in Greater China.","So, with that, let me summarize today's General Mills update. The operating environment for food and beverage companies remains quite challenging and trends weakened for some markets in the latest quarter.","However, we've not changed our 2015 growth targets. We expect mid single-digit growth in net sales and segment operating profit on constant currency basis, and high single-digit constant currency growth in adjusted diluted EPS.","We continue to see strong opportunities for our brands. Our number one priority is to find those opportunities and leverage them to accelerate our topline growth. And finally, as John shared, we are maintaining our strong HMM discipline and we are initiating new projects to further boost our efficiency and sharpen our focus.","So, I thank you for your time this morning and for your interest in General Mills. Now let's open the call for questions. Operator, will you get us going.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Ken Goldman - JPMorgan","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Ken Powell","Hi, Ken.","Don Mulligan","Good morning.","Ken Goldman - JPMorgan","Hi. I have a bit of general question. What do you think has to happen for the food industry to get out of, to me, what seems to be the fairly self-destructive pattern of heavy promotional spending right now? Do we just need and this is really across a lot of categories? I'm just curious, if someone just have to say enough is enough, I am going to loose volume in order to restore some, I guess, price rationality or are you just getting so much pressure you being the industry from large retailers to fund deal back that even if you want to be more rational it might be a little difficult at the current time?","Ken Powell","So, Ken, its Ken Powell, and thank you for the question. I would say that we have albeit Q1 aside. And we can talk in more detail about how that played out in the comparison of this quarter to a year ago and some of the plumbing around that. But I would say in general as we look at price points, as we look at promotional discounts and this sort of thing, we have maintained fairly steady levels there across our categories.","But to your general comment on what\u2019s it going to take industry wide, I think all the roads lead to higher levels of innovation. I'm continuing to focus on brand renovation making sure that we have the right level of messaging behind our core brands and new products. I mean, I think ultimately innovation and capitalizing on consumer trends is what gets -- what gets us to higher levels of growth. And the reason we\u2019re so certain of that is because we see that when we get that formula right, we get a very market response from consumers.","We talked a little bit about some of the cereal changes in Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Lucky Charms. Last quarter, we\u2019re seeing the response very rapidly. This quarter we have developed now over the last year and a half and launched very good varieties of Greek Yogurt as an example and in support of those with very effective marketing campaigns and it\u2019s very satisfying now for us to see those products to gain traction. We changed the formulation in the positioning of our core Yoplait original and that brand was up double digit this quarter.","So behind consumer targeted initiatives, so ultimately the answer to your question, which I think is the right question is innovation, core renovation, strong consumer communication, that will get us where we need to be.","Ken Goldman - JPMorgan","Right. Thank you, Ken.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please proceed.","Chris Growe - Stifel","Hi. Good morning.","Ken Powell","Hey, Chris.","Don Mulligan","Good morning, Chris.","Chris Growe - Stifel","Hi. I just had two questions I could. First one will be to just to better understand maybe this is with getting a more into the detail you were talking about there, Ken but within U.S retail to see sales down 5% and the measured channel data showing flat up a little bit, down a little bit, somewhere in that neighborhood. So I just want to better understand maybe this is the promotional spending year-over-year and that comparison that is the major driver of the GAAP if you will, sales in reported consumption and reported sales. Can you offer a little more color on it?","Don Mulligan","Yeah. Chris, this is Don. It really goes back to the point that Ken touched on that one into -- in terms of the phasing of our merchandising, as we talked about in June or July in our Investor Day. We\u2019ve seen drop in merchandising effectiveness. We, General Mills, we the industry have seen that and it does take some time to reset the plans. And so we knew that the year unfolded that our merchandising expense whether you look at it as a percent of sales or cost per sold case, it will come down on year-over-year comparisons.","But it\u2019s going to take couple of quarters to work it through so that\u2019s one of the reason that we signal that we expected lower profit in the first quarter versus last year where we still see full-year growth in the high-single digits.","Chris Growe - Stifel","Okay. And then maybe a question for Don -- you or for John about the cost savings coming through this year. So with little softer sales in the first quarter, I know you kept your guidance in place for the year. Do you now expect a heavier degree of cost savings may be along those if you could -- I know we have $400 million, I think of HMM savings, $40 million overhead savings, so are there any project entry savings that have come through this year?","Don Mulligan","Minimal projects entry as John said, we\u2019re going to be starting that effort this year. We\u2019ll see significant savings starting in \u201816. We\u2019re not making that a great deal this year. It\u2019s mostly going to come from our overhead efforts. And obviously there is the ongoing both HMM efforts that we see within our COGS, within our overhead expenses.","First, when we you start the year like we have, everyone is tightening their belt a bit from an admin standpoint. And the one thing I would notice is that we did see growth in our media support. So that's one area because we have good ideas to drive growth in some of our key segment and some of our key platforms. We haven't cut back. What we\u2019re doing it is really an overhead in some of those project areas we discussed. We\u2019re still targeting the $40 million for this year and it would be something larger in F\u201816.","Chris Growe - Stifel","Would you expect the gross margin to grow this year, Don?","Don Mulligan","Yes.","Chris Growe - Stifel","Okay, thank you.","Don Mulligan","We still expect it to grow modestly.","Chris Growe - Stifel","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Hi. I guess two questions. I guess, I was a little unclear as to why U.S. retail profits will get better during the course of the year. I think Don you said that it's taking some time to adjust your promotional spending tactics. So maybe just a little more detail on why was the spending so high in first quarter. You mentioned frequency, I mean, were you just having very frequent deals and now you won't for the rest of the year and therefore the profits will be stronger, just a little more clarity there. And then secondly on the restructuring programs, I haven't seen anywhere how much the programs is going to cost in terms of cash costs or hit the P&L. Could you give us some help there?","Don Mulligan","So let me start with the USRO profit first and then I\u2019ll frame up the Q1 if you thinking about the profit decline in the first quarter for USRO. You know about half of that was because of the trade phasing and the merchandising effectiveness we talked about. There was another, probably third from negative mix, product mix and then a bit from volume.","As I said, we didn\u2019t -- we held our media investment behind, some of the good ideas that Ken took us through. So as the year unfolds, we expect a couple of things to happen. First, our price mix will improve as the merchandising effectiveness evens out and our trade spends phasing rebalances versus last year again as we -- as we try to highlight. Not only is there a merchandise effectiveness opportunity for us, we also set absolutely lower trade spend in our first quarter last year versus balance of that year and this year the phasing is really reverse of that. So that will be the first thing.","Second is we do expect volumes to improve. We look at the phasing of last year\u2019s volume growth. The comps get easier as the year unfolds. And so we expect that to improve. And then we expect the mix as well not to be as negative in the first quarter as it was in the first quarter. So that -- and again strong overhead control and some of the benefit of that $40 million in overhead savings will accrue to our U.S. retail business. Those are the factors that give us confidence. So we\u2019re going to see better profit as the year unfolds.","In terms of the restructuring charges, as I hope you understand, we want to make sure that we inform everybody internally on what those changes are before we start talking about numbers either in terms of positions or dollars. What I will tell you is that there will be some severance of fixed asset write-offs, probably about half of it will be non-cash when we do give you the figures.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Okay.","Ken Powell","Rob, let me just jump in and add a couple of comments to your first question which you know had to do with rest of the year. So I think Don explained well that we expect to see sort of reduction or elimination of these negatives that we saw in Q1. You know, coupled with that there are number of positives, I think, that are going to continue to work for us.","First of all, as we say we have good marketing initiatives and we have -- we're planning an increase in consumer directed marketing this year. Second of all, yogurt, which you know, has been a drag for the last couple of years is going to be a positive as we go forward. We\u2019re quite encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing there.","And then we feel we\u2019d like to start in spite of the comment that we made about China. We do like our start in International especially in Canada and Western Europe which are our biggest markets. We like what\u2019s happening there and we also like what we\u2019re seeing in that convenience and food service business, which is off to a very strong start.","So we see a number of positives that we\u2019re going to continue to press for us here over the course of the year. And then as Don said, we have a very good control of costs and overheads, better than plan that will continue. So I think those are kind of the way we\u2019re looking at the balance of the year.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","But is it fair to say that U.S. retail mid single-digit profit growth maybe you are going to be a little bit below that. But it could be made up for by stronger International and Convenience Stores or are you maintaining the segment guidance for the year?","Don Mulligan","Yeah, Rob, I think it is fair to say there\u2019s going to be probably a mix shift if you look at how the year started for us. We said we\u2019re going to be down in the first quarter. We were -- we're actually on the bottom line working materially of our own internal plan. But we did have some favorable results in Convenience and Foodservice and International offset by some weaker than planned results in USRO. I think those trends will probably have some impact on our full-year outlook for those businesses.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman with General Mills.","Ken Powell","Hey, Eric, welcome to the team.","Eric Katzman - General Mills","I have a buy recommendation, but I wouldn\u2019t go that far. Okay. Let\u2019s talk a little bit about sales to start. So you\u2019ve got Annie's, but currency is more of a headwind. So where do you think dollar reported sales given the -- in addition the promotion and the first quarter miss? Where do you see like dollar reported sales coming in using all other things, including M&A?","Ken Powell","With M&A, it depends obviously when we are closing Annie's, but I wouldn\u2019t tell you that we signaled through the couple set headwind from a forex standpoint on EPS, so let\u2019s around that to a 1%. You can probably apply that same percent on our net sales if you\u2019re going to get the reported numbers. Annie's is a $200 million, it would be more than that, but then we closed given its growth rate, $1 million business, and we are projecting to close that this calendar year. So we will probably get half a year of sales from that business as well. So add a $100 million for Annie\u2019s or more and take off about a 1% from forex on top of the mid-single-digit guidance that we\u2019ve given you on constant currency. That will probably range in the ballpark.","Eric Katzman - General Mills","Okay. And then I guess the second question has to go with the new products. It seems like you\u2019re really emphasizing all the new product launches both in your last call and at the Analyst Day. Can you make the point that this year is really all about growth? Is this first quarter where U.S. retail albeit in a very tough environment? Do the new products not as successful as you would've hoped initially? Or was it just promotion on the core that overwhelmed what is new product success, maybe you could kind of expand out a bit?","Ken Powell","We like our new products lineup which I commented on in my remarks. Cheerios Protein is off to a very strong start. The snack products, Strudel, the Nature Valley, they have been good. We think the soups, the light cream soups will be very good. The OEP products that we\u2019ve launched -- Old El Paso, I beg your pardon. Chris, those flavored shelves will be quite good. I mean, as we go down that, our U.S. portfolio, we feel very good about those.","The Foodservice -- Convenience and Foodservice business is entirely driven by new product innovation, whether it\u2019s Go-GURT and McDonald\u2019s or new varieties of Greek, new chips, new offerings to K-12s. We like the innovation there, and we have good innovation across Haagen-Dazs and Old El Paso in Europe. So the new products are very much important for us and part of the mix. The issue in Q1 is primarily the trade and the merchandising impact, which, as we said, will normalize as the year goes forward, and those new product contributions I think will be more visible.","Don Mulligan","And Eric what I will detail also is Ken shared that chart on a market share performance. And while the categories aren\u2019t growing at the rate that we had maybe originally planned, our competitive situation is pretty strong. We have two-thirds of our growing share and two-thirds of our category sales. And so I think that would not happen without some meaningful contributions from our new products.","Ken Powell","Maybe one other point, Eric maybe one other detail here to point, to make, but it\u2019s worth pointing out, we did see particularly in our dessert mix business this summer Betty Crocker mixes. We saw a very competitive promotional environment there. And if you watch our shares, you saw that business down quite a bit, and as to a lesser extent vegetables. And so I think there were some competitiveness issues there. And as we kind of tactically adjust if you will and head into the fall and winter baking season which is where we concentrate our program, we would expect those businesses which were volume drag also in Q1 again to become more of a contributor.","Eric Katzman - General Mills","Okay. If I could just ask one more, in the restructuring, could you consider getting out of any brands or businesses as oppose to capacity and labor. I mean, with the industry and everything that's going on and you said what were the -- was something more on the brands or lines considered for sale as you look at what can grow in this change in consumer environment? And I\u2019ll pass it on. Thanks.","Ken Powell","Well, thanks Eric. So we are continually looking and reviewing our portfolio and the categories that we\u2019re competing in. And so the answer to your question is that\u2019s an ongoing process and obviously nothing to talk about our report but we are constantly reviewing our portfolio.","Operator","And our next question comes from line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please proceed.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Don Mulligan","Hello Bryan.","Ken Powell","Good morning.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America","I just wanted to follow-up on one comment that you have made, Don and then I had a question just on brand merchandising. Don, I think, you might have said previously in response to one of the other questions. At the first quarter bottom line came in relatively close to where your internal forecast were, is that right?","Don Mulligan","Yes, EPS. Yeah. The EPS correct.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America","Okay. And then in terms of the merchandising, I guess, one question I would have maybe just going forward. It just seems like you\u2019ve got a lot going on. You launched 145 new products in the first quarter. You\u2019re going to be changing some of the merchandising tactics on some of your other brands. But is the lack of lift or sort of the efficiency of the merchandising and maybe this is a more general question. Is it tied at all to -- there is just generally most of your -- the industry is trying to do more, trying to merchandise more or launch new products to try to stimulate demand. And retailers just can't execute all of that merchandising effectively. So it sort of dilutes the intent just simply because they\u2019re trying to do too much?","Ken Powell","So Bryan, you kind of summarize the number of comments that we made in June on the merchandising environment. And there is more kind of merchandising and promotional offers now seeking what is a limited display space in the store and that is an environment where I think, I should question sort of points out quality can suffer. You see more offshelf kind of pricing. You see more ads without an end isle or you see lots of products at the end of the isle.","So there is lots of activity seeking relatively limited space and that\u2019s why for us it's important. First of all that we focused very much on how we execute these events and the brand that we promote and do everything we can to make sure that there are sort of must have promotions. And there are other consumer things that accompany them to make them appealing.","So our execution is very important for us in this environment. And as well as just constantly looking at what we do, did it work, what was the ROI and if something didn't work or tactic doesn\u2019t work to apply the same HMM stuff that we do in all of the rest of the business, apply those and get rid of that kind of promotion and try something else. So it is an ongoing process of review and evaluation, making sure the execution is of the highest level because it is a very competitive environment out there as you point out with your question.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America","But fair to say that as you described sort of changing merchandising tactics, it\u2019s too address that specific dynamic, really trying to hold it on those -- generally inefficiencies and provide retailers with programs that should be more efficient and maybe take a higher priority?","Ken Powell","Very much so and also just to highlight, it\u2019s very much about that. It\u2019s certainly not about depth of discount or anything like that. I mean, we think those are -- it\u2019s not about going in that direction. It\u2019s all about the execution of the entire program.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America","Okay. Thank you.","Ken Powell","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.","Ken Zaslow - BMO capital markets","Hey, good morning everyone.","Ken Powell","Hey Ken. Good morning, Ken.","Ken Zaslow - BMO capital markets","Just two questions, one is how do you assess the opportunities for Annie\u2019s like, what do you envision the size of it, do you -- where do you see this trend going and how large do you think it could be the margin structure, I know they have had some issues internally? So can you give a little bit of color on that?","Ken Powell","Yeah. I\u2019d love to, obviously, we think it\u2019s a terrific equity. It\u2019s a very, it\u2019s a unique equity in that organic space sort of it\u2019s an all family equity. Its mom\u2019s buying organic products for herself and for her family and the kids, which is a very attractive positioning within the organic space.","They\u2019ve -- as you know, they\u2019ve had consistent very strong growth and we think that the brand is very flexible and very expandable, giving that -- given that broad positioning and gatekeeper target. So we really like the positioning and the reason we bought it is because of that flexibility and the growth opportunity.","There are also some sort of business model opportunities that I think will result from the combination of Annie's with General Mills. First of all, we just have more sales force capacity that we can bring to Annie's and that means that we are very confident that we can continue to increase the distribution of those brands and that\u2019s a good opportunity for us.","There are numerous margin expansion opportunities for -- with Annie's, everything, can from the sourcing and how ingredients are brought in to the logistics and how we reach customers, all of the other internal supply chain, HMM things. We think there are many opportunities here and we have actually jointly discussed these opportunities with Annie's management and they are quite excited by those opportunities. And then again, they will just be some cost savings that we can capture as a corporate entity, Annie's becomes part of General Mills.","One other thing that I\u2019d like to add, they have terrific marketing and sales capability, particularly as it relates to the natural and organic channel. They really focused there and that is going to be an opportunity for the entire General Mills natural and organic portfolio. We think that they can really help us to accelerate the growth of our existing portfolio brands.","So, anyway, I am not going to tell you, how high is up that we are awfully excited by that brand and what we can do to help it grow faster and more profitably and what Annie's can do to help us with the rest of our natural\/organic portfolio. We think it\u2019s going to be really good combination.","Ken Zaslow - BMO capital markets","And Ken, to make it more mainstream like, one of your competitor did was a organic type of brand as well or like its good still have it panache of being focused on the organic channel and you are not trying to make it mainstream and make it more of General Mills\u2019 type of product, is that fair?","Ken Powell","Yeah. No. That\u2019s very fair. We learn that lesson about 15 years ago, when we first acquired Small Planet Foods and we have -- we learned a tremendous amount from these various natural and organic companies that we\u2019ve acquired over the years. We've been very good. I think about leaving them alone. Let them do that thing. We will retain Annie's headquarters in Berkeley. These are very talented people. They build a -- built a really good brand. And key is just to figure out where we have capabilities that can really help them and bring them those capabilities which they are actually eager to -- eager to have to accelerate the growth of this thing.","Ken Zaslow - BMO capital markets","Great. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Ken Powell","Yeah.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Please proceed. ","John Baumgartner - Wells Fargo","Thanks for the question. Ken, you mentioned the slowdown in China, but the economic news out of Brazil and Europe hasn\u2019t really been to hot recently either? So, I guess, given that, what\u2019s your confident in terms of your guidance and maybe this consumer frugality we are seeing here in North America doesn't take root more deeply in these geographies we are still seeing growth?","Ken Powell","Yeah. So the situation in China, I think, is partly macroeconomic and partly, and I think very specifically related to government policies around gifting and entertainment and these sorts of things that has a very direct impact on some of our channels, our gifting programs through our H\u00e4agen-Dazs cafes for an example. So there is sort of a very specific impact.","In Brazil even with the sort of the economic slowdown, we are seeing consumer food sales not just in our categories, but broadly across the industry continue to be a pretty solid. And obviously, we\u2019re participating in that. And also, I would say, John, that our products are very well targeted to, if you will, the solid working and middle class in Brazil. So our price points are good. These are very much everyday products for most consumers. And so we think that they are very well-positioned to be resilient even during a period of some slowdown in Brazil.","Don Mulligan","The other thing, John, I\u2019d add in Brazil is that one of the consumer behaviors we\u2019ve seen is the shift to the smaller mom-and-pop stores. And one of the real strong capabilities that we acquired with Yoki was a national sales force that was deeply ingrained in those channels. And we think that\u2019s play into our advantage today as well.","John Baumgartner - Wells Fargo","Great. Thanks, Don. Thanks, Ken.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi. Please proceed.","David Driscoll - Citi","Good morning.","Ken Powell","Hi, David.","David Driscoll - Citi","Hi. Just wanted to ask a little bit more about the U.S. retail profit performance. Specifically, Don, I wanted to ask -- you cited here unfavorable price realization mix and lower volumes as the contributing factors to the $155 million decline. Notably absent in these comments is comments about gross inflation and\/or productivity savings in the quarter. Can you talk about this a little bit? Obviously it must've been positive, but I'm curious about magnitude of it and the pacing of these programs throughout the year?","Don Mulligan","David, as we -- as John reiterated today, we still expect 3% inflation for the year. We think it's fairly evenly distributed during the year, so we don't necessarily see any unique quarterly facing. HMM, our productivity savings from HMM are similar. So one of the reasons that we remain confident in guiding to a higher gross margin is because with inflation at 3% and HMM productivity savings over $400 million, we look at that as a net offset at least and part of that came through in the first quarter which is why it really wasn\u2019t a contributing factor year-over-year.","David Driscoll - Citi","But the productivity would be more back-half loaded then front-half loaded?","Don Mulligan","No. Not materially.","David Driscoll - Citi","","Final question just, Ken, you make a really important statement in the press release where you say and you said it in your prepared script, but you acknowledge the U.S. market conditions are more challenging than expected. You said the quarter came out EPS-wise where you expected and you maintain guidance. So there's just -- it\u2019s like you to connect the dots for me, if everything is more difficult, but yet EPS comes out as expected. In a way I feel like I am getting a little bit of both here, I am getting that, your plans coming out as advertised, but then you're making the statement that no, no, no watch out, the environment is tougher. I feel like we should be worried about the guidance, but I'd like you to comment on what this comment means and how confident you are in the full year numbers?","Ken Powell","Well, I mean, it means that we're staying with our guidance because that's the way the business looks to us right now as we look forward, but we do acknowledge that the environment is more challenging, so there is some risk around that profile. But we do think because of the factors that we talked about earlier in the call, which is that we -- the trade which was a primary issue this quarter, the trade will normalize, some of the bigger volume drags will strengthen, coupled again with the positive momentum that we have in a number of areas of the business.","Those factors all combined and then again on the -- with well controlled on the cost side, we are guiding to our full year guidance for the year and that we will recover there as we go through the next three quarters. I think the wildcard is the category and we don't know whether they\u2019re going to be a headwind, a tailwind, or a neutral. I think that\u2019s the unknown right now.","We\u2019re encouraged somewhat by what we\u2019re seeing over the last several weeks. They seem to be strengthening, but whether that\u2019s going to be a headwind or a tailwind remains to be seen. But in any event, our job is to execute around innovation and core brand renovation and make sure we\u2019ve got strong consumer programs drive the business that way and that's our plan, we like the plans that we have and that\u2019s why we feel confident right now about maintaining guidance.","Don Mulligan","And David, what I would add to that is, as I said, we came close to our internal plan on EPS, but the mix was very different. We absolutely do not plan for the full year for International or for Convenience and Foodservice we are growing midteens in profit.","So there are some puts and takes in the first quarter that some came toward us and some went against us. The overriding one that, we are going to be working on and watching as the year unfolds is the U.S. thorough topline volume growth, because we do expect that to go from a negative in the first quarter to a positive, while we are working through the merchandising effectiveness.","So any caution around the category performance, the industry performance really reflects that area for us and that is where the, that\u2019s where our key focus is right now as we think about the rest of the year in our financial performance.","David Driscoll - Citi","Thank you. Very helpful.","Ken Powell","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.","Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein","Good morning, everyone.","Ken Powell","Hey, Alexia.","Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein","Hi. So two questions, first of all on advertising, which I don\u2019t think has come up yet, was your advertising spending up or down year-on-year in this quarter and are you seeing any deterioration in the effectiveness of advertising and a lot of companies are saying with respect to merchandising, so that\u2019s the first question?","And then the second one with respect to acquisitions, you obviously announced Annie's this past week, is that it for the time being? Do you have an appetite for more potentially in the near future and if so, which direction would that be, could it be more in the natural area, could it be more looking overseas and what sort of scale might you would be thinking about as you think about your acquisition strategy? Thank you.","John Church","Yes. So, Alexia, our advertising in Q1 in the U.S. was up\u2026","Don Mulligan","Flat in U.S., 1% total company\u2026","John Church","Okay. I am getting, so flat in the U.S. and up 1% overall for the company. And of course, we are always monitoring the effectiveness of advertising programs, but we have, we have some very good performance behind advertising. We think that the sort of revised and renovated positioning for Yoplait Core Cup around the snacking benefits of the product, which we are running quite a bit has been highly effective and one of the reasons why we are seeing resurging growth there. Obviously, we have been communicating a lot about the product reformulations in Big G we commented on the growth in Cinnamon Toast Crunch.","So, again, we are always evaluating and monitoring effectiveness of advertising. But when we have something -- when we have a good product change or something new to say and we say it to the right people, seems to work well for us.","Ken Powell","On M&A, I'll let Don jump in on that.","Don Mulligan","Yes. Alexia, Annie's, obviously, it set a place for us in terms of, it\u2019s kind of businesses that we are looking for here in the U.S., which is around the natural organic better for you areas. We have done smaller acquisitions, this was the largest one in that space and we feel good about that.","And our focus outside the U.S. remains on emerging markets. As we have talked before, Indonesia, India, finding that next leg if you will to add what we have in China and what we purchased in Brazil, can remains on our focus and those would be in -- the U.S. ones could be on the smaller side, we\u2019ve done small to large ones, internationally there could be a mix as well, although, if we go into a country like Indonesia, similar to our entry into Brazil, we want to look for something with some size and capabilities to bring -- that had size capabilities, as well as strong brands.","Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein","Great. Thank you very much. I will pass it on.","Kris Wenker","And Operator, we are out of time here. So, I think, I am going to have to apologies to anybody who\u2019s left in queue, if you\u2019ve got questions, please give me a call. Thanks very much for your time today.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines."],"9978":["General Mills (NYSE:GIS) F3Q14 Earnings Call March 19, 2014  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Kris Wenker - VP, Investor Relations","Don Mulligan - CFO","Ken Powell - Chairman and CEO","Ann Simonds - Senior VP and President, Baking Products Division","Analysts","Andrew Lazar - Barclays","David Palmer - RBC","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","David Driscoll - Citigroup","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America","Operator","Welcome to the third quarter F14 earnings conference call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Kris Wenker, senior vice president of investor relations. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am.","Kris Wenker","Thanks, operator. Good morning, everybody. I'm here with Ken Powell, our chairman and CEO; Don Mulligan, our CFO; and Ann Simonds, senior vice president and president of our baking products division. Before I turn the call over to them, I\u2019ll cover my usual housekeeping items.","Our press release on third quarter results was issued over the wire services earlier this morning. It's also posted on the website, if you need it. You can find slides on the website that supplement this morning\u2019s presentation. Our remarks will include forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions, and the second slide in today's presentation lists factors that could cause future results to be different than our current estimates.","With that, I'll turn you over to my colleagues, starting with Don.","Don Mulligan","Thanks, Kris. Good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us today. As we noted in our preliminary release last week, several factors restrained our third quarter operating performance. Severe winter weather resulted in weak sales trends across the food industry and our categories. Foreign exchange was a headwind.","We made significant incremental investments in our U.S. yogurt business in the quarter, including advertising, sampling, and in-store merchandising. Early response is encouraging, and Ken will share the details with you in a few moments.","And finally, our comparisons in this quarter were difficult, lapping double digit gains in adjusted segment operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS a year ago. Our third quarter results are summarized on slide five. As a reminder, we\u2019re now excluding Venezuela currency devaluation from total adjusted segment operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS. That affects last year\u2019s third and fourth quarters and will likely impact this year\u2019s fourth quarter.","In the third quarter, net sales totaled nearly $4.4 billion, 1% below last year. On a constant currency basis, net sales in the quarter matched year ago levels. Adjusted segment operating profit totaled $690 million, 10% below year ago results.","Net earnings grew 3% to $411 million, reflecting good control of administrative expenses and favorable mark-to-market effects. Diluted earnings per share were $0.64 as reported, up 7% from last year. Adjusted diluted EPS totaled $0.62, down from $0.66 a year ago.","Slide six shows the components of our third quarter net sales growth. As I mentioned, foreign exchange reduced net sales growth by 1 point. Pound volume was 1% below year ago levels and sales mix and net price realization added 1 point of sales growth.","Slide seven shows third quarter net sales results by segment. For U.S. retail, net sales declined 2% overall, with gains in our frozen foods, Small Planet foods, and Big G divisions offset by declines in our remaining divisions. Pound volume for U.S. retail was down 1%.","International segment sales grew 2% as reported, and 7% on a constant currency basis. Pound volume was down 1%. All four regions achieved constant currency net sales gains, with double-digit growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific.","Net sales of our convenience stores and food service segment were down 7% in the quarter. Pound volume declined 3% due in part to winter weather that closed schools, business cafeterias, restaurants, and hotels around the country. Price realization also was lower, reflecting lower index prices on certain product lines.","Slide eight shows the third quarter gross margin, excluding mark-to-market effects, declined 80 basis points. This was primarily due to unfavorable mix and higher promotional spending in U.S. retail, plus some weather-related disruption costs in our supply chain.","For the fourth quarter, we expect input inflation will be well below year ago levels, and that will help drive strong expansion in our underlying gross margin. Our full year estimate for input cost inflation continues to be 3%. That\u2019s despite the higher dairy inflation we\u2019re seeing.","Slide nine shows our third quarter profit growth by operating segment. Comparisons were tough across the board. U.S. retail profit declined 11%. Roughly two-thirds of the decline reflects the impact of dairy inflation and incremental merchandising and marketing investment in our U.S. yogurt business.","International profit increased 1%, excluding the Venezuela currency devaluation last year. On a constant currency basis, international profit grew at a mid-single digit rate.","Convenience stores and food service profit was down 17%, reflecting the weather-related sales declines.","Third quarter after-tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $23 million on a reported basis. On a constant currency basis, JV earnings grew at a double digit rate, fueled by net sales growth of 1% for CPW and 13% for Haagen Dazs Japan.","Slide 11 summarizes other key income statement items for the third quarter. Interest expense was 1% below last year. We continue to expect full year interest expense will be slightly below last year.","The effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.8%, as reported. Excluding the items affecting comparability, the tax rate was 33.6%, compared to 30.5% a year ago. For the full year, we still expect our underlying tax rate to be roughly comparable to last year\u2019s.","Finally, average diluted shares outstanding for the quarter were 4% below last year\u2019s level.","Turning to the balance sheet, slide 12 shows the components of core working capital. In the third quarter, our core working capital declined 8% versus a year ago, driven by an increase in our accounts payable balance, and we continue to see positive results from our inventory reduction efforts.","Slide 13 summarizes our financial performance through nine months. Net sales grew 2% to $13.6 billion, including 2 points of growth from new businesses. Of our reported net sales growth of 2%, pound volume contributed 2 points, net price realization and mix added 1 point, and foreign exchange reduced sales growth by 1 point.","Adjusted segment operating profit was over $2.4 billion, 3% below last year. Net earnings attributable to General Mills totaled over $1.4 billion, and diluted earnings per share were $2.18. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were down 1% to $2.15.","The next three slides provide more detail on our nine-month results by segment, starting with U.S. retail. In total, net sales for U.S. retail were flat in the first nine months. This includes sales gains of 8% in Small Planet foods, 5% in snacks, and 2% in Big G cereal. Year to date segment operating profit is down 3%.","Sales for our convenience stores and food service segment are down 3% through the first nine months, with segment operating profit 7% below last year.","Constant currency international sales are up 11% year to date, led by Latin America, where constant currency sales are up 50%. That includes 3 incremental months of Yoki in the first quarter, but even without that incremental boost, sales would be up double digits.","In the Asia Pacific region, sales increased 10%, led by double-digit growth in China. Sales for the Canada region are up 8%, including incremental contributions from Yoplait in the first quarter. And constant currency sales in Europe declined 1%, reflecting the difficult operating environment there.","International segment operating profit is up 8% on a reported basis. Excluding all currency effects, international profit grew at a high single-digit rate in the first nine months of the year.","Let\u2019s turn to cash flow results. On slide 17, you can see that cash flow from operations in the first nine months exceeded $1.7 billion. This was down from last year, due largely to changes in trade promotion and tax accruals, and the timing of payments to vendors.","We anticipate fourth quarter operating cash flow will be up significantly over the last year, driven by strong net earnings growth, normalized working capital trends, and no pension contribution. We anticipate that full year operating cash flow will meet or exceed last year\u2019s strong results.","We\u2019re leveraging our robust cash flow to increase our cash returns to shareholders this year. We\u2019ve purchased 29 million shares thus far this year, and for the full year, we expect our average diluted shares outstanding will be roughly 3% below last year\u2019s levels.","Last week, we announced a dividend increase of 8%, payable on May 1, which will result in a 17% increase in dividends per share for the full fiscal year.","Our outlook for fiscal 2014 is summarized on slide 19. In the fourth quarter, we expect input cost inflation will be below last year\u2019s levels, which, combined with continued HMM delivery, should result in significant gross margin expansion.","Our underlying tax rate and diluted shares outstanding will both be significantly lower than last year. As a result, we expect to deliver robust double-digit growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter.","For the full year, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.87 to $2.90.","I\u2019ll now pass the microphone to Ann Simonds. Ann has managed our baking products division to strong results over the last two years, including good retail sales growth in the latest quarter. Baking products is a key product platform for General Mills in the U.S., and her division has been a leader in developing successful digital marketing capabilities within our U.S. retail business.","But I\u2019ll let Ann tell you all about that. Ann?","Ann Simonds","Thank you, Don, and good morning to everyone. It\u2019s a pleasure to be on the call today to give you an update on our baking products business and how we\u2019re growing this portfolio of iconic brands.","Internally, we call our baking products division Mill City, which is a tribute to the Minneapolis milling heritage of General Mills and Pillsbury. This division generates $2.5 billion in annual retail sales, making us the largest branded baking business in the U.S., with nearly a 50% share of our baking products categories, combined.","Refrigerated baked goods generate over half of our sales, and Pillsbury is the leading brand in this $2 billion category. We\u2019re also home to the Immaculate Baking brand, which includes organic, gluten-free, and Non-GMO Project-verified dough products.","Betty Crocker is the leading brand in the $1.8 billion dessert mix category. Combined with the Bisquick brand, baking mixes generate more than a third of our division sales. Gold Medal flour, General Mills\u2019 oldest consumer brand, rounds out our sales.","With all of our baking products in one division, we\u2019re leveraging our extensive baking knowledge and driving efficiencies across R&D, manufacturing, and marketing. These efficiencies, along with our market-leading positions, put our division\u2019s profitability well above the company average.","We like the growth prospects we see for our business. Dessert mixes and refrigerated dough enjoy high household penetration rates, and people shop these categories nearly every month, because baking is on trend.","That\u2019s particularly true with growing consumer groups in the U.S. Millennials are a great demographic for us. As Ken described last month at the CAGNY conference, this is the generation that is starting families. They like to cook and bake. They\u2019re willing to try new things, and they\u2019re also developing an interest in scratch baking. But keep in mind, for many of them, their definition of scratch includes the use of baking mixes to spark their creativity.","Boomer households are downsizing, but they still like baked goods. They\u2019re looking for smaller package sizes. We\u2019ve introduced a variety of small pouch baking mixes and five-count packages of fresh dough to appeal to these consumers.","The growing Hispanic population represents a great opportunity for our products. Hispanic moms like to bake for their families, and it\u2019s a tradition to have bread with the evening meal, but refrigerated dough is not familiar to them, so in our advertising and packaging, we\u2019re showing them how to use Pillsbury dough, particularly biscuits, to complement a meal. We\u2019re seeing increased household penetration for refrigerated baked goods among these consumers.","In the third quarter, retail sales for our business grew 4% overall. Competitive price promotion led to a decline in retail sales for our dessert mixes, but retail sales for our refrigerated baked goods grew 6% and sales for Gold Medal flour were up 15% as we sharpened our price points on this leading brand.","For the year to date, our market share of refrigerated dough was 70% and growing. This performance is led by sweet rolls and biscuits. We\u2019re showing consumers creative new ways to use our biscuit dough, from crusts for single-serve pizzas to pockets for sloppy Joes.","And we\u2019re bringing new product innovation to our category. We launched Hershey\u2019s baking mixes and frostings earlier this year, giving consumers an affordably priced line of premium products.","We\u2019re working to bring news for our baking category year round, not just during the winter holiday season. For example, our Pillsbury Place and Bake cookies in Easter shapes are in stores right now. Seasonal products like these contribute to good year-round sales growth, and they\u2019re highly incremental to our regular business.","According to the NPD Group, 30% of households are trying to limit gluten in their diets. Formulating great-tasting gluten-free baked goods is a challenge, but we\u2019re doing it. We launched our first Betty Crocker gluten-free dessert mixes back in 2010. In 2011, we introduced a gluten-free version of Bisquick baking mix, and this year we added sugar cookies and rice flour to the Betty Crocker line, contributing to 23% retail sales growth for our gluten-free mixes so far this year.","We also introduced our first gluten-free fresh dough products this year. More than 60% of the sales are incremental to the refrigerated dough category, so watch for more varieties to come.","As Ken noted at CAGNY, we support our business with strong levels of advertising. Over the past five years, General Mills U.S. media investment has grown at an 8% compound rate. While we\u2019re the fourth largest U.S. food and beverage company, based on Nielsen measured sales, we\u2019re the second largest food and beverage advertiser.","Since 2008, our U.S. media spending has grown nearly 50%, and the mix has changed. TV advertising is still the largest part of our advertising budget, but we\u2019ve significantly increased our use of digital media.","Digital media and communication technologies align particularly well on baking businesses. That\u2019s because our consumers have always had an interest in recipes, cookbooks, and sharing food ideas. So the Mill City division pioneered an initiative inside General Mills to look at the future of marketing and build our capabilities to reach consumers in an increasing networked world. While TV is still a significant part of our budget too, our use of digital media is growing at a strong double digit rate, and it now represents more than a third of our total media spending.","Let me give you some examples. We know consumers are putting their grocery lists on their smartphones. They\u2019re looking online for recipes, and they\u2019re watching cooking videos on YouTube. The goal of our digital initiatives is to be on the right mobile device, at the right time, with the right message, and we have some well-known equities to leverage.","For example, Betty Crocker\u2019s Big Red Cookbook is one of the best-selling cookbooks of all time. Today, this cookbook is a platform to connect with consumers. It can be loaded as an app onto smartphones and tablets. We also include baking tips and shopping lists that are right there with you when you\u2019re in the grocery store.","BettyCrocker.com is one of the top 10 most frequently visited websites in the U.S. We\u2019re working to increase that frequency by providing changing and compelling content. We also customize the experience for consumers. If you sign up as a member of BettyCrocker.com, you\u2019ll receive recipes, entertaining ideas, and even coupons that are based on what you look at online and what you buy. I hope some of you will give it a try.","Through this membership feature, we\u2019ve developed a robust consumer database. That database helps us identify and act on consumer trends. For example, once we saw the increasing popularity of cronuts, a cross between a crescent and a donut, we were able to quickly develop a recipe for them using our crescent roll dough and send it out to our members.","Our digital media also helps us better target our marketing, which increases the likelihood our message gets seen and makes the most efficient use of our media spending. When we send an email to our members, we generally see an increase in traffic to our sites, and we see our recipes and product ideas expand to social media outlets such as Pinterest, giving us even broader exposure.","While BettyCrocker.com appeals to aspirational bakers, Pillsbury.com is all about quick and easy preparation. We know that site traffic spikes between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m., as people start to think about dinner, so we\u2019re giving consumers, from a time-crunched Millennial to a Hispanic consumer unfamiliar with refrigerated dough, new and simple ways to use our products to make an evening meal.","Starting in January, visitors to our Pillsbury site receive a weekly video on a new use for one of our dough products. This site gets 40 million visitors per year, and we expect that will continue to rise, as we add more video in addition to our daily content.","Our Pillsbury website also features recipes from the Pillsbury Bake-Off, which is another unique part of our marketing mix. This is the country\u2019s largest amateur baking contest, and one in four consumers has tried a Bake Off recipe. We continually update the contest to keep it contemporary. For example, in 2013, for the first time, consumers could vote to select the finalist.","The Bake Off is a great platform to showcase our products, and a great opportunity to partner with retailers to drive growth. We work with retailers to develop ads, in-store promotions, even customized web pages that feature contest finalists from the retailers\u2019 area and their recipes.","I\u2019ll wrap up my comments this morning with these three key points. Consumers are interested in baking, and our products are on trend with the needs of the growing consumer groups Boomers, Millennials, and Hispanic families.","We hold the leading brands in the $4 billion U.S. baking category, and we\u2019re supporting these brand with a unique marketing mix that includes increased use of digital assets.","We continue to innovate in our categories, providing great quality and value, and we\u2019re bringing news to the baking aisle and refrigerated case year round.","I appreciate your interest this morning, and with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Ken.","Ken Powell ","Thanks, Ann, and thanks to you and your great team for these very strong product and marketing initiatives, and good morning to one and all, all of you on the webcast. As you can see, our baking products business is a terrific platform for sales and profit growth in our U.S. retail segment.","Now, as Don mentioned earlier, our U.S. results for the third quarter reflect actions we\u2019ve taken on our yogurt business. Let me give you some details.","The U.S. yogurt category wasn\u2019t immune to the food industry slowdown this winter. After posting 9% retail sales growth through the first half of the fiscal year, retail sales for the yogurt category grew just 3% in our third quarter. Retail sales for our yogurt business in total declined in the quarter.","But during this period, we put our foot down on the gas pedal, with incremental investment in this business, and here\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. We launched 16 new product SKUs in January. That\u2019s twice the number we launched this time a year ago.","We increased our merchandising support. This included introductory trade funds to generate feature and display on all of those new products, and we matched competitive merchandise price points on Greek.","In January, we announced Yoplait Greek\u2019s taste superiority over the leading blueberry Greek yogurt, and we launched the Greek Taste-Off. As part of that announcement, we began a sampling program that will ultimately reach stores that account for nearly half of total retail volume. We supported this news with incremental TV advertising, and we opened a pop-up store in New York City, so consumers could judge for themselves the superior taste of Yoplait Greek.","We\u2019re already seeing benefits from these efforts. Since January, our turns on Greek varieties have increased, and we\u2019ve gained dollar share nearly every week versus last year, reaching more than 10% of the Greek segment in the most recent period.","In addition, original style Yoplait has returned to growth. Retail dollar sales are up on Yoplait original for virtually every week in the calendar year to date, on the strength of our family targeted snacking campaign, and distribution for this line is growing again too. We still have work to do on Yoplait Light, but turns for that line are now positive, and we\u2019ve been gaining share in this segment.","For the third quarter, the combination of weak category sales, our increased marketing and merchandising investments, and higher dairy input costs reduced sales and profitability for this business. Our reported net sales for Yoplait were down 8%, reflecting lower volume and the increased merchandising, but our sales trends in the marketplace are improving, and we\u2019ll keep our foot on the gas to fuel momentum in this business.","Let\u2019s turn to cereal, where our business is growing. Big G net sales were up 1% in the third quarter, and 2% fiscal year to date. We\u2019re gaining share in the category, up 0.3 of a point so far this year. We\u2019ve seen good performance from many of our established brands, like Lucky Charms and Cinnamon Toast Crunch, and our new products launched in January have received good early consumer response.","We believe that product news and innovation, combined with high levels of effective advertising, will bring consumers to the category, and so far this year that formula seems to be working for us. New products are contributing to strong growth on our grains snack business.","We launched Nature Valley Breakfast Biscuits and Fiber One Meal Replacement Bars in January. They\u2019re helping to drive 10% retail sales growth so far this year, and we\u2019ve gained a full 4 points of dollar share.","We\u2019re also seeing good growth on Totino\u2019s. Retail sail for pizza are up 5% so far this year, due to good merchandising execution and distribution gains. And retail sales for Totino\u2019s Pizza Rolls are up 6%, including new Bold Rolls, launched this past summer.","Turning to convenient meals, Progresso share of ready to serve soup is growing. We recently announced a partnership with the Mayo Clinic promoting our heart healthy soups. The convenience and great taste of Old El Paso Mexican foods are driving good growth for this brand.","Fiscal year to date, retail sales are up 4%, and we\u2019ve gained half a point of dollar share as we promote the fresh aspects of these dinner kits. And in the freezer case, Old El Paso entrees, launched last September, are on track to deliver $50 million in retail sales in their first year.","Finally, our natural and organic products continue to perform well. Cascadian Farm cereals are up 1% in natural and traditional grocery outlets combined, and our snack business is growing nicely, as we\u2019ve recently introduced new varieties of Food Should Taste Good chips and crackers, Uber bars, and Cascadian Farm protein granola bars.","For the U.S. retail segment in total, we expect category top line trends to improve gradually as the calendar year unfolds, and we expect to show a strong profit increase in the fourth quarter.","Turning to our convenience stores and food service business, Don outlined the drivers of our overall sales and profit decline. However, we\u2019re seeing growth in several of our key product platforms. Net sales for our snack items is up 4% fiscal year to date on good performance in convenience stores. Net sales for yogurt increased 10%, due in part to continued good performance on Yoplait Parfait Pro. And net sales for our frozen breakfast products are up 23% so far this year.","Our international businesses continue to post solid results. Through the first nine months, net sales and segment operating profit are both up 8%, with good growth in both developed and emerging markets. On a constant currency basis, excluding both foreign exchange and last year\u2019s Venezuelan currency devaluation, net sales are up 11% fiscal year to date and operating profit has increased at a high single digit rate.","In Europe, our constant currency net sales are down 1% year to date. We have some good new product introductions just entering this region. We\u2019re introducing Old El Paso stand and stuff tacos in France and the U.K., and new Haagen Dazs Triple Sensations ice cream treats are launching in the U.K. this spring.","In Canada, our grain snacks are performing well, and our Liberte and Yoplait product line continue to drive growth of the Greek segment, with a combined 35% share.","Constant currency net sales in China are up 13% so far this year, fueled by Haagen Dazs ice cream and Wanchai Ferry frozen foods.","And we\u2019re having a good year in Latin America. In Brazil, we\u2019re now launching a line of baking mixes cobranded with Yoki and Betty Crocker. We think these sweet snacks will be another good platform for us in this growing market.","And one quick word on Cereal Partners Worldwide. Constant currency net sales for CPW are up 1% so far this year. We\u2019re seeing growth on many core brands, including Lion in Europe, Chocapic in Asia, and Shreddies in the U.K., and CPW recently launched a variety of new products in Europe, Asia, and Australia.","So our international businesses continue to post good performance in developed and emerging markets. So with that, let me summarize today\u2019s General Mills update. It was a tough third quarter, reflecting some clear external headwinds along with our actions to increase marketing and merchandising investments in U.S. yogurt.","We expect strong earnings growth in the fourth quarter, and the drivers of that growth are relatively straightforward. We see lower input cost inflation, a lower tax rate, and a lower average share count in the period.","For 2014 in total, our guidance for adjusted diluted earnings per share is a range of $2.87 to $2.90. We\u2019re getting there differently than we planned. Top line trends in developed markets have been softer than anticipated, but we\u2019ve offset that with good administrative cost control, lower interest expense, and increased share repurchase. And we\u2019re delivering the robust cash returns to shareholders that we outlined for fiscal 2014, with a dividend increase of 17% and strong share repurchase activity.","So I\u2019ll leave it there, and we\u2019ll now open the call to your questions. Operator, would you please get us going?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar from Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays ","First, Ken, of the three main drivers you mentioned around lower yogurt profitability in the quarter: increased dairy costs, trade promotion for the new products, and some price matching in Greek, and then on the consumer spend, I was hoping you could dimensionalize them for us a bit. Was one much larger an impact than the others, or were they all about equal?","Ken Powell ","It was basically a third, a third, a third. Don, do you want to put a finer point on that? No, he doesn\u2019t. So significant dairy inflation. We did get those merchandising price points in line, and there has been a good increase in consumer spending, and that spending is all about taste, Andrew. It\u2019s very taste-oriented advertising, and it\u2019s a lot of sampling. We want to get these products in people\u2019s mouths, because we know that they perform very, very well, and people like them. So think a third, a third, a third.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays ","And on its conference call last week, Post mentioned that it expects the ready to eat cereal category growth will return to a single digit rate of growth in 2015. And they\u2019re basing that on a lot of the actions taken by the two leaders in the category to bring consumers back in. And they also thought that many of the more recent demand shocks in the category are sort of nearer to the end than the beginning. And most of their comments are really based on what you and others do, as opposed to them, but I guess I just wanted to get some thoughts on if you share that level of optimism about \u201915 for cereal, or maybe their comments are a bit premature at this stage.","Ken Powell ","We certainly share their optimism on the outlook for the cereal category, which is a great category in response to innovation. And I would also share the view that, for instance, as you look at the growth of Greek yogurt as an example, I think that is still growing, but that growth is starting to taper. And to the degree there\u2019s been some interaction there, that also is potentially something to monitor closely. I would love to see it return to growth in 2015.","As we\u2019ve said, we think that the recipe is all about core brand renovation and good new products, and good levels of advertising. And we\u2019re very focused on doing that. And we\u2019re hearing good messaging from the other leaders in the category that they\u2019re focused on that as well, so we think, as those things continue to increase, and we continue to see the level of renovation strengthened in the category, consumers are going to come back in. We\u2019re very confident that that will happen, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re focused on those kinds of activities.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC.","David Palmer - RBC","You mentioned the weather drag in the quarter. Specifically in the last couple of months, just looking at the scanner data, it looks like some of the home meal oriented categories improved, presumably because people were eating more at home. Could you just talk about what you\u2019re seeing with the weather and exactly what you meant by that?","Ken Powell ","I'd be happy to David. I have to say, I didn't \u2013 could you just repeat the \u2013 you were \u2013 it wasn't exactly clear. You said your data shows what?","David Palmer - RBC","There were a lot of the home meal oriented categories. It looked like they improved in the last couple of scanner period, considerably because people were eating more at home and as you know restaurants were suffering over those same two months, and so it seems logical that people were eating more at home, so, just wondering what you are seeing in terms of a net impact to your business.","Ken Powell","First of all, our categories, over the three months of the quarter, actually declined sequentially, and basically February for us, the categories were flat. So we were seeing softening of retail purchases as well. Now, as we\u2019ve gone into the most recent periods, which I think is the data that you\u2019ve referenced you saw, we are seeing those categories start to recover, although, I have to say, from a pretty low basis. But as the weather improves, we are seeing those categories recover.","Just in terms of the nature of the weather impact, basically, on our side, it really just disrupted plant operations and logistics. So we lost 62 days of production, which would be 3% or 4%, which hasn\u2019t happened in a long time to us, think decades. And that would be the result of people not being able to get into work safely, or not having inputs arrive. And so there was that impact. There\u2019s an even greater logistics impact, as trucks couldn\u2019t move, and the rail system becomes less efficient.","And those things combined, basically, as Don said, those combine to add cost to the quarter. And then on the retail side, we\u2019ll let the retailers give you all the detail there, but I think basically it\u2019s just fewer trips for all the obvious reasons. Fewer trips to restaurants, and then of course in schools and universities, which were closed, they\u2019re just serving fewer meals in cafeterias, and those sales are clearly lost.","So it\u2019s a combination of logistics and plant factors that added the cost, and consumers staying at home and probably drawing down a bit from their own pantries, which slowed down the industry.","Does that give you a bit of texture?","David Palmer - RBC ","That is helpful. And I guess just one separate last question here, just on the M&A front, I haven\u2019t heard you talk about acquisitions lately. Wondering is that something that you\u2019re still continuing to look for deals from that angle, or are you looking more international still with regard to acquisitions?","Don Mulligan ","We are still looking to see how we can continue to refine and evolve our portfolio, and our focus areas haven\u2019t changed. Emerging markets, obviously our move into Brazil was very instrumental in that respect about a year and a half ago. So we continue to look at it. As we\u2019ve said before, we\u2019re interested in expanding our businesses and getting a larger footprint, particularly in Indonesia and India.","And then within the developed markets, particularly in the U.S., the area of the better for you snacking, we\u2019ve made some moves over the last couple of years in that regard. It remains a point of interest. But as we said a year ago, F14 was not going to be a year of acquisitions, and that\u2019s how it\u2019s playing out. But we\u2019ll continue to look, and share news as it becomes relevant.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley","Ken, you mentioned an expectation that U.S. food industry volumes should improve going forward. How much of that is just related to some of the extraordinary factors like weather that impacted Q3 and how much is an expectation of a tangible improvement in consumption? And just with respect to the inflation outlook, in a number of commodities, not necessarily grains, but a number of commodities moving higher, what\u2019s the risk that more selective price increases across the industry could limit the likelihood of that volume improvement playing out?","Ken Powell ","In terms of the development of our categories, I think it\u2019s going to be both the points that you mentioned. In the short term, we\u2019re coming off of a very severe winter, and we\u2019re already seeing our categories strengthen a little bit as we get through that. And as we\u2019ve said in the past, while the economy is improving slowly and incomes are strengthening slowly, they are improving. And we think that as incomes continue to grow and consumers gain confidence, that will be a positive sign for our category.","The one other near term headwind I think are the SNAP reductions that took place over the course of last year, and I think will continue to impact us a little bit this year. That was clearly adding some purchasing power to consumers when it comes to food. So that would be a bit of a headwind. But in general, we see the economy strengthening, and that will support our categories.","In terms of inflation, it\u2019s always a mixed bag. Some things are up and some are down. For us, grains have moderated significantly. As everyone knows, dairy costs have been significantly higher. On balance, though, as we\u2019ve said the last couple of times, we see the inflation environment manageable at this point. We\u2019ll be able to offset the inflation that we see with our productivity efforts, and we would expect pricing to remain relatively stable in the near term.","Don Mulligan ","The only thing I would add is the recent jump in some certain commodities and some of the headline news that has made, as we\u2019ve talked about before, as we look forward for inflation, we assume that we\u2019ll see the same kind of inflation we\u2019ve seen over the last six or eight years, which is in that 4% and 5% range. And I don\u2019t think anyone is projecting something different than that as we go forward. From our standpoint, I think we\u2019ve shown the ability to offset that through productivity and mix management and our [HMM] activities.","Ken Powell ","And just to add one final thought, triggered by Don\u2019s comment, the whole oats controversy. In fact, we had a great harvest in the northern of oat growing regions this year. We just couldn\u2019t get it to market because of the logistics disruptions that I mentioned over the winter. So that\u2019s a short term spike in oat costs, and those should moderate going forward.","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley ","I have to admit, I think I need to get up to speed on the oat controversy. [laughter]  ","Ken Powell ","I think it\u2019s already passed you by.","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley ","All right. Well, no need, then. Just one follow up on Yoplait. I appreciate that the share trends at retail are improving, but based on the step down that we\u2019re seeing in implied third quarter shipments, even though there\u2019s new products coming out, it looks like you\u2019re working down an imbalance in new products and inventories that\u2019s been going on for the past two quarters, where do inventories stand now? And are we sort of at the point where we should expect to see shipments align a bit better with consumption going forward?","Ken Powell ","Well, consumption was ahead of shipments in the quarter, and eventually those things always come into line, especially for a short shelf product like yogurt. But what we have been seeing really over several months, really since December, for Yoplait in total, we\u2019re seeing our distribution expand, which is a very good sign.","As I said, we\u2019re seeing Yoplait Original now growing on an absolute basis. It\u2019s very significant to us that Yoplait Light turns are now positive, because positive turns are, if you will, the precondition for being able to expand distribution. And if we\u2019re able to maintain that turn strength, ultimately we\u2019ll get that franchise going on an absolute basis as well.","And as I said, we\u2019re very pleased with the early trends that we\u2019re seeing across all of our Yoplait Greek products, which include Yoplait Greek 100 and now Greek Blended, and lots of flavors, formats, multipacks. And so as you say, there\u2019s still more to do, but we feel we\u2019re quite a bit ahead today where we were six months ago, and we like the direction the business is going in.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Thilo Wrede from Jefferies.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies ","At CAGNY, you made a comment that you see growth out there in the packaged food industry, but you have to work harder to get that growth. Are these measures that you\u2019ve taken on Yoplait Greek an example for how you\u2019ve worked harder? And if so, does that mean that you might expand these measures to categories like cereal and what would that mean for margins going forward?","Ken Powell ","Well, for yogurt, we\u2019ve reached a point where we have the right product portfolio. As I just mentioned, it\u2019s a very broad and consumer focused portfolio, and the products are very high quality. And we have the distribution that we needed, and critically, we have the manufacturing capacity that we need. And so it\u2019s the perfect time for us to really go out and drive trial on these products through, as I mentioned, strong advertising and sampling. So it\u2019s a good time to really focus and build that business.","In cereal, we are going to work harder there. We already have high levels of trial generating advertising and consumer focus support in the cereal business. There, our focus is on the renovation of brands, often by bringing important health news to them. And we see that work well for us. We\u2019ve commented, for instance, on the success of gluten-free brands or taste improvements, or new products. And so it\u2019s very much an innovation focus in categories like cereal.","I think the way it plays out will vary by category, but we just think, in a time where the consumer is a little bit stretched, we just believe that the way forward is through innovation and renovation and strong communication of our benefits. And when we get that right, we see it work across all of our categories. And that\u2019s really the focus for us.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies ","And what does it mean in terms of margin pressure for the next 12 months?","Ken Powell ","As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re expecting manageable levels of inflation. I think as you all know, we have very disciplined productivity programs. And so I\u2019m not going to comment today on what our margins will look like over the next 12 months, but I will say, among our peers, we\u2019ve been among the very best over the last five years of maintaining or expanding margins because of our productivity discipline. And certainly we\u2019ll keep that mindset going forward.","Don Mulligan ","What I would add to that is there are some product lines we launched that are margin accretive on a dollar basis, but maybe margin dilutive on a percentage basis. Greek yogurt is a good example of that, where from a per-serving basis, we actually make a bit more penny profit on Greek, but because of the higher price point, it\u2019s actually slightly margin dilutive on the gross margin line, but it\u2019s obviously dollar accretive.","So those tradeoffs that we\u2019re willing to make, we also then look at our operating margins, and there\u2019s a couple of factors that can come into play there. One is we obviously have very strong control on our admin expenses. If you look at our SG&A for the year, it\u2019s flat year to date. And I expect it to be flat or even slightly down on a full year basis, so that is part of managing those margins as well. The other, and Ann touched on this, is that in our digital marketing, as we go to market digitally, we see strong returns there, and that helps manage our margins as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse ","Just a question on yogurt in China. Can you talk about the investment that you\u2019re making there, maybe quantify it and then talk about that business in terms of how big you think it can be in year one?","Don Mulligan ","We\u2019re not going to quantify how much we\u2019re putting into the market, but we are making a substantial move to tap into what we think is a very attractive yoga market, one that already is relatively large, but we think there\u2019s an opportunity for Yoplait to have a leading role. I think that\u2019s all we\u2019re ready to share at this point in time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll from Citigroup.","David Driscoll - Citigroup ","Just wanted to touch on the fact that the full year EPS guidance would imply something like 40% of fourth quarter growth, and it seems a lot of that will come from margin expansion. And I think that signals that it\u2019s transitioning into a more favorable cost environment as you indicated in the press release. How should we think about this going forward? As the rest of calendar \u201814 plays out, should we expect to see similar favorability in the types of costs that you\u2019re experiencing on a year over year basis?","Don Mulligan ","Let me just take you through Q4. We touched on some points that I just want to make sure are clear. Because essentially all of our EPS growth is in the fourth quarter, so I think it\u2019s important for investors to understand how we get there. And they are, I think, very visible.","Again, the primary ones would be the gross margin expansion. To your point, we expect a deceleration of inflation - we still expect inflation, but decelerating - in the fourth quarter, which is very different than a year ago, when we were seeing accelerating inflation. So we\u2019ll have pretty significant margin expansion, and obviously our HMM activities will continue to be very robust.","For the full year, we expect our tax rate to be comparable to last year. And if you look over the last several years, we have consistently held or dropped our tax rate on an annual basis, but quarter to quarter, it can vary quite significantly. And last year\u2019s fourth quarter was actually a higher tax rate quarter. So we\u2019ll have favorability in our tax line.","And then I mentioned the share count. We have been accumulating shares as the year has gone on. One percent reduction in Q1, 2% in Q2, 4% reduction in Q3. So you can kind of expand from there what Q4 could be.","So those factors will come through, but importantly, we\u2019re not banking on accelerated sales growth. Frankly, we expect our sales growth to be about the same as it has been year to date. So it\u2019s really based on those middle of the P&L factors that will get us that substantial EPS gain in the fourth quarter and have us deliver the full year in the same range as we talked about back in July.","As far as what it means going forward, obviously we\u2019re not in a position today to give F15 guidance for inflation or any portion of our financials, but I guess I would just caution, based on the question that Matt asked earlier, inflation is a tough thing to project. Everyone was asking us if we were going to see deflation a few months ago, and now there\u2019s been a turn in some markets and people are asking us if we\u2019re going to see accelerating inflation next year.","So I just would caution not to get ahead of ourselves in terms of what our inflation expectations are. But we will be very clear what they are when we release our results in the fourth quarter, when we give \u201915 guidance in June.","David Driscoll - Citigroup ","Moving on to yogurt, obviously you were negatively impacted by some inflation in dairy. Should we be expecting any price increases in yogurt from you in the near future? And what have you seen in terms of your competitors in the market in terms of pricing?","Ken Powell ","We never talk about possible or prospective pricing increases. I will comment that we have seen, as you all know, dairy inflation over the last year, primarily driven by increased demand for dry powdered milk, primarily in Asia and particularly in China. And that demand really is driving the market. And I think the herds shrank a little bit earlier in the economic crisis. But those things have a way of adjusting, and we\u2019re not seeing it yet, but the prices are unusually high now, and we expect that they\u2019ll moderate over time.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with BMO Capital Markets.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets","A couple of follow ups to some of those questions. One is, when you think about next year, are you using your base earnings of $2.87 to $2.90, or are you using the number including Venezuela when you think about the growth rate?","Don Mulligan ","We\u2019re going to use $2.87 to $2.90. Part of the reason to take out Venezuela is the remeasurement impact of Venezuela, it\u2019s a one-time noncash event that we don\u2019t think is representative of our underlying earnings profile.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets ","It\u2019s been four years you\u2019ve been a little bit below your long term growth algorithm, do you see material headwinds derail you for another year or two? Or do you think things are actually becoming a little bit more normalized, if that\u2019s a good way to use the word?","Ken Powell","I would say that things are slowly improving, and our comment at CAGNY was that for next year, we\u2019re affirming our growth model. But you know, we continue to see slow improvement, with an emphasis on slow. And I think we\u2019ve been saying that consistently, and our predictions have been accurate over the last several years.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets ","And then on the Yoplait side of it, do you think that the competitive environment has structurally compressed the margins for that business? Or do you think it will be able to return to the margins of the last couple of years once you get through this period of time of getting your market share where you want it to be? Can you talk about that?","Ken Powell ","I think the inflation that we\u2019ve commented on, that\u2019s the critical factor that\u2019s compressed the margins. And there\u2019s always volatility in those input costs. But that\u2019s been the key issue. Obviously, our mix has changed, and it is changing quite significantly as the category migrates to Greek. But as Don said, we like the price point of Greek yogurts. They\u2019re $1 or more, so we like that a lot. On a percentage basis, the margins are a bit lower, but certainly overall, on an absolute basis, we think those margins are just fine. So I think the key thing will be to work our way through this inflation, which we will eventually do, and we\u2019ll see margins strengthen as we do that.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets ","And my last question, for Don, is you\u2019ve mentioned that you\u2019re obviously doing a lot of work on your working capital, but this quarter, your working capital actually cost you cash, but you said it was going to normalize in the fourth quarter. Can you just explain that? I just didn\u2019t understand it.","Don Mulligan ","I\u2019d break out the working capital into two components. The core working capital that I highlighted on the slides, the bulk of it, and that was down 8%, and that will be down for the full year as it has been for the last three to four years. So that will be a cash contributor. You also have accruals and payment timings for our trade, for our tax, for our advertising. Those were negative this quarter. Those will normalize as the year unfolds. So you\u2019ll see pretty strong cash inflow from working capital in our fourth quarter. And for the full year, we still expect working capital in total to be a cash contributor for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason English from Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs ","First, you\u2019re abstaining from giving us an outlook for next year right now. You have in the past, around this time, felt comfortable giving us at least a bit of a glimpse into the fall. So my question, is why not now? What\u2019s preventing you from giving us that outlook?","Don Mulligan ","We don\u2019t historically give guidance until June. We did it on a one-off basis last year because we were coming through a period of pretty significant change in terms of the portfolio, a couple of large deals. We also had some operating headwinds that meant we were off model from a bottom line earnings and a cash return to shareholders standpoint.","And the last piece was very strategically, we decided, because we had some strategic M&A that we wanted to do. So last year we made a point of noting that we\u2019d be back on model both from earnings and a cash return standpoint in FY14, but that was a one-time view to the future that we thought was important for the market. But historically, in every other year, we have given guidance in June, and that\u2019s what our practice will be this year as well.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs ","On cereal, net sales look pretty strong for you so far this year. I think you said up around 1 or 2, around 2 for year to date, around 1 this quarter. Clearly, consumption is not tracking there. So my question is, on inventory, are you just coming off a very low base, and this is just sort of rebuild to normalized levels, or is there risk that we get a [deload] at some point in the future.","Ken Powell ","Some of it is shipments of new products. We launched three more in January, and those always expand inventory. As you\u2019ve observed, we also have had good share gains, about 30 basis points over the nine months of the year so far, and really over 40 basis points of share improvement in Q3. But you\u2019re right, our shipments are a little bit ahead of sales right now, and I would expect those to come in line over time.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs ","Yoplait, congratulations on some of the early read success on the Greek side, and it\u2019s encouraging to hear about some of the turns on Light. When we look at your aggregate yogurt portfolio, the turn rate has been decelerating since something around down 10% and down 6% the prior 12 weeks, and down 3% the 12 weeks before then. In light of some of the strength you\u2019re seeing, I guess where is the big offset that\u2019s causing velocity to decline so rapidly?","Ken Powell ","There were two areas that have been declining over the last period of time. Light, which continues to decline, although at a rate less than the Light segment, that one continues to decline overall, and largely because of distribution [unintelligible]. But as I said, where it is in distribution, we\u2019ve seen the turns reverse now. Those are growing now, which again sets up a case for us to hold and then expand distribution.","We also had an uncharacteristic decline in our kid business over the last couple of quarters, and that\u2019s been a good grower for us, all the way through. And we attribute that to our own variability in execution. We don\u2019t feel we had the right kind of kid-oriented promotions on Gogurt. And that\u2019s easily correctable.","So those are the two soft spots, and we think those are both reversible, and we like the trends on Yoplait original and Greek, as we said.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America ","Don, as you went through the fourth quarter drivers, really helpful. If I\u2019m looking at it correctly, it looks like, for the full year, it gets you to the low end of a mid-single digit operating profit growth. Am I looking at that correctly?","Don Mulligan","Operating profit growth, we ended the year with guidance of mid-single digit. Given what we\u2019re coming off of in the third quarter, I think we\u2019ll probably be a touch below that for the full year.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America ","And then just in terms of this year getting to the earnings growth in a way that was a little bit different than what you were projecting at the start of the year, looking forward, as we start to try to model going forward, and just assuming that we\u2019re in the algorithm for next year, does it put more burden on operating profit growth, because now we\u2019re comping against really good cost control in SG&A, we\u2019re comping against a lower share count, we\u2019re comping against the tax rate being flat? I\u2019m just trying to get a better understanding of, just to get back on the algorithm, do some of the other line items in the P&L get more burdened next year in terms of trying to get there?","Don Mulligan ","I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d say more burdened. It certainly depends on us getting back on model on the operating side, sales and SOP growth. We\u2019re getting to the bottom line number this year, but we\u2019re not getting to it in the way we intended at the beginning of the year. Next year, we intend to build a plan that gets us there starting from the top line and working through SOP all the way down to EPS.","Kris Wenker","All right, I think we\u2019re over time everybody, so if there\u2019s someone left in queue, apologies. Give us a call and we\u2019ll try and help you out."],"9983":["General Mills, Inc.

Welcome to the fiscal 2015 fourth quarter earnings conference call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, July 1, 2015.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Jeff Siemon, Finance Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jeff Siemon","Thanks, Tina and good morning, everyone. I am here with Ken Powell, our Chairman and CEO, Don Mulligan, our CFO. Kris Wenker is here too but she has put herself in listen-only mode. I will turn the microphone over to Ken and Don in just a minute, but first let me cover our usual housekeeping items.","Our press release was issued over the wire services earlier this morning. It's also posted on our website if you need a copy. And you can find our slides on our website that supplement our remarks this morning.","These remarks will include forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions. The second slide in today's presentation lists factors that could cause our future results to be different than our current estimates.","With that, let me turn the call over to Don.","Don Mulligan","Thanks, Jeff. Welcome to your first earnings call. And hello everyone. Thank you for joining us today.","Before I get into the numbers, let me just take a moment to recognize Kris Wenker's tremendous 35 years with General Mills and her terrific, differential leadership of our Investor Relations efforts. She will be missed, both inside this building and I know by many of you on the phone after today. We wish her all the best.","As noted in our press release today, due to the business in hand, General Mills' operating performance in fiscal 2015 was mixed. Our convenience stores and foodservice segment had an excellent year with segment operating profit increasing 15% to reach a record high of $353 million. And our international segment posted good margin expansion and profit growth in constant currency. But sales and profit declined for U.S. retail, our largest operating segment.","Our business performance strengthened in the second half of the year as our Consumer First efforts gained traction and we took important strategic actions during 2015, including the acquisition of Annie's and the initiation of several projects designed to increase our speed and agility while reducing costs. These actions have positioned us to deliver stronger growth in 2016 and beyond.","Our fourth quarter results are summarized on slide five. Remember that this quarter included extra week which contributed approximately six points of net sales growth and $0.04 of earnings per share. Net sales of $4.3 billion essentially matched the year ago results. On a constant currency basis, net sales increased 6%. Segment operating profit totaled $800 million, an increase of 9% as reported and 13% in constant currency. Net earnings and diluted earnings per share were both down on a reported basis, primarily due to an impairment charge taken out of our Green Giant brand asset and a tax charge related to a one-time repatriation of foreign earnings. Adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes these and certain other items affecting comparability, increased 12% to $0.75 per share. Constant currency adjusted diluted EPS increased 18% in the quarter.","Our full year results are summarized on slide six. The 53rd week contributed approximately one point of net sales growth in fiscal 2015. Net sales declined 2% to $17.6 billion. On a constant currency basis, net sales increased 1%. Segment operating profit fell 4% to $3.0 billion. Constant currency segment operating profit was 2% below last year. Net earnings attributable to General Mills totaled more than $1.2 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.97. These results were below year ago levels including the charges related to restructuring projects, the brand asset impairment and the repatriation of foreign earnings. Adjusted diluted EPS of $2.86 was up 1% as reported and up 4% in constant currency.","Slide seven provides the components of our net sales growth. For the fourth quarter pound volume increased 3% from prior-year including Annie's in the 53rd week. Sales mix and net price realization also added three points of sales growth. And foreign exchange reduced sales growth by six points. For the full-year, pound volume declined 1%. Net price realization and mix added two points of sales growth and foreign exchange reduced sales growth by three points.","Our U.S. retail segment had a disappointing year, but as you can see on slide eight, trends did improve in the second half, most notably, for yogurt and cereal. Our U.S. retail brands gained share in categories representing 65% of measured sales volume, including gains in the cereal, yogurt and grain snacks categories. But overall sales trends in many categories were weak reflecting the impact of changing consumer food preferences.","For convenient stores and foodservice, fourth-quarter net sales increased 4%. Our six focus platforms, which include cereal, yogurt, snacks, frozen breakfast, mixes and biscuits continue to lead growth for this segment with sales up 8% in the quarter. For the full-year, segment net sales increased 4% to $2 billion, including 9% growth on our focused platforms.","Fourth-quarter net sales for our international business segment increased 9% on a constant currency basis, with gains across all four regions. For the full-year, international net sales totaled $5.1 billion, 5% below last year's reported, but 6% above last year in constant currency.","Slide 11 shows you constant currency net sales results by region. Full-year net sales in Latin America increased 17%, reflecting inflation driven pricing across many markets. In the Asia-Pacific region, constant currency net sales grew 5%, driven by growth of H\u00e4agen-Dazs in China and Betty Crocker products in the Middle East. Sales in the European region also increased 5% due in part to Strong innovation on Old El Paso Mexican products. In Canada, sales in 2015 essentially matched year ago levels in constant currency.","On slide 12, you can see that adjusted gross margin increased by 70 basis points in the fourth quarter. This was driven by positive net price realization. For 2015 in total, adjusted gross margin was down 70 basis points to 34.7%, reflecting the impact of volume deleverage. Our input cost inflation for the year totaled 2%.","Slide 13 details our segment operating profit results for fiscal 2015. Total segment operating profit declined 2% in constant currency driven by the fall in U.S. retail. On a constant currency basis, international's profit increased 9%. And as I mentioned earlier, profits in convenience stores and foodservice were up double-digits.","Slide 14 summarizes 2015 joint venture performance. On a constant currency basis, net sales for cereal partners worldwide declined 2% and H\u00e4agen-Dazs Japan sales grew 6%. After tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $84 million, a decline of 6% as reported, but in line with year ago results in constant currency.","Slide $15 highlights some additional items from our 2015 income statement. At the end of the fourth quarter, we made a strategic decision to redirect certain resources supporting our Green Giant business in U.S. retail to other businesses in the segment. As a result, our future sales and profitability projections for this business declined, causing us to record a $260 million impairment charge related to our Green Giant brand intangible asset.","We recorded restructuring and project related charges of $357 million in fiscal 2015, including $73 million in cost of sales. Corporate unallocated expenses, excluding items affecting comparability, declined 7%. Annual interest expense increased $13 million driven by higher average debt levels. In the fourth quarter, we incurred a tax charge of $79 million related to the one-time repatriation of foreign earnings. We expect to pay $24 million in cash taxes. Lastly, the adjusted effective tax rate was 30.5% compared to 32.2% a year ago, reflecting changes in earnings mix by country and favorable discrete items.","Turning to the balance sheet. Slide 16 shows that core working capital declined 13% in fiscal 2015, due primarily through improvements in accounts receivable and accounts payable. This is the ninth consecutive quarter that we have reduced our core working capital versus the prior year. Cash flow from operations totaled more than $2.5 billion in fiscal 2015, essentially unchanged from the previous year. Fixed asset investments totaled $712 million, including investments related to Project Century.","We paid over $1 billion in dividends and repurchased 22 million shares for $1.2 billion. Since fiscal 2011, General Mills has returned $10 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Over that time, our dividends per share have grown at an 11% compound rate and we reduced average diluted shares outstanding by 2% per year. And we have accomplished this during the same period that we acquired three significant businesses in Yoplait International, Yoki and Annie's.","Slide 19 provides an update on the status of our cost savings initiatives. We delivered $75 million in savings in 2015 from Project Century, Project Catalyst and our policies and practices update. This reflects accelerated pace of savings compared to our original projections. In addition, last week we announced Project Compass, an initiative designed to streamline our international organization structure and save $25 million to $30 million in fiscal 2016 and $45 million to $50 million by 2017.","We anticipate incurring between $57 million and $62 million in restructuring charges associated with this project. In total, we now anticipate the combination of all our recent cost initiatives including Project Compass will deliver between $285 million and $310 million in savings in 2016 and more than $400 billion by 2017. We plan to reinvest a portion of these savings into growth driving initiatives including cereal renovation, capacity expansion for grain snacks and our launch of Yoplait in China.","Looking ahead to fiscal 2016, we expect to increase our operating cash flow above 2015 levels. The first call on cash is investment into the business to support growth and drive cost savings. On slide 20, you can see that we anticipate fixed asset investments will increase to approximately $840 million in 2016 driven by increased investment in Project Century.","Slide 21 provides a summary of our 2016 sales and earnings guidance. The 2016 growth rates reflect the impact of one less week. We are targeting net sales to be approximately flat in constant currency. Excluding the difference in weeks, we expect 2016 net sales to be up 1% in constant currency. We expect to deliver $400 million in cost of goods HMM. This should more than offset input cost inflation, which we estimate at 2% this year. Given HMM plus Century savings, adjusted gross margin is expected to improve from 2015 levels.","We expect our media investment to decline slightly. We project our total segment operating profit will grow at a low single-digit rate in constant currency. Our plan assumes a mid-single-digit decline in interest expense, reflecting a stable level of debt and lower average rate resulting from refinancing maturing higher coupon bonds. We are expecting our adjusted tax rate will be comparable to last year's 30.5%. We expect joint venture earnings to grow at a low single-digit rate in constant currency. And we plan to continue returning cash to shareholders through share buybacks.","For fiscal 2016, we are targeting a net reduction in average shares outstanding of approximately 1%. We expect mid-single-digit constant currency growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share. At current exchange rates, we would estimate a $0.04 headwind to full year adjusted diluted EPS growth in 2016. In terms of the quarterly cadence of EPS in 2016, we expect the first quarter to show the strongest growth as it compares to a weak prior-year period. The fourth-quarter will have the comparison with one less week, though we do expect base business growth in the final quarter. We have a broad slate of Consumer First renovation and innovation planned in each of our business segments for fiscal 2016.","For more on that, I will now turn the call over to Ken.","Ken Powell","All right. Well, good morning, everybody. Thanks, Don. So as we enter fiscal 2016, General Mills is keenly aware of our consumers' changing food preferences and the impact those changes are having on our industry. We remain deeply committed to following the consumer adapting to their evolving preferences and driving growth. And where we embraced Consumer First in fiscal 2015, we saw our business respond whether that's with protein cereals in U.S. retail, Yoplait Yogurt in U.S. retail and foodservice channels or Old El Paso dinner kits around the world. Our plan for 2016 is to expand our Consumer First efforts worldwide to generate sustainable topline growth.","So let me give you some highlights starting with U.S. retail. We have four clear priorities for U.S. retail in 2016. They are, first and foremost to grow our cereal business, second to accelerate our performance in better-for-you snacking, which includes both our yogurt and snacks operating units within U.S. retail, third to drive double-digit growth on our natural and organic portfolio by leveraging the combination of Annie's and our heritage natural and organic brands and finally to deliver Consumer First value on select brands in a way that generates positive returns for our business.","Let me give you a few details on these priorities, beginning with cereal. General Mills has been leading performance in the $10 billion U.S. cereal category. We gained 30 basis points of value share in fiscal 2015 and have grown our share in seven of the past eight years, gaining 1.6 share points during that time. But our share growth in 2015 did not translate into sales growth for us. So we have more work to do.","Consumer First renovation is at the heart of our plans to renew cereal growth. At CAGNY, we told you we are embarking on a broad investment plan designed to renovate our Big G portfolio for today's consumers and that gluten-free Cheerios was the first step in that plan. Later this summer, we will begin marketing five of our largest Cheerios varieties which make up nearly 90% of franchise sales as gluten-free. We have developed a technology that separates our oats which are naturally gluten-free from other gluten containing grains that find their way into the oat supply.","We know that 30% of U.S. consumers are interested in gluten-free foods and that a number of them have less the cereal aisle as a result. This news gives them five great reasons to come back. We will be taking another of our oat based cereals, Lucky Charms, gluten-free later this year. Between Cheerios, Lucky Charms and our Chex franchise, we are gluten-free news on product representing over half of our cereal sales and 17% of total category sales.","Last week, we unveiled the second step in our cereal renovation plan. We are removing artificial flavors and colors from artificial sources from all General Mills cereals. Nearly half of U.S. households are making an effort to avoid artificial flavors and colors and we are responding. 75% of our Big G portfolio will meet this claim by January with the remainder targeted by the end of calendar 2017.","In addition to Consumer First renovation news, we are launching a strong slate of innovation in 2016 geared toward growing segments of the cereal category. Nature Valley Protein Granola has been a big success since it launched last two years ago. This year, we are introducing two varieties of Nature Valley Protein Soft Baked Granola Bites, a portable granola for consumers on the go.","Muesli is another cereal form that is benefiting from consumer interest in simple less processed foods. To capitalize on that trend, we have recently launched new Nature Valley Toasted Oat Muesli in Original and Blueberry flavors.","Our line of Cascadian Farm organic cereals and granolas continues to enjoy strong growth and we are introducing a new Honey Oat Crunch variety this summer. And finally, we are expanding our Nature Valley Protein Hot Oatmeal line with Maple Pecan Crunch and Toasted Coconut Almond Crunch varieties.","So these are all first half launches and we have more new items planned for the back half. In fact, our lineup of news is as strong as I have seen from Big G in a very long time, with core renovation that impacts the entire portfolio, compelling new product innovation, strong promotional events and increased consumer directed marketing, all rooted in a deeper understanding of what our consumers are looking for today. Add it all up and we expect to deliver share growth and sales growth for our U.S. cereal business in 2016.","Let's turn to yogurt where we generated strong growth in 2015. Retail sales for Yoplait increased 7% and we gained nearly a full point of market share and this growth was broad-based. Retail sales growth for our Yoplait Greek yogurts increased 39%, led by Yoplait Greek 100 and New Greek 100 whips. Our original style Yoplait business saw retail sales increase 15%, thanks to new advertising focused on better-for-you snacking for the whole family. And retail sales for our kid yogurts returned to growth driven by our removal of artificial colors and flavors and by fun movie equities, like Frozen and Star Wars.","In fiscal 2016, we will build on this positive momentum. Core brand renovation is at the heart of our 2016 growth plan for original style Yoplait. We recently rolled out a 25% sugar reduction across the entire line and early response has been positive. In Greek, we have a new line called Yoplait Plent\u00ed. These eight varieties include whole grain oats, slacks and pumpkin seeds. We are also launching two new flavors of Yoplait Greek 100 whips, Coconut Macaroon and Chocolate Cherry. And we will grow our kid yogurts by partnering with movie equities, like Disney's Frozen and by leveraging our GoGurt Get the Last Drop advertising campaign. With broad-based momentum and strong plans in place across the business, we expect 2016 will be another year of sales and share growth for our U.S. yogurt business.","Over the past decade, General Mills has leveraged consumer interest in convenient great tasting better-for-you snacks to build a grain snacks business that totals $1.4 billion in Nielsen measured outlets. Our market share has increased by 15 points over the last seven years, including almost two points of growth in 2015. Core brand renovation is a central part of our 2016 grain snacks plan too. In the second quarter, we are rolling out an improved Nature Valley crunchy bar that's easier to bite and we will be marketing 20% of the Nature Valley portfolio as gluten-free. And we have got some terrific new items too.","In fiscal 2016, we are launching two new Fiber One Cheesecake Bars in Salted Caramel and Strawberry flavors and we are introducing a pair of new Nature Valley Simple Nut Bars featuring whole simple ingredients for consumers interested in less processed snacks. Our natural and organic portfolio of brands ended 2015 on a strong note with net sales nearly doubling to $200 million dollars in the fourth quarter. Even excluding the Annie's business, net sales for our heritage natural and organic brands were up approximately 25%, led by our Cascadian Farm, L\u00e4rabar and Food Should Taste Good brands.","Pro forma sales for our U.S. natural and organic brands are now approaching $700 million and we remain on track to grow this business to $1 billion by 2020. We have a strong growth plan for natural and organic in 2016, which we expect will deliver double-digit sales growth. We will use General Mills sales strength in traditional channels and Annie's strength in the natural channel to grow distribution across our natural and organic portfolio.","On the innovation front, we are launching a line of Annie's soups later this summer. These are five organic soups, packaged in Tetra Pak cartons featuring flavors that kids will love and a brand that moms trust. This new platform will be in stores only nine months after we closed on the acquisition. We also have exciting news across many other parts of our natural and organic portfolio. We are launching two new Food Should Taste Good Real Good Bars and we are doubling consumer investments on L\u00e4rabar.","Our final priority for U.S. retail is to deliver Consumer First value on select brands in our portfolio. On Helpers, we are launching our 20% more initiative to better meet the needs of larger families. On Totino's Pizza Rolls, we are adding value with the crispier crust product improvement and on Betty Crocker Desserts, we are making a clear distinction for consumers between our everyday value products and our more premium value-added mixes.","So that's a glimpse of the Consumer First marketing plans we have in U.S. retail in 2016. You will hear much more on this business from Jeff Harmening at our Investor Day on July 14.","As Don mentioned, our convenience stores and foodservice segment had an outstanding year in 2015. Net sales grew 4% overall and consumer and customer first innovation helped generate 9% growth for our six focus platforms. And that favorable mix drove segment operating profit to a record $353 million, 15% above the prior-year. Let me give you a few examples of our product news and innovation for 2016.","On cereal, we will leverage the gluten-free and color and flavor renovation work from U.S. retail and bring that news to K-12 schools and college and university foodservice outlets. On yogurt, we will launch Yoplait Smoothie Pro, a ready to serve smoothie solution for foodservice operators and we will continue our partnership with McDonald's offering Yoplait GoGurt in Happy Meals at more than 14,000 locations across the U.S. We will grow our successful line of frozen breakfast products targeted to school operators. Our new cream cheese-filled Pillsbury mini bagels are heated right in the bag and meet the nutritional requirements for K-12 school meals. And we will expand our Pillsbury Mini's portfolio in convenience stores with two new flavors of ready-to-eat Danish. Bethany Quam, President of our Convenient Stores and Foodservice segment will share more details with you on the 14th.","Our international segment generated 6% constant currency net sales growth in 2015. We had a strong year in Europe, where constant currency sales rose 5% and today, nearly 40% of the segments' $5.1 billion in net sales are generated in emerging markets, which represents an important long-term growth opportunities for our brands. Let me share some highlights of the Consumer First product news and innovation we have planned for 2016, starting in our developed markets.","Constant currency net sales for Old El Paso increased mid-single-digit in Canada and double-digit in Europe in 2015. We will build on that success in 2016 by launching our premium line of Ristorante dinner kits into Europe and by introducing Old El Paso flavor blasted tortilla shells in Canada. In addition, we will expand our convenient meal offerings by introducing a line of Parampara Indian spice mixes in Europe. We are encouraged by early results of our H\u00e4agen-Dazs stick bar launch in France and we will be extending that innovative platform to other markets later in 2016. In the U.K. and Canada, we are launching a line of Liberte Greek products with grains and seeds utilizing the same technology as Yoplait Plent\u00ed in the U.S.","In emerging markets, we continue to focus on the growing middle class consumer. Our plans in 2016 include a new line of Yoki branded ready-to-eat popcorn in Brazil, leveraging Yoki's leading position in the microwave popcorn category. In China, we will extend the line of Wanchai Ferry dumplings with more vegetables and lean meats, appealing to a younger consumer demographic. We will introduce seasonal flavors of H\u00e4agen-Dazs ice cream like apricot lavender and cream and expand H\u00e4agen-Dazs shops and retail outlets into new cities. And we will broaden distribution in Shanghai on our new Yoplait business which we launched just last month.","Our CPW joint venture has been capitalizing on growth opportunities for the past 25 years. This is now a $2 billion net sales business and a strong number two player in the cereal category outside of North America. CPW is focused on Consumer First growth plans too. In fiscal 2016, we are bringing gluten-free news to Nesquik, the second largest global brand in CPW's portfolio. In the U.K., we are seeing growing consumer interest in simplicity and we are launching two varieties of shredded wheat with fruit to capitalize on that trend.","And emerging markets continue to be a great growth opportunity for CPW. In the Philippines, we are introducing a cocoa crunch all-in-one product that comes in a single-serve package with milk powder so a consumer just adds water to enjoy a bowl of cereal with milk.","So that gives you a sense for the growth plans we have across our international business in 2016. Chris O'Leary will share more details with you in two weeks. So let me quickly summarize our plans for 2015. Our primary strategy is to expand our Consumer First focus to generate sustainable topline growth. We will do that by investing in significant core brand renovation across our portfolio and by introducing a strong slate of meaningful innovation, all geared toward meeting consumers evolving food preferences. We will maintain our focus on HMM and will deliver increasing levels of savings from our cost reduction initiatives and above all, we remain focused on our commitment to deliver earnings growth and strong cash returns to our shareholders. We look forward to talking more with you about these plans during our Investor event on July 14.","So with that, I will open the call for questions. Operator, please get us started.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Chris Growe of Stifel Nicolas. Please go ahead.","Chris Growe","Hi. Good morning.","Ken Powell","Hi, Chris.","Don Mulligan","Hi, Chris.","Chris Growe","Hi. Just two questions, if I could. The first would just be, you have a lot of cost savings coming through this year, in particular on the HMM cost savings as well as obviously the restructuring related savings. Just wanted to get a better sense of, if you could give an idea like how much of these are being reinvested, how much do you expect to come to the bottom line and maybe a breakdown of those savings roughly between cost of goods sold and SG&A? If I could just add one other question, it would be a different question, in relation to, you mentioned an investment in Yoplait in China and I guess just to get a better sense of when that's going to start hitting, when we should see that in the market and any expectations for that business? Thank you.","Don Mulligan","Sure. Chris, this is Don. I will take the cost saving reinvestment. Obviously we see this year, talking about 2016, we do see a step up in the cost savings contribution the incremental value of those this year. We are selectively reinvesting. We are, as we think about how we have built the plan this year, it was really about balancing, reinvesting to derive sustainable topline growth with increased efficiency in margins and then returning cash to shareholders.","And as we balance all that, we did some opportunities for some specific investments. As you do your modeling, it is probably going to be 50% plus in the phase this year will go back into the business. And that's going to be across both COGS, in media, in consumer support more broadly and then as some SG&A capabilities. So for example, as you think about gluten-free Cheerios, removing artificial colors and flavors across our cereal brands, the sugar reduction in yogurt, getting our value right on Betty Crocker and Helpers launching Yoplait in China that you refer to.","Plus there are some things we didn't talk about today that we are improving our capabilities to reach Hispanic consumers in the U.S. and putting some chaos in our categories against some faster growing channels like e-commerce. And so we have been very targeted where we see the greatest growth opportunities and the commonality of all those is where we see Consumer First opportunities to grow our business for the long-term and that's where we are putting the reinvestment.","We do expect to see a return to comparable top line growth this year. As I said, if you remove the one week, it's going to be up 1%, but I also want you to think about this being a two-step process. We are going to see part of the benefit of those reinvestments this year. We expect to see another step as we get into 2017. Because we are building the base for growth for the long-term and we will start seeing that infection and change in trajectory this year.","Ken Powell","And just to add to that, Chris, Yoplait China would be a good example of really looking at the long term and to build businesses that are going to sustain over many, many years. I think you know we have been planning to enter China for a number of years. Interested, of course because it's a very large multibillion dollar category already in China and so we began shipping from our own plant last month.","The products are on the shelf in retail stores in Shanghai. We are offering a couple of traditional spoonable varieties. These are very, very high quality building on the French heritage of Yoplait. We are also offering a drinkable product. So there will be basically three platforms. They are on the shelf. They look great. We are really excited by it. We are going to do what we have always done in China, which is to really learn about the business model in Shanghai and then as we success we fully intend to expand that business into other major cities in China.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Katzman of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Eric Katzman","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Ken Powell","Hi, Eric.","Don Mulligan","Good morning, Chris.","Eric Katzman","I guess, I am not sure if we calculated this correctly, but if you exclude the acquisitions and you exclude the extra week, was the fourth quarter volume down mid single-digit? And if so, was that within your expectations for the quarter?","Don Mulligan","Eric, your math is pretty good. It's probably around 4% when you back out the extra week in Annie's and so forth. It was actually. And there's two things that I would just point. One is, in our C&F business we did exit a line of low to no margin businesses and that had an impact in the quarter. And then in U.S. RO, we actually were lapping a build of retail inventory from a year ago. So we had anticipated both of these when we gave our guidance. Our sales actually came in pretty much in line with what we expected including the volume component of our sales. So we enter 2016 in the position that we expected to when we first started building our plan back in the spring.","Eric Katzman","Okay. Thank you. And then, maybe I could ask about this value initiative and just how should we think about that? It seems like it's mostly some of the baking goods, baked goods products that are being affected and is this kind of a straight out price cut? Or are you promoting? Or is it like a combination of trying to drive some of those, I guess, center of the store brands that have struggled a bit?","Ken Powell","Yes. So Eric these, as you know, we are not trying to win on the basis of pricing and merchandising, but in the case of some of our baking products and also Helpers, for example, we simply found ourselves not competitive from a merchandising standpoint as the year unfolded. That was also true for soup where we didn't enter the season with the right price point. So I would just describe this as getting our merchandising price points and frequency in line with competition, tactical adjustments. In the baking area, for instance, we are adjusting prices on some of the more value oriented parts of the line anyway. So think cake and frosting. Other parts of the line maybe brownies and cookies and these sorts of things, we will leave those prices as is. So these are really just tactical adjustments to move us into the competitive zone and we think that that will benefit in much better volume performance.","Eric Katzman","Okay. I will pass it on. See you in Boston.","Ken Powell","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bryan Spillane","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Ken Powell","Hi, Bryan.","Don Mulligan","Hello, Bryan.","Bryan Spillane","Hi. I wanted to follow up on Chris Growe's question, just with regard to just making sure I have got all the pieces on the cost savings that are incremental this year and then trying to sort of figure out how much is being reinvested, because I think back of the envelope, I was looking at between HMM and the three programs, the incremental savings for this year should be somewhere in the $500 million to $600 million range. Is that right?","Don Mulligan","Yes. That's correct. That's what will impact COGS. That will impact in total, sorry, not just COGS, but in total, yes.","Bryan Spillane","In total, yes. And then implied, I guess, in the operating profit growth currency neutral is mid single-digit operating profit growth is like $150 million or so of operating income. So if you are reinvesting half of the savings but there is $150 million of operating profit growth, it just seems like there is something I am missing in between. So could you just help bridge that?","Don Mulligan","Yes. You see, there is inflation. We have 2% inflation in COGS. We will have normal inflation across the remainder of our SG&A. And again, the reinvestment is going to be over half of what the cost saves are. So you have got to roll that in as well. And then the last piece that you might not have is for our pension expense with the change in mortality table, it's going to increase our liability, increase our expense, non-cash by about $70 million next year. That will not all flow through because we have some things that will partially offset that. But it is some thing that we will have to absorb next year.","Bryan Spillane","Okay. That helps. And I guess the 53rd week is also another $30 million or $40 million of OI that you have to lap?","Don Mulligan","Yes. That's going to take a point plus off your growth rate.","Bryan Spillane","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Ken Powell","Hi, Rob.","Robert Moskow","[indiscernible] for myself out there. A question on --","Ken Powell","We lost you, Rob.","Operator","Mr. Moskow, we are unable to hear you, sir.","Robert Moskow","Can you hear me now?","Ken Powell","Yes. We can hear you now. Okay. Now we have lost you again.","Robert Moskow","All right. I will hop out. Thanks.","Robert Moskow","We will go to the next question. Our next question comes from Kenneth Zaslow of BMO. Please go ahead.","Kenneth Zaslow","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Ken Powell","Hi, Ken.","Kenneth Zaslow","I just have two questions. One is, every couple of quarters or several quarters you guys start looking again at the cost savings opportunities throughout different pieces of the businesses. Are there any businesses that you are in the process of reviewing to go another level of cost savings? That's my first question. My second question is, can you discuss the different sales trends for cereal in retail versus foodservice? Is there any insight to be gleaned from the different growth trajectories of those two?","Ken Powell","So you want to take the question?","Don Mulligan","Yes. Ken, on the cost saves side, it's an ongoing effort, it's an ongoing practice within the company to look at where we are not as competitive as we think we could be and as opportunities present themselves that are material enough for investors to have different guidance on, we obviously disclose that as we did with Project Compass just a couple of weeks ago.","Ken Powell","And on your cereal question, Ken, I think part of it is just rooted in the fundamentals. As you know, our convenience and foodservice business is very, very targeted to the channels that we think have longer term growth potential and so we are highly focused in schools and universities and healthcare and all of those channels are growing anywhere from 2% to 4%. So a part of it is that we are just seeing there is a little bit of a tail wind there and I would say the second part is that our innovation has just worked terrifically well in those channels.","We have great tasting cereals. The whole grain benefit of our Big G cereals has been extremely important to school foodservice operators and has given us a real competitive advantage. We have a little over half the share in that segment. So I would say, it's a combination of some tailwind in those channels, very well targeted innovation and that's why we are very encouraged by the innovation that we will be bringing to the general market in 2016. We think that's very well targeted, very focused on consumer trends and we are going to see revenue growth that will result from that innovation.","Kenneth Zaslow","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, sir.","Ken Powell","Hello, again.","Robert Moskow","I hope that --","Ken Powell","Rob, you have got to try. You have got to get on a different phone. We are not hearing you.","Don Mulligan","You are going to find a pay phone.","Robert Moskow","All right. Thanks. I am out. I will try again later. Bye, bye.","Ken Powell","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Matthew Grainger","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Ken Powell","Hi, Matt.","Don Mulligan","Hello, Matt.","Matthew Grainger","Hi. So just two questions. First, I wanted to see if you would give any more context on the rationale for the Green Giant impairment? It is a brand that obviously has very high awareness. You have done some testing out of the branded snacks. Just how did you assess the pros and cons of continuing to try to enhance its credibility in more of a health and wellness context? And with the impairment, what are the implications for the future of it in your portfolio, whether that's just prioritization or other alternatives?","Ken Powell","So Matt, we do continuously review where and how we are allocating our resources and resources defined as R&D investments and marketing investment and capital investment. So as you can imagine, we are just constantly looking very closely at that. And we have, you have already heard about a number of opportunities that we have around the world in cereal and yogurt and snack and you will hear more about it in July. And we are dedicating resources to drive growth in those businesses and that necessarily means that other businesses are getting less and we have highlighted Green Giant. The fact that we have done that shouldn't take away from the fact that Green Giant know is in fact a profitable business for us. As you said, it's a really good brand. We are going to be bringing news and innovation to Green Giant, both in the U.S. and in international markets in F16. So sort of reallocation doesn't mean not doing things. We like that equity. And we think there is innovation opportunity there. So we will have news coming, but we have just shifted some of the resources to areas that we see as higher growth and that's resulted in the impairment analysis that we have highlighted.","Matthew Grainger","Okay. That helps. Thanks, Ken. And then, Don, just briefly to come back to your comment on the prior year comp, from an inventory standpoint. Can you just give a sense of where retail inventory stands at the moment as we go into the year? Because there were some retailer inventory reductions earlier in 2015 and we have heard a fair amount of public discussion around inventory practices at some key retailers changing. So just whether you feel you are at normalized levels, whether we should expect any volatility?","Don Mulligan","A good question, Matt. I appreciate the chance to clarify. We do think we are at normalized levels in the retail trade. The issue is that we had some billed inventory at the end of last year. We had that inventory then depleted during this year. So we ended up taking two hits, one for the depletion this year and one for lapping last year's increase. But we think as we enter 2016, the retail inventories are going to normalize level.","Matthew Grainger","Okay. Great. Thanks, Don.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Driscoll of Citi Research. Please go ahead.","David Driscoll","Great. Thank you and good morning.","Ken Powell","Hi, David.","Matthew Grainger","Good morning.","David Driscoll","I had kind of one major question and then just a couple of little details. First one is about cereal, both U.S. and international. Ken, you said a lot in your prepared comments about it, but when I look back at the track record in cereal and the category, it's just been such a tough category. So I would just kind of like to ask you what gives you real confidence that this is the turn that you are going to grow the business? And if you could delineate between your confidence and growth in the U.S. versus international, that would be helpful. And is this a General Mills specific positive or is this a category comment that you will also participate in?","Ken Powell","Well, so let me start by saying, first of all, I think that the category in the U.S., as we look at that, still declining but the levels, the rate of that decline is moderating. And so we are, David, encouraged by that. And if you just look at last 12, last three, it was a little over 3% decline for the year. For the quarter, it was a little less, 1.5% decline and okay. And I think as you know, the latest month was an easier comp, but there was actually a little bit of growth there. So we do see the category rates of decline moderating, not only in the U.S., but we are also seeing that in Canada and other developed markets around the world. So I think that's an important factor.","The second point is that we think we have a very good understanding for the new preferences that consumers have for breakfast and we have talked about this with you many times for products that are simpler, products that are more filling, products that taste good, products that address very specific issues that consumers have like gluten and artificial colors. And as we address those things and as we bring innovation that address those, we are seeing growth. Our granola business is growing really well.","We think Muesli is going to do really well for us. We see products that have had taste improvements grow extremely well. Our Cinnamon Toast Crunch, which is the third largest brand in the category grew at double digit this year. So I guess just the second part of my answer to your question, David, is that we think we are really good theory on what's going on in the category and as we addressed it with Consumer First, we are seeing a response.","And then to your last point, we were very single-mindedly focused on growing our business and we think we have very, very strong innovation in order to do that. Of course it will be, as we see other players in the category invest more in innovation, as we see stronger investment in media and we think we are beginning to see that, these of course are going to be very helpful as well. So as the entire category focus is on these things and we get the consumer support back in the category, that's going to make a big difference as well.","So anyway, long answer, but hopefully give you our rationale.","David Driscoll","Very helpful. Just two quick ones for Don. What's the Annie's revenue contribution in F16? Is it about one percentage point to growth? And then on media, I think in your guidance slide you said it was down but then in response to one of the Q&A you said that there was reinvestment in -- and I forget what word you used -- advertising, media from the cost savings initiative. So apologies, I am confused. Is media down and I think it is and then why did you say that there was reinvestment in it from the cost saves?","Don Mulligan","Media is down. I will get that question first. Media is down and what I said is our total consumer will be up. And just let me parcel that out. So media is obviously what you see on air, what you see in digital or in print. It will be slightly down, essentially I think about it as flat on a 52 to 52 week basis. So we lose a week obviously this year. Importantly it's going to be up on key growth platforms where we have clear ideas. Ken just talked about cereal in U.S. and internationally, our snacks business in the U.S., yogurt in the U.S., natural and organic in the U.S. Internationally, we see it in Old El Paso in addition to the cereal businesses and in emerging markets. So we will have media up on platforms where we have strong growth ideas.","And then total consumer will be up low-single digit. So when I talk about total consumer, that takes into things like in-store events. We have many of those in the emerging markets. We are doing H\u00e4agen-Dazs in-store displays in Southeast Asia markets. Obviously Yoplait displays in China, Yoki in Brazil. So a lot of opportunity to get more exposure in the store itself. And then sampling falls into it as well. Again think about Yoplait in China as we are launching that brand. We are going to see a lot of our natural and organic businesses getting supported by increased sampling this year in the U.S. So there is a number of vehicles that don't hit media nor a consumer vehicles that don't hit media that we will be increasing or invested on this year.","Ken Powell","The only think I would just underline on that is, Don's comment on sampling. Sampling is perhaps the most powerful penetration driver that we have and many of our natural and organic businesses are not really driven in the traditional media. They are in fact driven almost entirely by getting the products into people's mouths. So that's a growing part of our marketing mix and one that is not really counted in the media thing. So that's an important highlight for you.","David Driscoll","What was Annie's?","Don Mulligan","So the other question was on Annie's sales contribution. It was about 1% in both 2015 and in 2016 because we had it for roughly half a year in both instances.","David Driscoll","Perfect. Thank you. I will pass it along.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Diane Geissler of CLSA. Please go ahead.","Diane Geissler","Good morning.","Ken Powell","Hi, Diane.","Diane Geissler","I wanted to ask a question just about the cereal category in general. I know you are probably category captain with a variety of retailers, but obviously cereal sales have been weak for a number of years. And I am just trying to gauge where the retailer is at, in terms of the category and some of the alternatives to the category such as the granola products you are launching which I think are quite a bit different than the regular sort of boxed cereal, but also what you have been doing on the bar business? How does that all shake out at the retailer? Are they increasing square footage, linear feet for some of these new products and decreasing the amount of shelf space for the core products? Or is the granola and bar growth kind of incremental? And then I have part two to the question which is, we have seen a lot of manufacturers come into that bar category. I think SKU proliferation there has been pretty massive over the last few years. And so, what are you seeing in terms of some of these more protein enriched granola snack bars that have been launched over the last few years?","Ken Powell","Okay. Well, Diane, so let me start my answer by reminding everyone that cereal is $10 billion category in the U.S. So it's very, very large and as you know, it's been declining for the last couple of years, but still very, very large and still about a third of all breakfasts include cereals. So I think the first point is, it's very, very important to the retailer and basically what they want from us is innovative ideas that will drive growth in that category.","And so they are very enthusiastic about the initiatives that we are bringing. I can assure you that you will see lots of in-store support and activity this summer and going into the fall, for example around gluten-free Cheerios. Cheerios is by far the largest brand in the category. They are highly enthusiastic about that initiative and it will get a lot of support because they see it as great news for the whole category. So I guess the first point is, it's big and our retail partners really want us to bring innovation. And so they are quite enthusiastic about what we are doing.","In terms of SKU proliferation in these targeted areas of granola or protein or things like this, those initiatives are working for us. And so that's exactly what our retail partners want. They see those trends as well in other parts of the store. It makes sense to them and we are getting nice support from them on those brands. Of course, both of us are constantly looking at what are our top turning items, what are the bottom turners and making sure that we are pruning. But as you have heard from us before, in general, our cereal items are very high churning and so we have held our share of distribution. We have actually grown our share of distribution over the last several years because we have really strong brands.","So does that kind of get your question, Diane?","Diane Geissler","Yes, because some good color on what the retailer is thinking about those two categories. I also wanted to ask about the cash repatriation and the tax charge on that. I guess the question is that obviously you didn't need those funds to grow the businesses internationally, otherwise you wouldn't have repatriated them, but is there an expectation about future repatriation? Or was that done because of some kind of timing with regard to tax rules? If you could kind of frame that for us, that would be helpful. Thanks.","Don Mulligan","I appreciate you flagging at it. This is a one-time repatriation. It was $600 million. We look at the economic cost of bringing that money back for some of the cash need that we have in the U.S. for restructuring actions of Annie's that we did last year. We brought it back and while effective tax rate charge was $79 million, it carries $24 million cash charge to it. So it was low cost from that standpoint. It is one-time. It doesn't change our perspective in terms of how we are going to manage the rest of our cash internationally nor does it reflect -- it doesn't reflect anything on our investments internationally. We have some robust investments internationally, but we also have a very cash generative business internationally.","Diane Geissler","That's great. Thank you.","Ken Powell","I think we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Ken Goldman","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Ken Powell","Hi, Ken.","Ken Goldman","I am a little bit surprised by how far Green Giant has fallen. I mean it used to be a really good brand. The category is not the greatest but other of your competitors are doing okay. So as you think about what happened there, are there any learnings you can take away from that that you can apply to maybe some of your other brands and categories just to sort of make sure something like that doesn't happen again? Because I know in your words here you are sort of softening what's happening, but it's not every day we see an impairment charge to this degree.","Ken Powell","The observation that I would make, Ken, is that it's increasingly kind of a value focused category and the segment that is performing a little better tends to be the commodity oriented, just frozen blocks of vegetables. And so that's the direction that the category has moved in. And of course, as you know, we are also in the canned part of the category as well with our products. So that would be an observation for you.","Having said that, we do see our portfolio is primarily more value added and more flavored and soft products and we see opportunities to continue to innovate and adapt with those kinds of products and it tends to be the higher and more innovative end of the category. And so that will be our focus going forward.","Don Mulligan","And Ken, what I would add to it in terms of learnings is this is one area where the consumer preferences have shifted pretty rapidly. And a large focus of ours, from a Consumer First standpoint, is moving as rapidly as we can against those. Some times you are constrained by the number of resources you can put against the business. And so the cost saving initiatives that we are undertaking to free up resources to get after opportunities like these, I think will allow us to be better and more adaptable and more agile as these kinds of shifts happen as we go forward.","Ken Goldman","That's helpful. Can I sneak in a very quick one? Cereal reformulation, you talk about no colors from artificial sources. Is that different than saying no artificial colors? I am just trying to make sure I understand that?","Ken Powell","No, it's not. We are eliminating artificial. And so any color and flavors that will be, by the end of 2017, will be from natural sources.","Ken Goldman","Great. Thank you.","Ken Powell","Okay. Tina, I think we are out of time. So Kris and I will be taking calls all day. For those of you that don't have my number, you can reach me at 763-764-2301. So thanks every one and have a great day.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect all lines. Thank you and have a good day."],"10136":["General Mills Inc. (NYSE:GIS) Q3 2017 Earnings Conference Call March 21, 2017  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Jeff Siemon - Director, IR","Ken Powell - Chairman & CEO","Jeff Harmening - President & COO","Don Mulligan - EVP & CFO","Analysts","Andrew Lazar - Barclays","David Driscoll - Citi","Chris Growe - Stifel","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","Rob Dickerson - Deutsche Bank","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Steven Strycula - UBS","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the General Mills Quarter Three Fiscal 2017 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Tuesday, March 21, 2017.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Jeff Siemon, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Jeff Siemon","Thanks, Kelly and good morning to everyone. I'm here with Ken Powell, our CEO; Don Mulligan, our CFO, and Jeff Harmening, our President and COO. I'll turn you over to them in a minute, but first let me cover our usual housekeeping items.","Our press release on third quarter results was issued over the wire services earlier this morning. And you can find this release and a copy of the slides that supplements our remarks on our investor relations website. I'll remind you that our remarks will include forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions. The second slide in today's presentation lists factors that could cause our future results to be different than our current estimates.","And with that, I'll turn you over to my colleagues, beginning with Ken.","Ken Powell","Okay, well thank you Jeff, and good morning to one and all. I'll cover the key headlines for the third quarter.","Our third quarter results finished in-line with our expectations and keep us on-track to deliver the guidance we updated last month. Our net sales declined due primarily to gaps in pricing and promotional activity in key U.S. businesses, and our cost savings efforts helped us expand our adjusted operating profit margin and drive growth in adjusted diluted EPS. We are highly focused on improving our topline growth trend. We've added support in the fourth quarter to strengthen key business lines and we're pursuing global growth priorities that will further improve our sales trends beyond fiscal '17.","Jeff Harmening shared those priorities with you in our presentation at the Cagny Conference last month and we'll come back to them when we discuss our fiscal '18 business plans in June. We are also reaffirming our full year guidance today.","So with that let me turn things over to Don to provide more detail on our financial performance.","Don Mulligan","Thank you Ken and good morning everyone. Slide 6 summarizes our third quarter fiscal '17 financial results. Net sales totaled $3.8 billion, down 5% as reported and on an organic basis. Total segment operating profit totaled $662 million, down 2% in constant currency basis. Net earnings decreased 1% to $358 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.61, as reported. Adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes certain items affecting comparability, was $0.72. Constant currency adjusted diluted EPS increased 8% compared to last year's results.","Slide 7 shows the components of total company net sales growth. Organic pound volume reduced net sales growth by seven points, it was partially offset by two points of positive mix and net price realization. In our foreign currency translation nor the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures had a material impact on net sales growth.","Before turning to our financial results by segment let me briefly review our new segment reporting structure which was highlighted in this morning's press release. Starting this quarter we're now reporting under four business segments aligned with the new global organization structure we announced in December. We've combined our U.S. retail and Canada businesses into a North American Retail segment due to their similar product portfolio and go-to-market structure. North America Retail is our largest segment representing roughly two-thirds of company net sales; and thanks to the large part to net scale is also our most profitable segment with fiscal '16 operating margin to 22%.","Our Convenience Stores & Foodservice segment which is unchanged from previous structure contributed 12% of total net sales -- total company net sales and posted a 20% operating profit margin last year. Our cumulated international segments; Europe and Australia, and Asia and Latin America represented 12% and 10% of fiscal '16 net sales respectively. In these two segments, we have less operational scale, we're investing for growth and we don't benefit from a higher margin cereal business which is captured in the results of our cereal partners worldwide joint venture. As a result, profitability in these segments is lower. And due to their smaller scale we expect more volatility in quarterly results which you will see in our third quarter numbers.","Slide 9 summarize our third quarter results across the new operating segments. North America Retail posted high single digit declines in organic net sales in constant currency segment operating profit. Convinience Stores & Foodservice net sales declined 1% while operating profit grew 3%. The Europe and Australia segment delivered 2% organic net sales growth and 39% constant currency growth in operating profit. And finally, organic net sales for Asia and Latin America declined 2% while segment operating profit increased to $10 million from $2.5 million dollars a year ago.","Turning to joint venture results, CPW net sales grew 4% in constant currency with growth across all regions. H\u00e4agen-Dazs constant currency net sales declined 5%, primarily due to the comparison against last year's third quarter which grew 22% behind the successful relaunch of H\u00e4anah Mochi [ph]. Combined after-tax net earnings from joint ventures totaled $11 million in the third quarter, down 35% in constant currency due to asset write-up for CPW and lower volume for H\u00e4agen-Dazs, Japan. Year-to-date constant currency net sales for CPW and H\u00e4agen-Dazs, Japan have grown 3% and 5% respectively. And constant currency combined after-tax earnings from joint ventures is down 3%.","Third quarter adjusted gross margin was up 20 basis points with benefits from holistic margin management and our other cost savings initiatives more than offsetting the impact of volume deleverage and modest input cost inflation. For the full year, we continue and expect to deliver $380 million of cost of goods sold HMM savings which will more than offset our expectation of 2% inflation. Adjusted operating profit margin increased a 100 basis points in the quarter driven by higher adjusted gross margins and a 9% reduction in SG&A.","Slide 12 summarizes other noteworthy income statement in the quarter. We incurred $106 million in restructuring and project related charges in the quarter including $28 million recorded in cost of sales. Corporate unallocated expenses excluding certain items affecting comparability decreased by $22 million, a bit faster pace versus prior periods reflecting our costing initiatives plus the reduction in our incentive growth. Net interest expense decreased 1% from the prior year. We continue to expect full year interest expense will be roughly flat to last year.","The effective tax rate for the quarter was 23% as reported. Excluding items affecting comparability, the tax rate was 24.7% compared to 30.8% last year, driven by favorite impact of recent French tax legislation and a number of small discrete tax items that occurred during the quarter. We estimate our full year adjusted effective tax rate will be 29%, in-line with the updated guidance we communicated in February. Average diluted shares outstanding declined 3% in the quarter and we continue to expect a 2% reduction for the full year.","Turning to our nine months financial performance; net sales were down 5% on an organic basis, segment operating profit declined 2% in constant currency, and adjusted diluted EPS was up 4% in constant currency.","Turning to the balance sheet, our quarterly core working capital increased year-over-year for the first time since fiscal '13 due to the impact of late quarter volume shortfalls on domestic inventory, partially offset by continued improvements in accounts payable. We expect core working capital to improve in Q4 and be a source of cash for the full year, primarily behind for the benefits from payables. Nine month operating cash flow was $1.6 billion, down 16% from the year ago driven by non-core working capital items including changes in trade and advertising accruals, as well as changes in taxes payable, primarily related to capital gains on the Green Giant divestiture in fiscal '16.","We expect to derive significant growth in operating cash flow in the fourth quarter behind higher net earnings and working capital improvements. Year-to-date capital investments totaled $475 million and through the first nine months of the year we returned $2.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and net share repurchases.","Slide 16 summarized our fourth quarter outlook. We expect modest improvement in organic net sales trends driven by the trade and consumer support we've added to keep businesses in North America Retail, as well as the continued growth in Europe, China and our focused six platforms in Convenience & Foodservice. We also see significant margin expansion due to favorable mix, the comparison to margin contraction in last year's fourth quarter, and continued benefit from strong cost savings behind HMM, a global restructuring actions in zero-based budgeting.","Two final comments on the quarter; net sales growth in Europe and Australia segment will be negatively impacted by the comparison to a year ago period which included an extra month in results for [indiscernible] Europe as we align net business to our fiscal calendar. And note that in this year's fourth quarter our Asia and Latin America segment will benefit from an extra month of reported results from Brazil as we align that businesses calendar to our fiscal year. At the total company level, the combination of these two impacts will be a modest headwind to our fourth quarter organic net sales growth. On a full year basis, the impact is immaterial.","With those fourth quarter expectations we are reaffirming the fiscal 2017 full year guidance we communicated in February. Specifically, we expect organic net sales to decline approximately 4% for the year. Constant currency total segment operating profit is expected to be in the range of down 1% to up 1%. We expect our fiscal '17 adjusted operating profit margin to finish at 18% or higher which translates to at least 120 basis points of expansion versus last year. And adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to grow between 5% and 7% in constant currency. We expect foreign currency translation will have a minimal impact to full year diluted EPS results.","Now I'll turn it over to Jeff to provide more color on our operating performance.","Jeff Harmening","Thanks Don and good morning everyone. As Ken described, our third quarter results were in-line with our expectations. Improved top line performance on our Convenience Stores & Foodservice, and Europe and Australia segments, and growth on our core business in China were offset by declines in our North America Retail segment, driven largely by yogurt, soup and refrigerated dough.","Let me provide a little more detail regarding our third quarter segment performance and our outlook for the remaining year. For our North America Retail segment, organic net sales declined 8% in the quarter; cereal net sales were down 1%, an improvement over first half net sales results. Mid-sales for U.S. Max were down 4% driven by declines in Fiber 1. In our U.S. meals and baking unit, net sales declined 10% as we didn't have competitive levels of promotion activity on soup and refrigerated baking products during their key seasons in the third quarter.","Declines on U.S. yogurt sales were led by [indiscernible] varieties as well as a widening gap from promotional levels between us and our competition. In constant currency net sales in Canada declined by 1% in the quarter. Constant currency segment operating profit decreased 7% in the quarter driven by volume declines that were partially offset by our cost savings initiatives. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we've added support to strengthen key businesses, improve our momentum and better position our brands as we head into fiscal 2018.","Globally, our cereal business is improving, it's growing in Canada, Cereal Partners Worldwide, and in U.S. food service outlets. In our U.S. retail cereal business, we're adding support in the fourth quarter behind taste and wellness news that is working. That includes taste news on Lucky Charms and Coco Pops with retail sales are increasing at low and mid-single digit rates so far this year. We're also adding media support behind gluten-free messaging on our Cheerios franchise including new Very Berry Cheerios that launched in January and are off to a good start. And we continue to support our whole grain message on a variety of our cereal brands.","In U.S. snacks, Nature Valley has gained nearly two points of dollars share so far this year in the grains next category. As the new product we've launched such as granola cups, and a new flavor of nut-butter biscuits hit shelves in January and we're increasing media support in the fourth quarter behind the Nature Valley brand. We also continue to post strong growth on Larabar. Year-to-date, retail sales are up 44% in Nielsen measured outlets, thanks to broadened consumer awareness and expanded distribution across mainstream channels. In fact, household penetration for a Larabar has grown 30% in the past year as we found new ways to reach consumers including targeted T.V. advertising.","We're also seeing good growth on Epic, natural meat snacks with retail sales more than doubling so far this year on good innovation and strong distribution gains. And we see considerable opportunity to expand household penetration on this growing brand. As we have previously discussed, we have work to do to reposition our U.S. yogurt portfolio and to faster growing more premium yogurt segments. We'll do that through core renovation on our existing lines and innovating on emerging segments in the yogurt category. We've recently renovated a significant portion of our core yogurt business including a complete reformulation and relaunch of Yoplait Greek 100 which now has more protein, less sugar and a significantly improved texture and taste. We've also refreshed packaging on our original Yoplait and we are adjusting the pack size of Gogurt to deliver more value to the consumer.","On the innovation front, we're capitalizing on increased consumer interest in snacking with the recent launches of Yoplait Dippers, Yoplait Custard, and a new regional yogurt drink that gets us into the fast growing beverage segment. The natural organic yogurt segment is growing by double digits, and we're strengthening our position in this space by building distribution on our Liberte, Annie's and Mount High yogurt varieties. And we're starting to see consumers looking for more simple, better tasting yogurts that feel more are seasonal. This summer we'll launch a new line here that leverages our French heritage to bring an entirely new yogurt taste and texture to the U.S. market.","Within our meal and baking operating units, we continue to post solid results on Old El Paso with retail sales up 4% so far this year on the strength of our innovation and brand messaging. In the fourth quarter, we'll be providing additional consumer support with the [indiscernible] event that includes TV advertising and social media marketing efforts. Totino's frozen and hot snacks continue to grow as we have taken a strong consumer first approach on this brand with innovative campaigns using digital assets that resonate with the Totino's consumers. Our fourth quarter activities include additional media support and a tie-end with the massive-X [ph] video game release this month. And we're also putting support behind refrigerated baked goods with in-store promotion as well as a new recipe and coupons on digital outlets for the Easter season.","Our natural and organic portfolio continue to drive double-digit sales growth and as we reframe our view to capture all of North American business, our natural and organic brands will generate more than $1 billion in net sales in fiscal 2017. Annie's is our largest brand and retail sales are increasing nearly 40% so far this year in U.S. Nielsen measured outlets. We continue to gain distribution on Annie's established businesses including macaroni and cheese, fruit snacks, and cracker lines that were in the market when we acquired the brand. Year-to-date retail sales for those categories combined are up 18%. And as you know, we've also introduced this brand into new categories with ready-to-eat popcorn being our latest addition to the portfolio. In the fourth quarter we'll increase our promotional activity with in-store and consumer events tied to Easter [ph].","Turning to Canada; our fourth quarter plans build on a solid year-to-date growth we've seen on Old El Paso, grains next cereal, and Liberte yogurt; and we're very excited about the recent launch of Annie's into this market. Early consumer response to Annie's has been very positive and there is still plenty of run way for growth here. We're also celebrating Canada's 150th Anniversary next quarter with limited edition maple-flavored Cheerios along with variety of online and in-store promotion events to mark this milestone.","So in total, we expect to see improvement and topline performance in the fourth quarter for our North America Retail segment driven by increased contributions from our product innovation and core renovation efforts and increased consumer and trade support on key businesses like cereal, snacks, Old El Paso Mexican products and Tortino's hot snacks. And we expect to pose good segment operating profit growth in the fourth quarter as we start to realize benefits from our recent global restructuring and we'll have double-digit profit declines in the U.S. business a year ago.","Turning to our Convenience Stores & Foodservice segment; organic net sales declined 1% in the quarter. However, our Focus 6 platforms posted 2% net sales growth led by cereal, yogurt and biscuits. We saw good growth on ballpack [ph] cereals and [indiscernible] as our no artificial colors and flavors messaging continues to be popular with cafeteria operators. Yopliat park play pro [ph] is driving growth on our yogurt business and pricing actions we have taken on biscuits drove high single digit sales growth in the quarter.","Segment operating profit increased 3% in the quarter primarily driven by benefit from cost savings initiatives and lower input cost. Our net sales trajectory for this segment has improved each quarter this year. In the fourth quarter we expect the post growth on our Focus 6 platforms led by cereal, yogurt and biscuits. We'll also benefit from increased distribution on our frozen bread products and in-store bakeries and we expect to reduce headwind from bakery flour index pricing in the fourth quarter.","Now let's turn to our international segments. In Europe and Australia, organic net sales increased 2% in the quarter led by good growth on Old El Paso, H\u00e4agen-Dazs and Nature Valley and Fiber 1 snack bars. Here too we've seen improved top line trends in each of the last few quarters after a slow start to the year. Third quarter segment operating profit increased nearly 40% on a constant currency basis primarily driven by favorable mix and cost savings. A large driver of our improving performance in Europe has been our H\u00e4agen-Dazs business.","We've been expanding our very successful stick bars into markets across Europe, and we're supporting the brand with strong marketing initiatives such as our partnership with Wimbledon that expand the brand awareness. We also launched H\u00e4agen-Dazs in Australia this year and have already secured a 40% dollar share of the super-premium ice cream category there. We'll continue that momentum in the fourth quarter by introducing new stick bar flavors and launching new mini-stick bars in markets across Europe. We're also relaunching H\u00e4agen-Dazs in the UK with stick bars, mini cups, and new more contemporary packaging and marketing communications. So we're seeing good trends in our portfolio and these developed markets.","In the Asia and Latin America segment organic net sales declined 2% in the quarter reflecting macroeconomic challenges in Latin America and the restructuring of our snacks business in China. Segment operating profit increased to $10 million from $2 million dollars a year ago. China is our largest market in this segment and we're seeing good growth on our core business there. We're posting mid-single digit sales growth at H\u00e4agen-Dazs and Wanchai Ferry so far this year. And Yoplait yogurt is growing at a triple digit rate driven by continued kind of trading games in Shanghai and our expansion into Beijing. We expect performance momentum on these brands to continue into the fourth quarter. We've seen same-store sales return to growth on our H\u00e4agen-Dazs shops, and we recently launched new flavors of our retail new flavor for our retail channels including Toffee Mochi, and Fruit and Flower ice cream varieties. On Wanchai Ferry, strong promotional plan on core pork and shrimp dumplings along with a new line of dumplings for kids will contribute to growth in the quarter too.","In Latin America, the operating environment remains challenging but we expect to see performance improve in the fourth quarter behind an expanded promotional plan for Fester Janina [ph], an annual celebration that starts at the beginning of the Brazilian winter. We'll also he continued distribution gains on Carolina yogurt including our new renovated Greek yogurt line which is receiving good early feedback from consumers.","So as we look across our entire portfolio, we expect modest improvement in our top line trends in the fourth quarter due to increased consumer and trade support on key brands across our U.S. businesses, as well as continued growth in Europe, China and on our Focus 6 platforms in the Convenience Stores & Foodservice segment. We also expect to generate significant operating margin expansion driven by mixed strong cost savings and a favorable comparison versus last year's fourth quarter.","And with that I'll turn it over to Ken for some closing comments.","Ken Powell","Alright well, thanks Jeff. So to summarize our comments this morning, our third quarter results were in-line with our expectations and keep us on-track to deliver the guidance we updated last month. We're highly focused on improving our topline performance, we've added support in the fourth quarter to strengthen key businesses and we'll look to further improve our sales trends beyond fiscal '17. Our plans for next year will balance stronger product news, define our global growth priorities, refined levels of investment across our categories and continued margin expansion.","So I'll close this morning by reiterating our commitment to our shareholder return model which consists of balanced top line growth in margin expansion combined with disciplined cash conversion and cash returns, that's the formula we believe will generate top two returns for General Mills shareholders over the long-term.","Jeff Siemon","With that we'll turn it over to Q&A. Operator, you can go ahead and get us started.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Lazar","Good morning everybody. I think as of the fiscal second quarter you were looking for full year gross margin expansion in a sort of 100 to 120 basis point range. I'm trying to get a sense if that is still what is embedded in your thinking when you're thinking about the overall operating margin expansion for the year? I know you've got an easier gross margin comp and you mentioned the mix and things of that nature. So I guess if that's still reasonable or if more of the operating margin expansion for the full year at this point comes from the SG&A side just given some of the volume deleverage?","Don Mulligan","Andrews, this is Don. Yes, as we look at the full year, again we still expect to drive operating profit margin expansion of 120 points plus a greater portion of that will come from SG&A that we originally anticipated. Our gross margin expansion will partly been in the 50 to 100 basis points range versus the 100 plus that we talked about earlier and it is for the factor that you reference with bit more volume deleverage in particular. But importantly, as we go into Q4 as you also referenced, we have every expectation of seeing significant margin expansion, particularly given the fact that we see a bit more modest inflation outlook versus what we saw a year ago in the fourth quarter and last year's fourth quarter we saw some significant margin contraction. So we expect to improve margin performance in the fourth quarter but for the full year we expect gross margins to be more -- expand more in the 50 to 100 basis point range.","Andrew Lazar","Thanks for that. Just a quick one and on just the growth versus sort of foundation strategy; we're a couple of quarters into it now and I know it's always tough to gauge at the start of something like this when you're reallocating resources around to different brands and categories and such -- what sort of impacts will be but maybe if there is just a -- maybe a key learning or two from the first couple of quarters of undergoing this process and maybe what it means for how you view that rubric [ph] kind of going forward? Thank you.","Jeff Harmening","So Andrew, this is Jeff. You know what I would say is that -- you know, we're satisfied with our strategy on growth versus foundation brands and we mean the brands we set for growth we think are the right ones and the foundation ones as well. And how we're managing those, we feel fine we're fine with that. I mean the challenge for us as Ken and we've talked about this a lot is that -- as we look at this year it's not really growth versus foundation for us, it's just in some key categories. We haven't had the promotion mix right and we haven't been as competitive and pricing as we could have been. So yogurt which is a growth brand for us, as well as refrigerated baked goods and soup; and so it really is a matter of our price competitiveness, as well as our innovation on yogurt and getting back to innovation -- levels of innovation in yogurt that we feel are going to be more than competitive and can get us back to growth on that business. So as we look at our strategy and growth and foundation, we're satisfied with that as well as the brands we have and kind of in each bucket but it really is our promotion competitors on some of our biggest businesses.","Andrew Lazar","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","David Driscoll","Great, thank you and good morning. I wanted to ask first about Pillsbury and Progresso in the brands -- just kind of your assessment of the brands at this stage; the volumes in our AOC per see data were down 20% and 16% respectively for those two brands. So the question is -- you know, after the season is over how significant is the damage to those brands given -- I don't have any other word to say here; staggering declines in the volumes. We'll just like to understand kind of what you do going forward and is this something that we have to think has really impacted these brands on a more permanent basis or is there something that you could call up that would be more transitory regarding the trends on those two brands?","Jeff Harmening","So David this is Jeff. I look at the fair question given the decline we've seen on the brands but I will tell you, there is nothing wrong with either the Pillsbury or the Progresso brand. I'm in fact we -- you know, we grew those two businesses a year ago and so whatever -- it is fully transitory. And you know with refrigerated baked goods, we took a significant amount of pricing and we've paid the price for taking more than we should have and you see it in our pricing versus competition, you particularly see it as retail brands private label, that's kind of filled the promotional void that we left. And so for us on refrigerated baked goods; for -- if refrigerated baked goods is really is getting back to being price competitive and we think we'll have a much better year next year than we had in 2017. And on Progresso as well, I mean we were out to merchandise this year, our Progresso Brand and our price points weren't particularly good and we didn't probably execute the way that we wanted to and so there is nothing wrong with either of those brands although I can understand how you would think that given the volume decline but it really is transitory, they are both great brands and we think we can improve performance on both of them.","David Driscoll","My second question is on the cost reduction efforts; do you believe that the cost reduction in these programs are in the whole or in part to blame for the significant revenue problem that the company is having? And then if you could just give some detail why or why not I think people would greatly appreciate that.","Ken Powell","So as we look at the biggest challenge that we've had this year with are -- our retail sales have been two-fold and it really has been the pricing and the price discrepancies we've had in our biggest categories as well as our innovation on yogurt and we need to get back to fundamentally strong levels of innovation. Those are the two biggest drivers by far. Now we have gone through about as much organizational changes one can go through in the last three years and so you know does that have an impact, I suppose it does. And if you look at our results in Europe for example, where we had an independent Yoplait organization and an independent General Mills organization, we put them together and you see our first quarter results in Europe from what we wanted but that we've been getting better and better as the quarters have progressed and I think part of that is due to the fact that we've put the organizational change we've undergone.","And North America has probably been through a lesser extent; the issues although -- we have changed quite a bit with our supply chain and you know from time to time we've had service challenges especially in the first quarter of this past year but those things are behind us now; and so as we as we look ahead, I wouldn't expect any impact from our cost savings initiatives. And frankly, over the last year even though we've had some -- the vast majority of our challenges have really been due to the pricing we've had in the marketplace and an innovation on yogurt.","David Driscoll","Well, just one fast follow-up. Do these issues on the revenue line and in whatever connection it had to the cost reduction program, does it make you fundamentally more nervous or wanting to move in a slower fashion on future cost reductions?","Ken Powell","Well, look -- I mean most of the big supply chain restructurings we have are behind us now. We've already implemented ZVB. The cost savings initiatives that we've seen in front of us, things like going to global sourcing and things like that -- you know aren't going to have an impact on how we execute in the marketplace. And so whatever I say a lot of the big organizational changes that we think could have an impact commercially we're not going to see going forward. And as I said even though there has been a lot of change that's not -- I really don't think that's been the primary driver of our performance this year.","David Driscoll","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Growe","Hi, good morning. I just had a question for you if I could, if you're putting more support back behind the business in the fourth quarter isn't investment more transitory short-term kind of reacting to the current environment or are you treating some of these -- in particular, the foundation brand differently than you thought when you've learnt of their strategy, so I'm thinking like soup and baked goods. You have to get little more aggressive behind those and therefore less margin improvement than you expected from those categories?","Ken Powell","Well, as we look at the fourth quarter Chris the -- we're putting more emphasis behind our cereal and snack brands first and foremost, and then a little bit behind Old El Paso. And because we -- you know, if we like the marketing efforts we have on all those brands we've seen good results on Nature Valley and snacks and we like we have included Cheerios and Lucky Charms and so forth. We're also adding a little bit back to our Pillsbury business on Easter which is later this year; so Easter is in April as opposed to March and so we won't see results on that until April. So we are adding a little bit back for our refrigerator baked goods. What I would say is that the -- we're not going to have a tons back on soup because the soup season is kind of over and after Easter the baking season is kind of over until next fall.","We expect good margin improvement on soup and refrigerated baked goods but we also have to make sure that we were supporting those business properly as well and we've had a significant volume deleverage this year which has partially offset some of the cost savings that we've had. And so our expectation is that we go forward, that we'll continue to grow margin in those brands but we'll do it with a little bit less of the leverage and a little bit more support.","Jeff Harmening","And Chris, I guess what I would add to that is, you know, as we've talked about we have a couple of opportunities in front of us. One is to get sharper on price and as we do that we think that will have long-term benefits and you expect that to continue. And stronger support behind some of our best marketing ideas and you know, as we said before as we look at our media investment for the back half of the year; excluding U.S. yogurt which we said we were right sizing, the other growth businesses will see an increase in media in the back and that's been consistent since we've decided to put money back -- more money back into the business in December. Again, we're going to -- we're expecting good returns on that and we continue to expect to support our brands as we go forward beyond the fourth quarter.","Chris Growe","Okay, thanks for the color. And then just -- if I can ask a quick overall question; in some of the recent IRI and Nielsen data has been very weak for General Mills and for the industry overall; I just want to get a sense -- was this fact of that \u2013 obviously, the weight on your third quarter performance; are there any unique factors that are worth considering in relation to that weakness in the data we're seeing broadly in the industry?","Ken Powell","So as we -- you know, we're obviously seeing the same trends for the industry. If you look at kind of where the food and beverage industry is now versus a year ago, there is about a four point difference from where it was than to where it is now; so sales were up about 1.5 this quarter a year ago and now it's down to -- about half of that is due to pricing; and so we've seen deflationary pricing across food and beverage over the past quarter and so as we think about that 4 point gap, half of that is pricing and so the unit volume really is about 2 points and there is really not one factor that impacts it. Although there are -- certainly there is movement for the perimeter over the store and there is even more deflation in categories like meat and dairy; but also you see significant growth and increasing growth in channels that aren't measured by Nielsen and e-commerce is certainly one of those which is growing at between 35% and 50% this year and is probably upto 1.5% of total food and beverage sales. And so without doubt there is increased growth and channels as not measured by Nielsen.","Chris Growe","Okay, thank you for the time today.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Jason English","Good morning, thank you for letting me ask the question. Back to the top line, I hear your message loud and clear that maybe from a support and execution perspective you are bit-off kilter. But when we try to dissect that data, roughly three quarters your measured declines appear attributable to distribution losses and it seemed pretty broad-based across a number of different categories, not just a problem children that you're pointing to. So I was hoping you could give us some color on what do you think is contributing to the drop in gross distribution or total distribution points? Sequentially it looks like it's still falling -- your velocity is still falling despite the survivor bias and that data is -- the data would suggest like we still have a lot of room to go before we can find a floor there but you guys obviously see a lot more granularity there than we do and you understand what's going on that looks better; so I was hoping you can give us a little more context, a little more color that hopefully leads us to some visibility of when we can find that support level on distribution?","Ken Powell","So as we look at distribution, our distribution is down in our U.S. business this year and a fair amount of that was planned as we did SKU rationalization in Pillsbury and Progresso. And that part was down more certainly than our yogurt business. But also as we look at it, you know we've got -- even though our distribution is down, we've replaced a lot of slower turning SKUs with faster SKUs, and we call those our Priority 450. And so the -- our P450 SKUs are actually up, and so even our distribution is down in a few categories, the level of distribution on our highest turning has [indiscernible] SKUs is actually growing and so for that reason distribution is not really the contributing cause to our decline this year. It may be a little bit in yogurt but that we expect it but for the rest of our businesses really distribution declines are not the driving force, it really is more about our price competitiveness and the marketplace support we've had.","Jason English","Okay, that's helpful. And one other more housekeeping oriented question and then I'll pass it on to others in queue. The year is not quite shaping up as you expected at the onset, is it safe to presume that there has been some incentive compensation adjustments that if a company at the shortfall? In a so can you give us a sense of magnitude as we think into next year sort of how much cost may be deferred into next year if assuming a reset?","Jeff Harmening","Jason, I mentioned in my script -- you know, a part of the same which you see in the quarter is our incentive reduction which obviously we reset after our December earnings reduction and then reset again this quarter. It's probably going to be about a $40 million savings in the year, a reduction to expense in the year which obviously will look factor into our planning for next year.","Jason English","Thank you guys very much. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken Goldman with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. It's actually Josh [ph] on for Ken. I was hoping you could help us out just to comment on at export, I know you've talked a bit about the trade spending and getting there on price points and obviously some increased advertising around a bunch of brands in the fourth quarter. But I guess when you talk about how much of the added sort you are putting in a market, at least I guess try to get a sense of that magnitude? And then as a follow-up, I think you've -- I guess obviously there you haven't provided much of an update on '18 but I believe the last time you gave guidance, you had said you expect modest growth in '18. I guess that still holds and if so how much of it do you think depends on a positive response from some of this added support?","Jeff Harmening","So Josh, this is Jeff. You know, a couple of points in the fourth quarter and then 2018. On the fourth quarter we are adding support, it will mostly hit in April and May, and that's partially due to the timing of Easter when we've added back some support for our banking business. But also when we enter -- when we left the second quarter, the time you can get merchandising and advertising back into the marketplace is going to be mostly seen in April and May. So our improvement in the fourth quarter will mostly be April and May. I think also importantly that even though we're adding support in the fourth quarter our merchandising levels are still going to be down, they just won't be down as far as they were before; so it's not that we're going to one end of the shift to the other in terms of pricing support. You know whether that's in cereal or whether that's in snacks or whether that's in other places; so while we are adding support in April and May our merchandising will still be down it just won't be down as much as it has been in the last quarter. And then as Ken said in his remarks, we'll give increased guidance and thoughts in June when we deliver our fourth quarter results for 2018.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Alright, I had to try on '18. And Don, I guess I was hoping to ask just on the inventory build in the quarter; I know in the year ago there were some issues just around with the Green Giant sale but I guess in turn the increase was -- was there anything else? I guess was there an issue with any timing factors, anything you can help with that? Thanks.","Don Mulligan","No. It was really the fact that you know we had a production set for the plants and volumes still little short of the quarter unfolded and obviously that mean that those products ended up in inventory that we sold through in the fourth quarter. The only thing to keep in mind about Green Giant is actually on the tax side. Last year we had a -- we paid a capital gains tax on that divestiture and that was an outflow in Q4, so you think about our free cash flow generation. One of the reasons to be confident that we'll accelerate in the fourth quarter, in fact that we will be rolling over that outflow from a year ago but Green Giant didn't have an impact -- a material on inventory.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Dickerson with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Rob Dickerson","Thank you very much. So just kind of go obviously back to the top line again, so main topic of the day. You know, if I just look at Q4 organic sales, I think about the year guidance around down 4% because there is no FX impact and I think about kind of comparing it like your stock basis relative to Q3. I mean it seems like sales kind of implied for Q4, organic sales are down 2.5% to 3% let's say which is like it's just a pretty decent sizable improvement relative to what we're seeing in Q3 if we include the year ago comparison. I'm just curious with the increased -- let's say pricing support in April and May as just mentioned, obviously there is still lot of competition, that way you know what's -- what's really the hope here, what's the core driver of that acceleration in Q4? I mean it sounds like it's basically volume but it might not be volume coming from yogurt percentage, it might be coming from some of the other pressure categories. So any color you have there?","Ken Powell","So I mean -- look I think you're in the right ballpark in terms of the improvement we expect to see in the fourth quarter for sales. So I think your math is pretty good on about what we expect to see. You know, what I would tell you is that if you look at our business outside the U.S. retail, so for Convenience & Foodservice and for Europe, we continue to look for good performance there as well as a our business in China. So we feel good about performance in those areas. And then when it comes to our U.S. business, you are right in assuming -- we're not assuming a turnaround in our yogurt business in the fourth quarter, we think the businesses that will get better in the fourth quarter in April\/May particularly are going to be our cereal business and our snacks business. And with continued good growth from Old El Paso and Tortino's because that's where we put more of the pressure whether it's a little bit of pricing pressure or as importantly, if not more so, some of our consumer marketing pressure because we feel like we've had -- we have good ideas in cereal, we have a good ideas in Nature Valley as well as Old El Paso and Tortino's and we think we can drive those businesses better by spinning some more marketing support behind those key businesses. So that's where we really expect to see the growth and improvement in the fourth quarter.","Jeff Harmening","Rob, this is Jeff. I just add that the waiting of our business shifts as you go into the fourth quarter, you move away from the big kind of winter season businesses like soup and refrigerated dough where we've seen the largest -- some of the largest decline, so just from a portion of portfolio standpoint those declines will become less a portion of our business as we get into the fourth quarter.","Rob Dickerson","Okay, great that very helpful. And then just second question on cost savings; I believe you've had this $4 billion HMM target out for many years; as we approach that target I'm curious -- if I just think about what the implied savings are HMM left if we just assume that that you actually hit that target. It seems like there would be some decent step down year-over-year over the next few years at HMM but what my sense is maybe that that's not true, it sounds like maybe there is a decent probability that you exceed that $4 billion cost savings target and cost savings over the next few years would be a bit higher than what's implied?","Ken Powell","That right. Yes, I think your sense is good, we assume they don't expect any slowdown in the annually HMM contributions. And so given that there is a good likelihood we'll see that $4 billion for the decade.","Rob Dickerson","Okay, great, thanks. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ken [ph] with Bank of Montreal. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning, everyone. Just two questions; one is -- is there a way to -- what are the steps I guess to improve your promotional activity going forward that you won't end up in this situation in the '18, '19 or '20 or going forward; how do I think about that and what steps can you take to change how you do the promotional spending? The second thing is, to what extent have you seen changes in your personnel -- to keep personnel levels at the brand management level? And can you talk about how you're doing that as well; so maybe there is some shifting on the personnel that we would see some changes and activity at that level?","Ken Powell","Well, I'm looking at the pricing, I mean -- you know, I think we've been pretty good at pricing for a while and we've been -- basically, worked within the context of the marketplace. In this year we were just priced way higher than the market, so we didn't really anticipate as well as we could have I suppose the market dynamics. And you know what I would tell you is that we -- as we've said, maybe a quarter ago we haven't improved our strategic revenue management capability and we're still improving that, we've brought in resources from outside of the company to help us with that and I think that's going to -- that is certainly going to help us as we look ahead and so we've strengthened our capability there and I think we'll continue to strengthen our capability there. And in terms of answering the question on personnel, we feel like we've got the right personnel in the right place, we've got segment leads who are good at driving growth whether that's in North America here or whether that's in Europe or Asia and we've had a SPU on H\u00e4agen-Dazs in yogurt and so we feel really good about the talent that we have in place that can drive our business across our segments.","Jeff Harmening","And the only thing that I would add on the promotional side is, we might be adding back promotional dollars, it is about frequency more than depth. So it's really that as we look back over the course of the year, it's we have missed some windows that we would have typically have gotten. And putting money back and getting \u2013 reearning some of those windows; so it's about frequency, strategy, not just depth.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. And Ken, the only thing I'm trying to figure out is, I agree your history has been there, I just can't figure out exactly what went wrong and why it won't happen again but\u2026","[Technical Difficulty]","Ken Powell","We'll move on to next.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexia Howard [ph] with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning everyone. So can I ask about the retailer environment because it think to me that even as recently as December I think on the last earnings call you were talking about wanting to pull back on in effect of promotional activity, obviously that's been harder to gauge given your comments to-date and now you're going in the other direction and reinvesting back in promotion. Can you comment on how hostile are the retailers being in pushing for incremental reinvestment back in pricing? It seems to me that Wal-Mart and others are worried about competition from hard discounters, so the retailer environment is getting tougher; private label share gains are picking up, distribution trends as Jason mentioned earlier seems to be coming down, maybe just some comments for you on that? Thank you and I'll pass it on in the interest of time.","Ken Powell","Well, you have some fair observation but what I would tell you is that, as we look ahead we will be -- we're not going to be increasing our level of promotion in the fourth quarter. Our level of promotional will still be down year-over-year, we'll be just down a lot less than it was before. And so while we are adding back spending, we're not kind of going from one side to the other. In terms of retail environment; what I would say is, it's always been competitive as it is right now, in fact private label shares in our categories are actually down and they're down in almost all of our categories year-on-year. And so as we look at the private label impact, actually for us it's not really -- at least in our categories it's not increasing but private label shares are actually declining. And while the -- while retailers are competitive, they've always been competitive and we don't feel like it's any more competitive environment with regard to retail that it has in years past, it's always been that way and we remain -- they don't feel particularly hostile to us and we've got good relationships with all of our major retail customers, and that's been unchanged.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Bryan Spillane","Good morning everybody. Just one question for me. I guess you know -- from as an outsider looking in, it look -- it's just seems like in 2017 one of the things this maybe didn't exist within the plans or at least the guidance that you gave in the street was just not enough flexibility to deal with some of what was going on at retail with merchandising and price point. So can you just kind of talk about '18, '19, you've got margin calls out there; just whether or not you feel like you've got enough flexibility giving kind of what the environment it is today to sort of do what you need to do and still have those margin goals or just how you would think about that if you continue to face this kind of volatility? Thank you.","Ken Powell","Well Bryan, as we went into the year, we went in with a certain expectation on volumes. And as that didn't eventuate we were able to pull certain levers because given the magnitude of the top line it was hard to contain it for me from a profit standpoint. That said we will still have a lot in the site to hold level on SOP, drive our EPS growth and drive a 100 points in margin expansion; so there is a lot of things that we had planned for the year that will still come through but clearly, you know, as we're sitting here now with the sales expectations of minus four, you know, 200 to 300 basis points lower than coming into the year which is kind of hard to contain that in a given fiscal year.","Jeff Siemon","Okay. I think we've got time for one additional question operator if you don't remind.","Operator","Certainly. Our last question comes from Steven Strycula with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Steven Strycula","Hi, good morning. Two questions; first would be a question on snacking which is little bit softer in the quarter. Just wondering what's going on in the snacking category, it sounds like you're going to put a little bit more incremental spend in the back half or in the fourth quarter, but just curious as we're anniversarying [ph] kind of the [indiscernible] initiative. And then the second part would be with respect to the unit volume declines that we've seen on a year-over-year basis in some of the categories or maybe there were lot of price gaps; how do we think about the recapture of that unit share? Where these like bad promotions that you're divorcing yourself from? Where these like unit volumes that you want to recapture ultimately? And the fact you know -- the back half of calendar 2017? Thank you.","Ken Powell","So on the snacking question, we have two businesses we feel in the U.S. We have two businesses we feel really good about and we're added support behind that. So Nature Valley is the biggest one, it's our biggest snacks bars business and we've gained share on that and we like our marketing on that; and so we're going to add support because that's our biggest business and we like what that's doing. And Larabar has also been growing. The challenge we had in the third quarter is really behind our Fiber 1 business and our Fiber 1 business has been declining, and we're working to improve that but we won't get back to growth on Fiber 1 certainly in the fourth quarter; and so what we're doing is we're going to place more bets on things that are working well in our snacks business and we feel confident that that can improve our snacks performance in the fourth quarter.","As far as recapturing unit volume, it really depends category by category, that's what I would tell you. And that -- you know, in cereal we don't think we're far off so there's not a lot of volume to be recaptured. I mean we -- you know, we're only down 1% this quarter and so while we would like to grow it wasn't too bad and we think actually as importantly as trade spending in cereal really is actually marketing spending because we feel good about our ideas. I contrast that with refrigerated baked goods where we feel like we really have to add some money back to our merchandising as we look at the back half of '17 to make sure that our merchandising is in the right place because we lost a lot during merchandizing. ","So it really does depend category by category and that's how we'll look at it as we head into next year.","Steven Strycula","Alright, thank you.","Jeff Siemon","Okay. Kelly, I think that's all the time we have. So everyone thanks so much for the questions and I'll be on the phone all day if you want to reach out and have additional follow-ups. So thanks again. Have a great day.","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and we ask that you please disconnect your lines."],"9820":["General Mills (NYSE:GIS) Q4 2012 Earnings Call June 27, 2012  9:00 AM ET","Executives","Kristen Smith Wenker - Vice President of Investor Relations","Donal Leo Mulligan - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President","Kendall J.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, June 27, 2012. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kris Wenker, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Kristen Smith Wenker","Thanks, operator. Good morning, everybody. I'm here with Ken Powell, our CEO; and Don Mulligan, our CFO, who will discuss our fiscal 2012 results and our outlook for the new fiscal year in just a minute. First, I'll do my usual housekeeping.","Our press release was issued over the wire services earlier this morning. It's also posted on our website if you still need a copy. We've posted slides on the website, too, to supplement today's prepared remarks.","These remarks will include forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions. And the second slide in today's presentation lists factors that could cause our future results to be different than our current estimates.","And with that, I'll turn you over to Don.","Donal Leo Mulligan","Thanks, Kris, and hello, everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning. As you\u2019ve seen in our press release, we posted solid results in the fourth quarter. Slide 4 gives you a summary. Sales totaled $4.1 billion, up 12%. Segment operating profit was $737 million, a 9% increase versus last year. Net earnings attributable to General Mills totaled $325 million. And diluted earnings per share were $0.49, as reported. Excluding changes in the mark-to-market valuations of certain commodity positions, integration expenses from the international Yoplait acquisition and the restructuring charges we announced at the end of last month, adjusted diluted EPS totaled $0.60, up 15% year-over-year.","Slide 5 summarizes operating highlights for the quarter. Net sales increased 3% excluding acquisitions, and all 3 of our business segments posted gains. Gross margin declined 140 basis points, excluding mark-to-market effects. This was an improvement from results through the first 9 months. The addition of Yoplait International to our business mix accounted for roughly 1\/2 of the fourth quarter decline. Our media investment increased 11% in the quarter. And segment operating profit rose 9% with strong contributions from our International businesses and a 4% gain for our U.S. Retail business.","With this good fourth quarter finish, our annual results were consistent with revised guidance we provided in February. Slide 6 summarizes our results for 2012 in total. Sales grew 12% to $16.7 billion, led by the addition of Yoplait International and strong net price realization on our base business. Segment operating profit increased 2%, exceeding $3 billion for the first time in company history. This included input cost inflation of more than 10% along with an 8% increase in worldwide advertising expense. Diluted earnings per share declined 13% as reported. Adjusted diluted EPS, excluding certain items affecting comparability, reached $2.56, up 3% from last year.","Results for our U.S. Retail segment reflected the challenged operating environment for food manufacturers in 2012. U.S. Retail net sales increased 3%, but segment operating profit was 2% below year-ago levels due to inflation, volume declines and a 5% increase in media investment.","Our Bakeries and Foodservice business posted another year of solid top line growth. Sales increased 8% in 2012 with modest volume growth and strong net price realization both contributing to this increase. This performance is well ahead of the industry. And as you can see on Slide 8, we posted good growth across our key channels and brands. Operating profit for this segment declined as expected due to sharp input cost inflation and comparisons against record grain merchandising earnings last year.","Our International segment delivered another year of strong performance. Net sales and segment operating profit both increased nearly 50%, reflecting good contributions from our international Yoplait acquisition and growth in our base business. These good results included balanced growth across both developed and emerging markets. For example, in Western Europe, net sales for our base business increased 6% in constant currency. And in China, constant currency sales grew 22% for the year to reach $550 million, led by H\u00e4agen-Dazs and our line of Wanchai Ferry frozen dim sum items. And we are very pleased with the results of the Yoplait International yogurt business acquired last July. In our 3 largest markets, France, the U.K. and Canada, we delivered sales growth and market share gains, including 1 full point of share gain in France and nearly 3 points of share growth by our Libert\u00e9 brand in Canada.","In 2012, our global media expense increased 8% to exceed $900 million. This includes higher levels of investments in our core developed markets and media support behind our International businesses, including Yoplait. We increased our investment in targeted media vehicles like digital and multicultural. Based on measured media spending tracked by Kantar, we rank as the top U.S. advertiser among all food and beverage companies over the last 12 months.","Slide 11 summarizes our 2012 joint venture performance. Net sales for Cereal Partners Worldwide increased 5% in constant currency basis, led by mid-single-digit growth in developed markets like the U.K. and Australia and double-digit growth in the emerging markets in Asia and Latin America. For the year, we maintained our 23% value market share.","CPW earnings declined in 2012, reflecting a onetime adjustment to tax reserve related to prior years, higher input cost and expenses for new manufacturing capacity in emerging markets, including Malaysia, Turkey, South Africa and Brazil.","In Japan, constant currency sales for H\u00e4agen-Dazs increased at a mid-single-digit rate, but earnings were below year-ago levels. This is expected, given the difficult economic environment in Japan following the earthquakes and tsunami a year ago. That being said, this business finished the year a bit ahead of our plans.","Turning to the balance sheet. Slide 12 shows the components of core working capital. In a year where net sales increased 12%, our core working capital declined 7% as our focus on inventory reduction will improve working capital efficiency. Increased levels of accounts receivable and accounts payable, primarily from the Yoplait acquisition, were largely offsetting.","Cash flow from operations totaled $2.4 billion, and this was after a $200 million voluntary cash contribution to our pension plan. This strong cash flow funded $676 million in capital spending. We invested in new manufacturing capacity in our snacks, cereal and yogurt businesses, and we funded multiple cost-savings projects across the company. We returned $1.1 billion of cash to shareholders, including a 9% increase in our dividend. And our strong profit growth and cash flow allowed us to fund 3 acquisitions and take on additional $544 million in debt while maintaining our credit rating.","Last month, we announced a restructuring program designed to improve our organizational effectiveness and alignment on our key growth strategies. We recorded a $101 million pretax charge in the fourth quarter, which we've excluded from adjusted diluted earnings per share. We expect to record an additional $19 million in pretax expense in fiscal 2013. We're estimating $75 million in annualized cost savings from this restructuring plan.","In fiscal 2013, we realized the majority of these savings, roughly 80% of the full amount, which we reinvested to support our key growth strategies and to accelerate innovation across General Mills' global business platforms. In our U.S. yogurt business, we're launching 35 new items the first half of 2013. That's 3x the number in last year's first half. They were supporting our 2013 product news with increased levels of marketing investment and merchandising support. We're also investing to accelerate development for certain international businesses, including support for the Canadian Yoplait yogurt business we'll acquire in September and investment in emerging markets, particularly in China.","So let me outline more fully our fiscal 2013 plans, which call for another year of good sales and earnings growth for General Mills. We're targeting mid-single-digit sales growth. That includes good contributions from acquired business: Yoplait Canada, Yoplait Ireland, Food Should Taste Good, Parampara food products and 2 incremental months of Yoplait International.","We also expect volume and sales growth on our base business. Input cost inflation is expected to run at a 2% to 3% rate. We expect to offset this inflation with supply chain productivity savings. We expect segment operating profit to grow slightly faster than sales with advertising and media support at or above this year's $914 million level. Our 2013 plan also includes reinvestments. As I mentioned earlier, the 3 key areas are our U.S. yogurt business; the Canadian Yoplait business we'll be assuming control of on September 1; and emerging market development. These investments total roughly $100 million pretax. In addition, we expect pension expense and tax rate to be headwinds for us in 2013.","The funded status of our qualified pension plans remains fairly healthy. Despite historically low interest and discount rates, we finished fiscal 2012 94% funded. In fiscal 2013, several changes will affect the calculation of our pension expenses: first, the discount rate we're required to use is 60 basis points below year-ago levels at a historically low 4.85%. In addition, we are lowering a rate of return assumption from 9.6% to 8.6%. This is a reflection of the lower equity market performance over the last decade and our view of long-term future market prospects. Along with various other smaller factors, these changes impact pension expense by $0.06 per share.","Slide 17 provides a summary of our earnings guidance for 2013 before any contribution from the Yoki acquisition in Brazil. We expect mid-single-digit growth in net sales. We see sales and volume growth trends for the base business weighted toward the second half of the year. Underlying gross margins are projected to improve modestly from 2012 levels. We expect our media investment to at least match last year's strong level of investments. We project our operating profit will grow at a mid-single-digit rate. We're assuming an effective tax rate of 33%. This is higher than 2012, which benefited primarily from a onetime adjustment in our tax reserve, but is in line with recent years' average rate. And we expect joint venture earnings to grow at a double-digit rate. In terms of phasing, we expect first quarter earnings per share to be below last year with growth across the remaining 9 months of the year.","At the end of May, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire Yoki Alimentos, a family-owned food business in Brazil. We expect the transaction will close during the first half of fiscal 2013. Yoki's 4 largest businesses, popcorn, basic foods, seasonings and side dishes, are growing at a double-digit rate in recent years and hold leading share positions. In fiscal 2011, Yoki reported IFRS sales of roughly $550 million with EBIT margins in the low double-digit range. We expect Yoki to contribute nicely to sales and operating profit in 2013. That will be offset by onetime transaction costs, incremental amortization expense and funding costs, so we're estimating a roughly $0.02 to $0.03 drag to adjusted diluted EPS in 2013 from the partial-year impact of Yoki. On an annualized basis, the addition of Yoki will roughly double our sales in Latin America and significantly increase our scale in Brazil. We'll gain an extensive supply chain network and a national sales force. We're very excited to add Yoki's people and products to our company.","As you can see on Slide 19, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share of roughly $2.65 in fiscal 2013. This includes the $0.06 of additional pension expense, a $0.02 hit from the higher tax rate and a $0.02 to $0.03 drag from the anticipated Yoki acquisition. Our adjusted EPS excludes onetime integration costs, mark-to-market effects and restructuring charges.","We expect to couple good sales and profit growth in 2013 with increased cash return to shareholders, inclusive of the Yoki acquisition. Yesterday, we announced an 8% dividend increase to a new annualized rate of $1.32 per share. This represents a roughly 3.5% yield at recent stock prices. And we're planning a higher level of share repurchase activity than in 2012. So share repurchases are expected to contribute to EPS growth in fiscal 2013.","We believe our operating plans for 2013 are quite strong. We have high levels of innovation planned across our core product portfolio. We'll have good contributions from recently acquired businesses. Sales and operating profits are expected to grow at mid-single-digit rate, and that's before any contribution from Yoki.","To tell you more about our plans for next year, I'll now turn the call over to Ken.","Kendall J. Powell","Thank you, Don, and good morning to everyone, and thank you for calling in. As you all know, the last 12 months was a challenging period for the food industry. Input costs increased at the highest rate in over 3 decades, and the pace of economic recovery around the world remains slow at best. As we move into fiscal 2013, we expect slow economic growth to continue, and we think the packaged foods business will remain very competitive. The restructuring program we announced last month will better align and focus resources against our best opportunities for growth, accelerate our innovation efforts and make General Mills a more efficient organization. It will generate savings we will invest back in our businesses and enable us to deliver a balanced plan for growth across our global platforms. And I want to tell you a bit more about this initiative.","In our U.S. Retail segment that reports to Ian Friendly, we're strengthening our alignment and focus by creating 3 new divisions. Our new Meals division will be solely focused on our key center store meal items: Progresso soup, Helper dinner mixes, Old El Paso Mexican foods and Betty Crocker side dishes. This alignment allows us to increase our emphasis on these important brands and to strengthen their growth.","The new Frozen Foods division combines our frozen entr\u00e9es, Totino's pizza, Totino's hot snacks, Pillsbury breakfast pastries and Green Giant items. This division focus will better leverage our frozen foods' scale and consumer insights in order to increase our executional capability, and it will allow us to more effectively partner with our customers in this important and growing section of the grocery store.","And finally, we've combined our baking expertise across Pillsbury refrigerated dough and Betty Crocker dessert mixes to create a new Baking Products division. With many complementary products from shelf-stable mixes to refrigerated ready-to-bake items, we will more efficiently serve the baking consumer moving forward.","Now our Big G snacks, Yoplait and Small Planet Foods division already have good category focus, and they remain unchanged. Jim Murphy has assumed leadership of Big G, as Jeff Harmening has moved to become CEO of Cereal Partners Worldwide. Christi Strauss, who led CPW for the last 6 years, is currently on sabbatical.","In our International segment that reports to Chris O'Leary, we are creating a new regional operating structure to maximize growth in developed markets and drive differential growth in emerging markets. We're creating a new Europe Australasia region focused on driving developed market growth. The other regions are Canada, the Latin America region, the Greater China Region and a region combining Asia, the Middle East and Africa. And we'll also have 2 strategic business units designed to centralize and coordinate growth strategies for our 2 biggest global brands: Yoplait and H\u00e4agen-Dazs. This new structure will allow us to generate cost efficiencies across our international operations that will help fund business development around the world.","In Bakeries and Foodservice, our business realignment began several years ago. By focusing on the fastest-growing customer segments and higher-margin product lines, we've grown sales and profits, and we've expanded operating margins by several hundred basis points. So we're going to stick with this strategic approach moving forward. John Machuzick, who led the transformation of this business, is retiring in August after a highly distinguished 34-year career with General Mills. He will be succeeded by Dave Dudick, who most recently led our U.S. channel sales team focused on supercenter, club and alternate format customers.","Our restructuring program is truly a company-wide initiative. Across every function, we've identified opportunities to reduce duplication and centralize capabilities, making us a more efficient and a more cost-effective organization. Savings from these restructuring actions will accelerate our investment in strategies to drive future growth, and I'm very confident that these changes will lead to continued strong operating results for General Mills.","Our strategies for growth are focused on 5 global categories: ready-to-eat cereal, super-premium ice cream, convenient meals, wholesome snack bars and yogurt. Euromonitor data shows that these are big categories, projected to grow at mid- to single-digit rates in the years ahead, and innovation plays a key role in driving global category growth. So I want to share our plans for growth on each of these platforms, beginning with our newest global business, yogurt.","The international Yoplait business we acquired last July delivered strong results in 2012, and we've got plans for continued international yogurt growth in 2013. In France, we're launching new varieties of Calin, a functional yogurt high in calcium. We're expanding Calin to the U.K. market with a 3-item launch. We're supporting both new and established yogurt products with higher levels of advertising. And we've expanded our European yogurt business by reacquiring the Ireland Yoplait license. Retail sales of Yoplait in Ireland totaled $65 million in the last 12 months.","In Canada, we expect to increase household penetration for our Libert\u00e9 brand through distribution gains and new flavors of core Greek and Mediterranean product lines and expansion into drinkable and kid varieties. And reacquiring control of the Yoplait business this fall will also significantly increase our scale. Together, Libert\u00e9 and Yoplait account for roughly 35% of total Canadian yogurt market sales.","In the U.S., we are innovating across multiple segments of the yogurt category. We are the market leader in the light segment. And we're launching a lower-calorie Greek offering, new Yoplait Greek 100-calorie yogurt. And we're bringing product news to Yoplait Light. It's now just 90 calories per cup. And both of these items are the only Weight-Watchers-endorsed products in the category. We have increased levels of advertising planned on our kid yogurt business. We're expanding our regional Mountain High large-size business to a national offering. And today, large-size yogurt represents 9% of category sales. We are launching Yoplait Simplait, a line of great-tasting, all-natural yogurts with just 6 simple ingredients. And we're also launching Yoplait Fruplait with twice the fruit. And our U.S. yogurt innovation extends beyond the Yoplait brand. Libert\u00e9 is a leading player in Canada's fast-emerging Greek segment. We're bringing this great-tasting product to the U.S. with a 6-item launch. The regional rollout begins this summer. We're also increasing distribution of Libert\u00e9 M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e, a highly indulgent yogurt available in 7 varieties, including coconut and French vanilla. We believe this strong innovation lineup will renew sales growth for our U.S. yogurt business in fiscal 2013. And we will share more details of our yogurt plan at our New York meeting on July 10.","Let me turn to ice cream. Our H\u00e4agen-Dazs business had a terrific year in 2012 with constant currency sales up 16%, and we look to continue that momentum in 2013. We are planning to open roughly 80 additional shops this year, including 50 in China. The launch of Secret Sensations was a big success last year, and in 2013, we're adding a new meringue and raspberry flavor, and we're launching this line to additional markets in Europe, Asia and South America. We're also adding flavors to our core H\u00e4agen-Dazs product line and rolling out a new package design. And we expect to increase our media investments at a double-digit pace behind our global advertising campaign.","Convenient meals are important for today's busy consumers, and we have strong growth plans in place for our brands in 2013. In the U.S., our Progresso Recipe Starters are easy base sauces to use in a wide range of recipes. We're expanding our Hamburger Helper business with new package sizes that are perfect for club stores and dollar stores. In Europe, we'll drive growth on our Old El Paso business through improved advertising, in-store displays and the expansion of recent new products to new markets. And we'll continue to add new products and new cities for our Wanchai Ferry business in Greater China.","Now let's turn to wholesome snack bars. In the U.S., we've led the growth of the grain bar category for several years, including nearly 5 points of share growth in 2012 alone. And we've got a strong lineup of new items in 2013. We are expanding our Fiber One franchise with the launch of Fiber One Chewy Bars, and we're building on last year's highly successful Fiber One Brownies with a new flavor and a new package size. We expect continued growth for Nature Valley Protein Bars launched last January, and we're adding a dark chocolate and peanut butter crunchy bar variety. We are targeting another year of growth for L\u00c4RABAR, and we\u2019re launching \u00dcber bars in away-from-home channels along with new Gardetto's snack crackers and additional varieties of Betty Crocker Sweet Rewards bars.","Wholesome snack bars are a hit in markets around the world, and we've got strong plans for international growth in 2013. In Canada, we're bringing innovation to the category with Fiber One 110 Calorie Brownies and Nature Valley granola Thins. In Europe, we're expanding our Nature Valley franchise with the launch of a new Sweet & Nutty product line. Nature Valley also will be an official product sponsor of the Olympic Games in London next month.","Our largest global business is cereal. In the U.S., we posted market share gains in each of the last 5 years, exceeding a 31% dollar share across all channels in 2012. And we have a strong growth plan for our U.S. cereal business in 2013. Peanut Butter MultiGrain Cheerios, launched in January, continues to perform very well. It's the biggest new cereal among the 25 items launched in the category since January. We've just introduced gluten-free Apple Cinnamon Chex. New Fiber One Nutty Clusters & Almonds is a great-tasting cereal that delivers 40% of a consumer's daily value for fiber. And we've added Cascadian Farm Ancient Grains Granola to our line of Cascadian Farm organic cereals.","We've also got news on established cereal brands. We'll remind consumers that all Big G cereals contain more whole grain than any other single ingredient, that original Cheerios provide heart health benefit and that several varieties of Chex cereals are gluten-free.","We're bringing innovation to our international cereal businesses as well. In Canada, we've increased our cereal market share by 5.5 points over the last 5 years, reaching nearly a 30% share of the category in 2012. Outside North America, Cereal Partners Worldwide will increase marketing investment against each of its core brands: Cheerios, Nesquik, Chocapic and Fitness. CPW has some great-tasting new products, too, including Fitness White Chocolate and Chocapic Pillows.","So as we look to fiscal 2013 and beyond, we see the prospects for General Mills as very bright. Our 5 global product categories deliver foods that are convenient, nutritious and they taste great, all at good value. These 5 platforms account for over 60% of our worldwide sales, and they have terrific growth prospects. And our brands hold leading positions in these large and growing global categories. So we really like the prospects for increasing our sales, earnings and market share positions in these categories in the years ahead.","We\u2019re continuing our evolution into a truly global food company. 10 years ago, just 5% of General Mills' sales were generated outside of the U.S., and most of that business was in Canada. Today, half of all General Mills' employees work outside the U.S., and we sell our products in over 100 countries. Including our proportionate share of joint ventures, international net sales now exceed $5 billion and represent over 30% of General Mills' total worldwide sales.","Now, while we are pleased with our progress in international markets, we remain very committed to driving growth in our core U.S. market. And with increased levels of investments in our U.S. yogurt business and a very strong lineup of product news and innovation across our domestic portfolio, we like our U.S. growth prospects moving forward.","We enter 2013 confident that we are positioned for another year of balanced growth at General Mills. We're investing to keep our established brands healthy and to launch new products in both developed and emerging markets. We'll make investments to ensure our products are competitive and investments to fuel our global growth. We believe our 2013 targets strike the right balance between sales and profit growth in the current year and reinvestment to support our longer-term progress.","I'll wrap this up -- I'll wrap up this morning by reminding you about our investor meeting in New York on Tuesday, July 10, where we will discuss our plans for 2013 in more detail. Presentations will begin at 10 a.m. Eastern Time, and they will also be webcast.","So I'd like to thank all of you for joining us on the call today and for your interest in General Mills. With that, we will open the call for questions. Operator, would you please get us the first question?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So when we think about the need to -- or the desire to accelerate your international investments, whether in China or in other markets, clearly, this is going to be a multi-year process. Does this have the potential to weigh on your ability to generate high single-digit EPS growth over the next several years? Does the commitment to increase scale outside the U.S. imply that the company's sustainable EPS growth over the midterm could or potentially should be below your long-term targets?","Donal Leo Mulligan","No.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And I guess when you think about the acceleration in international investments, is this -- does this really mark sort of a structural step-up in how you're thinking about allocating your spending across the different regions? Or is this sort of -- is 2013 going to be a more focused year of increased investment?","Donal Leo Mulligan","I wouldn't -- I would say that as we look at emerging markets -- well, let me step back and just say 2 things. First off, when we think about growing our business, first order of business is ensure that we have a very strong base business, whether that is here in the U.S., Canada, Europe. And you saw those results this year with Europe, for example, showing mid-single-digit base business sales growth. And so that's always job one, is to make sure that we have a very vibrant base business. Then where we see incremental opportunities is in international, particularly in emerging markets. We have a fabulous business in China that's growing over 20% this year. We're augmenting that with obviously an acquisition -- a soon-to-be acquisition in Brazil. But also on an organic basis, we're plotting back several earnings growth to accelerate even faster in China, for example, and we've done that for the last 3 to 4 years. And while we've done that, you still see that International has grown quite nicely on both the top and bottom line. So this isn't a change of direction. We've been trying to be pretty transparent about that over the last few years that we've been putting additional money back into those markets because we see a long-term growth potential.","Kendall J. Powell","The only thing that I would add to that, Matt, is I would say we don't have a target percentage of international business that we're chasing. We want to do this in a thoughtful and strategic way. Obviously, we're buying businesses that we think fit very well within our capability where we can add value and that will create value for us over the long term. This year was interesting because we had a couple of significant opportunities with Yoplait International at the beginning of the year and Yoki at the end, but -- I mean, this is -- you can't always predict how these things will fall, but -- and in both cases, clearly, both acquisitions, I think, fit very well within our product categories and the things that we're good at, and we're going to use those to create value for shareholders over the long term.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And very quick follow-up. Just with respect to the 2015 targets that you've outlined in the past, are you still committed to those?","Kendall J. Powell","We are. We are committed to those. We think that certainly when you include the businesses we've acquired over the last few years, I think it\u2019s -- we're probably nicely ahead of the top line and operating profit goals on those targets. And we think we're in the hunt on EPS as well, so we're still very committed to those targets.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I have a couple of questions. I guess just some details first. Don, you included some what looked like onetime transaction costs in the dilution from Yoki. Can you give us a sense as to how much onetime costs you're looking within that $0.02 to $0.03 of dilution?","Donal Leo Mulligan","Yes, the transaction will be about $0.01.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then on the pension accounting assumptions, I feel like I've been screaming in the wilderness, but a couple of your peers have -- with fiscal years close to yours have made some adjustments to the accounting, which were kind of favorable to their growth. Why didn't you do that?","Donal Leo Mulligan","A couple of reasons. The major one is consistency, both with our historical results and what is still, I think, the norm for most of our peer set. And then the other one is transparency, and the information you need to see what our results would look like with different accounting treatments or reporting treatments is readily available in our Qs and Ks. So if someone wants to take a different look at our pension, we have the information there for them to do that. Plus, as you saw on the call today, we highlight when there's a material movement in the pension expense. So it's really about consistency and transparency, and we're quite satisfied with our accounting and reporting treatment.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess to you -- to Ken, I thought you laid out a good view of the upcoming year. But one thing that's been a little bit different, I guess, in terms of the board and your signaling is that with the Yoki acquisition, despite spending about $1 billion on this, you've now kind of committed to buying back stock where, for example, with the Yoplait deal, you suspended that. Is that kind of a signal of your and the board's view of the valuation of the stock? Or just maybe you could kind of explain the use of capital in that regard.","Donal Leo Mulligan","Yes, Eric, I'll take that one. And we -- clearly looking at the stock price today, I think you'd look at our results at any kind of multiple whether it's cash flow earnings versus historical measures, and we think we're undervalued, and that certainly plays into our consideration of how we use our capital per share versus acquisition funding.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then last thing, sorry for this, I guess there's some concern over the volume performance in the last quarter, and obviously, as you well know, there's been incredible focus on yogurt. Can you care to say what the volumes were if you pulled out what's happening in yogurt? Because you seem to be gaining share and doing pretty well across every other part of the business, and I'm kind of wondering, does the 7% volume drop in the last quarter -- is that mostly tied to yogurt and everything else is doing pretty well? And I'll pass it on.","Kendall J. Powell","Well, I mean -- the answer would generally, Eric, would be yes. I mean, yogurt has been a drag this year. And if you look at the -- if you just look at market share, for instance, for U.S. Retail with and without yogurt, I mean, if you back yogurt out, I think our share was flat to slightly above in aggregate across the rest of those categories. So there are some other factors in there. But in general, I think your premise is correct. And with all of the innovation and renovation that we have on our yogurt business as we entered the first quarter this year, work both on our core product line with very good marketing initiatives and new products that we feel are quite good. Obviously, we're committed to reversing that and getting unit and sales growth in our yogurt business this year, and we think we have a good chance to do that.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two questions. One, just in terms of the process you've gone through in terms of business realignment. Can you just talk through, I guess, first, as far as you see it today, is that process complete, meaning you've made some adjustments to how you're viewing the world and what you need to do to source incremental growth going forward and you feel comfortable that this process is done? Or do you think it's -- there's still kind of more of an ongoing -- more events to come in terms of realignment?","Kendall J. Powell","Well, this process is done. But as you know, as a company, we have an ongoing very high focus on margin-expanding activities under the HMM grouping. We're very focused on continuous improvement. And so, as you said, while this restructuring, which is based on our look going forward of inflation and the environment, while this particular reorganization process is done, we remain very highly committed to these HMM processes. And in fact, we're going to have a very -- in addition to this restructuring that we've just completed, we will have a very strong level of HMM in the plan next year, both in the U.S. and increasingly on the international side where we just are seeing more and stronger engagement with those HMM disciplines.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just a follow-up. In terms of your revenue outlook for 2013, this is more, I think, just a U.S. -- a question about the U.S. If you could give any color at all in terms of your view on price-volume mix expectations, and I guess what I'm really interested in is, given the volume weakness really across the industry, is there any expectation in your view that either for your own plan or for the industry that there's some reinvestment in price or promotion in order to drive volume?","Kendall J. Powell","So let me give you a couple of thoughts. First of all, our volume growth assumption in -- we're confident about our volume growth assumption in U.S. Retail, which basically assumes a continuing good level of volume growth in our -- in all of our snack businesses, which have been very strong and would include products like L\u00c4RABAR, Nature Valley, Fiber One. So those products have very strong momentum, and they're going to contribute to growth. We also have very strong initiatives in our yogurt business, and that will contribute as well to units. And then we have, we think, very, very prudent and reasonable volume assumptions on some of our bigger, more established categories like cereal, and we think the mix, all-in, is very prudent. On the merchandising side, as we said, we took a lot of pricing last year. We got it mostly right. Going forward, we're going to be adding some merchandising selectively in selective categories and product lines, just to make sure that they are competitive and, as we say, in the zone. We typically do that anyway, and following very substantial amount of price increases this year, we're going to be doing that again as we go into 2013, just to make sure that we have that value equation right everywhere. And it's important for us to do that. We constantly monitor the value. We're not looking at necessarily a price point. We're looking to be in a zone and -- that will allow our marketing programs and our consumer promotion programs to be as effective as they can be. So we'll be doing some of that as well.","Donal Leo Mulligan","Bryan, the only color I would add -- Bryan, the only color I'd add a little bit further is just in terms of phasing. We do expect volumes to grow over the course of the year, to be relatively flat in the early -- in the first quarter and then begin building as we come out of the negative trends we've seen through F '12.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I'd like to ask you in relation to the sales growth guidance, I think you had said, Don, it does not include the Yoki acquisition. What else would it include? Would it include a couple months of Yoplait from last year? Would also -- would it include the Yoplait licenses that you are reacquiring?","Donal Leo Mulligan","Yes, I'm glad you asked. Let me just -- let me run through because there are quite a number of them, and that's worth about 2 to 3 points in our top line. So there's the 2 months of the Yoplait International business that we bought last July that are incremental to 2013. There are 9 months of Yoplait Canada. We'll take over that business on September 1. There's 10 months of Food Should Taste Good, which we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal '12, 10 additional months. There's roughly 11 additional months or incremental months of Yoplait Ireland that we acquired in May. And then there's virtually a full year of Parampara, the small business that we bought in India. So those 5 businesses in those months I listed are all going to be incremental, '13 versus '12. That all excludes, of course, Yoki, which we'll provide some guidance on when we actually close it.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So I think you just indicated, about a -- call it a 2-percentage point benefit overall to the sales from those -- all those factors or a little more than that?","Donal Leo Mulligan","About 2 to 3 points.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, and that's in relation to the mid-single-digit sales growth that you're giving for the year then?","Donal Leo Mulligan","Correct. That's right.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. So I guess what I'm trying to understand then is the underlying sales growth guidance, let's just call it kind of roughly 3%, I'm just trying to understand what's embedded within that expectation. Is it -- so are you going to have some follow-through pricing still coming through? I'm just really trying to work up to volumes and trying to get a sense of what you expect on the volume front. Do you expect that to turn pretty meaningfully into, say, second and third quarter to a positive?","Kendall J. Powell","Yes, so some of it is as you said, Chris. There'll be some be carryforward pricing that comes in. And then the rest of it is really what I said in the -- in trying to reply to the previous question, which is modest volume assumptions for some of our big core categories and then continuing pretty good volume growth in that healthy snacking area where we have very strong momentum and very -- another year of very good innovations, so that would be all the healthy snacking, many of the Small Planet Food product lines. So we're expecting good growth there and some growth, unit growth, in Yoplait in the U.S. So it would be those components that would give -- lead us to the volume growth in the U.S.","Donal Leo Mulligan","Right. And for the full year, that underlying sales growth will be a mix of volume and price mix. And the volume, as I mentioned, will build as the year unfolds.","Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Right, okay. And then just a follow-up, if I could. In relation to the guidance for marketing to be flat to up, I guess I want to understand, that's on, I guess, a constant-currency basis or is that on a reported basis? Again, given all the new products you have, and you\u2019ve even highlighted some areas of investment you want to make, I guess I thought it would have been up a little more than that. I want to make sure I\u2019m understanding the number correctly, though.","Kendall J. Powell","Yes. Well, we're starting with a very, very high base. I mean, we have really, really increased investments here continuously over the last 5 or 6 years. So I think Don may have said, we're the largest consumer foods advertiser in the U.S. now. So it's a good base, Chris. And we think it'll probably up close to sort of low single digits. But I think at this point, we'll just say at that level or maybe a bit more. It's a substantial amount, and we've got plenty of advertising to fuel our growth in the plan.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just a couple of quick things. One, just following up a little bit on Chris. You talked about some of incremental investments totaling around $100 million in fiscal '13 and with media spending being up a bit off of an already high base, I'm just trying to get a sense of where that incremental $100 million is going. Is a lot of that the sort of merchandising activity you've talked about a little bit to make sure you're, I think as you put it, kind of in the zone on certain sort of price ranges and such? Just maybe a little more clarity on where that spending is going would be helpful.","Donal Leo Mulligan","Yes, there's really 3 areas as I think I noted. There's Yoplait U.S. where we have product launches, 35 new items in the first half of the year, and so we're advertising behind that. There's also merchandising programs behind that.","Kristen Smith Wenker","So introductory trade spending is definitely a piece.","Donal Leo Mulligan","Yes, correct. And the second is Yoplait Canada. As we reacquire that business, there's going to be some investment to bring that in. And then the third area, as I mentioned, was the emerging markets, particularly in China, where for the last few years we have put additional investment behind it and rolled back some of the earnings to accelerate growth.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. And then I think when you originally announced the Yoplait International acquisition, you said there would be about $0.01 of dilution in fiscal '12 and then some level of accretion thereafter. Is that still coming through the way you expect it and any way to help quantify what that helps you in fiscal '13?","Donal Leo Mulligan","Yes, the Yoplait acquisition is performing at least as well, if not a touch better, than we anticipated a year ago. I mentioned some of the top line results, but the bottom line has been just as encouraging. So the guidance we gave last year in terms of the EPS flow would be consistent.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it, okay. And then the last thing would be the repurchase or the buying of the Canadian franchise, and then I was just -- to a smaller extent, Ireland. Are there -- I mean, to the extent you can talk about it, are there other, let's call it, Canada-like or more sizable Yoplait franchises sort of out there that either the timing of the agreement comes up over the course of the next year or so or where it may make sense to kind of go ahead and buy out the franchisee? How likely are we perhaps to see some other things like this that are somewhat more sizable like Canada in the near to intermediate term?","Donal Leo Mulligan","Well, there's -- Yoplait, we have licensees across some 70 markets. In many of those, we have existing General Mills operations. We'll continue to analyze those just as we did in Ireland and in Canada. I don't have any news to announce today in terms of what our next step would be, but that is part of the integration of the business is to evaluate each of those relationships and determine if it's best with the current licensee or part of our wholly owned family.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Greg Hessler with the Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Gregory Hessler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","You indicated in the press release that on the Yoki transaction, you're going to fund that with cash, a combination of cash and commercial paper. Can you tell us about the breakdown there? And just given where rates are today, might we see you in kind of the longer-term bond market?","Donal Leo Mulligan","Yes. Greg, thanks for coming on the call. I like it when the debt capital market guys get involved as well. We are -- the initial funding obviously will be with commercial paper, and then over the year, we'll pay that commercial paper down with our cash flow. And we will likely be in the market -- we have a maturity coming up in February of next year. And so the combination of that and the commercial paper balance will probably bring us into the market at some point later this calendar year. One thing I will mention, just to build on that and just take advantage of the question, as I mentioned earlier, our view on our shares and our share buyback activity will be higher this year than last year. But I also want to just reaffirm that our credit metrics are very important to us. And as we pay down some of the debt we take on for Yoki, our intent is absolutely to get back to the credit metrics that we're carrying today.","Gregory Hessler - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, appreciate that. And then maybe just one follow-up. As you look at your capital structure as it stands today, I mean, is there a particular tenor, whether it be 5 years, 10 years, 30 years that you might look to when you do come to market?","Donal Leo Mulligan","Well, in today's environment, longer is obviously better, given where the curve is. But actually, our maturity ladder is pretty well dispersed, so there's not necessarily individual pockets that I would highlight today. We'll make that determination as we get closer to going to market.","Operator","And our next question comes from line of David Driscoll with Citi Investment Research.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Want to follow up a little bit here on the bridge for F '13. So I appreciate the reconciliation on the top line guidance, that it does include some of the acquisitions. The approximately 5% to 7% segment profit growth, I would assume that there is also the flow-through from the, what did you say, about 3 points from those carry -- the acquisition carryover into F '13 that will also go in to drive your slightly better than the mid-single-digit sales growth for segment op growth. So assuming I'm still right there, then a couple of points here. The diluted -- sorry, the share repurchase, you normally do 2% of diluted shares outstanding. Is that your intention for F '13?","Donal Leo Mulligan","Okay. Dave, this is Don. I'll take that one. There were several questions rolled in there.","Kendall J. Powell","What are the questions?","Donal Leo Mulligan","Yes, let me just clarify something. You said SOP growth of 5% to 7%. We didn't say 5% to 7%. We said mid-single digits, just to clarify that. Within that, clearly, is going to be some benefit from the acquisitions, the most material one would be the Yoplait International, the extra 2 months. And I wouldn't quantify beyond that. And as far as share, we always said that we are going to have -- reduce shares that will contribute to EPS, even after the Yoki acquisition. So that will play a role in our EPS growth.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","But you won't say that it's 2% of diluted shares outstanding?","Donal Leo Mulligan","No.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And Ken, sorry for the rambling of my statements here, but it's difficult to reconcile everything that you've got here because there's pieces missing. If we don't know diluted shares and then you blend it in...","Kendall J. Powell","We understand there are a lot of moving parts here, so...","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, I know. I apologize here. I'm trying to be as clear as I can. The realignment is -- that relates to the 850 workers that you've reduced in the force. And I want to just make sure that's not part of ongoing HMM.","Kendall J. Powell","That's correct. And the realignment that I focused on in my remarks, David, really, the focus there was on the 3 segments. So I made some comments on U.S. Retail and International and Foodservice. There were other elements to the restructuring that we did that I didn't comment on. I mean, I commented on it generically, but -- so for instance, we did some very good work in our R&D organization that really just accelerated a path that we were already on, which was to centralize more of our R&D capability around platforms and which is going to generate, we think, a higher level of innovation and in a very efficient way. So for instance, we used to have 4 different R&D groups working on snack bars, depending on the division, and we said that didn't really make -- we can do better than that. Let's put them all together and have one group focusing on that big platform. So we've done other things like that, and altogether, that would be the bigger number. And then this is all incremental to our ongoing level of HMM across our supply chain and -- which will be very, very strong. We're going to generate very strong base core HMM in the plan for F '13.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","All right. Let me try one final way on this particular line of logic is if we've got mid-single-digit operating profit growth including a whole number of factors, the $100 million of investment, the realignment in the worker reduction, when you go from there to 3% growth year-over-year as your forecast at $2.65, there's then obviously below the segment operating line, there's a bunch of negatives here that retard the EPS growth. The problem that -- I can't really see it in the numbers right now is if there's a diluted share repurchase going on, if there is a share repurchase going on, it would seem like the $2.65 number that you've given is worse than the pieces that I can -- I'm guessing at. But Don, maybe you can just help me clear up any of this. I mean, is it just as simple as you're taking this mid-single-digit operating profit growth and you get down, that translates into 3% EPS growth because of the pension and the tax headwind and whatever the diluted share number is at the moment, it's extremely minor?","Donal Leo Mulligan","Right. Well, if you take the $2.65 guidance and you add back the Yoki dilution that we highlighted at $0.02 to $0.03, the tax at $0.02 and the pension at $0.06, you get to a $2.75, $2.76 number, which is high single-digit growth, which is what our long-term models calls for.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Final question, moving on to yogurt. The 35 new product launches, Ken, can you talk about the shelf space issue that I would guess that you would face launching that many products? Is there any issue in actually getting all these things on shelf? Maybe you can talk about do you have to take some of your current products off shelf, or is this just net incremental adds to your current yogurt space? And then what does it imply for your projections for growth in U.S. Yoplait in 2013? And from there, that'll be it for me.","Kendall J. Powell","Okay. David, that is a great question, and thank you for asking it. We have 2 sort of thrusts in yogurt in terms of category management and distribution. The big one and the main one, and we put a lot of effort into this, is making sure our retail partners understand how dynamic and how exciting this category is. And the intent of that is to help them and make sure that they are planning to expand the case. And we've had very good success doing that over the last -- over the last several years and so we -- depending on the retailer, I mean, we can go in and recommend another 2 feet, another 4 feet, another 6 feet. So we've done, I think, a very good job of playing a leadership role in that area, and you are seeing -- across many of our large retail partners, we are seeing them expand the footage. And so then within that, our goal is to increase our distribution. We held it basically stable in 2012. We lost a little bit as we got to the end of the year, and I mean very small amounts. But as we go in with all of these new items, we have the retailer very optimistic about the category and inclined to expand shelf space. We think we'll be able to hold our core distribution and add incrementally with new products that we think are quite exciting and quite incremental. So that's sort of the 1-2 punch to this.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Rob Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess I'll focus on gross margin guidance. It's for a slight improvement, I think, Don? The commodity cost inflation outlook is very unstable. You can see corn prices starting to shoot up again. But on the other hand, I get calls from a lot of investors who think that General Mills might have a lot of gross margin expansion similar to what happened, I guess, in fiscal -- was it fiscal '10 or fiscal '09? And I wanted to know how is this year going to be different from that prior year where margins were up 400, 500 bps? Is this different because it's more like decelerating inflation rather than true deflation? And as you look at the grain markets right now, are you really locked in at favorable rates that protect you from what's happening in grain?","Donal Leo Mulligan","Sure. Well, first off, we view F '13 as very different than F '10. F '10 was a deflationary year. We had I think it was minus 3% input cost that year. This year, we expect low single-digit at 2% to 3%, I mentioned in the script -- 2% to 3% inflation. Thank you, Kris. 2% to 3% inflation. So it is a very different environment. We're about 50% covered as we enter the year, which is about an average position for us. And as you noted, Rob, the markets are very volatile, and we've taken positions accordingly. But that volatility will play out as the year unfolds.","Kristen Smith Wenker","Thanks, everybody. I apologize that we didn't get through all the queue. Give me a shout if I can be of help. Thanks so much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

And I\u2019m pleased to say that we have delivered broad-based improvement in the second quarter across geographies, product platforms and channels. We\u2019re executing better. We have stronger innovation, more effective brand building and better merchandising that\u2019s driving market share gains in the majority of our key global platforms.","We\u2019re growing aggressively in key emerging channels like e-commerce. And I\u2019m also pleased to say that, we grew organic sales in absolute terms across all four of our operating segments this quarter. And while we like our momentum, I must say, it feels great to grow again in absolute terms.","While we like the momentum we\u2019re building on our top line, we also know we have work to do to deliver the year. Our second quarter total segment operating profit was improved over the first quarter, but still down over a year-over-year. We have concrete plans in place to deliver strong profit growth in the second-half of the year, while continuing to drive our top line.","So with two quarters behind us and good visibility to our back-half plans, we are raising our organic sales outlook for the year and maintaining our guidance for profit and EPS growth. With that as a summary, let me turn it over to Don Mulligan to provide more details about our second quarter performance.","Donal Mulligan","Thanks, Jeff. Let\u2019s jump right into our financial results on Slide 6.","Net sales totaled $4.2 billion in the quarter, up 2% as reported. Organic net sales increased 1%. Total segment operating profit totaled $773 million, down 8% in constant currency. Net earnings decreased a 11% to $430 million and diluted earnings per share declined 8% to $0.77 as reported. These results include a $42 million charge related to a prior year tax adjustment. Adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes that tax charge and other items affecting comparability was $0.82, down 5% on a constant currency basis.","Slide 7 shows the components of total company net sales growth. Organic net sales increased 1% in the second quarter, driven by sales mix and net price realization. Foreign currency translation yielded a one point benefit to total net sales.","Second quarter adjusted gross margin decreased 240 basis points and adjusted operating profit margin was down 220 basis points as expected, driven by higher input cost, including currency driven inflation on imported products, unfavorable trade expense facing, stronger seasonal merchandising performance and a 7% increase in media expense. These were partially offset by savings from cost management activities.","As we look ahead, there are a few key drivers that will strengthen our adjusted operating profit margins from the low 17% range in the first-half to more than 18% in the second-half.","First, we expect to drive positive net price realization and mix across all four segments, driven by trade phasing, pricing in certain geographies and improved sales mix. Second, our cost savings will accelerate as our global sourcing initiative ramps up. And third, we expect input cost inflation to moderate a bit after peaking in the second quarter.","For the full-year, we have increased our sales guidance maintained our profit guidance, we now expect our adjusted operating profit margin to be below last year. Due to a higher input cost outlook, more negative transaction FX impact, some incremental investment we\u2019ve chosen to make in our differential growth platforms to accelerate their growth in fiscal 2019, and favorable translation FX helping sales more than operating profit.","Slide 10 summarize our joint venture results in the quarter. CPW net sales declined 2% in constant currency, due to volume declines in the UK, partially offset by strong performance in Asia and Middle East and Africa region. H\u00e4agen-Dazs Japan constant currency sales were 3% below a year ago period, when net sales grew 21% in constant currency. On a year-to-date basis, constant currency net sales were up modestly for CPW and up 4% for H\u00e4agen-Dazs Japan.","Combined after-tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $24 million in the quarter compared to $30 million a year ago, driven by lower volume and higher input cost for CPW and a comparison against 27% constant currency after-tax earnings growth last year.","Slide 11 summarizes other noteworthy income statement items in the quarter. We incurred $6 million in restructuring and project-related charges in the quarter, including $5 million recording in cost of sales. Corporate unallocated expenses, including certain items affecting comparability increased by $17 million. Net interest expense was down 1% versus prior year, and we continue to expect full-year interest expense will be flat to last year.","The effective tax rate for the quarter was 35.9% as reported, compared to 32.8% a year ago, driven by the prior year adjustment I mentioned earlier. Excluding items affecting comparability, the tax rate was 29.3% roughly in line with our full-year expectations and 310 basis points below last year\u2019s quarterly rate due to favorable impacts from discrete foreign items.","We continue to expect our full-year adjusted effective tax rate will be in line with last year. At this point, we have not incorporated any estimate of the impact of U.S. tax reform legislation into our guidance. And average diluted shares outstanding declined 3% in the quarter. We now expect shares to be down approximately 2% for the full-year.","Turning to our first-half financial performance. Net sales of $8 million were down 1% as reported and on an organic basis. Segment operating profit declined 12% in constant currency and adjusted diluted EPS was down 6% as reported and 7% in constant currency.","Turning to the balance sheet. Slide 13 shows that our core working capital decreased 42% versus last year\u2019s second quarter, with benefit from our terms extension program more than offsetting higher accounts receivable. First-half operating cash flow totaled $1.6 billion, up 45% over the prior year, driven by continued improvements in accounts payable, as well as changes in trade and incentive accruals.","Year-to-date capital investments totaled $260 million. And through the first-half of the fiscal year, we returned over $1.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and net share repurchases.","As we turn our attention to the second-half of fiscal 2018, we expect to continue to drive strong seasonal merchandising performance, as the soup and baking key seasons extend through the third quarter. We have an excellent back-half innovation lineup and we expect our new products sales will continue to outpace last year.","We anticipate favorable price mix across each operating segment. We expect input cost inflation to moderate in the second-half and cost savings to accelerate, with the largest benefit coming in the fourth quarter. As a result, we\u2019re targeting strong growth in segment operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS in the second-half.","Importantly, given the seasonal merchandise in the third quarter, cost savings wrapping up in the fourth quarter and some shifts in below the line items, we expect growth in SOP and EPS to be more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter.","Let me close my portion of our remarks by outlining our updated fiscal 2018 guidance. Namely, we now expect organic net sales growth to be in a range between flat and down 1%. This translates to a 300 to 400 basis point improvement over our fiscal 2017 performance.","In addition, we now estimate currency translation will increase reported net sales by approximately 1 percentage point for the full-year. We continue to project total segment operating profit growth to be in a range of between flat and up 1% on a constant currency basis. As I said, we now expect adjusted operating profit margin to be below last year\u2019s levels. We continue to expect adjusted diluted EPS will increase between 1% and 2% in cost currency. As I mentioned earlier, this outlook excludes any impact from proposed U.S. tax reform legislation. And we continue to estimate foreign currency will have a $0.01 favorable impact to full-year adjusted diluted EPS.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to John for an update on our North American retail performance.","Jonathon Nudi","Thanks, Don. Good morning, everyone. I appreciate the opportunity to give you a deeper dive into our North American Retail segment. I\u2019m proud to lead this team. We have great people. We\u2019re moving with urgency. We\u2019re operating differently than a year ago and I think you can begin to see that translate into our performance.","The key messages for North America Retail this quarter are similar to headlines for a total company. We\u2019re driving broad-based top line improvement with organic sales slightly positive amounting to flat in the quarter. Our profit was down this quarter, but improved sequentially over the first quarter and we have clear initiatives that will deliver profit growth in the second-half. We\u2019re executing well against our fiscal 2018 priorities and we have strong back-half plans in place to maintain our trajectory.","Looking at the financial results in the second quarter, organic net sales for this segment were up just under 0.5%. U.S. Cereal posted 7% net sales growth, which was ahead of Nielsen-measured retail sales, due to non-measured channel growth, strong sell-in for new Chocolate Peanut Butter Cheerios and other quarterly timing shifts.","Fiscal year-to-date, U.S. Cereal net sales and retail sales are each roughly flat to last year. U.S. Snacks net sales increased 5% in the quarter, with growth on L\u00e4rabar, Nature Valley and fruit snacks, partially offset by declines in Fiber One. Canada net sales are up 1% in constant currency and net sales for the U.S. Meals & Baking operating units were down 2%.","U.S. yogurt net sales declined 11% and a 11 point improvement over the first quarter, driven by continued declines in Light and Greek varieties, partially offset by excellent innovation in news and core established brands. Segment operating profit declined 5% in constant currency in the quarter, driven by higher input costs, unfavorable trade phasing and increased advertising and media expense, partially offset by favorable product mix and benefits from cost savings.","We\u2019ve driven sequential improvement in U.S. retail sales since the beginning of the year. In fact, our second quarter retail sales trends are almost 700 basis points better than fourth quarter of last year and our improvement is driving better results for our categories.","We saw retail sales trend positive in measured channels in the second quarter. And it\u2019s not just a couple of businesses driving this trend, our retail sales trends are better in eight of our nine largest U.S. categories. We\u2019ve had absolute retail sales and dollar shared growth in this quarter on six of these nine businesses.","Not only those \u2013 not only are these trends broad-based or high-quality, we\u2019ve increased our brand-building investment this year and we\u2019re leveraging new campaigns on some of our biggest brands, generated by new creative agencies and we\u2019re taking a fresh approach towards consumer messaging.","For example, new campaigns on Cereals, Nature Valley and Pillsbury are helping drive baseline sales improvements by as much as double digits for these branches at the end of last year. We\u2019re also seeing benefits from an increased focus on innovation with retail sales from new products of more than 50% of the share, driven by successes like Oui by Yoplait and Chocolate Peanut Butter Cheerios.","In total, our second quarter baseline sales trends in the U.S. improved by over 600 basis points relative to the fourth quarter of 2017. That represents more than 75% of our overall improvement in the Nielsen-measured channels. We\u2019re also driving better merchandising performance this year.","Our display support, which is the most effective merchandise vehicle was up double digits in the quarter. And when you have good brand-building support and strong innovation, your merchandising works even harder for you. It\u2019s important to note that we\u2019re maintaining discipline in our pricing in the market. Average unit prices for our overall U.S. portfolio were up 5% in the first-half. However, three quarters of that increase was due to significant mix impacts from our year-over-year business.","Excluding year-over-year, average unit prices for the rest of our portfolio were up 2% in the first quarter and about a 0.5% in the second quarter. The quarterly change was driven in part by moving end of the zone or [ph] dough businesses, where our seasonal pricing is lower than last year, but still higher than two years ago, as we had planned.","As we look ahead to the second-half of fiscal 2018, remember that our Nielsen pricing metrics will compare against periods last year, when our aggregate U.S. pricing was up 5% or more. We\u2019re also driving strong results in growing channels, including exceptional performance in e-commerce.","Our U.S. e-commerce business grew 82% in the first-half of the year and we still enjoy higher market shares in online full basket purchases compared to shares in bricks and mortar channels. We\u2019re excited about the opportunity that e-commerce provides and we will continue to develop our insights and capabilities to keep our business in advantage position and it\u2019s important in emerging channel.","With that as a backdrop, I thought I\u2019d briefly check in on the segment priorities I shared at our Investor Day in July and give you a preview of the product news innovation that will drive results in the back-half of 2018. Our top priority, North America retailers are driving improved performance in U.S. Cereal. I\u2019m happy to report that we\u2019re achieving that goal through six months.","We\u2019ve seen a strong turnaround performance in measured channels this year, with retail sales growth in the second quarter, and we\u2019ve gained 70 basis points in market share through the first-half. Four of our largest taste-oriented cereals, which make up over third of our portfolio driving a performance this year.","Year-to-date retail sales are Lucky Charms and Cocoa Puffs reached up 14%, while Cinnamon Toast Crunch and Reese\u2019s Puffs are up 8%, the corn puff and kid cereals, because roughly half of the consumption on these brands is by adults. Compelling consumer news has been a theme across these brands, whether that\u2019s new marshmallow news each quarter on Lucky Charms or cinnamon news on Cinnamon Toast Crunch, which has driven 43 consecutive months of market share gains for the brands.","We\u2019re planning to extend our cereal momentum in the second-half behind some exciting innovation and platform marketing executions. Chocolate Peanut Butter Cheerios, which launched in October is off to a great start and is turning at the top of the category. We\u2019ll continue to fuel this new product in the second-half with strong in third quarter.","In January, we launched two new blasted shred cereals in Peanut Butter Chocolate and Cinnamon Toast Crunch flavors and an opportunity to invigorate $400 million shredded wheat segment by delivering on to tidy and taste. What happened in the fast-growing nut butter channel with new almond butter and peanut butter varieties of our Nature Valley Granola Cereals.","We\u2019re supporting these launches, as well as the rest of the portfolio with remarkable marketing and merchandising. I\u2019m probably most excited about our cheerios and merchandising initiatives at the Ellen DeGeneres show that begins in January. We\u2019re running an on packed sweepstakes, where consumers share an active good that demonstrated for a chance to win two prizes. One for themselves and one to share with another person as an active good. The sweepstakes will be announced on the show next month.","Now let\u2019s shift gears to our second priority, which is reshaping our U.S. yogurt portfolio by innovating in faster-growing emerging segments of the category. In 2018, the yogurt innovation has been tremendously successful thus far, led by Oui by Yoplait, which already makes up almost 10% of our U.S. yogurt portfolio. Oui\u2019s glass jar and unique positioning really standout on shelf, which has helped drive strong consumer trial and we\u2019re seeing an acceleration in repeat purchases. Retailers love wheat, because it is driving more sales with current consumers and attracting new yogurt buyers.","Through the first four months in shelf, we used the largest launch in the category over the past five years. And Yoplait Mix-Ins targets towards traditional yogurt levers looking for great tasting snack options is the second largest launch in the category this year.","While innovation is critical to our U.S. yogurt strategy, it\u2019s also critical that we stabilize our two large core platforms in kid yogurts and Original Style Yoplait. This year, we adjusted our biggest consumer paying atGoGurt franchise by making the tubes easier to open. Consumer investment communicating this change is driving improvement on the GoGurt business, with retail sales nearly flat in the second quarter. We\u2019re also investing in advertising for Original Style Yoplait, featuring our Mom On Campaign, where we celebrate hard working moms and show how Yoplait fits into our busy life, and we\u2019ve seen sales trends improved here as well over the last few quarters.","We have plenty of news to drive further improvement on GoGurt in second-half, and we were launching four additional flavors in January; Raspberry, Key Lime, Mango and Black Berry. We\u2019re also launching a new line of Annie\u2019s powder sugars. We make this product using organic home milk and four flavors that combine fruits and vegetables with no added sugar.","Fruit is the hero on the traditional yogurt segment, nearly 50% of shoppers like more. So we\u2019re giving them what they want, adding more fruits to our Original Style Yoplait. We\u2019re updating the package to communicate the change, and thus using the change on TV and digital advertising. We\u2019ve also seen indulgence opportunity in the traditional yogurt segment and then we can bring more consumers to shelf for the decadent home milk and real food offering.","Our new fruit sideline shows off its indulging ingredients with clear packaging and it\u2019s price for the dollar to maintain broad appeal. We know there\u2019s still a long way to go on the U.S. sugar, but we like the direction we\u2019re heading. We think the combinations were first-half improvements and our back-half news will help us cut our declines to single digits by the end of the year.","Our third priority in North America Retail this year is driving differential growth on Totino\u2019s hot snacks, Old El Paso and snack bars. I would say, we\u2019re generating good growth so far this year with low single-digit retail sales increases across each of these large platforms.","On Totino\u2019s hot snacks, we were forced to led consumer support plan for the back-half, target towards a millennial male consumer. We\u2019re bringing to life for live free couch hard campaigns in time for football championship season by inviting consumers to show us how they couch hard. We\u2019re supporting the campaign with football theme in store merchandising and we will continue to run advertising and digital in TV throughout the year.","For Old El Paso in the second-half, we\u2019re accelerating our in-store activations. We\u2019re again partnering with Avocados from Mexico, which is one of our largest merchandising events of the year, and we\u2019re bringing taco truck merchandising displays to key retailers. And we will continue to support the business with our Anything Goes in Old El Paso campaign.","Growth on our snack bars business has really been a tale of two stories, with strong growth from Nature Valley and L\u00e4rabar, offsetting declines in Fiber One. Retail sales for Nature Valley are up up double-digit so far this year, helped by new advertising on our core and excellent performance in our new nut better biscuits and granola cup platforms. And L\u00e4rabar continues to deliver 30% retail sales growth behind strong distribution growth and investment behind its food made from food campaign, which will continue in the back-half of the year.","The story on Fiber One is more challenging. We\u2019re working hard to improve performance by refocusing our messaging on our core consumer and renovating our products and packaging which are the Fiber One\u2019s core role permissible indulgence. And the retail sales were still down sharply in the first-half, driven by reduced distribution base sales per point of distribution of turn positive, which is a good indicator of future trends.","We\u2019re working to rebuild the innovation pipeline of Fiber One, including the launch of eight new items in January, featuring four flavors of Fiber One Bites and we\u2019re supporting these launches with our all mine TV and digital advertising. We have some great new indulgent offerings on Nature Valley as well. Consumers are looking for indulgent treats made from real food.","So we\u2019re introducing layer bars to have a triple layer of nut butter, granola with nuts and chocolate, and we\u2019re launching soft-baked filled squares that combine whole grain Oatmeal bars with creamy peanut butter filling. We\u2019ll support these lunches with TV, social media, digital coupons and merchandising.","With the winter in full swing here in Minneapolis, I thought I\u2019d share a quick update on our performance so far in the key soup and baking seasons. We\u2019re back in our game on \u2013 in soup this year. Retail sales growth were up 2%. We gained a half point to share in the category two months in the soup season, with strength across a core registered business, including new progress organic.","Retail sales for Betty Crocker Dessert Mixes were up a 0.5% since October, and we gained over a plenty of share behind strong and season support and good performance from our core segments. And I\u2019ll closer by refrigerated dough, our results have improved over last year\u2019s key season, but we\u2019re still not where we want to be.","Our new media campaign Made at Home is driving better baseline sales and we have stronger merchandising plan this year. Retail sales declined 1% in the first two months of key season, but we\u2019re seeing month-by-month improvement and we posted growth in November.","Our final priority for this year is to expand our national organic portfolio and we\u2019re seeing good results here too, particularly on three of our largest businesses Mac And Cheese, Cereal and fruit snacks. We generate year-to-date market share gains across each of these categories due to strong consumer engagement, distribution expansion and instruct support, and we\u2019ll continue those efforts throughout the second-half to continue to drive growth in our national organic portfolio.","I\u2019ll close by summarizing my key messages for North America Retail today. We\u2019re seeing broad-based high-quality improvement in our top line trends, including organic sales growth in the second quarter. Our profit performance is improving and we have clear initiatives that will deliver profit growth in the second-half. We\u2019re making progress on our fiscal 2018 key priorities, and we have strong back-half plans in place to maintain our trajectory.","For the full-year, we now expect organic sales to be down 1% to 2%, which is a 100 basis points better than our original guidance. We expect segment operating profit growth on a constant currency basis.","With that, I want to thank you for your time this morning, and I hand it back over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Harmening","Thanks, Jon. I\u2019ll cover second quarter performance for our other three segments. In Convenience Stores and Foodservice, second quarter organic net sales were up 5%, driven by mid single-digit growth for the Focus 6 platforms and benefits from index pricing on bakery flour.","Within the Focus 6, Innovation drove strong double-digit growth on frozen meals, including new frozen breads and stuff presence in K-12 schools and new Stuffed Waffle in Convenience Stores. We also generated good growth on Cereal and the Foodservice channels. Segment operating profit was down 2% in the quarter, driven by higher input costs.","Looking ahead to the second-half, we expect to continue driving good performance on frozen meals, led by strong demand in K-12 schools for our healthy delicious and easy-to-prepare meal solutions. And we like the prospects for our Stuffed Waffle, which meets many C-store\u2019s consumers desires for convenience and great taste.","We\u2019ve also seen our snacks business strengthened in C-stores recently. And we\u2019ll build on that success \u2013 with success with the support for Gushers and Nature Valley Granola Cups. And finally, we expect further growth on Cereal on the back-half, including our successful Granola offerings in colleges and Universities.","Turning to Europe and Australia, organic net sales were up 1% in the second quarter. We gained market share across our seven largest H\u00e4agen-Dazs markets, driven by innovation on stick bars and mini sticks, new packaging on our prime business and investment behind a new advertising campaign.","Our performance on yogurt improved behind new product innovation, focusing on a combination of simple ingredients and great taste. In the UK, we leveraged our learning from Canada to drive 25% growth on the Betty. And in France, we found success with our Triple Sensation\u2019s launch.","On snack bars, innovation and increased distribution grow double-digit retail sales growth across the segment, including in the UK, our largest snacks bars market.","Segment operating profit totaled $27 million in the quarter, compared to $41 million a year ago, primarily driven by significant raw material inflation and currency-driven inflation on products imported into the UK.","As we look at the back-half, we expect H\u00e4agen-Dazs and snack bars will lead the segment\u2019s growth. It\u2019s summer in Australia and we\u2019re looking to build on our successful H\u00e4agen-Dazs launch last year by driving the brand\u2019s consumer awareness through media, sampling and consumer promotions.","On Fiber One snack bars, we\u2019ll leverage our diet season playbook to reach consumers who are looking for an indulgence that doesn\u2019t break their New Year\u2019s resolution.","In our Asia and Latin American segment, second quarter organic sales matched year ago levels with growth in Asian markets offset by declines in our Latin American markets.","In China, we had our strongest H\u00e4agen-Daz mooncake season in four years behind new flavors and improve marketing. Our Wanchai Ferry business strengthened behind our innovation and marketing of our core shrimp dumpling line and we continue to expand distribution for Yoplait yogurt.","We also posted excellent growth on our snacking platform in India and the Middle East. While our Latin America business improved from the first quarter, net sales were still below last year due to continued challenges related to our enterprise reporting system integration in Brazil, as well as the impact of natural disasters in the Caribbean and Mexico.","Segment operating profit decreased to $17 million in the quarter, compared to $29 million a year ago, reflecting currency driven inflation on imported products and increased media and advertising expense.","We have an exciting lineup of news planned across Asia in the second-half of this year. There is strong demand for premium yogurt in China, so we\u2019re expanding our pro-delay line with two new flavors created specifically for our Chinese Yoplait consumers, Mochi green tea and red bean, and we\u2019ll have more news to share on pro-delay innovation in coming months.","For H\u00e4agen-Daz, we\u2019re introducing two new flavors at our limited edition fruit and flower line. We\u2019re continuing to rollout sour new global packaging design and we\u2019re launching new green tea and red bean flavors on our popular H\u00e4agen-Daz Mochi line.","In addition, we have some important snack bar launches across the segment, including new Pillsbury pastry cakes in India and Nature Valley crunchy single bars across Asia, which better aligned with Asian consumers preferred sizing and price point expectations.","Before I close, I wanted to provide a brief update on the four key growth priorities for fiscal 2018 that we outlined back in July. First, our momentum is building on Cereal, and I like our chances to grow Cereal globally, including CPW this year.","Second, while there\u2019s still work to do, we\u2019ve made significant progress on improving our U.S. Yogurt business through Innovation, thanks to the great success of Wii and Yoplait Mix-Ins.","Third, we\u2019re shifting resources towards our differential growth platforms. As Don mentioned, we\u2019ve added investment on these platforms this year to accelerated growth \u2013 to accelerate growth in fiscal 2018.","And fourth, we\u2019re in the zone for soup and baking seasons and we expect our performances on those businesses will be much improved versus last year.","With that, let me summarize today\u2019s key messages. We delivered high-quality, broad-based improvement and our net sales performance this quarter with organic sales growth in absolute across all four operating segments. We drove sequential improvement and operating profit in the second quarter, and we have clear plans in place to deliver profit growth in the back-half of this year.","And with six months in the books and visibility to the impact of those second-half plans, we\u2019re raising our 2018 organic net sales guidance and maintaining our outlook for total segment operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS.","Now, we\u2019ll open up the call for questions. Operator, will you please get us started?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] One moment please for the first question. And our first question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please proceed.","Christopher Growe","Hi, good morning.","Jeffrey Harmening","Good morning, Chris.","Jonathon Nudi","Good morning, Chris.","Donal Mulligan","Good morning, Chris.","Christopher Growe","Good morning. So I just had a question for you in relation to this pretty significant shift you\u2019re going to see in margin for the second-half of the year, and you\u2019ve got a pretty significant improvement built in. You obviously have some trade phasing benefit coming in later in the year \u2013 sorry, the trade accounting benefit. But your trade, I think, you said we\u2019re higher in the third quarter.","I know that cost savings are picking up, inflation is coming down. When I put it all together, I\u2019m trying to understand, especially into the third quarter how that gross margin is going to pick up significantly, or should be more fourth quarter weighted. And then overall for the year, as you think about the gross margin, how much could that be down? Are you giving any kind of color around the amount of gross margin decline for the year?","Donal Mulligan","Sure. Okay, Chris. This is Don. A lot of questions rolled into that. But I\u2019ll try to answer. If I don\u2019t, let me know. So first off on gross margin, as I said in the second quarter, the operating margin [Technical Difficulty] including transaction FX, unfavorable trade-phasing and incredible into the accounting behindthat last quarter, so I won\u2019t go through that again, but that will \u2013 that impacted this quarter as we expected. Again charge seasonal merchandising and we had increased media expenses and that was partially offset by costs.","If you look at the back-half, we expect again the same thing from the low 17% that we saw in the first-half more than 18% in the second-half. The primary drivers are going to be positive price mix on all four segments, and that\u2019s driven our reported results by trade-phasing reversing, improved sales mix and pricing as we mentioned in certain geographies.","Our cost savings will accelerate as those \u2013 as our sourcing initiatives ramps up. And input cost inflation will moderate pursuing up slightly for the full-year was higher than we expected, but will moderate in the second-half after keeping in the second quarter. Those are the drivers.","You see, your question on the phasing, we\u2019ll take more in the fourth quarter. And the reason for that is that the merchandising activity obviously carries through the third quarter. As I mentioned, the global sourcing savings ramp up in the fourth quarter. The largest impact that once we start again the year was it our incentive through up. We began producing our incentive accrual last year, primarily in the third quarter.","So we\u2019ll see that impact that year-over-year impact drag in the third quarter will limit the growth in margins. And then in the below the line, the other item is that where I think about EPS is metrics. It\u2019s actually \u2013 we have negative comp in Q3 and positive in Q4. There\u2019s a number of factors that we\u2019ll see the margin in the fourth quarter and the one tax item that we\u2019ll see the EPS for the fourth quarter.","Christopher Growe","Okay. That was helpful. Sorry, so just a quick follow-up and it would be in relation, so you\u2019ve had a couple of food industry competitors here down some larger-scale acquisitions recently. And it seems like they\u2019re really heavily focused on growth of these acquisitions. I\u2019m just curious, you\u2019re very internally focused right now. You\u2019ve got a lot going on in General Mills. Is that these acquisitions that would be of interest to you? I mean, more from a high-level growth-oriented acquisitions, or maybe you could comment perhaps on your pipeline of acquisitions or how you\u2019re looking at that today for General Mills?","Jeffrey Harmening","Yes. So, Chris, this is Jeff Harmening. The \u2013 what I would say is that, first, we don\u2019t feel pressure to do M&A just because all the other kids are doing it. So and we don\u2019t really think that, that scale for the sake of scale is what\u2019s important. And we think that having leading positions and good categories is really what drives growth.","Having said that, what I will say is that a couple of things. One is that, M&A is part of our growth strategy. The first piece and most important piece of that is being competitive in the markets we currently compete in. The second piece is an accelerating in some certain categories. And then the third piece is M&A itself.","So we think M&A has a role in our growth strategy going forward, but is one of three pieces. The most important in the foundation of being, which is being competitive in our own categories.","To that extent, what I will also tell you is that, I\u2019d say, we\u2019re increasingly confident in our ability to execute M&A as part of this broader growth strategy and really for three reasons. The first is that, we\u2019re increasingly confident in execution on our base business. And internally, here we talk about that all the time that being competitive where we are kind of gives us a better foundation to build upon whether that\u2019s accelerating in other categories or whether that\u2019s M&A. So we feel increasingly confident about that as hopefully the second quarter results start to show.","The second is that, whether it\u2019s Annie\u2019s or Apec or Carolina yogurt business, which we\u2019ve acquired recently. One of the things we feel good about is that, we have demonstrated our ability to grow businesses. And in the case of Annie\u2019s, we\u2019ve actually accelerated that growth.","And we\u2019ve been able to use our internal capabilities effectively in order to do that. And so we feel good about our base business. We feel that \u2013 we feel good about our ability to grow businesses. And with a lot of our restructuring behind us, we\u2019re \u2013 we feel like our ability to integrate businesses will certainly be improved.","And then third, look, we have the financial capacity to execute against M&A. Our cash flows are really good. Don and his finance team have done a really nice job with working capital. And to the extent, we can grow our profitability in the back-half of the year, which we feel good about. We\u2019ve got good cash flow.","So we feel good about our base business, increasingly good and our ability to execute that. We feel good that we\u2019ve been able to grow businesses \u2013 growth businesses and we have the capacity. So, M&A will be an important component of our growth, but it\u2019s only one of the three.","Christopher Growe","Okay. Well, thank you and happy holidays.","Jeffrey Harmening","Happy holidays. Thanks, Chris.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner from Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","John Baumgartner","Good morning. Thanks for the question.","Jeffrey Harmening","Hey, John.","John Baumgartner","Jon, I\u2019m curious, there\u2019s some concern circulating about retailers scaling back to center store to make room for the parameter and then just downward pressure on pricing from suppliers in general. But from your commentary, it doesn\u2019t sound as though, you\u2019re expecting an impact from Mills. So could you speak a bit to the broader retailing environment, how you\u2019re seeing retailers responding to your initiatives?. And in terms of just new shelf base and merchandising and also how you\u2019re comfortable that margins won\u2019t deteriorate further relative to the guide?","Jonathon Nudi","Yes, sure. Thanks, John. I\u2019ll give you \u2013 try to answer as many of those questions I can as a lot rolled up there. Clearly, it\u2019s a competitive environment right now as new players entered the U.S. as emerging channels like e-commerce come on to the scene. So definitely, it\u2019s competitive both on the retailer side, as well as the manufacturer side.","What I can tell you is, I feel really good about our ability to compete in this environment. Where we\u2019re big in the U.S., we\u2019re one of the top food companies. We have scale across center store, refrigerated and frozen. And as we grow the categories of our retailers growth, so again, it\u2019s important that we have good plans locked in with our retailers.","In addition to that, we\u2019ve got one of the best sales forces as ranked by Cantor in the industry. They\u2019re doing a great job of really sitting down with the retailers and putting together joint business plans. And what we find with those joint business plans is trade-offs. And again, even across a retailer, we might give a bit one category to get something in return in another. But by applying our scale, and again, if we\u2019re growing broadly, that\u2019s really good for our retailers category. We\u2019re finding a way to get to win-win solution.","So, again, there\u2019s a lot going on. And certainly, space optimization, that\u2019s something that we\u2019re seeing as well. What I\u2019d tell you there is, we have some businesses that are going to win in that. So we have a broad snacking portfolio, which will likely win in that environment in addition to that natural organic\u2019s core strength of ours as well with the third largest national organic player in the country, so that\u2019s good. And in the categories that might contract.","What we tend to see is that, the smaller manufacturers the third or fourth or fifth players tend to be the ones that lose. And when you look at our business in the U.S., 80% of our brands are the number one or number two in their category. So it\u2019s tough out there for sure. But at the same time, I actually feel like, we\u2019re in a place now that we can be advantaged and really win in this marketplace.","John Baumgartner","Great. Thanks, Jon.","Jonathon Nudi","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Kenneth Goldman","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Jeffrey Harmening","Hi, Ken.","Donal Mulligan","Hi, Ken.","Kenneth Goldman","I just wanted to get, Don, appreciate the \u2013 you gave it already, I think healthy list of reasons why the second-half will get better in terms of the growth, both especially on the bottom line. But I think what might help is, if you get a little sense maybe of, which of those factors will be the most critically important as we think about modeling the business, because one of the questions I\u2019ve been getting this morning and I have it myself is, you\u2019re talking about better price mix. Obviously, some of that is trade accrual phasing. You\u2019re talking about less cost inflation, cost inflation innovation.","Just trying to get a sense of really where the key, I guess, pivot points are that\u2019s going to make or break the year, because in modeling it, I don\u2019t know, if we necessarily have enough information to sort of say, all right, this is what really needs to have happened for this company to make it. So I\u2019m just trying to get a sense if you had a sort of bucket or rank them how you would do that in terms of the factors helping the second-half?","Jeffrey Harmening","Yes, sure. They\u2019re really are in the order now listen. The major piece is going to be the price mix. And probably half of that is going to be from the reversal and the trade accrual. And as we said in the first quarter, that was about 100 basis point drag, it was close to that in the second quarter that will start reversing in the second-half.","And then on top of that, we expect improved sales mix in the second-half, given the businesses that will drive our growth and pricing in certain geographies, obviously, across the emerging markets a little bit in the UK as we battle the transaction FX. So that will be the largest driver.","Second will be the cost savings acceleration that we see in global sourcing. Again, that\u2019s going to be largely in the fourth quarter. And then the third and the smallest bit will be the input cost moderation.","Kenneth Goldman","Okay, thank you for that. And then just a quick follow-up, just so we said expectations, I think, at a reasonable level. Can you give us any sense of all? And I really do appreciate you guys talking about just being more fourth quarter loaded than third quarter. But are we talking about EPS potentially being flat in the third quarter year-on-year, or do you still expect them to be up to some degree based on what you\u2019re seeing right now?","Donal Mulligan","We still said growth in the third quarter, but the majority of the growth was going to be in the fourth quarter.","Kenneth Goldman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Matthew Grainger","Hi, good morning, everybody. I wanted to ask first on, I guess, about the open question on the proposed tax legislation. And I know there\u2019s probably going to be a hesitancy to give formal comments before everything is set in stone. But can you give us any sense assuming it passes in its current form 21%, where the consolidated tax rate for the company would go. And how we should think about the flow through of that to the bottom line in the second-half and in 2018,maybe just in generality if not in absolute?","And I guess, secondarily, just to the extent that you can talk about this on a forward-looking basis, do you see that having any impact on the promotional equilibrium in the industry? How do you think about the ways that cash flow may be or that earnings flexibility might be reinvested?","Donal Mulligan","Well, I guess, I\u2019ll start by just saying that, we think it\u2019s important for U.S. businesses to be \u2013 to not to be competitively disadvantage globally relative to our foreign competitor. So lower corporate tax rate as the current legislation in visions certainly make the U.S. a more attractive place to invest. The territorial system makes U.S.-based corporations more competitive, because we have reduced global tax burden, and obviously, we have increased access to our cash from foreign earnings. So that\u2019s the positive.","Based on the current legislation, clearly, it\u2019s still a moving target. Even just last night, I said, I made some changes, the house now has to revote on. The bottom lime, we\u2019ll see a reduction in our effective tax rate. But, Matt, frankly, these have timing of it and the magnitude of it, will have to determined once you see the final bill. It will be favorable, but however phase-in 2018 versus 2019 in the absolute magnitude, we will have to come back to you on once we actually digest the entire bill, and we\u2019ll do that in due course once that\u2019s available to us.","Matthew Grainger","Okay, understood. And I guess, just one question from a sort of a category \u2013 from a category standpoint. I guess, just your thoughts on the health of the cereal category in the U.S. at the moment. I know you\u2019re gaining share. You saw strong sales delivery here in the quarter. But overall, when we look at the scanner data, the category still declining 2% to 3%, it looks like promotional levels are up year-on-year, although I know that can sometimes be misleading. I guess, are you happy with where the category is at the moment? And do you think anything needs to change there to ensure that the growth you\u2019re seeing right now is going to be more sustainable?","Jonathon Nudi","Yes. Sure, Matthew, this is Jon. What I can tell you is that, we really like the way that we\u2019re competing in the cereal category right now. When you look at our performance through the first-half, our change in trend is pretty significant and nearly 70% of that change is from baseline sales. So, again, it\u2019s really better innovation and better marketing that\u2019s driving our results in the category, and that\u2019s really been the recipe for success in the category over the long-term.","So we\u2019re very committed to, again, continue to build strong brands and then innovate more aggressively and we feel really good about the pipeline as we look forward. As you think about the category, it\u2019s still a big category, important category is the fourth largest class across grocery. And we believe and it\u2019s highly penetrated 90% of households consume cereal.","So we really believe in the category. We think there\u2019s growth ahead. There are some interesting timing of things. So again, if you think about the category grew nicely during the financial downturn. So between 2007 and 2012, the category grew. As the economy gradually got better and out of home eating increased, we saw the category tip the negative.","So we\u2019re starting to see that moderate in terms of the in-home versus out-of-home. We also know that, 30% of consumption of the category comes from boomers and older adults and that group of consumers are going to grow. So we absolutely believe in the category. We believe that strong marketing and good innovation can drive it. We\u2019re committed to doing our part and we look forward to again driving our growth as we move to the back-half and into the future.","Matthew Grainger","Okay, great, Thanks and happy holidays, everyone.","Jeffrey Harmening","You too.","Jonathon Nudi","You too.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi. Please proceed.","David Driscoll","Great. Thanks a lot and good morning, everybody.","Jeffrey Harmening","Hi, David.","David Driscoll","Wanted to follow-up, Jon, on refrigerated dough. So can you \u2013 you touched on it in your prepared comments, but can you just talk a little bit more about the trends and how stage is. And I\u2019m kind of curious why fields aren\u2019t a bit stronger there, that\u2019s such a dominant franchise and comping against a reasonably weak year-ago period? Do you expect refrigerated dough to see material improvement in the remainder of the winter season? And kind of what would give you confidence, if that would be true?","Jeffrey Harmening","Hey, David, good question. Obviously, a big important category for us. And as I mentioned, we got off to a bit of a slower start than we had hoped. We are seeing improvement for sure. I would say two things drove this slower start. One was a distribution built a bit slower than we had planned as we came to the key season. What I can tell you is, distribution is getting to our projected levels as we are really entering December and January here. The second thing is, we missed a promotional window at a major retailer in October. And as a result of that, that really impacted our performance there.","As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we grew in November, which is great and we\u2019re seeing some positive things so far in December. So we are still confident that we\u2019re going to deliver a much improved year in refrigerated bake goods. We believe that we\u2019re tending in the right direction.","David Driscoll","Thank you. And then two follow ups. One on cereal, and I\u2019m just specifically interested in the shift in versus sell-through second quarter impact, and then what it means to the third quarter? So given our plus seven in the second quarter, are we going to have a negative in the third quarter simply because of the timing issues between 2Q and 3Q, as it outlined?","And then I had a \u2013 just a follow on tax question for you, Don. Maybe you don\u2019t have all the quantifications on, which is understandable. But I think, we\u2019re all just curious what the company would do with that money higher capital spending, dividends, share repurchase, just what you do with kind of found money of this magnitude? Thank you.","Jeffrey Harmening","Hi, David, I\u2019ll quickly take the cereal question. I mean, the short answer is, we don\u2019t expect a knock-on effect in Q3. If you look at the \u2013 first of all, if you look to the first-half, our end market movement our RNS is almost perfectly aligned. So, again, it\u2019s where we expected to be.","There were some quarterly shifts, so the biggest drivers in the RNS versus movement difference in Q2 was first non-measured channels continue to grow nicely and that\u2019s a piece of it. We ship Chocolate Peanut Butter Cheerios in October, and that\u2019s off to a great start, as I mentioned, all of that hasn\u2019t moved through the register. And actually, at the beginning of the quarter, we had some impact due to the hurricanes.","If you remember, in August, the hurricane hit Texas. And as a result, due to some supply chain interruptions, we felt pipeline in September that likely would have shipped in August. So, again, we feel really good about how we\u2019re performing in cereal and expect normal movement in RNS as we move to the back-half of the year.","Donal Mulligan","Yeah, on the tax front, as we see with any increase in earnings, we\u2019ll evaluate several uses. We\u2019ll look at brand investment, look at capital investment, look at M&A and clearly cash return to shareholders. Our long-term expectations on how we\u2019re going to drive the business haven\u2019t changed.","David Driscoll","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge Research. Please proceed.","Jonathan Feeney","Good morning. Thanks so much, and happy holidays.","Jeffrey Harmening","Good morning.","Jonathan Feeney","I had \u2013 good morning. I had a couple of questions. First, I know when you think about U.S. retail specifically, can you comment at all about \u2013 anything standout to you as far as pockets of success by channel like mass versus traditional or not necessarily in absolute, but say relative to the competition. I know you mentioned e-commerce, but any sort of like takes where, wow, this is really working, it\u2019s really coming together in a particular channel?","And secondly, and maybe related, there has been \u2013 can \u2013 there has been a fair amount of the data we see and what you report to us this morning share gain across a lot of few different categories. Can you comment on the \u2013 you mentioned the competitive environment, but specifically, that share gain this year right now at a time when everyone is looking for the same thing. Can you comment about your take on potential competitive responses in 2018 and how you\u2019re set up for that? Thanks.","Jonathon Nudi","Sure, sure. This is Jon. So a couple of things. One, we really like the way we\u2019re competing across categories. And again, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we\u2019re seeing broad-based improvement across the majority of our categories and we like the way we\u2019re competing across channels. It\u2019s really is broad-based better as well. We feel like we\u2019re winning in the majority of our channels, so that feels really good.","As we think about share, again, the thing that gives us good confidence that we\u2019re heading in the right direction here is the majority of our change and improvement in trend is really coming from baseline sales. So, again, across total U.S. retail, 75% of our improvement is via baseline sales. So it\u2019s really not a case of merchandising driving the bulk of our improvement, so it\u2019s better marketing.","And as I mentioned in my remarks, we made a pretty major change last year shifting long relationships with advertising agencies moving to some new ones and we really like that trend that we see in market and we know that is driving our business and our baselines and our innovations are better, it\u2019s up 50% year-over-year. And I can tell you that\u2019s actually off the same number of items. So, again, it\u2019s not turning much stuff out there, it\u2019s actually better quality.","So we\u2019re really focused on competing. We\u2019re focused on the fundamentals. And we believe that if we continue to do that, we can continue to see broad-based wins across our business.","Jonathan Feeney","Great. Great, Jon. Any comment about channel at all, like particularly successes that you had?","Jonathon Nudi","Again, we feel good generally across the majority of the channels. And again, without calling off specific customers, there\u2019s this puts and takes. But the reality is, we\u2019re growing share across all channels. And I think for us right now, that\u2019s the focus to compete wherever we are. So I\u2019m not going to \u2013 there\u2019s not one that jumps out of me. Again, we feel really good about how we\u2019re trending in all of them.","Jeffrey Harmening","And to build on Jon\u2019s point to broaden that from the U.S. to more broadly globally, one of the things we\u2019re most pleased with for the quarter in general is just the breadth of our growth. And so whether you look across product categories in the U.S., we improved. If you look across channels in the U.S., we improved. If you look across channels more broadly like Convenience Stores and Foodservice, we improved. If you look at Europe, we improved. If you look at Asia, we improved.","And so, the \u2013 for us means, Jon answered the question for the U.S. But I would say, more broadly as a company, one of the things we\u2019re most pleased about with the quarter that we hope to continue and that we plan to continue is just the breadth of the improvement that we have seen, and that\u2019s geographic improvement in channel, as well as product line.","Jonathan Feeney","Well, thanks very much. And any of you have spare room for the Super Bowl? Don\u2019t be shy, I\u2019m an excellent house guest. You know how to reach me.","Jeffrey Harmening","Exactly.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Akshay Jagdale","Hi, good morning. Thank you for the question. I wanted to ask about the innovation momentum. So can you comment on the yogurt that we launch. You mentioned, it\u2019s obviously the best the category it seems. But what\u2019s the endgame there, if you can help us sort of size that opportunity. And more importantly, like what is that \u2013 you or your organization that you can apply to other franchises and when should we potentially expect some of that, meaning, more sort big bet innovation across your other franchises? Thank you.","Jonathon Nudi","You\u2019re welcome. So this is Jon. I\u2019ll give you a few thoughts on Wii. So, again, we\u2019re really pleased with the results there. It\u2019s about 1.5 share of the category already. We expect that to continue to increase. And for year one, again, we expect this to be in north of $100 million in sales. So, again, it\u2019s off to a terrific start. We\u2019re seeing really good repeat rates and consumers are telling us that they view us very, very unique.","In terms of how we got there, I\u2019m really proud of we. And again, let me just start by saying, we know there\u2019s a lot more work to be done in yogurt. So we\u2019re not taking any victory laps in that category, to be clear. But I like the way that, that seems really operating.","They\u2019re focused on playing our game and then looking for opportunities and segments that are going to be growing in the future and bringing fundamental innovation. And we did it in a really scrappy way, innovating quickly and closely with consumers is truly is consumer-first innovation. And by being in market and iterating over time, we\u2019ve got to a product that we know really resonates with consumers really works hard.","So the actual process that we used to create, we were actually moving across overall use in the U.S., really around the world to make sure that we move more quickly and make sure that we\u2019re connected as closely to the consumer as we can. And we believe that\u2019s going to help our pipeline as we move forward and make our innovation even more impactful.","Jeffrey Harmening","And to build on Jon\u2019s point, one of the things I\u2019m really pleased about is, as I look across our organization and how we\u2019re working differently now is that, Wii is a great example of something as simple ingredients and great tasting. Well, we use that same kind of thought in the UK and in France, and it didn\u2019t happen to be Wii, but the same consumer insight drove Liberte taste success in the UK and Triple Sensation success in France.","So as an organization, we\u2019re getting better, much better and much faster, sharing insights across geographies. And I\u2019m really proud of the UK team, for example, for taking Liberte, which has been so successful in Canada and and not trying to do anything different than what was done in Canada and applying that to the UK and growing it by 25%.","And so I\u2019m pleased with our team here in the U.S. on yogurt and we see improvement broadly in our yogurt business across the globe. And I\u2019m also pleased with how we\u2019re working differently, whether that\u2019s the specifics to the launch of we here in the U.S. or how we\u2019re sharing ideas more broadly and quickly globally.","Akshay Jagdale","So just two quick follow-up. So when do you think we\u2019ll start to see a broader impact on your top line growth as you\u2019re sharing these ideas, right, whether it\u2019s globalization or just innovation being the bigger piece of the top line? I mean, it\u2019s already better, but should we expect that to accelerate, and when might that happen?","Donal Mulligan","Well, obviously, look, I think you\u2019re already seeing it in this quarter. I mean, we cut our losses on yogurt. Our declines on yogurt in the U.S. in half behind innovation. And we hope to get the single-digit losses and plan to get the single-digit losses in the U.S. in the back-half of the year. We\u2019re down less than 1% on yogurt in Europe this quarter, so this was one of the best quarters we\u2019ve had behind new innovation. So to be honest with you, I think, you\u2019re starting to see it already, and we\u2019ve got a team that\u2019s dedicated to continuing that, whether it\u2019s on yogurt or on H\u00e4agen-Dazs or on Old El Paso and on snack bars.","If you look at the second-half of the year, one of the things I mentioned in my remarks was that, you\u2019ll see Nature Valley in Asia and are expanding Nature Valley in Asia and that\u2019s based on success we saw in Europe and obviously the success we\u2019re having in the U.S., but applying it to Asia consumers in a slightly different format that works for them. And so, honestly, I think you\u2019re starting to see it now and our plan is to continue that.","Akshay Jagdale","Perfect. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thank you. Happy holidays.","Donal Mulligan","Happy holidays.","Jeffrey Harmening","You too. Operator, I think we have probably time for just one more unfortunately.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Steven Strycula with UBS. Please proceed.","Steven Strycula","Hi, guys, good morning. Two-part question. For the first part, just want to get a sense of, I think, Ken was asking about it earlier, but the absolute gross margin magnitude of pressure that we\u2019re seeing for the full-year obviously gets better in the second-half. But is it a fair way to think about it down 50 basis points for the year? That\u2019s my first part.","Donal Mulligan","Well, let me focus on operating margins and it\u2019s actually kind of what we\u2019ve been giving guidance on. And I mentioned the factors that will drive it inflation is going to run higher than we \u2013 slightly higher than we expected in transaction FX and work against this. We\u2019ve added some investment in accelerators to drive growth, the top line of which will come through next year, but we\u2019re encouraging cost this year to make that happen. And then I mentioned just the kind of the nature of our transaction FX, which is helping the top line more than SOP or more than the operating profit.","And just to put it \u2013 just to mention that, we were talking about a swing here of maybe 50 basis points. We will still be in the zone of 18% operating margins for the full-year. So we correct that level last year and that\u2019s still remains 200 basis points above where we were three years ago. So just kind of in the order of magnitude, that\u2019s where we were going to land for the year.","Jeffrey Harmening","And, Steve, this is Jeff. I don\u2019t think gross margin, we don\u2019t expect to have material difference in gross margin trends versus operating margin trends. So I think, the drivers are very similar.","Steven Strycula","Okay, thanks. That\u2019s really helpful. And then just a question for Jon, just on the soup business. Want to get a sense and there has been a little bit of shuffling of the deck in the category of \u2013 for the soup season this year. Just wanted to think about how you think about the health of the overall category, total shelving displays, not just specific to you, but the category in general? And then how do we think about, given some of the decisions that were made in third quarter, are you seeing that \u2013 obviously progress is doing better, but do you think that the category is maintaining its momentum and what stopped it from necessarily being a bit back of the business next year? Thank you.","Jonathon Nudi","Sure, Steve. The categories through key season is growing, so that\u2019s good overall. And, again, for the rest of the strong share, which we like. Similar to some of the other businesses what we really like that 80% of our improvement in trend in soup is actually coming from baseline sales. So, again, it\u2019s fundamentals, it\u2019s good marketing.","Now we\u2019ve got a little bit of innovation with the progress of organics, it\u2019s working for us as well. So, again, like many of the other categories, it\u2019s about fundamentals and competing well. And if we do that, we think that we can be successful and drive the category. And again, through key season, we\u2019re seeing the category grow and it appears to be healthy and we\u2019re having good constructive conversations with the retailers around it. So we\u2019d expect continued growth through the back-half of the year.","Steven Strycula","Okay, great. Thanks, guys.","Jeffrey Harmening","All right. And Sara, thanks. Unfortunately, I know we didn\u2019t get to everybody today. I know there are a few people probably still hoping to get a call \u2013 question in. So I\u2019m on the phone all day, please feel free to reach out and connect on any question from here on out. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect your lines."],"9824":["General Mills (NYSE:GIS) F4Q13 Earnings Call June 26, 2013  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Kris Wenker - VP, Investor Relations","Don Mulligan - CFO","Ken Powell - Chairman and CEO","Analysts","Chris Growe - Stifel","Andrew Lazar - Barclays","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","David Palmer - UBS","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies","Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein","David Driscoll - Citigroup","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","Operator","Welcome to the General Mills F13 Q4 year-end earnings release conference call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, June 26, 2013. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kris Wenker, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Kris Wenker","Thanks, operator. Good morning everybody. I'm here with Ken Powell, our chairman and CEO, and Don Mulligan, our CFO. And I\u2019ll turn the microphone over them in just a minute, but first, let me cover my usual housekeeping items.","Our press release was issued over the wire services earlier this morning. It's also posted on our website, if you still need a copy. We've posted slides on the website, also. They supplement our prepared remarks this morning. And our remarks will include forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions. The second slide in today's materials lists factors that could cause future results to be different than our current estimates.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Don.","Don Mulligan","Thanks, Kris, and hello, everyone. We appreciate your interest in General Mills today. As you\u2019ve seen from this morning\u2019s press release, net sales in the final quarter of 2013 grew at a high single-digit rate up 8% to exceed $4.4 billion. That includes 7 points of growth from new businesses.","Segment operating profit of $722 million was 2% below year ago results that grew 9%. Net earnings attributable to General Mills and diluted earnings per share both grew at a double digit rate, primarily due to lower restructuring expense this year. Adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes restructuring and certain other items affecting comparability, declined 12% to $0.53 per share.","Slide five gives you the components of our fourth quarter sales growth. Volume was up 11%, including strong contributions from the recently added Yoki and Yoplait international businesses. Price and mix reduced sales growth by 1 point in the quarter, and foreign exchange subtracted 2 points of growth.","Slide six shows the gross margin, excluding mark-to-market effects, declined in the fourth quarter as expected. This reflects the factors we discussed on our last call, namely that our fourth quarter input costs were above year ago levels, and so was our in-store merchandising activity.","For 2013, in total, underlying gross margin was down 80 basis points to 36.1%. This was entirely driven by the change in our business mix, primarily the additions of Yoki and Yoplait Canada.","Slide seven summarizes a few other items of note to the fourth quarter. Advertising and media expense increased 5%. Corporate unallocated expense, excluding mark-to-market effects, totaled $115 million. That\u2019s above last year\u2019s fourth quarter, due in part to a $40 million annual increase in pension expense this year.","Our fourth quarter tax rate was 31.5% as reported, including several discrete tax items that have been excluded from our calculation of adjusted diluted EPS. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, the fourth quarter tax rate was 35.1% this year, compared to 31.1% a year ago. Remember that last year\u2019s fourth quarter rate was the lowest of the year. For the full year, our underlying tax rate matched last year\u2019s 32.4%.","One final item of note to the fourth quarter. Historically, many of our international operations have been consolidated at a one-month lag to our fiscal year. We have a long term project underway to align all of our international operations on our corporate fiscal reporting period. As part of that effort, fiscal 2013 includes 13 months of results for our Europe region. Last fiscal year\u2019s results included 13 months for our operations in greater China.","The extra period in each year does have some impact on fourth quarter sales growth rates for our Europe and Asia-Pacific regions. However, there was no material impact on the total international segment results or on overall company sales and operating profits for fiscal 2013.","The full year results are summarized on slide eight. Net sales for 2013 grew 7% to reach $17.8 billion. New businesses contributed 6 points of that growth. Sales at our base business increased 2%, before a 1-point drag from foreign exchange.","Segment operating profit increased 6% to reach $3.2 billion, net earnings and diluted EPS grew at double digit rates, and adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes restructuring costs. Mark-to-market effects and certain other items affecting comparability, grew 5% to reach $2.69 per share. That\u2019s a bit above the $2.65 target we set at the beginning of the year.","Now let me give you a quick summary of how our three operating segments finished 2013. For our U.S. retail segment, net sales grew 1% to $10.6 billion. And operating profit increased 4% to $2.4 billion.","On slide nine, you can see U.S. retail sales split by our new marketing division structure we adopted at the start of the fiscal year. Sales for our Big G cereals, frozen food, and Yoplait declined for the year, while baking products, snacks, meals, and Small Planet Food divisions posted sales gains.","Consumer takeaway trends in the fourth quarter saw sequential improvement as we can see on slide 10. Our increased merchandising activity in the quarter helped drive retail consumer sales growth for a number of key product lines and even stronger unit volume gains across our U.S. portfolio. So we exited 2013 with better momentum in this business segment.","For our bakeries and food service segment, net sales declined slightly in 2013, reflecting a 1% decline in pound volume. But operating profit rose at a double digit rate to $315 million, a new record. And segment operating margin expanded 160 basis points to 16.1%. This good performance reflects our ongoing strategy of focusing on key branded product lines and the most resilient customer channels.","2013 net sales for our international business segment grew 24% to reach $5.2 billion. This reflects mid single digit growth in base business net sales and strong contributions from Yoki and Yoplait International. Operating profit rose 14% to $490 million. That\u2019s despite the Venezuela currency devaluation and the one-time costs associated with transition of the Yoplait Yogurt license in Canada. If these items are excluded, our consolidated international operating profit would have increased 24%, in line with sales growth.","On slide 12, you can see our international sales, split by geographic region. Canada sales rose 22% to $1.2 billion, reflecting low single digit growth in base business net sales and the addition of Yoplait. Latin America sales more than doubled to $876 million as we added Yoki.","Our sales in the Europe region grew 11% to exceed $2.2 billion. This includes low single digit business net sales growth, two incremental months of Yoplait results, and one extra month of base business results, as I mentioned earlier. In the Asia-Pacific region, sales grew 11% to $900 million. That\u2019s despite lapping the extra period last year for greater China. On a constant currency basis, our total international segment sales grew 28%. Today\u2019s press release includes constant currency sales growth by region.","Slide 13 summarizes 2013 joint venture performance. Net sales for cereal partners worldwide rose 2% on a constant currency basis, and constant currency sales for Haagen Dazs Japan grew 5%. After tax earnings from joint venture grew 12%, to reach nearly $100 million. And dividends received from the joint venture, net of advances made to them, totaled $79 million in 2013.","Turning to the balance sheet, slide 14 shows the components of core working capital. In a year where net sales increased 7%, our core working capital declined 5%, reflecting our focus on extending payables terms.","Cash flow from operations totaled $2.9 billion for the year, a robust 22% increase versus last year. And that\u2019s net of a $200 million voluntary contribution to our pension plans. This strong cash flow funded $614 million in capital spending. That\u2019s a bit below our original estimate for the year, primarily due to changes in project timing.","And we returned $1.9 billion of cash to shareholders through stock buyback activity and an 8% dividend increase. We bought back 24 million shares during the year at an average price of roughly $42 per share.","In addition, we funded strategic investments in new businesses. Debt increased a bit this year due to those investments. However, we still received an upgrade from one of the primary debt rating agencies.","Turning to fiscal 2014, our plans call for another year of good sales and earnings growth for General Mills. We\u2019re targeting low single digit sales growth that includes volume and sales growth in our base business in three incremental months of Yoki and Yoplait Canada.","We\u2019re estimating input cost inflation of 3%. We expect our strong set of holistic margin management initiatives to offset this cost headwind. We expect segment operating profit to grow faster than sales.","Pension expense was a $0.06 per share headwind for us last year. As we look at 2014, pension expense will be a neutral factor. I can also report that our pension plans are in good shape. The return on plan assets was over 16% in 2013 and the funded status overall exceeds 94%.","Finally, I\u2019ll remind you that our 2014 plans call for increased cash returns to shareholders. We expect to generate strong operating cash flows again this year. We expect capital investments to total roughly $700 million. The resulting free cash flow will fund a 15% dividend increase, effective August 1, and share buybacks are designed to reduce diluted shares outstanding by a net 2%.","Slide 17 provides a summary of our earnings guidance for 2014. Our targeted sales growth is expected to push annual revenue above $18 billion. Underlying gross margin is projected to improve modestly from 2013 levels. We expect our media investment to grow in line with net sales. We project our operating profit will grow at a mid single digit rate. We\u2019re assuming an underlying tax rate comparable to last year\u2019s 32.4%.","We expect new venture earnings to grow at a mid single digit rate in constant currency, and be roughly comparable to this year\u2019s strong results on an as-reported basis. And we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to increase at a high single digit rate to a range of $2.87 to $2.90 per share.","We believe our operating plans for 2014 are quite strong. We have high levels of innovation planned across our portfolio. To tell you more about our plans for the new year, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ken.","Ken Powell","Thanks, Don, and good morning to one and all. So Don\u2019s just given you the key financial targets embedded in our 2014 plans. Our confidence in this year\u2019s plan is rooted in the strength of our product portfolio. As you know, we\u2019ve taken clear actions in recent years to focus and enhance our business mix.","Slide 19 provides our 2013 sales split by platform for our five global platforms, and for our additional businesses that are largely US-based. We compete in large, profitable food categories that are important to both retailers and consumers, and our brands hold leading positions in these categories.","Our global categories of ready-to-eat cereal, super-premium ice cream, convenient meals, wholesome snack bars, and yogurt are projected to grow at attractive rates in the years ahead. Innovation will be the key driver of this growth, and we\u2019ve got strong plans to do our part in fueling that category growth in 2014.","We\u2019ll share the details of those plans at our investor meeting on July 9, but let me give you some quick highlights of our first half innovation plans this morning, and I\u2019ll start with our cereal business.","After an extended period of sales and market share gains for our U.S. cereal business, we gave up a bit of ground in 2013. Category sales also declined modestly for the year. In 2014, we\u2019re bringing a stronger new product lineup, and stronger advertising to the cereal aisle, and we expect to generate annual sales growth for Big G.","Slide 21 shows just the new items we\u2019ll be launching in the first half. We\u2019ll have additional new items later in 2014. We\u2019ve also got significant ad campaigns behind several Big G stalwarts including Lucky Charms, Reese\u2019s Puffs, and the one and only Cheerios.","In Canada, we\u2019re expanding the Cheerios franchise with new Honey Nut Cheerios Hearty O Crunch. We\u2019re expanding the Fiber One franchise too, with an almond and cluster variety, and we\u2019re increasing the consumer marketing activity focused on the cholesterol lowering benefits of our whole grain oats cereals.","Our cereal partner worldwide also has a full slate of product news and marketing innovation planned this year, including new varieties of Fitness, Chocapic, and Nesquik. Add it all up, and we see excellent growth prospects for our global cereal business in 2014.","Let\u2019s turn to snacks, beginning with our wholesome snack bars business. We\u2019ve added nearly 10 points to our share of the $3 billion U.S. grain snacks category over the past five years, and we\u2019ve got a strong innovation lineup coming again in 2014.","This includes extensions of Fiber One protein bars and new lemon and coffee cake flavors of Fiber One 90-calorie bars. We\u2019re also expanding our Nature Valley franchise with two terrific new lines: soft baked oatmeal squares and Greek yogurt protein bars.","That\u2019s all in our U.S. retail business. Our bakeries and food service team sells a lot of snack bars in convenience stores too. We\u2019ve got several new items launching in this channel, including single-serve versions of our Nature Valley soft baked oatmeal squares and Betty Crocker brownies.","Beyond grain snacks, our new line of Green Giant vegetable snack chips is off to a great start. We launched the first flavors in January and will expand the line this summer. And in the freezer case, we\u2019ve got some new, bold flavors of Totino\u2019s pizza rolls.","And finally, we\u2019ve got some great new items for consumers interested in organic and natural snacks. Sales for our LARABAR all-natural fruit and nut bars continue to grow at a robust double digit rate. The newest addition to this line is ALT, a snack alternative that gets its high protein content from peas.","We\u2019re also expanding the Food Should Taste Good assortment, with two varieties of corn dipping chips. Outside the U.S., our Nature Valley and Fiber One snack bar lines continue to expand at a fast clip. Our 2014 plans include new flavors, new package sizes, and new points of distribution for these two powerful brand franchises.","Slide 27 shows a few of our new convenient meals items for 2014. Retail sales of Progresso soup increased 8% in 2013. We\u2019ll fuel that momentum with an assortment of great tasting new varieties. Every night, over 1 million U.S. families choose Hamburger, Chicken, or Tuna Helper for dinner, but this business has been languishing in recent years. We intend to renew Helper\u2019s growth in 2014 with a comprehensive marketing plan featuring new products, new packaging, and new advertising.","We\u2019re also introducing a completely new line of high quality frozen Old El Paso Mexican entrees. Outside the U.S., we\u2019ve got strong product news and innovation coming on our key Old El Paso and Wanchai Ferry lines. And in Brazil, we\u2019re launching a new line of dinner kits called Yoki [unintelligible].","For our Haagen Dazs ice cream business, fiscal 2014 is primed to be another strong growth year, fueled by a global advertising campaign featuring actor Bradley Cooper. This advertising just began airing in select international markets.","And finally, let\u2019s talk about yogurt. We\u2019ve got a tremendous amount of product innovation coming across our global yogurt business in 2014. In the U.S., we fell short of our goal to renew annual sales growth in 2013. However, we did post a modest increase for the fourth quarter of the year, and we intend to build on that momentum in 2014.","Our launch of Yoplait Greek 100 Calorie yogurt is a clear success. Year one retail sales for this product are expected to exceed $140 million. We\u2019re launching a multi-pack version and supporting the line with increased levels of advertising. We\u2019re launching a new full-calorie line of separated Yoplait Greek yogurt. This product\u2019s point of difference is its superior taste.","We\u2019ve got a new line of Yoplait Fruitful yogurt, a new high protein variety of Gogurt, and the continuing U.S. regional rollout of Liberte yogurt. So all of this should fuel U.S. yogurt growth this year.","And outside the U.S. our yogurt business is posting good sales and share increases in key markets. We\u2019re a leading player in the emerging Greek yogurt segment in Canada, the U.K., and France, with brands ranging from Liberte to Yoplait Yopa, to Yoplait Source. We\u2019re developing the reduced calorie segment in various global markets with Weight Watchers endorsed product lines.","Cal-in yogurt delivers the calcium and vitamin D that contribute to bone health, and we\u2019ve got a range of new yogurt items designed to appeal to kids and their moms. In short, we believe we\u2019ve got lots of ideas that will drive good growth for our brands and the global yogurt category in 2014.","In the U.S., we have one more product category I want to mention, and that\u2019s our baking products business. Our Pillsbury and Betty Crocker brands are the leading players in refrigerated dough and shelf-stable baking products, categories that generate a combined $4 billion in retail sales.","We\u2019ve just wrapped up a great fiscal 2013, with growth in volumes, sales, and profit. Our 2014 innovation efforts include the launch of a gluten-free line of refrigerated dough products, expanded distribution of the Immaculate Baking line, and some great new dessert mix items including a line featuring the irresistible taste of Hershey\u2019s chocolate.","So that\u2019s a few highlights from our innovation plan. It\u2019s a strong full year program. So we feel confident about our prospects for good top line growth in 2014.","We\u2019re expecting to combine that sales growth with margin expansion this year. Our schedule of HMM projects adds up to a strong level of cost savings, and we see the 3% input cost inflation in our plan as manageable. Remember too that some of the margin compression we\u2019ve seen in each of the last two years simply reflected changes in our business mix, particularly the additions of Yoplait International and Yoki. We\u2019ve largely integrated those businesses, and have already begun introducing HMM tools and other practices that drive efficiencies.","These factors all support our goal of growing operating profits faster than sales in 2014. We also expect to resume improvement in return on capital this year, following two years where strategic acquisitions interrupted our progress. Net earnings growth will be the primary driver of that ROC increase, but our discipline around working capital and uses of cash will also contribute to this objective.","So I\u2019ll wrap up this morning by summarizing the key points of our 2014 outlook. Our plans for this year add up to a healthy level of top and bottom line growth, fueled by robust innovation and marketing plans across our portfolio. We expect to couple sales and earnings growth with an increasing return on capital. We\u2019ve planned a strong level of cash returned to shareholders, and we look forward to talking more with you about these plans during our investor event two weeks from now.","So with that, we\u2019ll open the call for questions. Operator, please get us started.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Growe from Stifel. Please proceed.","Chris Growe - Stifel","I had two questions for you. Maybe the first one for Don. Is there anything unique to the year in terms of maybe the way the input cost inflation is flowing, or maybe the comparisons to fiscal 13, where you had a number of one-time items, like the Venezuelan bolivar devaluation. Just trying to get an understanding of the shaping of the earnings for the year and if there's any unique things that we should be aware of?","Don Mulligan","Yeah, we expect 3% for the year. It will be a little heavier in the front part of the year as we phase it through, as we come through some of the costs you saw in our fourth quarter in Q4. So as you model it, think about a little bit heavier inflation in the front half than the back half. But importantly, think inflation, not deflation, throughout the year. But a little heavier in the front half.","Chris Growe - Stifel ","Is there a certain amount of hedging you have in place now in the input cost inflation, Don?","Don Mulligan","Yeah, we\u2019re about 45% covered, which is a typical spot for us to be at this point in the year. So we have pretty good visibility, particularly the front half.","Chris Growe - Stifel ","My second question was on Yoplait, in the U.S. in particular. You had another year of sales being down. And I just want to be clear on, as you look at the new product pipeline, your core cup performance, maybe some marketing increasing? I\u2019m just trying to get an understanding of your expectations for your performance with Yoplait in fiscal \u201914. Do you expect sales growth? And how do you rate the new products this year versus last year?","Ken Powell ","We do expect sales growth in 2014, and that\u2019s built around a couple of pillars. First of all, we did see the churns on our core cup business strengthen considerably over the course of this year, high single digit, low double digit from month to month as we moved into the second half.","And so we\u2019re very encouraged by that. That happened as we got those merchandising price points back into the correct zone. And we believe that that improving turns performance will allow us to stabilize our distribution on that core cup line. So we\u2019re very encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing there.","Our kid business has continued to be quite robust. We really like what we\u2019re seeing from Liberte as we continue to expand that business across the U.S. And I believe we\u2019re in about 50% of the country now, and so obviously more to go there.","And then finally, we have quite a good lineup of new products. The Yoplait traditional Greek product that we will be shipping here as we come into July is a terrific product. It\u2019s a filtered traditional Greek yogurt. It has absolutely a terrific taste profile, and we believe that will be very well received by consumers. Retailers are quite enthusiastic about it as we bring that to market.","We really just started with Yoplait Greek 100. That\u2019s been very successful for us as we said in the presentation. We think that\u2019s going to be well over a $100 million in year one. And we\u2019ve just started on that. So we\u2019ll be bringing new flavors to that, multi-packs, all the things that we can do to continue to give that product the growing shelf space that it will deserve.","So we feel quite good about the innovation that we\u2019ve got on that business. So we\u2019ll have high levels of advertising and we\u2019re sort of loaded for bear here and feel optimistic about 2014.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar from Barclays. Please proceed.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays ","First, I just wanted to dig into the gross margin expansion, you expect a little more for fiscal \u201914. I think you said underlying gross margin, ex the acquisition, was roughly flat in fiscal \u201913, and you expect it up a bit in \u201914. Inflation\u2019s expected to be pretty similar year over year. So I\u2019m trying to get a sense of what the more significant drivers of the improvement in gross margin will be in \u201914. Does HMM look like it will be comparable to last year? Or perhaps greater? Or is it all really just expected better base business performance that will get you there?","Don Mulligan ","It\u2019s actually probably three components I'll point to that you can really put in the larger HMM bucket. We talked about HMM. It\u2019s about productivity, mix, and price. So productivity, we continue to see our productivity grow. We are still very much online to meet or exceed our commitment to get $4 billion of COGS productivity in this decade. So that will be a contributing factor, certainly.","The other two are more in the mix bucket. We continue to see strong performance out of our bakeries and food service business as we continue to even heighten our focus on the key product platforms and customer channels where, with our branded products and our direct sales force, we can make a difference, both in terms of volume and importantly mix benefit.","And then the other mix, and we actually saw that as we came out of F13, is stronger baselines in our U.S. retail business, which will contribute to better gross margins as well. As a matter of fact, that was probably the key reason that we were able to beat our previous guidance for F13, is that our baseline volume in U.S. retail was better than we had originally participated at the beginning of the quarter. It allowed us to exceed our original guidance by $0.01, and it will help to contribute to some margin expansion in F14 as well.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays ","And Ken, just a broader industry question. I guess I\u2019m curious if you think this is a fair characterization of where the industry is at. It\u2019s that perhaps the recovery in volume has not been as rapid as the industry players would like to see, but that at least it\u2019s been sort of moving forward at maybe a slow and steady pace. So I\u2019m trying to get a sense, is that a fair characterization? And why do you think the recovery has been maybe slower than everyone would like, particularly as we\u2019ve lapped a lot of the pricing?","Ken Powell ","As to why the recovery has been slower than we all would have liked, I\u2019m not an economist, but I think we\u2019ve all read about how this has just been a very troublesome and challenging recovery for the country. And I think we have felt our share of it.","But you know, the important thing, as you said, is that we are seeing steady improvement. We saw sequential improvement in our categories over the course of the year, particularly in the second half, and so the category and trends are improving. And as we enter F14, our situation basically is the categories generally are better.","As we just commented a bit, our prices are stable. Inflation is moderate, and we think will be quite manageable for us from an HMM standpoint. And we\u2019ve got a good lineup of innovation. So we feel that with this slow improvement and the steady improvement in the category fundamentals, we feel in quite a bit better position as we enter 2014 both for the industry and also for our portfolio of brands and categories.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman, Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","I\u2019m going to follow up on Andrew\u2019s question, Ken, because it seems to me that if you\u2019re forecasting, on the core business, low single digit sales growth, but at the same time you\u2019re saying that categories are better, you\u2019ve seen sequential improvement, your mix and baseline business is stronger, you\u2019ve got a lot of confidence in your new products that you\u2019re introducing. Maybe some of the categories are a little bit different, but it just seems like the organization is targeting market share kind of flat, and not market share gains. Can you respond to that?","Ken Powell ","Well, we\u2019re looking for flat to up on market share, and I think the points that you\u2019ve made, they\u2019re good points, but the other side of it is it continues to be very, very competitive out there, obviously, as Andrew pointed out. While we\u2019re seeing recovery, the recovery is still pretty slow. So we feel good about the fundamentals as we enter the year, we feel our guidance is prudent, given the continuing challenges of the environment.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank ","And Don, as a follow up, based on my calculations and I think some of your comments at our conference, it looks like you\u2019re trading at about a 7% free cash flow yield. You\u2019re going to give about 3% of that back in the form of a dividend, and you\u2019re buying back 2% of your stock.","Why wouldn\u2019t you be more aggressive given that your leverage ratios are pretty reasonable. It seems like you\u2019ve got another 1-2% of free cash flow to either return to shareholders or pay down debt more aggressively. I don\u2019t remember if you said what you expect interest expense to be, but maybe that\u2019s the difference.","Don Mulligan ","First of all, your math is right. It\u2019s about 7% as we sit here today. With our market cap, you\u2019d expect it to be about a 7% yield. Our expectation is that our free cash flow for F14 will be more than 100% of our earnings, so we\u2019ll have the same kind of conversion efficiency we\u2019ve had for the last couple of years.","And we\u2019ll return that cash to the shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase, and it will be split as it has been in prior years, about a 15% increase in dividends, and we\u2019ll have the 2% reduction in the number of shares. We\u2019ll return a higher amount in dollar terms than what we generate in cash, so we will maintain our leverage ratios for the year. But we will return all that cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase.","In terms of interest expense, our interest expense will be up in F14 versus F13. Our debt levels in total will be higher, obviously, based on the Yoplait and more recently the Yoki acquisitions. And we also expect to term some of that debt out and probably carry a little less CP this year than we carried last year. So the mix will be a little bit more on the fixed side, and hence a slightly higher rate as we term out at what are still very attractive rates.","But shareholders will see all the cash back this year that we generate, as we\u2019ve been talking about for the last several months.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with UBS. Please proceed.","David Palmer - UBS ","With regard to the big two categories in breakfast for you, yogurt and Big G, yogurt, it seems that the Yoplait Greek 100, you\u2019ve effectively found pretty good promotion price points where it seems to be moving off the shelf rather well. For instance, we\u2019re seeing 10 for 10s lately.","Is that part of what\u2019s working there for that, that you\u2019ve been able to find the right size and the right price point, where that\u2019s beginning to resonate in addition to the fact that you\u2019ve gotten the taste and calorie counts to a point so it\u2019s a promotion strategy that\u2019s working?","And as you\u2019re thinking ahead to fiscal \u201814, is this really a law of big numbers, where Greek 100 is beginning to overtake the declines that you\u2019re seeing in core cup Yoplait?","Ken Powell ","So I think that the fundamentals of Yoplait Greek 100 is that it offers consumers a terrific benefit. And you touched on that in your question. But it\u2019s a great tasting, traditionally filtered Greek yogurt that has only 100 calories per serving. And, by the way, it has a nice endorsement from Weight Watchers. And we know that that is a very very compelling benefit in the yogurt category.","The light segment, in the traditional yogurt side of the category, that\u2019s a huge segment. So we know the consumers really look for and appreciate that benefit, and I would say that\u2019s fundamentally why it has been so successful, along with the fact that it tastes terrific.","And then in terms of the marketing and promotion of that brand, it\u2019s been, I would say, advertising driven. We\u2019ve had good introductory advertising on that brand, I think, and consumers find the benefit compelling. The promotional in-store strategy I would say is very much in the zone, and very competitive. We\u2019re not trying to outpromote anybody with Greek 100. We don\u2019t feel we need to. We\u2019re really driving it with consumer awareness building.","So we feel very good about that benefit, and we think that we\u2019ll continue to grow that next year. We have more capacity coming onstream this summer, which I think is an important point, to support the expansion of that brand, and this Yoplait Greek product that we\u2019ll be launching in July, which is more of a traditional Greek product.","And I think what we\u2019ll say to you this morning is that product really really tastes good, and those of you who have decided to attend our investor day here in a few weeks will have the opportunity to taste that product and see it in its final packaging configuration and that sort of thing. And probably it\u2019s a case of one taste will be worth a thousand words on that one.","But, so, the combined impact of this Greek innovation that we\u2019re bringing I think will give us continued very high growth in that segment. And that\u2019s going to help our top line sales growth next year, obviously.","David Palmer - UBS ","And just a follow up on cereal, when Big G was really firing and getting share, it seemed to be on the wellness news of the day, whether it\u2019s fiber or whole grain, and also you played well on weight management. What benefits today do you think you can emphasize, and will be emphasizing, to get that trade up consumer? What are you going to be focusing on into fiscal \u201914?","Ken Powell ","Well, we\u2019ll be focusing across our great portfolio. We\u2019re bringing a lot of marketing news on our Cheerios franchise, fresh new advertising on yellow box and Honey Nut. We\u2019re already seeing some nice improvements in baseline on yellow box in response to new advertising there. So when we get that right, that kind of marketing innovation always works for us. So we\u2019ll be bringing fresh news there.","We\u2019ve got some good new products including Hershey\u2019s Cookies and Cream cereal, which we think will be a good success for us. Chex continues to be a very high growth franchise for us. That\u2019s another health benefit. But I would also say our stalwart kid brands continue to perform very well for us. Lucky Charms, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Reese\u2019s Pieces, these are great products. We\u2019ve had very good growth from those.","And one of the things we\u2019re seeing here over the last year is as we advertise those products, those traditional kid brands, to adults, we\u2019re seeing nice bounces in baseline, just by reminding adults how these products taste. So we\u2019ve got a lot of good penetration driving marketing initiatives in Big G next year, that we believe will restore that division to growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Thilo Wrede from Jefferies. Please proceed.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies","Ken, last year at the analyst day that you had in New York, you laid out all the innovation that you had planned for Yoplait for the year. And you sounded very optimistic that they would improve the performance of the brand. Now, you said earlier today that the plans didn\u2019t quite work out for Yoplait. What would give me confidence that the innovation that is coming over the next 12 months will work better, and the plan will work out better than apparently the plan last year did?","Ken Powell ","We are disappointed that we didn\u2019t have sales growth this year in the Yoplait division, but I would hasten to add that as you look at the sequential trends for the business, they\u2019re quite encouraging. So our Q1 performance, we were minus 10 sales, Q2 was minus 6, Q3 was minus 3 or 4, and then we were flat or up slightly in the last quarter of the year. So clearly the trend is positive.","I think the reason for the longer length of time for us was that it was very important for us to get our merchandising price points corrected and competitive in the market, and we began doing that, frankly, in Q4, going back two years ago. But it just took longer to see the impact of those price point adjustments and corrections flow into the market. But as they did flow over the course of the year, we saw significantly strengthening trends.","The new product innovation in Yoplait worked very well. As you\u2019ve heard, Yoplait Greek 100 has been quite successful for us. So I think that played out, if anything, a little better than we expected, and we clearly have something we can build on. So as we enter F14, what gives us confidence is that we\u2019ve got our price points right on the core cup business, turns are up dramatically on core cup, and so that provides a foundation for stabilizing distribution on that business. And then we\u2019ve got real good innovation on the Greek side. So that encourages us that F14 will be a good opportunity.","Thilo Wrede - Jefferies ","And then on a different topic, your advertising and media spending as a percentage of sales has been declining for I think three years now. Based on the guidance that you gave today, it sounds like it will stabilize. What\u2019s the thinking behind the trend over the last two years and why the stabilization now? Why is this the right level now?","Ken Powell ","First of all, just a little bit of context, we\u2019ve increased our advertising by 50%, which I would suspect puts us at the top of the class in terms of our commitment to brand building. Now, this past year, in 2012, again, we made the decision early in the year to make some investments in merchandise price points just to make sure that we were in the right zone there, and that caused a slight reduction in advertising for the year.","But also, resulted in strengthening baselines for us over the course of the year and our belief is that as we got those price points right, see those baselines recover, that really makes all the advertising spending much more effective. So we think we made the right tradeoff there. As we enter 2014, again, we enter with our price points just where we want them to be, and we are planning an increase in advertising in line with sales, for F14. So really back on model, if you will, for General Mills and advertising spend.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard from Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.","Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein","Maybe just following up on the question about U.S. cereals. In terms of category growth, other companies have said demand is fairly weak at present, especially for adult cereals. And I was just wondering if you\u2019ve been seeing the same thing and whether you have views on what might be causing that.","And then as a follow up, there\u2019s been quite a few legislative and retailer-led developments in response to increasing consumer concerns about genetically modified foods. Are you seeing any impact? And then if you are, then what steps are you taking to address those?","Ken Powell ","Where we see baselines that are a little bit weaker or declining, it always has something to do with what we\u2019re doing or not doing, and fundamentally would come back to not the right kind of innovation.","And so as I mentioned earlier, take yellow box Cheerios as an example. As we\u2019ve shifted and refreshed our advertising, particularly in the second half of this year, we\u2019ve seen that brand first stabilize in Q3 - I think share was down just a couple of basis points - and then continue to strengthen in Q4. This is yellow box Cheerios.","And this is all behind better messaging and around the health benefits of that product. So we look at it as down to us. It\u2019s about the quality of our messaging and our innovation, and we\u2019re encouraged by what we\u2019re beginning to see in the Cheerios franchise as an example.","Another example for us would be our Chex franchise, which is broadly an all-family franchise, but a good bit of adult consumption. And here, of course, where we have that strong gluten-free benefit that we\u2019ve communicated well about, I think we\u2019re in our third year of double-digit growth.","And so the way we look at it, we see plenty of evidence that when we get the message right, when we get the innovation right, these brands respond. We\u2019re seeing that in Chex, we\u2019re beginning to see that in Cheerios, and we have a very strong program of innovation and marketing and consumer promotion next year. So we think we\u2019ll continue to see those franchises strengthen.","And maybe the last point is one that I made earlier, just advertising some of our more traditionally child-targeted adults, like Cinnamon Toast Crunch. Getting plenty of adult consumption there, with that advertising, and adults may be looking for some variety and they love the way those products taste.","So there are lots of signals that we\u2019re not victims here. If we get the innovation right, we\u2019ll do just fine. It\u2019s on us, and we like what we\u2019ve got in the pipeline for next year.","On GMOs, obviously aware of what\u2019s going on there and the traffic in social media. Again, we\u2019re not seeing an impact on our business. What does impact our business is when our innovation and our messaging is right, then we see a fairly rapid impact in a positive direction. So obviously that\u2019s something that\u2019s out there, but we don\u2019t see it really affecting our business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll from Citigroup. Please proceed.","David Driscoll - Citigroup","Wanted to follow up on cereal, and then a Hamburger Helper question. On cereal, kind of picking up the thread that I think many analysts have laid out, baseline cereal dollars have been weakening.","Ken, you\u2019ve already tried to explain this a little bit, but when I look at the slides and I see the BFast product, I also see a similar product from your big competitor. I wonder if you guys aren\u2019t hedging a little bit here about what\u2019s happening to breakfast and the volume growth within the cereal category itself.","Can you explain a little bit about how BFast fits in? If this thing is really successful, is it successful at the expense of the cereal business itself, because of the underlying trends? I think a lot of people are really trying to get at this. We\u2019re watching these baselines. They look awfully weak. We\u2019re seeing these other products out there suggesting that people are moving away from that traditional breakfast. How do you put this all together for us?","Ken Powell ","Look, I won\u2019t repeat myself on what I\u2019ve said on the core cereal business. This is a third of all breakfast occasions. We saw it down a little bit this year, a couple of percentage points. There are so many innovation and messaging opportunities around health and taste in cereal that we\u2019re quite confident that we can find messages that will resonate and that will restore that category to growth. We really strongly believe in the category and that we can do that.","Something like BFast, breakfast is a huge category. It\u2019s a huge occasion. I mean, I\u2019m going to guess $100 billion or more of products consumed at breakfast. So that\u2019s a big ocean. And people drink beverages at breakfast, and interested in convenience. And so we just see an opportunity there, and are simply capitalizing on it. It\u2019s too soon to say how bit it is, but we clearly think it\u2019s interesting.","And in terms of where it might get its volume from, it\u2019s probably everything from fruit and yogurt and coffee, you name it. Probably sourced a little bit from everything. But we simply see it as a good opportunity on its own. Obviously we have very strong breakfast equities and credentials at General Mills, and so we want to pursue that opportunity and we think there may be something there.","Don Mulligan","The only thing I would add on BFast is historically consumption for cereal has been teenagers and younger and 45-50 and older, and there\u2019s the breakfast skippers in the middle. And that\u2019s really what we\u2019re going after a BFast. So we\u2019ve seen, in the testing that we have done so far, this to be highly incremental to our RTE cereal business.","David Driscoll - Citigroup ","On Hamburger Helper, it seems like you\u2019ve been attacked on two fronts there, on both kind of the cheese side within the dinners, and then also perhaps on the price point in merchandising. Can you talk about your response? It looks like you\u2019ve got some nice packaging and products coming out. How quickly do you believe that you can restore the strength of the Helper franchise?","Ken Powell ","Well, our goal is to do it this year. And you\u2019ve seen some of the packaging, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll demonstrate those products more in a couple of weeks. But it\u2019s a complete redo of the core line, with packaging and some reformulation and refreshed advertising.","We\u2019ll also be launching a subline of products called Hamburger Helper Ultimate, and those products will feature liquid pouches, if you will, and so that would include some cheese-based pouches to make some very, very good dishes, but also some other liquid ingredients that would make other different kinds of Helper meals. And we\u2019re quite excited about that product as well, which we think will extend that franchise in a nice direction.","So again, it\u2019s about refreshing and renovating these core brands and bringing good innovation. And we think we\u2019ve got a very good program for Helper as we go into 2014.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Todd Duvick of Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities","Don, I think you answered this in part already, but with respect to your debt balance, you\u2019ve got about $2 billion of short term debt, including a $700 million note that matures in August. Can we expect you to be in the market probably before that matures to refinance that, and a portion of the CP you had mentioned?","Don Mulligan ","I\u2019m not sure if we\u2019ll be in the market before September. We have a couple of maturities this year. I think about $1.4 to $1.5 billion of maturities between September, and I think we have another one in February, if I recall the date correctly. So we\u2019ll definitely be in the market. Probably do something pretty substantial, $1 billion plus. I would think later this calendar year, probably not before September necessarily. And it will be to both refinance those as well as term out a little bit of our CP.","Back to Eric\u2019s question on free cash flow, I just want to be very clear on it. We are going to return all our cash to shareholders and maintain our leverage, but just the math behind it, because I think that\u2019s really what Eric\u2019s question was getting at, is our free cash flow yield will be about 7%, or is sitting today at about 7%. Obviously our dividend yield is about 3%.","We are going to reduce our average shares outstanding by 2%. So if you think of the math behind that, since we didn\u2019t reduce our shares this year, we actually have to take 4% of our shares off this coming year to average 2% down. So think 4% going to share repurchase, 3% going to dividends. That really explains the 7% free cash flow yield and how it\u2019s being returned to shareholders.","So I just want to be clear about that, more back to Eric\u2019s question than yours, but for everyone doing the math behind the cash flow, I want to make sure they know where it\u2019s going.","Todd Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities","And a quick follow up. Can you just remind us, in terms of how you manage your balance sheet, you did mention the upgrade by Moody\u2019s. Do you really manage to kind of a rating target? Or do you look at a specific range of leverage ratios?","Don Mulligan ","We look at the latter. It\u2019s not our call on what the rating agencies rate us at. That\u2019s their call. But we target leverage ratios, and primarily our debt to EBITDA. And so obviously each of the rating agencies calculates that a little bit differently. But we want to stay basically in the range that we\u2019re in today, and where we\u2019ve been actually for the last couple of years.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason English from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs"," ","I want to come back to your 3% inflation guidance. I think it\u2019s a little bit higher than some people expected, including myself. Can you help us understand some of the factors that are driving that?","Don Mulligan ","Obviously we have a pretty broad input basket. Again, this is all of our COGS. And it\u2019s pretty widely dispersed, as we\u2019ve talked about in the past. Ten percent or less is in grain, you have 5% in dairy, 5% in energy, 5% in soy, 5% in sugar. So it\u2019s a pretty broad base.","And if you look today, on a spot basis, most of the grains are still up, certainly energy is up, and [even in] a forward market that would hold true for most of those items as well. And as we look forward, both in positions we have and where the forward market is, whether it\u2019s a viable forward market for our inputs, it comes to about a 3% inflation for the year. Obviously different by business, and by geography, but averaging 3% for the company.","And as I mentioned earlier, a little higher than that in the first part of this year and a little lower than that in the back half. But inflation in every quarter.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs ","So no particular outliers. I want to come back to some of the category questions we\u2019ve been getting. First, congratulations on some of the velocity improvements that we\u2019ve been seeing in yogurt. It\u2019s encouraging that it does seem to suggest your base is a lot stronger. The path to get there has been pretty long, and somewhat painful, with discontinuations, product pruning, sharpening your price points.","As we look at your cereal business now, the velocity looks almost as bad as it was in yogurt before you had to go through that process. Your velocity\u2019s now down around 12% or so, more than offsetting the distribution gains you\u2019re getting. What\u2019s the path forward there? And is it going to be different than what you\u2019ve experienced in yogurt?","Ken Powell ","Well, I think for cereal, the path forward, it\u2019s always brand by brand renovation and execution. And so where we have solid messaging and innovation, we\u2019re seeing a very good response, and very good growth.","And this year we didn\u2019t feel that we had all that we needed, or should have, and so as I\u2019ve said, we\u2019re very encouraged by the response to new advertising on Cheerios, and we\u2019ve got more innovation planned on Cheerios as we go into F14. So we\u2019re encouraged by that. We\u2019re very encouraged by the continuing strength of our kid brands.","Fiber One is a brand that I haven\u2019t mentioned. That\u2019s been a good grower for us over the last four or five years. We didn\u2019t see that last year. We think there are some product renovation and [flanker] opportunities that can revitalize that franchise, and so we\u2019ve got some initiatives that we\u2019ll be taking there.","So it really comes down to just making sure we\u2019ve got the right innovation and messaging program on all these core brands, and we just didn\u2019t have that this year. And we feel much more confident about the program that we\u2019ve got for F14.","Kris Wenker","And I think we\u2019ll have to end it there. We\u2019re at the end of our hour, so if there\u2019s people still left in queue, please give me a call, and I\u2019ll try and get your questions answered."],"9984":["General Mills, Inc.

Welcome to the First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. ","During the presentation all participants will be in a listen-only-mode. Afterwards we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder this conference is being recorded, Tuesday September 22, 2015. ","I would now like to turn the conference over to Jeff Siemon, Director of Investor Relations at General Mills. Please go ahead sir. ","Jeff Siemon","Thanks, Cathy and good morning everyone. I'm here with Ken Powell, our CEO; Don Mulligan, our CFO; and Shawn O'Grady, Senior Vice President and President of Sales and Channel Development. I'll turn the call over to them in just a minute, but first let me cover our usual housekeeping items. ","A press release on first quarter results was issued over the wire services earlier this morning and is also posted on our website. You can also find slides on our website that supplement this morning's presentation. I'll remind you that our remarks this morning will include forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions. The second slide in today's presentation lists factors that could cause our future results to be different than our current estimates. ","And with that I'll turn it over to my colleagues, beginning with Don ","Donal L. Mulligan","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning to everyone. Thank you for joining us today. As noted in our press release, General Mills posted strong operating results in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 with 4% constant currency growth in net sales and double-digit constant currency growth in segment operating profit and adjusted diluted earnings per share. We continue to make good progress on our cost savings initiatives and we have clear visibility to delivering our 2016 savings target. We are reaffirming our full year fiscal 2016 growth targets, which currently exclude any impact from the proposed Green Giant divestiture. ","Slide five provides a summary of the Green Giant transaction. We're selling the Green Giant and Le Sueur brands of frozen and shelf stable vegetables to B&G Foods for $765 million in cash, subject to an inventory adjustment at closing. General Mills will continue to operate the Green Giant business in Europe and select other markets, primarily in Asia and the Middle East under a perpetual royalty free license from B&G. B&G will operate Green Giant primarily in the U.S., Canada and markets throughout Latin America and the Caribbean. ","We anticipate using the net cash proceeds from the sale for share repurchases and debt reduction. The transaction is expected to be dilutive to our fiscal 2016 earnings per share in the range of $0.05 to $0.07 excluding transaction cost and a one-time gain on the sale. We'll provide you with another update after the transaction closes, which we expect to take place before the end of the calendar year. ","Now let's turn to the first quarter. On slide six you can see net sales totaled $4.2 billion, up 4% in constant currency. Segment operating profit totaled $826 million, 23% above the prior year in constant currency. Recall that profit was down 15% in last year's first quarter due primarily to higher merchandising expense in U.S. Retail. ","Net earnings increased 24% to $427 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.69 as reported. These results include mark-to-market valuation effects and restructuring and project-related expenses. Excluding these items affecting comparability, adjusted diluted EPS increased 30% to $0.79. On a constant currency basis adjusted diluted EPS was up 36%.","Slide seven shows the components of total company net sales growth. Pound volume increased 2% from the prior-year including a one point contribution from the Annie's acquisition. Sales mix and net price realization also added two points to sales growth. And foreign exchange reduced sales growth by five points. U.S. retail net sales for the first quarter were 4% above last year, with growth in the Cereal, Meals, Yogurt and Snacks operating units.","U.S. Retail net sales growth outpaced Nielsen measured sales in the first quarter. This was due in part to good growth in non-measured channels and increased customer inventory levels in advance of strong second quarter merchandising on promotions like gluten-free Cheerios. It's also important to remember that last year's first quarter net sales lagged Nielsen movement. Over a two year period growth rates for U.S. Retail net sales in Nielsen measured sales were comparable, excluding the impact of Annie's. Looking forward we expect Nielsen measured sales to strengthen in the second quarter.","In our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment net sales increased 1% in the first quarter. Our six focused platforms, cereal, yogurt, snacks, mixes, frozen meals and biscuits posted combined net sales growth of 9%. Net sales for our remaining products were down driven by our exit of some low margin businesses in late fiscal 2015.","Slide 11 summarizes the first quarter net sales results for our International segment. Constant currency net sales grew 5% overall. Sales in Europe increase 7%, driven by good growth on H\u00e4agen-Dazs and Old El Paso. Canada sales were up 5% due to strong growth on snacks. Latin America sales grew 3% and in the Asia-Pacific region sales increased 3% due to growth in South Korea and India.","Slide 12 shows the first quarter adjusted gross margin increased 290 basis points. Recall that high levels of promotional expense significantly reduced gross margin in last year's first quarter. Also this year our first quarter margins benefit from our cost savings projects. In addition our COGS HMM savings offset inflation. We expect inflation will be the lowest in the first quarter and will build over the year to average 2%.","Slide 13 details our segment operating profit results in the first quarter. Total segment operating profit was up 23% in constant currency driven by strong increase in U.S. Retail's profits. Remember that the U.S. Retail profit was down 25% in last year's first quarter. Constant currency International profit declined 3% versus year ago results that were up 17% and Convenience Stores and Foodservice profit was down 9% reflecting higher input costs, including lower grain merchandising and a comparison against 18% growth in last year's first quarter.","Combined after tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $26 million in the quarter, up 16% in constant currency due to favorable input costs, and a decrease in SG&A for CPW and favorable price realization for H\u00e4agen-Dazs Japan. CPW sales were 2% below year ago levels in constant currency, while H\u00e4agen-Dazs Japan posted constant currency sales growth of 9%.","And completing our review of the income statement; we recorded restructuring and project related charges of $95 million in the first quarter including $35 million in cost of sales and about $2.5 million in non-consolidated interest -- non-controlling interest. Unallocated corporate expenses, excluding mark-to-market evaluation effects and restructuring and project related charges were down $19 million. Net interest expense decreased $3 million in the quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.7% as reported. Excluding items affecting comparability the tax rate was 32.3% this year, essentially matching year ago levels. And average diluted shares outstanding declined 2% in the quarter.","Turning to the balance sheet, slide 16 shows that our core working capital decreased 16% versus last year\u2019s first quarter, driven primarily by continued improvements in accounts payable. This is the 10th consecutive quarter that we have reduced our core working capital versus the prior year.","Operating cash flow totaled $431 million in the quarter, 31% above last year\u2019s results due to higher earnings. Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $147 million and we returned more than $400 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Slide 18 provides an update of our cost savings initiatives. We are on track to deliver $400 million in cost of goods sold HMM savings in fiscal 2016. In addition we are making good progress on our incremental cost savings initiatives, including Project Catalyst, Project Century, Project Compass and the changes to our administrative policies and practices. Taken together these initiatives remain on track to deliver between $285 million and $310 million in annual savings this fiscal year and more than $400 million in fiscal \u201817.","Slide 19 provides a summary of our 2016 sales and earnings guidance which currently excludes any impact from the proposed Green Giant divestiture. We are reaffirming the targets we outlined in July. We expect net sales to be approximately flat in constant currency. Excluding the difference in weeks we expect 2016 net sales to be up 1% in constant currency. We project our total segment operating profit will grow at a low single-digit rate on a constant currency basis and we are targeting mid-single digit constant currency growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share.","At current exchange rates we estimate a $0.09 headwind to full year adjusted diluted EPS growth in 2016. Again all these growth rates exclude the impact of the Green Giant divestiture. We\u2019ll provide an update to these growth targets after that divestiture is closed later this calendar year.","With that I\u2019ll turn the microphone over to Shawn O'Grady. Shawn?","Shawn P. O'Grady","Thanks, Don, and hello everyone. It\u2019s great to be on the call this morning and give you an update on our U.S. Retail sales force and how we are partnering with our customers to drive growth.","The mission of our U.S. selling organization is to lead profitable growth for both General Mills and for our customers. This morning I would like to take you -- like to highlight three primary ways to accomplish this mission. First, we drive growth by supporting the fiscal 2016 U.S. retail priorities that Jeff Harmening shared at our Investor Day in July. Second, we accelerate this growth by expanding our reach across new and growing food distribution channels. And finally we look to maximize the return of our efforts by delivering quality in-store execution. ","And we do this through the efforts of the top sales teams in the industry, as ranked by our customers in the Annual Kantar Power Ranking survey. We are proud of that accomplishment, and more importantly it shows the credibility that we have with our retail customers. We know it means that our customers are counting on us to partner with them for growth.","To ground you in the size and scope of our organization we employ around 1,700 sales professionals across the U.S. Our organization includes cross functional teams that call on customer headquarters, a retail organization that make sure our products are merchandised in stores and stocked on shelves and a centralized support group that provides advantaged capabilities to our sales teams. We have expertise in 25 categories, that span all three temperature states and we manage an average of 690 General Mills items in distribution. ","The primary way we lead profitable growth is by supporting the U.S. Retail segment\u2019s top priorities, which are to grow cereal, accelerate yogurt and snacks, drive double-digit growth on our natural and organic portfolio, and deliver consumer first value on key brands. In many cases the difference between an idea's success and failure is in how it comes to life in the stores of our retail partners. Let me share some example from a few of our priority categories.","By now you have probably heard of the exciting news that nearly 90% of our Cheerios franchise is going gluten free. Our Cereal operating unit has developed a strong marketing plan to reach consumers with this news and we\u2019ll build on that plan by making it an unmissable event in stores. This quarter we\u2019ll place 35,000 full pallets on display across all retailers. To put that in to context our back-to-school merchandising event, the largest annual event across our entire cereal range is about this size. That means gluten-free Cheerios will be one of the largest merchandising event in our cereal business' history. ","In addition to full pallets, we're creating custom gluten-free point of sale materials and leveraging digital tie-ins with several of our key customers. Retailers are incredibly excited about this news and the interest that will bring to Cheerios and to the cereal category more broadly. ","In addition to supporting renovation, like gluten-free Cheerios we work to build in store excitement for innovation like our new Yoplait Plenti Greek yogurts and Nature Valley Simple Nut Bars. Our first job is building distribution, leveraging our category management capabilities to secure visible -- a visible block on the shelf for these new items. While it's still early customer acceptance and initial distribution build on these items are trending higher than our original expectations. Once we have new items in distribution, we execute introductory merchandising and in-store sampling to drive trial. And increasingly we're partnering with customers on digital marketing to build consumer awareness. ","We're also working hard to drive growth for our natural and organic portfolio. Annie's, our most recent brand addition is a terrific brand with a great deal of distribution upside. We're focused on growing shelf presence on the top-33 Annie's SKUs which have only 30% average distribution nationally. In fact, since the acquisition we've grown Annie's distribution double digits, including a 16% increase at Target, which was the customer with the highest level of Annie's distribution prior to the acquisition. We're also expanding Annie's into relatively untapped channels, including club, e-commerce and food service, and we're leveraging our broad category expertise to help launch Annie's into new categories like soup and yogurt. ","In addition to supporting U.S. Retail priorities, we also work to accelerate growth across the segment by expanding our offerings into faster growing channels. We have a strong position in traditional grocery stores and in super centers and a long history of generating growth in these two channels. We're also keenly focused on alternative channels where food retailing is expanding. In fact, sales in many of these formats are increasing at high single digit and double-digit rates. ","Club Stores continue to generate strong growth, especially with attractive consumer segments like healthful foodies. We've experienced increasing success with Club retailers by focusing on winning in snacks with our Nature Valley Fiber One and Food Should Taste Good brands, leveraging strong product credentials like gluten-free cheerios, Immaculate Baking natural and organic refrigerated dough, and Yoplait Simple GoGurt. And launching unique offerings like Larabar almond butter, which appeal to the Treasure Hunt mentality of club shoppers. ","Natural and organic retailers have also experienced strong growth as consumer preferences change. We've been selling to these retailers for more than 15 years but the acquisition of Annie's has opened up new growth avenues and increased our capabilities. We're now the third largest natural and organic food manufacturer in the United States and this enhanced scale combined with our dedicated stewardship of our brands has made us a significant and credible supplier to natural and organic consumers. ","We're increasing our investment to further strengthen our capability from this channel and we're leveraging Annie's direct sales team in Berkeley and their broker relationship to accelerate growth for existing General Mills' natural and organic brands like Muir Glen organic tomatoes and Cascadian Farm's organic frozen food. We're also seeing greatly enhanced merchandising execution on our cereal business in the channel, which is helping to drive 50 basis points of cereal growth for Cascadian Farm organic cereals in these outlets. ","In Drug and Dollar Stores we're seeing increased focus on food as retailers search for their next source of sales growth. Our scale, insights and dedicated sales force across food have provided us with an opportunity to positively impact growth for these customers. We leverage our leading brands and broad category positions to secure advisor ships early and those relationships have tended to stick and be beneficial to our business overtime. ","We're taking this learning to the e-commerce channel too. E-commerce is the fastest growing food channel and our customers are testing a wide range of business and distribution models. We've established an e-commerce Center of Excellence to provide leadership for the virtual shelf by serving as food captain and we engage in annual collaborative business planning with our key retailers like Amazon, Wal-Mart.com and other pure play e-commerce retailers. ","Our portfolio is well suited to the two main ways consumers shop for food online. We have limited distribution items like Larabar or gluten-free products that do well on sites that are geared to spear fishing or single item search. And our leading brands are seeing accelerating sales growth on sites that cater to customers looking to do their full basket shop online. Across these and other alternative food channels we're enhancing our capabilities to lead profitable growth for our customers and our brands. ","The third way we lead profitable growth is by focusing on two key areas of execution, on-shelf distribution and in-store display. Over the past few years distribution growth and display availability across traditional retail channels has slowed. As a result we've shifted our focus to enhancing the quality of these activities.","In fiscal 2016 we're focused on driving the right distribution across our portfolio. We are prioritizing what we call our Power 450 SKUs. These are our 450 best turning national items. In fact they turn at a rate that is nearly four times faster than the other items in our portfolio. These products represent three-quarters of our U.S. Retail volume, but less than 20% of our SKUs. More importantly we have on average less than 350 of these 450 items on the shelf. That's almost a 25% distribution gap and a significant growth opportunity for our largest and most profitable brand.","The recent decline in effectiveness of merchandising across the store has been driven by too many displays containing too many items and worse too many small items. We are working with retailers to improve merchandising effectiveness by refocusing on big categories, big brands and fewer but larger items. That should mean more merchandising support for cereal which is by far the most productive merchandise category in the center store and more support for Honey Nut and Yellow Box cheerios, the largest items in the categories leading franchise.","Now let me show you an example of how the U.S. Retail sales force integrated these efforts to lead profitable growth with Hispanic consumers in fiscal 2015. We started by leveraging strong dedicated Hispanic marketing initiatives on brands like Yoplait, Honey Nut Cheerios and Nature Valley. We focused our resources on specific markets and channels where we could maximize our results, for example Hispanic chains, wholesalers, Supermercados and select stores from national retail chains with concentrated Hispanic shopper bases.","We then built a customized distribution and display plan for each of these customers and we developed Consumer 360 surround with local event sampling, radio, digital couponing and in some cases the use of credible celebrities. The result in 2015 was a five percentage point increase in sales growth where we implemented this initiative as compared to our national trends. In fiscal 2016 we are expanding our efforts from three cities to 24 cities, which collectively represent 50% of the food and beverage dollar spend by Hispanic consumers in U.S.","I hope I've given you a better understanding of how our U.S. Retail sales force is leveraging our capabilities and relationships to lead profitable growth, both for our customers and for our brands. And with that I'll turn the microphone to Ken to provide some operating highlights from the first quarter. Ken?","Kendall J. Powell ","Okay. Hey, thanks Shawn and good morning to one and all. As Don described fiscal 2016 is off to a good start with strong top and bottom line growth. We continue to put the consumer first and have posted solid sales growth on many brands across our portfolio. Let me give you an update on our performance in each of our business segments.","In our U.S. Retail segment we delivered strong sales and operating profit growth in the quarter and we made progress on our key priorities for the year. We posted net sales growth for our cereal, yogurt and snacks businesses. We are seeing continued good performance from our natural and organic brands as we increase distribution across the country, as you just heard from Shawn. And we are gaining traction as we address value on key brands like Helpers and Betty Crocker mixes.","In cereal we are encouraged by recent trends in the category. As you can see on slide 39 category sales declines have been moderating over the past several quarters with retail sales down about 1% in the most recent quarter. We believe product renovation and innovation are two keys to restoring the cereal category to growth and we\u2019ve been doing our part with many of our recent launches. Our five varieties of gluten-free Cheerios have been flowing on to store shelves over the past month and we just began advertising this news a few weeks ago. While it\u2019s still early days we\u2019ve received very positive consumer response. ","We\u2019ve also been innovating within specific segments of the cereal category. For example Nature Valley Protein Granola has been benefitting from the increased consumer interest in Granola. We added to our Nature Valley cereal offerings in the first quarter with soft baked granola bites and toasted oats Muesli contributing to strong double-digit retail sales growth for Nature Valley cereals and we\u2019ll expand this franchise in the second half of fiscal 2016 with Baked Oat Bites and two varieties of Oat Clusters.","We have renovation news, more new items and increased media support plan for the remainder of the year and we\u2019re on track to grow net sales for our U.S. cereal business in fiscal 2016. We posted good retail sales growth in segments within the U.S. yogurt category too. Retail sales for Yoplait Greek varieties increased 11% in the first quarter on the strength of Greek 100 Whips! This summer we introduced two new flavors of this light and airy Greek Yogurt. And we recently launched eight flavors of Yoplait Plenti Greek Yogurt, which includes wholegrain oats, flax and pumpkin seeds for consumers seeking a heartier yogurt experience.","Consumer support on Plenti started this month and early response has been positive. Our reduced sugar messaging on Yoplait Original, along with its all family snack appeal drove 4% retail sales growth for this variety in the quarter, and that\u2019s on top of 12% retail sales growth in last year\u2019s first quarter. We\u2019re expecting another year of solid growth for our yogurt business as we grow distribution, bring more new items to the category and increase our media support for Yoplait.","For our U.S. snacks business we saw first quarter retail sales and share growth on our Grain Snacks led by Fiber One. This summer we launched two new Fiber One cheese cake bars with great success. The strawberry variety is now the fastest turning bar in our Fiber One portfolio. First quarter retail sales declined for our Fruit and Salty Snacks driven by decreased merchandising activity compared to a year. We\u2019ll have product news coming across our snacks portfolio in the second half of the year along with continued consumer support for our brands.","Our natural and organic snacks are growing nicely, retail sales across Larabar nutrition bars, Food Should Taste Good savory snacks and Cascadian Farm granola bars were up a combined 13% in the first quarter in Nielsen measured outlets. We brought innovation to the Food Should Taste Good brand in the first quarter with several varieties of bean chips and Real Good Bars. In the second half of the year we\u2019ll be increasing consumer investment on Larabar and have new varieties of Cascadian Farm Snack Bars coming.","Retail sales for Cascadian Farm Cereals grew 14%, leveraging consumer interest in Wholesome Granola. Cascadian Farm is the share leader in granola. We\u2019ll be bringing new flavors to the brand in the second half of the year and we\u2019re very excited about our line of Annie\u2019s soups that launched this summer. These five soups deliver the great taste kids love and they provide moms with a quick and easy lunch time option from the trusted Annie\u2019s brand. And we have seen very positive response to this launch on social media and customer acceptance has been strong. And there is more to come. In January we\u2019ll introduce Annie\u2019s Organic Yogurt. This three flavor line will be made with real organic fruit and whole milk for a creamy taste and texture that we think kids and the whole family will love.","As Shawn told you our sales team has strong plans in place to grow distribution on our natural and organic businesses and we are excited about the innovation we have coming later this year. Several other U.S. retail businesses deserve a quick mention. Retail sales for Old El Paso Mexican products grew 2% in the quarter, thanks to good performance on our new mini Stand 'N Stuff Shells and new bold Ranch Shells. Totino's Hot Snacks posted 4% retail sales growth powered by great advertised and bold flavored new products. Watch for a crispier crust version of these hot snacks coming later this calendar year. ","Progresso is innovating on two growing segments of the soup category, with new cooking stock and stew varieties and we're supporting the brand with a new ad campaign. We are expecting to deliver improved results in this year's soup season and we're addressing value on key brands. On Helpers dinner mixes, we've recently added 20% more pasta on our top SKUs to better meet the needs of larger families. While it is still early we are seeing base unit growth on those upsized products. On desserts we're bringing our prices in the line with competition in certain category segments and our market share is stabilizing as a result. Once we get the value right we can turn our efforts to bringing consumer first new and innovation to these businesses to drive sustainable growth. So we believe we're on the right track with our consumer first initiatives across our U.S. retail segment. ","Turning to our Convenience Stores and Food Service segment, Don told you that our focus six platforms posted 9% net sales growth in the quarter. First quarter net sales for our cereal business grew mid-single digits in food service outlets led by continued growth in K-12 schools. Yoplait Greek varieties and ParfaitPro drove mid-single digit net sales growth for our Yoghurt business in the first quarter. Net sales for our snacks portfolio were up high-single digits. We're seeing good growth on our snack bars in schools and our grain and salty snacks are performing well in convenience stores. And our frozen meals posted double digit growth in the quarter thanks to the continued success of our frozen breakfast products in K-12 Schools lead by mini bagels that launched earlier this calendar year. ","First quarter net sales for our International segment grew 5% on a constant currency basis, led by solid performance in developed markets. Net sales in Canada increased 5% primarily driven by innovation. We posted particularly robust performance on grain snacks as our summer launches of Nature Nut and Seed bars and Fiber One crumble bars exceeded expectations. Good performance on Libert\u00e9 Yogurt contributed to 2% retail sales growth for yogurt in the quarter and the new cereals we launched in Canada this quarter are off to a good start. ","Constant currency net sales in Europe increased 7% in the first quarter. It was an excellent summer for H\u00e4agen-Dazs ice cream led by the successful launch of premium stick bars in France. And the continued popularity of Stand 'N Stuff soft Taco shells contributed to solid retail sales growth for Old El Paso so far this year. ","Challenging economic conditions are having an impact on our categories and our businesses in emerging markets. First quarter net sales increased 3% on a constant currency basis for the Asia-Pacific region, but it was a mixed bag across our portfolio. In China, constant currency net sales were down 1%, driven by a decline on Wanchai Ferry dumplings. We have more promotions and advertising planned on Wanchai Ferry to spur growth in the second half of the year. H\u00e4agen-Dazs ice cream posted low-single digit net sales growth in China led by good performance on our retail products. ","And I'm pleased to report that our Yoplait yogurt launch in Shanghai is off to a good start. We've already achieved a 5% value share of the yogurt category in that city. We saw particularly strong performance on our Perle de lait premium varieties. We're learning more about the Chinese yogurt consumer, the taste and packaging preferences and we're taking a consumer first approach to give them what they want. ","Our business in the Asia, Middle East and Africa market is small and fast growing. Constant currency net sales increased at a double digit pace in the first quarter driven by H\u00e4agen-Dazs ice cream and Betty Crocker snacks. In Latin America, first quarter net sales increased 3% on a constant currency basis, driven by double digit growth in Mexico and Argentina. Constant currency net sales declined in Brazil as consumers continue to struggle with challenging economic conditions and as we lapped a very successful World Cup promotion during the first quarter of last year. ","We will continue to monitor emerging markets closely and will build on the good momentum we generated in developed markets. We're confident we have a strong portfolio of international brands and businesses to drive growth for General Mills' over the long-term. ","So I'll summarize our remarks this morning this way; our business posted strong growth in the quarter. We\u2019re making good progress against our priorities for our U.S. Retail segment, and our sales initiatives and capabilities are well aligned with these priorities. We're keeping the momentum going on our Convenience Stores and Food Service segment and we had a strong start in International developed markets, while growth in emerging markets has slowed. Our cost savings programs are on target and we're poised for margin expansion this year and we remain on track to achieve our fiscal 2016 performance goals which currently exclude the impact of the Green Giant divestiture. ","So with that I'll the open the call for questions. Operator, will you get us going please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly, thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC. Please proceed with your question. ","Kendall J. Powell ","Hi, David.","David Palmer","Thanks, maybe just a housekeeping. Hey, good morning, Ken. There was a mention about H\u00e4agen-Dazs in the retail products led to low-single digit growth in China. Just one little housekeeping question, is the retail, are the retail comps there, are they continuing to be fairly consistent, how are they -- how is the consumer environment in China lately? I think people would be interested to hear that. And then, but more of a core question, the promotional activity that we're seeing in U.S. Retail across all of food is really changing in the latest quad week periods. We're seeing a reduction in promotions. I know you had some merchandising timing yourself, but speaking for yourself and the industry it seems that in-store promotional activity has really dropped off. What are you doing to perhaps shift your spending there and what are you seeing across your peer group? Thanks.","Kendall J. Powell ","Okay David, let me answer the H\u00e4agen-Dazs question first. So when I referred to retail I was referring to traditional grocery retail sales in China, and that has increased. I actually don't know by how much, we can probably get you that later. As you look more broadly across H\u00e4agen-Dazs and you look at the shops that was driven by geographic expansion. Same-store sales in shops was actually down, as it has been for the last few quarters. And so but all-in on H\u00e4agen-Dazs we saw growth there. And then as I mentioned our frozen food business was down 2% or 3%. So we're still seeing headwinds there. We have some good innovation coming on the frozen food line later this year and so we think that, that will help. And but it's still challenging in China and Brazil. On the promotion, I'll make a few, the merchandising, I'll make a few comments and then turn it over to Shawn. We would not interpret a declining trend in merchandising right now. Frankly it's a mixed bag. We are seeing some increases in some categories, a little more frequency of promotion. ","We're seeing that in yogurt, we're seeing a little bit in cereal. In other categories, for instance in snacks particularly in our fruit snacks and salty snacks we're seeing declines in promotion. Now that's primarily retailer led, some of our retailers are choosing to simply promote those products less often. So I would say our perspective is, it's mixed, and we're not sort of concluding that there is going to be a lower, a less intense promotional environment if anything we're seeing a bit more. I don't know Shawn if you would add anything to that. ","Shawn P. O'Grady ","Yeah, I think that's right, Ken. And I think if I were to add a word to I'd say it's mixed but stable for right now, over the past quarter. In the categories that we compete in we saw an increase in quality merch support across the categories of 1%, which is nominal. So as Ken mentioned, it is when you look at the broad swath it's 1% category by category. Depending on the position of the players that we compete with, there is some increased activity, or as you indicated David there are some competitors who are backing off their merchandising. But overall I would say stable.","David Palmer","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions.","Kendall J. Powell ","Hey, Rob.","Robert Moskow","Hi, good morning. So I wanted to ask about the difference between the shipments and the Nielsen data. I think you said that you are shipping ahead of consumption this quarter, in advance of some heavy promotion that's going to happen in second or activity in second quarter. But the direction of our Nielsen data, we're kind of a slave to the numbers here, it seemed to go lower than I would have thought and can you give us a sense for just like, what the shape of the curve is going to look like on a retail basis, like I'm looking at negative 3% declines from a Nielsen perspective. Do we -- should we expect a pretty sharp uptick over the next few months as you get your cereal merchandising in place and maybe the new products start selling? Thanks.","Kendall J. Powell ","And that really is, you kind of have answered your question. That's what we expect to see. I mean we did build inventory, as we noted in our remarks, in advance of Q2. And I'll just make a couple maybe of additional points on that. Back-to-school which is a big promotional window for us, it was early last year and actually falls in Q2 this year. So that's a focal point for merchandising for us. We have a very solid line of merchandising on seasonal brands and here we talk about soup and baking and meals, and frankly we didn't execute all that well a year ago in Q1, and so we feel that we have a much better plan. This year we'll be more competitive and so we expect to see that in Q2. ","We've already talked about cereal and the promotional, not only the gluten-free event. But we also -- we have other promotional partnerships in Q2, movie tie-ins, this sort of thing. They're going to be quite strong and so we expect that to strengthen in Q2 and Q3 and this is all versus Q1 last year when we had protein, which was our big first half launch and had lots of activity that was Q1. ","So that's a bit of texture, I mean which kind of builds on the point you made. We just -- Q1 was stronger for us last year, there is less activity. We've got things lined up for Q2 and Q3, and that's how we expect the year to play out. Shawn, would you add anything?","Shawn P. O'Grady ","Just to reiterate the kind of the -- our focus in cereal will be on the gluten-free news, which is probably the best piece of renovation news that we've had in a long time and that really is just hitting shelves now. So we feel good about the merchandising we've lined up with customers because they've been very excited about that news. And as Ken said, our seasonal merchandising, as we went into the holidays last year, I think was more tepid just in execution than we expected to be this year.","Robert Moskow","And the back-to-school again, did you say it's going to fall more in second quarter than first quarter this year or is back-to-school comp the same?","Shawn P. O'Grady ","Yeah, just the timing of the- back-to-schools a week later and so this year versus last year. So you'll see more activity in September than you did a year ago.","Robert Moskow","All right. Great, thank you.","Kendall J. Powell ","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Kendall J. Powell ","Hey, Eric.","Eric Katzman ","Hi, good morning everybody. ","Kendall J. Powell ","Good morning.","Eric Katzman ","Can't let Don off the hook here. So I wanted to, one, I guess, did you change the forecast on the currency headwind for the fiscal 2016 guidance?","Donal L. Mulligan","Yes, it's about $0.05, I think it is. I think we had $0.04 in July, it's $0.09 now. So about $0.05 swing. And obviously the U.S. dollar strengthens, the Canadian dollars, it\u2019s the A dollars, the euro, the Brazilian real. So yeah we see more of a headwind in our reported results from currency.","Eric Katzman ","Okay, and then I guess on the -- thank you for that. And then on the Green Giant divestiture, so I guess a quantitative question than more of a qualitative, the $0.05 to $0.07 dilution, what -- is that, I guess is that on an annual basis and does that, like are you assuming use of proceeds to buy back stock to offset some of the dilution or kind of what factor you are assuming around that?","Donal L. Mulligan","Good question. That is a fiscal \u201816 estimate. So it will be a partial year, depending on when the deal closes, that's -- hence the reason we gave you a range. As we\u2019ve talked about, Eric you and I talked about, I talked with other investors, as we talk about our portfolio the reason we\u2019re often asked why don\u2019t we do -- why aren't we more active from a divestiture standpoint and one of the things we always come to is we have very profitable cash generative brands. And so Green Giant has a little under $600 million in sales last fiscal. Its margins were in the upper teens and that\u2019s going to be lost income this year. We\u2019re obviously going to use the proceeds to, as we said half of it is going to be used to reduce debt, half is going to be used to buy back shares. So that will have a somewhat mitigating impact on the results, but at the end of the day it\u2019s a profitable business and hence the reason we got a pretty fair price from B&G.","Eric Katzman ","Thanks for that. Is there a lot of -- is there some stranded overhead associated with it that's\u2026?","Donal L. Mulligan","Yes, a small, certainly a significant amount of direct overhead, that will go and there is some stranded overhead that will go as well during the course of this year, that's in those numbers as well.","Eric Katzman ","Okay, last question. I guess Ken, on the value changes that you have made with Betty Crocker and Hamburger Helper, like how long do you think you need to wait to see whether those actions are kind of generating the response you hope?","Kendall J. Powell ","We\u2019re already seeing it, Eric and I\u2019ll let Shawn jump in here.","Shawn P. O'Grady","So I will take them separately. So in the baking area, where we\u2019ve really shifted our attention to, getting the price point at the shelf right, that\u2019s already been executed, and we\u2019re already seeing the stabilization of that business. On the joint ventures front where it\u2019s the value that's being delivered by increased products in the box, that takes longer to actually execute and get the flow through on the shelf. And so that will probably take us, I would say another 60 days to get it fully on shelf and get a good clean read.","Eric Katzman ","Okay thanks. I will pass it on.","Shawn P. O'Grady","Okay, thanks Eric.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Kenneth Goldman","Hi, good morning everyone.","Kendall J. Powell ","Good morning, Ken.","Kenneth Goldman","Don, just hoping to weigh maybe some of the one quarter gross margin tailwinds you mentioned, just to sort of get a better sense of things. So if I can first, am I missing anything big in terms of the drivers? You talked about, I think lapping high promo expenses, benefits in cost savings, the least amount of inflation in the year, anything large that I am missing there? And then number two if we are sort of thinking about putting those drivers into buckets, maybe which would be the most important in terms of how well the gross margin came in and which maybe had a less important impact in the period?","Donal L. Mulligan","Yeah, those are the key drivers. Actually the other one is we\u2019re seeing growth in U.S. Retail, that obviously has a beneficial mix impact to it, slight favorable mix impact. But you hit the big three and let me just address that, and I think what's probably a question about our balance of the year as well, because you do hit on what is going to change as the year unfolds. So we had a benefit, as you recall a year ago we had higher merchandising expense in the first quarter. We spend much of last year working that down and we started seeing the benefit of that in the back half of the year. We started seeing gross margin expansion starting in Q4. ","We also have the benefit of our cost savings, that is still primarily hitting our administrative expenses, but we are starting to see some benefit in our gross margin as well. And then inflation, inflation in the first quarter was less than 1%. We still expect to be 2% for the full year. So obviously we'll above 2% for the next three quarters, and that had a beneficial impact, disproportional beneficial impact in Q1. And those three items rolled relatively equal in terms of their impact in the quarter and as the year unfolds. ","And so we certainly had planned for a very strong Q1, as Ken mentioned in his remarks, in the earnings release, and we're pleased to see it come through. ","Kenneth Goldman","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. ","Alexia Howard","Good morning everyone. ","Kendall J. Powell ","Hi Alexia.","Alexia Howard","Can I ask two quick ones based on your comments? You talked about e-commerce, can you comment on what proportion of U.S. retail sales are currently going through those kinds of channels today and maybe what proportion of sales you might expect that to go to overtime. And then you talked about the long tail of much smaller SKUs, I'm guessing with much lower velocities. Is there are an opportunity to lock some of those off, and maybe cash off a group of products that are very unprofitable? And what would prevent you from doing that, if it's the right thing to do in terms of the financial impact? Thank you. ","Shawn P. O'Grady ","Yeah, thanks for the questions Alexia. Both of them really good, on the e-commerce front, in the U.S. food sales that are going through online are between 1% and 2%. Now that's changing pretty quickly, meaning moving from 1% to 2%. If you said what does it look like out four or five years ahead, all the projections I've seen are in the 5% to 6% range. So it's going to be a high growth area. Obviously Amazon is leading some of the thought there, Wal-Mart.com is investing a great deal to make sure that they and utilizing their stores to make sure they are competitive. And that really is causing all the players in the marketplace to one of the actives in the e-commerce space. ","So an important place for us to play, we believe, as I mentioned with our portfolio, whether it's small hard to find items or our top turning items, we believe that we're well positioned to capture that growth. As far as the long tail and our look at, our overall distribution of SKUs, they've been several efforts over the years by I would say all the manufacturers to go through SKU rationalization. And in general SKU rationalization, if you just cut off the tail, because a lot of those items are either highly profitable or are covering a lot of overhead, that doesn't really work. So the job first is to get better distribution on the high turning SKUs and replace, get those slower turning off the shelves so that when you do discontinue them, the impact of those is very small at that point. ","So our first job is to really move our distribution up to our fastest turning items and then consider what things we can discontinue. ","Kendall J. Powell ","And the only thing I would the only comment I would add to that Alexia is that it's very easy to see e-commerce sales grow very rapidly. We have only to look at other markets where we do business like the UK and France where, for some of our categories our online sales are approaching 10%. So it's pretty clear that we're going to move in that direction very rapidly in the U.S. and this is an area that we're investing in at General Mills to develop our capability and make sure that we can be leaders and great partners for all of our customers who have a lot of interest in this. ","Shawn P. O'Grady ","Just to put one final point on what Ken just said, that the piece that will really shift the U.S. landscape on e-commerce is one that moves from being single item search to being full basket, online search, which it has in the places Ken mentioned in Europe and other parts of the world. And you can see that coming and so that's why we expect the growth projections to materialize. ","Alexia Howard","Great, thank you very much. I'll pass it on. ","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with the Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. ","Bryan Spillane","Hi, good morning everyone. ","Kendall J. Powell ","Hey, Bryan. ","Bryan Spillane ","Just a couple of follow-ups. I guess, first just in terms of Green Giant it's a -- the $0.05 to $0.07 dilution's a partial year. So should we also be factoring something in for next year as well in terms of dilution or do you expect it to be more mitigated by then. ","Donal L. Mulligan","It will be that same level but it will be something incremental to that. In the next year we'd have a full impact of the share reduction and the debt reduction. So it will be south of the $0.05 to $0.07, but it will be incremental since this year is only partial year.","Bryan Spillane","Okay, great. And then Don, also just on gross margins, I guess I think what you have said at the start of the year was just that it would be higher than last year. I don\u2019t think you really gave a sort of a magnitude, but I think as we look at this quarter, even if we kind of strip out the benefit from just lower promotional expenses, it looks like gross margins would have been up even little bit more year-over-year in this quarter than it was in fiscal fourth quarter. So just trying to gauge like order of magnitude on, is that sort of 70 to 100 basis point range kind of rate when all the noise settles out or is there something that\u2019s going to eat in the gross margin expansion more as we move through the balance of the year?","Donal L. Mulligan","This year we were up 290 basis points. Last year in the comparable quarter we were down, I believe was 200 basis points. So to think about a full year increase in the 50 to 100 basis points is a pretty fair range to be in.","Bryan Spillane","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","David Driscoll","Great, thank you, good morning.","Kendall J. Powell ","Hi, David.","David Driscoll","Don, first question for you is just with the quarter up 30% year-on-year, did this quarter exceed your internal expectations?","Donal L. Mulligan","We were pleased with the sales growth. I think the cost pieces that came in were pretty much right in line with our expectations, because again they were pretty foreseeable in terms of the merchandising timing, the cost savings, the inflation. What I would say is we are very pleased with U.S. retail sales. The volume came in probably a point ahead of our expectations and from a company standpoint; stripping out Annie\u2019s and ForEx we had organic volume growth of 1% and price mix of 1%. So a total sales of, organic sales growth of 2% and we haven\u2019t seen a quarter like that in a couple of years. ","So we felt good about the start, and what I would say is we\u2019ll continue to monitor that and we\u2019ll handle the proceeds of that similar to what we\u2019ve done with our plan and our cost savings which is if we see some plus there is going to be we invest back and some that we flow and we will keep you apprised of what we see.","David Driscoll","Okay, but it sounds like it might be fair to say that you did better in the first quarter. You keep your guidance the same, because at least your constant currency guidance is same, but the FX guidance all-in is worse by a nickel, you have got this dilution that\u2019s kind of not incorporated into the guidance of 5% to 7% from Green Giant, but all things equal here the first quarter is off to a very good start and there are positives. But maybe just too early to want to do anything to the guidance, is that a fair recap?","Donal L. Mulligan","I think that is a fair recap. We feel good about the quarter, it did come a little ahead of our expectation, on the top line and obviously flowed through to the -- a little bit better on the bottom line but it\u2019s only one quarter, and as Ken and Shawn talked about most of our initiatives are still in front of us which we feel good about but we want to see play out before we revise our expectations for the full year.","David Driscoll","Ken, on International it sounds like on a constant currency basis whenever I hear that, it never really sounds that bad, and then when I look over at the International profit line it\u2019s down like 20%. So I guess what I struggle with is just understanding why we are not seeing more pricing, given the sizable FX headwinds there and just the magnitude of profit decline seems quite large, what can be done about this?","Kendall J. Powell ","That\u2019s an excellent question and Don will be very happy to\u2026","Donal L. Mulligan","Well, first of all, I will tackle the question on the earnings. I mean, again we were 20% down, strip out ForEx it was 30 -- it was 3% and that has a number of factors, anything from transaction FX to launch cost for Yoplait in China. So some timing items as well. We still fully expect not only mid-single digit sales growth on a constant currency basis in international but margin expansion on top of that. So we still feel good about how the year will play out. ","In terms of your question on pricing, pricing comes into play locally, when there is local inflation that\u2019s offsetting it. If there is not necessarily economic factors that are driving it, it\u2019s a little bit tougher to get pricing in the marketplace but we take pricing where we believe that we have the opportunity to do it and you have seen that come through probably most fully in our Latin American markets overtime where you do see local inflation.","David Driscoll","And maybe just one follow-on on the international side did China worsen here, has the run rate continued to get worse, given the last couple of quarters here and the comments on Wanchai Ferry?","Donal L. Mulligan","We can follow up with you. My recollection is that it's been -- it was pretty stable. It was better in Q4 and it was, I mean we were kind of -- we were down 1% here in Q1. But I mean it's basically been stable. And so I would say it didn't worsen. Of course we'd like -- we need to see it improve.","David Driscoll","Okay. I'll pass along. Thank you so much.","Kendall J. Powell ","Maybe one more question.","Operator","And the last question comes from line of Jonathan Flee with Atos Research [ph]. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Good morning. Thanks very much. Just a detail question and a little bigger picture one. First would be, I think in the prior quarters you've given us the contribution between pricing and volume on Annie's to the U.S. retail business. If you have that detail and you could give it, I would appreciate, just trying to work through that on U.S. Retail. And the second question would be bigger picture, ex the new launches would you say that retail, so just as you think about your promotional strategy, going into this holiday selling season, independent of any new products. Are retail or inventory levels above the average because of your potential promotional plan at this point or is it really -- is that maybe a little bit of that build that was mentioned earlier in the call, I think by Rob, is all of that new product driven. Thanks very much.","Donal L. Mulligan","Well, I'll take the Annie's question, Jonathan. Annie's was a three point benefit to our net sales U.S. overall net sales. Two points of that was volume and one point was price mix.","Unidentified Analyst","Got you, okay.","Donal L. Mulligan","As you saw on the slide the company was one point each.","Kendall J. Powell ","I don't -- do we know the answer to the second\u2026?","Shawn P. O'Grady ","On inventories, we believe that our inventory levels are actually inline as we go in to Q2 this year. That was not as much the case last year when we were in this position. So I would expect, as Don indicated earlier that kind of our movements and our earnings [ph] should kind of track well from here on now.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. Okay, thanks very much.","Jeff Siemon","We know our friends that cannot go [ph] on the phone. So I think we should wrap up here.","A - Kendall J. Powell ","Okay. Thanks everyone.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Have a great day."],"10267":["General Mills, Inc.

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, September 18, 2019.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Jeff Siemon, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jeff Siemon","Thanks, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us for the General Mills first quarter earnings call. I'm here with Jeff Harmening, our Chairman and CEO; Don Mulligan, our CFO; and Jon Nudi, who leads our North America Retail segment, who is here for the Q&A portion of the call.","And before I turn it over to them, let me cover a few housekeeping items. A press release on our Q1 results this morning was issued over the wire services, and you can find the release and a copy of the slides that supplement our remarks this morning on our Investor Relations website.","Please note that our remarks this morning will include forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions. The second slide in today's presentation lists factors that could cause our future results to be different than our current estimates.","And with that, let me turn it over to my colleagues, beginning with Jeff.","Jeffrey Harmening","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter net sales performance included encouraging improvement in North America Retail and strong growth in our Pet segment, driven by good innovation and effective brand-building investment. We got off to a slower start in our other segments, and we expect topline improvement in those segments and for the Company starting in the second quarter.","On the bottom line, we delivered profit and earnings growth ahead of our expectations while continuing to invest in our brands and our capabilities. We remain on track to deliver our fiscal 2020 goals, including accelerating our organic sales growth, maintaining our strong margins and reducing leverage.","Slide 5 summarizes our first quarter financial results. Net sales totaled $4 billion, down 2%. Organic net sales declined 1% with lower volume, partially offset by a positive price mix across all operating segments.","Adjusted operating profit grew 7% in constant currency driven by a one-time purchase accounting adjustment in the Pet segment in last year's first quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $0.79 and grew 13% in constant currency, driven by higher profits and below the line favorability.","As a reminder, we outlined three key fiscal 2020 priorities on our Q4 earnings call. First, we will accelerate our organic sales growth. We are working to improve growth in North America Retail by maintaining momentum on Cereal and improving U.S. Yogurt and U.S. Snacks.","We are also focused on driving another year of strong growth on Blue Buffalo. We delivered solid results for these segments in the first quarter. The results in our remaining three segments were below our expectations. In a few moments, I'll share how we'll step up the Company's organic growth rate starting in Q2.","Our second priority is to maintain our strong margins and we delivered positive results here in Q1. And our final priority for 2020 is to maintain a disciplined focus on cash to achieve our fiscal 2020 leverage target and we had a good start to the year on this measure as well.","With these priorities in mind, I'll cover our Q1 segment results in detail with a particular focus on the topline before turning it over to Don to review our performance on margins and cash flow.","Turning to the components of net sales growth on Slide 7. Organic net sales were down 1% from a year-ago, driven by lower volume, partially offset by a positive price mix across all five segments. Foreign exchange was a one-point drag in the quarter.","First quarter organic sales for North America Retail were flat, compared to the prior year, which was a two-point improvement on our fourth quarter trend, and we delivered net sales improvement across most of our operating units.","In U.S. Cereal, we maintained our positive momentum with net sales up 1%. We saw early traction in U.S. Snacks with net sales down to 1% compared to a 4% decline in fiscal 2019. U.S. Yogurt net sales were flat to last year and I'm happy to say that our strategic revenue management actions drove one-point of positive price mix.","Constant Currency segment operating profit increased 2% in the first quarter, driven by benefits from HMM cost-savings and positive price mix, partially offset by input cost inflation and higher brand-building investments. Our in-market performance in North America Retail also stepped up in Q1.","As you can see on Slide 9, we've driven a steady improvement in our two-year retail sales trends since fiscal 2017. In the first quarter, our U.S. Nielsen-measured retail sales were flat versus a year-ago and we held or grew share in five of our 10 largest categories including Cereal, Refrigerated Dough, and Soup. We know we still have room to improve including some key categories like Yogurt and Snacks, and we'll continue to focus there to strengthen our overall growth profile.","Let's dive a bit deeper into our first quarter performance in North America Retail, starting with Cereal. We grew U.S. Cereal retail sales in fiscal 2018 and 2019 and our results accelerated in the first quarter with retail sales up 1%. We outpaced the category, expanding our share of leadership position through increased investment behind compelling consumer ideas such as our Cheerios Heart Health Campaign and strong in-store execution and events.","We also had another impressive quarter on innovation with the top five new products in the category including Blueberry Cheerios and Cinnamon Toast Crunch Churros. I am very pleased by our performance in U.S. Cereal and I'm excited about the plans we have for the rest of the year to continue our momentum. We are executing well on the fundamentals of innovation and brand-building and we'll continue to drive these levers in the rest of the year.","Last year, we improved U.S. Yogurt retail sales behind our strategy to expand in the faster-growing segments of the category and to support our core with brand-building investment and on-trend equity news.","In fiscal 2020, we'll continue to improve U.S. Yogurt with a strong lineup of innovation, brand-building and product news. Through the first three months of the year, yogurt retail sales were down 2%. We drove retail sales growth on the core with Original Style Yoplait flat to last year and Go-GURT up 13% due to increased distribution on Go-GURT Dunkers and Go-GURT Simply as well as strong back-to-school merchandising.","The Simply Better segment, which now represents 12% of the category, continues to be an attractive growth space. We drove 8% retail sales growth on our products in this segment behind our better-tasting YQ product reformulation, which now prominently features the protein benefit on the updated packaging. And we launched into a growing beverage segment with our new Yoplait Smoothies. In total, we like the news and innovation we are bringing to the U.S. Yogurt category this year to drive further improvement in our retail sales trends.","Turning to U.S. Snacks. We have a long track record of growth on this business. However, fiscal 2019 was certainly a more challenging year. In fiscal 2020, we're focused on improving our performance behind innovation, renovation, brand-building support, and in-store execution.","In the first quarter, retail sales were down 2% cutting our fourth quarter declines in half. Retail sales trends for Nature Valley improved each month during Q1, driven by positive results of our wafer bar innovation and a stronger back-to-school merchandising season.","Retail sales for Fiber One have also improved each month since we reformulated the product line to be more relevant for modern weight managers. While we still have distribution losses from earlier this calendar year, our gross returns per point of distribution have stepped up in recent months. For the remainder of the year, we'll continue to execute our F 2020 plans on bars and we expect to see continued retail sales improvement.","We are focused on competing effectively everywhere we play, including our profitable $4 billion U.S. Meals & Baking operating unit. First quarter retail sales for Old El Paso grew 5% due to increased distribution, consumer news and merchandising as well as price realization across channels.","We returned soup to both retail sales and share growth in the first quarter. We drove retail sales up 2% due to a broad-based strength in the soup portfolio and we have solid plans in place for the upcoming soup season.","We had a great year on our refrigerated dough in fiscal 2019 and that performance has continued into this year. First quarter retail sales were up 2% and market share increased by a full point driven by distribution gains and in-store execution behind innovation.","In total, we are off to a good start on these businesses, and we think we\u2019ll step up to have a successful year on U.S. Meals & Baking. Overall, we are encouraged by our first quarter results in North America Retail and we are focused on the right priorities to improve organic sales growth in fiscal 2020.","Shifting gears to Pet. I am pleased to say that we had a great first quarter with net sales up 7%. This includes lapping an extra week of reported results in last year's first quarter. Excluding this timing difference, net sales were up in the mid-teens. Our growth was led by our expansion into the food, drug and mass channel, and we generated seven-points of positive price mix in the quarter.","Looking at in-market performance, we drove all-channel retail sales up low double-digits, and we grew share again in the quarter. First quarter segment operating profit totaled $81 million, compared to $14 million a year-ago, driven by the $53 million purchase accounting adjustment in last year's Q1 as well as higher net sales this quarter.","On Slide 15, you can see how the key components of our double-digit retail sales growth breakout by channel. Retail sales were up more than 100% in the food, drug and mass channel as we benefited from our expansion to new customers and the launch of Wilderness in food, drug and mass in last year's fourth quarter.","Importantly, retail sales for food, drug and mass customers who have carried BLUE more than 12 months were up 50% versus last year. As we expected, retail sales and pet specialty continued to decline by double-digits. This is an important channel for BLUE and we continue to support the channel through unique programs and innovation.","For example, in the second quarter, we're launching CARNIVORA, a new super premium offering for pets exclusively into the pet specialty channel. We also have plans to execute exclusive programs in this channel later this year, including our new Baby Blue program, which we'll tell you more about next quarter.","And BLUE continues to win in the rapidly evolving e-commerce channel with retail sales up 20% in the quarter, resulting in further market share gains. We remain on track to deliver 8% to 10% like-for-like growth for our Pet segment this year.","We're also focused on a successful leadership transition as Billy Bishop moves into a Founder and Brand Advisor role in January; and Bethany Quam, currently President of our Europe and Australia segment assumes day-to-day management of the Pet segment. We remain confident in this business and are excited about the growth prospects ahead.","In the Convenience and Foodservice segment, organic sales were down 4% in the quarter, primarily driven by lower bakery flour volume and the negative impact of flour index pricing, both of which resulted from a decline in an underlying wheat prices during the quarter.","Despite near-term pressure from flour, we continue to drive good growth on our higher margin Focus 6 platforms. Net sales for these platforms were up 2% in the first quarter, driven by strong performance in the K-12 schools, including our new two-ounce equivalent grain cereals and our bulk Yoplait yogurt. Segment operating profit in Q1 declined 6% from year-ago levels that were up 14%.","In Europe and Australia, organic sales declined 5% due primarily to a challenging retail environment in France impacting yogurt and ice cream, where we were unable to secure agreements with some key accounts on inflation-driven price advances resulting in loss distribution.","Additionally, we had a headwind in the UK and France driven by changes in merchandising timing. On a positive note, we drove good retail sales growth on snack bars and Old El Paso behind innovation and consumer news.","First quarter segment operating profit decreased 15% in constant currency, driven primarily by the timing of brand-building expense and lower volume, partially offset by positive price mix.","In Asia and Latin America, organic sales declined 3%. Sales in our three key emerging markets Brazil, India, and China fell short of our expectations in the quarter. In Brazil, we saw retailers draw down inventories early in the quarter.","In India, we changed our route to market to focus on more strategic and profitable distribution. And in China, we saw lower volumes on H\u00e4agen-Dazs due to slower consumer traffic in shops and on Wanchai Ferry the pricing actions we implemented to cover significant pork inflation.","First quarter segment operating profit in Asia and Latin America totaled $10 million, down $2 million versus a year-ago primarily due to lower net sales. Looking ahead, we expect to drive improved organic sales trends for the Company beginning in Q2.","Slide 19 summarizes our key focus areas by segment. In North America Retail, we'll continue to focus on maintaining momentum in U.S. Cereal while improving U.S. Yogurt and Snacks.","In Pet, we'll continue to drive strong retail sales growth in the food, drug and mass and e-commerce channels, and we\u2019ll execute exclusive innovation and programs in Pet specialty. In the remaining three segments, we'll see acceleration in our organic sales growth starting in Q2.","In Convenience and Foodservice, improvement will be led by our Focus 6 platforms, where we'll benefit from strong innovation in Schools and Convenience Stores. We also expect bakery flour volume will improve, that we continue to expect index pricing on flour, which is profit neutral to be a drag on net sales.","In Europe and Australia, we'll benefit from increased merchandising and we'll continue to drive strong performance on snack bars and Old El Paso. We'll also lap the impact of our distribution loss on H\u00e4agen-Dazs in the second half of the year.","In Asia and Latin America, the retail inventory in Brazil and distribution headwinds in India that we experienced in Q1 are largely behind us, and we expect to see improvement in the second quarter driven by new strategic revenue management actions and increased levels of innovation from H\u00e4agen-Dazs cones in Asia, Betty Crocker ready-to-eat snacks in the Middle East and new spicy dumplings in China.","With that, I'll turn it over to Don to review our Q1 performance on margins and cash flow. Don?","Donal Mulligan","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Let me begin on Slide 21 by summarizing our joint venture results in the quarter. CPW posted topline growth for the fourth consecutive quarter with constant currency net sales up 2%. CPWs growth was broad-based with continued momentum in the UK, Australia and the Asia, Middle East and Africa regions, as well as a return to growth in Latin America.","H\u00e4agen-Dazs Japan net sales grew 6% in constant currency driven primarily by growth in core minicups and a comparison to a double-digit decline in last year's Q1. First quarter combined after-tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $22 million, compared to $18 million a year-ago, driven by lower restructuring charges at CPW and higher net sales, partially offset by higher brand-building expenses.","Turning to total company margins on Slide 22. First quarter adjusted gross margin and adjusted operating profit margin were up 160 basis points and 130 basis points respectively, driven by benefits from positive price mix in all segments and last year's $53 million purchase accounting inventory adjustment in the Pet segment.","Input cost inflation and Holistic Margin Management cost savings were largely offsetting in Q1. And for the full-year, we continue to expect input cost inflation in HMM to be 4% of cost of goods.","Slide 23 summarizes other noteworthy Q1 income statement items. Corporate unallocated expenses, excluding certain items affecting comparability increased by $22 million in the quarter. Net interest expense decreased $15 million, driven by lower average debt balances and lower interest rates. The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 20.9%, compared to 22.7% a year-ago, driven by international discrete tax benefits in fiscal 2020. In Q1, average diluted shares outstanding were up 1%.","Slide 24 provides our balance sheet and cash flow highlights in the quarter. Our core working capital totaled $624 million, down 7% versus last year's first quarter, driven by continued improvements in accounts payable.","First quarter cash flow from operations was $572 million, down 6% from last year, driven largely by slower core working capital reduction versus last year's Q1, partially offset by higher net earnings. Capital investments totaled $70 million and we paid $298 million in dividends in the quarter.","As detailed on Slide 25, we remain on track to deliver our fiscal 2020 guidance. We expect organic net sales to increase 1% to 2%. With an updated view on foreign currency, we now expect the combination of currency translation, the impact of divestitures executed in fiscal 2019 and contributions from the 53 week in fiscal 2020 to increase reported net sales by approximately 1%.","Constant currency adjusted operating profit is expected to increase 2% to 4%. Constant currency adjusted diluted EPS is expected to increase 3% to 5% from the base of $3.22 earned in fiscal 2019. We currently estimate that foreign currency will be immaterial to adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS.","We continue to target free cash flow conversion of at least 95% of adjusted after-tax earnings and we remain on track to achieve our leverage goal of 3.5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA by the end of the fiscal year.","Now I'll turn it back over to Jeff for some closing comments.","Jeffrey Harmening","Thanks, Don. And before we close, let me add a little bit more color on our Q1 results relative to our expectations. We feel very good about our performance in North America Retail and in Pet, where our Q1 organic sales results were modestly ahead of our expectations.","For our other three segments, we expected coming into the year that Q1 will be the slowest quarter of growth driven in part by the fact that we were lapping our strongest quarter of growth for each of these segments last year.","Our Q1 results in these segments were a bit below our expectations, largely driven by the shortfall in flour and Convenience and Foodservice and the retail inventory reduction in Brazil. We had expected and continue to expect to see growth ramp up in these segments starting in Q2, driven by the factors I mentioned a moment ago.","On the bottom line, our Q1 profit and earnings per share results were ahead of our expectations, and based on those Q1 results and our plans for the remainder of the year, I am pleased to say that we remain on track to deliver our full-year fiscal 2020 goals.","With that, let me open up the line for questions. Operator, can you please get us started?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Andrew Lazar","Hi. Good morning, everybody.","Donal Mulligan","Good morning.","Jeffrey Harmening","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar","Hey. I guess, first off with organic sales in fiscal 1Q, particularly in the three segments, you talked about a bit below expectations. I guess in order to get back to your own sort of original internal plan for the year, would you expect that to come from really more a recovery in the international and CS&F segments? Or anticipating North America Retail and Pet need to maybe bear a little bit more of the weight around accelerating than initially planned?","Jeffrey Harmening","So Andrew, the first thing I would say is that we \u2013 we did reiterate guidance for the full-year of 1% to 2% growth, and we feel good about that because as I said, primarily the two things that we're different than what we expected were flour index pricing on the flour and retail inventory in Brazil.","And the retail inventory in Brazil, we think we'll correct itself starting in the second quarter, which leaves the retail flour piece, the index pricing on flour really the biggest difference versus expectations.","As we head into the rest of the year, we fully expect without giving guidance on each and every segment, we fully expect that the segments that were below our expectations will improve significantly in the second quarter. And I would say we've got good momentum on Pet and we've got good momentum on North America Retail, which are our most profitable businesses, and I don't see any reason why that momentum shouldn't continue into the second quarter as well.","Andrew Lazar","Got it. And that's helpful. I appreciate it. And then just lastly would be, I think in fiscal 2019, you had mentioned that about in North America Retail and maybe this is best for Jon. I think seven of 10 categories held or gain share. I think this quarter it was five of 10. I know that can move around probably quarter-by-quarter, but anything to read into that that we need to think about as we go forward through the year? Thanks so much.","Jonathon Nudi","Yes. Hi, Andrew. I guess, overall, I'd say the short answer is no. We feel really good about the trajectory of our business. At our Investor Day, we said we wanted to do three things. One is continue our momentum on the Cereal and we did that in Q1, up 1%. We feel really good about that.","And then we wanted to improve our performance in Snack Bars and Yogurt, and we were able to accomplish that as well. So again, we feel very much like we are on track again quarter-to-quarter, you have some levels and share, but overall, we feel like we're performing well and are on track for what we expect for the year.","Andrew Lazar","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. The line is open. Please proceed.","John Baumgartner","Good morning. Thanks for the question. Jon, just looking at the narrowed gap between shipments and takeaway in North America in the quarter, I think the outlook for fiscal 2020 was that you continue to see retailer destocking. So are you seeing anything there improving a bit sooner than expected? Or are there any discrete benefits in terms of Q1 shipments that may be reverse or moderate going forward.","Jonathon Nudi","Hi, John. As we mentioned in fiscal 2019, we saw about a point gap between RNS and Nielsen, really driven by retailers focusing on reducing the working capital and inventories. We expect that to continue. It's not readily apparent, but due to rounding, we still saw about a half point gap in Q1 between RNS and movement. And we do expect to see a gap throughout the year, and again, we'll have to see how much that is as the year plays out.","John Baumgartner","Okay. And then just a follow-up on U.S. Yogurt. One pillar to that strategy is stabilizing Yoplait Light. I mean, you're still cycling through some pretty big year-on-year distribution losses there. It's been flat sequentially I guess since January. I'm curious, looking at the recovery in Go-GURT, which also went through distribution losses, you\u2019re back to mid single-digit growth there. Do you have a sense of confidence that maybe once you get into the back half of fiscal 2020, Yoplait Light does begin to at least stabilize back to the dollar growth overall? I mean is that kind of finding the bottom for distribution at this point?","Jonathon Nudi","Again, the short answer I think is yes. And as we look at our business, our biggest business, our Original Style Yoplait, the Red Cup, and that was flat, actually grew slightly in Q1. And then Go-GURT is a really important kid business for us as well. So we'd say that's the core.","The tail is really Light and Greek. And Greek, for all intents and purposes, has very little comp left there. And then Light, we do believe it\u2019s stabilizing and we've got some marketing that we're going to be rolling up throughout the year that we think can improve that.","But if you look at the Yogurt business, I would actually focus on, again Original Style Yoplait and Go-GURT, and then the Simply Better segment, which is where we think the category is going. 12% of the category today, I think like Oui and YQ, it's growing double-digits and we're the share leader, and we continue to introduce new products into that segment as well.","So we feel good about our plans for yogurt. Again, coming out at Investor Day, we said we wanted to improve half of that down two in fiscal 2019. We were able to do that in Q1 and feel like we have good plans in place to move forward.","John Baumgartner","Great. Thank you for your time.","Jonathon Nudi","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. The line is open. Please proceed.","Kenneth Goldman","Hi. Good morning and thank you. I wanted to ask two questions. Number one, in terms of organic volume, I know you don't want to be too specific on quarters, but you did talk about the second quarter, getting a little bit better. You do have an easier comparison, there are some better factors as you mentioned in terms of Brazil and so forth. Is it reasonable for us to model in at least flat organic volume as you see it in the second quarter now? Or is it a little bit optimistic?","Jeffrey Harmening","Yes. I think that we're certainly going to get better on organic volume and you'll see the biggest change in that and actually in Convenience and Foodservice because flour is pretty heavy and we lost a lot of volume in Convenience and Foodservice.","And so as we get our pricing back in line and we share innovation kicking in Convenience and Foodservice, actually you\u2019ll see a pretty good volume gain there because we won't have as much of a negative drag from flour and we've got some good innovation in K-12 schools.","Kenneth Goldman","Okay. Thank you for that. And then I wanted to ask, Jeff and Jon, you did talk about snacks getting a little bit better from a percent basis, but if you look at the comparison, look at the two-year, it did actually worsen a little bit from the fourth quarter of 2019.","I'm just curious, when can we think about a real turnaround in snacking when the absolute dollars start to rise and we start seeing legitimate improvement there because it feels like the improvement this quarter perhaps was just on an easier comparison a little bit.","Jonathon Nudi","Yes. So Ken, this is Jon. As you look at our snack business, it\u2019s really three key businesses, the first the snack bars and I want to dig into that in a little bit more detail. The second one is fruit snacks, and the third is salty. And fruit salty had a good Q1 combined they grew year-over-year and we need to make sure that we continue that as we move forward.","If you remember, we had capacity constraints from fruit in fiscal 2019. We now have capacity, so we feel like we're going to accelerate on fruit as we move throughout the year. So we feel good about those businesses. I think the story is going to really be about snack bars.","And as we've talked, it's really about Nature Valley and Fiber One. On the Nature Valley in fiscal 2019, our innovation wasn't where we need it to be and we missed the key back-to-school merchandising window.","As you look at Q1 on Nature Valley, we had a very good back-to-school, in fact incremental and displays were up double-digits in the month of August. And our innovation is Krispy Kreme wafer bar, which is off to a really good start. So we saw sequential improvement month-by-month on Nature Valley, and we expect that to continue.","And Fiber One, that's been again a challenging business for us over the last three or four years with significant declines. We renovated the product in the spring, and are seeing some really encouraging results. So if you remember, we went to 70 calories on Fiber One Brownies, five grams net carbs, two grams of sugar and really get back in line with modern weight managers going from five Weight Watchers points to two, and the early results are quite encouraging.","In fact, we've seen our turns from point of distribution up double-digits. Our distribution is down year-over-year, so that will be a bit of a drag. I think the inflection point from a distribution standpoint were really be the turn of the calendar year as we lap some significant distribution declines in both Nature Valley and Fiber One. So we are encouraged. We believe that we're very much on or maybe slightly ahead of where we expect it to be at this point on snacking and feel like we'll improve as we move throughout the year.","Kenneth Goldman","Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please proceed.","David Palmer","Thanks. Good morning. Just a question on Pet. Just looking at the numbers that we see in Scanner Data and also looking at those statistics you had on the other channels, and wondering what you think we will be seeing in the coming quarters.","And we're seeing that SKU count going up a lot. ACV is going up a lot. And then you mentioned specialty is down double-digits, but you have some new offerings going there and then e-commerce. So could you give us a sense of what we're going to see throughout this fiscal year by channel and maybe the complexion of the growth? Thanks.","Jeffrey Harmening","Yes. David, I think you will see us continue to grow in the food, drug and mass channel, especially through the second and the third quarter behind distribution build that we have on Life Protection Formula, so increased distribution there as well as the rollout of Wilderness across previously existing customers.","And we're really pleased to see in the food, drug and mass channel, we have year-over-year growth, which I think is really important. So not only have we gained distribution, but as consumers are starting to find it more in that channel, they're really going to Blue Buffalo. So we like the growth we see in food, drug and mass and certainly over the next couple of quarters, we see continued growth in that channel.","In the Pet specialty channel, as you noted, we had double-digit declines in the first quarter. We certainly think that will probably still decline in those channels over the coming quarters. We will hope we'll get a little bit better. As you can see, we've got some innovation and things like CARNIVORA and like Baby Blue. We're still lapping some distribution losses, but we're starting to see some traction on some of our innovation and some of our marketing ideas.","And so as we go throughout the year, we would certainly expect for that channel will get a little bit better. And then with e-commerce, we feel good about what we're doing in e-commerce. I think I mentioned at the end of last year that the e-commerce channel for Pet had slowed a little bit, but we would see an increase in this coming year we thought. And that's exactly what we're saying and our performance is good in e-commerce. So we have a high degree of confidence that will continue to grow and be the market leader in the e-commerce channel.","Donal Mulligan","And the only thing I would add to that is that as you recall at our Investor Day, we talked about the calendar differences in Pet this year. So we had a one-week drag in the first quarter that Jeff alluded to in our comments and then we'll have a one-month addition in the fourth quarter, we'll also then be lapping the rollout to Walmart in the beginning of the Wilderness expansion. So as we said in the Investor Day, we expect Q2 and Q3 to be our strongest organic growth quarters, ex the calendar changes.","David Palmer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Laurent Grandet with Guggenheim. The line is open. Please proceed.","Laurent Grandet","Hey. Good morning, Jeff and Don. Thanks for the opportunity. So let me first focus on the other segments. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned you\u2019re off to a slower start and that you were taking action to address topline improvement in second quarter. I know you alluded to some of those in your comments, but could you please elaborate a bit more on those three different subsegments? And I will have a second question, please.","Jeffrey Harmening","So we'll go around. In Europe and Australia, what will improve in the second quarter is that, we will return to our increased merchandising levels because we really had lower merchandising levels in the first quarter, vis-a-vis a year-ago. And so we had our strongest quarter of the year last year in Europe and Australia, and it was driven by two things, a strong ice cream season and higher merchandising levels.","We\u2019ll return to higher merchandising levels in the second quarter. So we have a high degree of confidence in the UK and France to our biggest markets, our performance is going to improve. We'll still be lapping some distribution losses on H\u00e4agen-Dazs, so it won't get all the way to bright, but it will improve significantly.","In Asia and Latin America, the biggest thing that will change is going to be the trajectory in Brazil. What we thought going into the year that our \u2013 that retail inventories would climb in the first quarter because last year we had a trucker strike as you may or may not recall.","It's materializing later than we had anticipated. And we'll see that pickup in the second quarter of this year. In fact, we've already started to see it. And so Brazil will be the biggest change. Here, we've mentioned India, that in India, we pulled back on some distribution in the first quarter. We were planning on doing it. We pulled back faster than we thought. And what we see in the first quarter, it makes it for a tough first quarter. It should make our second quarter better because we've already taken that distribution out.","And then in Convenience and Foodservice, we certainly have a lot of confidence in that business. And we've been growing that business over the last year or two. We'll pick back up in the second quarter. It really is a matter \u2013 you can see our Focus 6 grew 2%. That becomes a bigger part of our portfolio as kids go back-to-school and our K12 business is strong, and we've got great innovation there. And we've adjusted our flour pricing, so that will be less of a drag. And so we have a high degree of confidence that we'll return to momentum in our Convenience and Foodservice business.","Laurent Grandet","Thanks, Jeff. Very helpful. The second question is \u2013 and Don, no disrespect to your retirement announcement, but one of the major events during the quarter was the announcement of Billy Bishop moving to an advisory role.","Donal Mulligan","[Indiscernible]","Laurent Grandet","Lots of questions about this from investors. I mean could you give us a bit more comfort that this transition would be as smooth as it can be? And explain a bit further the role of adviser that Billy will take.","Jeffrey Harmening","So I think it's a fair question, commentary on Don not included. I thought, I think for Billy, Billy and I have been talking about this for quite a while, this transition. So this is not a surprise transition for us. We had talked about the timing many months ago. And one of the first I'd tell you, one of the things it allowed us to do is to get what I consider to be a great backfill in for Billy. And Bethany Quam, who's a terrific brand builder and knows the sales channel and marketing and really helped us get back on track in C&F a few years ago. And so it allows \u2013 who I think is a \u2013 someone great back in place.","The other thing I would tell you \u2013 it's interesting. When we decided to buy Blue Buffalo, when I first met Billy almost two years ago, there are a few things that made this seem like attractive opportunity. One was the growth space of Pet and the growth of natural and organic. But beyond that, when Bill and I talked, it was interesting how similar the cultures of Blue Buffalo were to General Mills, and also how their strategy for growth parallel our strategy for growth. And how they think about brand-building is very similar to ours. And so the underpinning of that hasn't changed with the new leader coming in. ","And the growth strategy that Billy has outlined is one that we very much believe in and we believed in before we bought Blue Buffalo. And so \u2013 and the way they built the Blue Buffalo brand, when they think about their brand is the same way we think about building our brands, and the kind of leadership that Billy provided, we think that Bethany will provide. In terms of adviser, I'm excited to have Billy come onboard as well as to have Bill senior as well as their brother, Chris. And so the Bishops will still be in an advisory capacity, and they provide a lot of pet experience, a lot of marketing experience, a lot of new product experience.","And this advisory role is nothing new for us. Gene Kahn stayed on for an adviser for many years on the Cascadian Farms in lower America and LARABAR. And so this role of adviser, especially a founder's, is really important. They provide a lot of legacy knowledge about the business, and we're thrilled that Billy and his dad and brother are going to stay on in that capacity.","Laurent Grandet","Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Jason English","Hey. Good morning, folks, and thank you for the question. So I want to delve into Pet a little bit more. We've heard that the Carnivora launches were reasonably well received by Petco and PetSmart, and it sounds like you're getting around four feet of space. A couple of questions on that: A, is that kind of consistent with your expectations? B, when will it hit? And you mentioned sort of a low double-digit retail sales offtake versus a mid single-digit underlying shipment. Was some of that delta, that spread the result of early shipments to the pipeline still ahead of that? And if you are getting four feet, can you give us some sort of context of proportionate to what you have now? Like how much incremental all-in space do you expect in that channel?","Jeffrey Harmening","All right. So let me take those series of questions, Jason, and I'll try to hit all of them. In terms of Carnivora, we're excited about the launch. Most importantly, it really started shipping in August. And that's important because August in the Blue Buffalo calendar actually falls in Q2. So none of the Pet Specialty results that we just talked about for Q1 include Carnivora being in the marketplace. And so we'll \u2013 that's why as we think about Pet Specialty, our initiatives to improve the growth in that channel really start in Q2 and Carnivora is a piece of that.","The growth expectations you talked about will certainly be consistent with what we would have in mind. We think they'll be incremental. It is certainly accretive from a price per pound perspective because it is really premium priced even to Wilderness. So to the extent that there is steal from other product lines, I mean it'll certainly be price accretive for General Mills.","And there's one more question you had that I \u2013 Oh, shipments, the difference in shipments really and consumption is that it's really the extra week. So it's not necessarily inventory build. It's really the extra week because our \u2013 kind of our like-for-like sales were up mid-teens in terms of growth. And so the difference between that and retail and what we reported was really one extra week, and our shipments lined up pretty well with our external takeaway.","Jason English","Got it. Okay. I'm tracking. That makes sense to me. And in terms of the margin profile for the business relatively healthy even absent the step-up, the lumpiness of the inventory step-up cost. Do you still \u2013 is that business, the profitability, still being burdened by the plant start-up expense? And could you remind us sort of the cadence to that start up and what sort of margin acceleration, we should see as you ramp capacity in this new facility?","Donal Mulligan","Yes, we've largely through Q1 now digested the plant start-up costs. So the benefit of the new plant will begin coming through as you alluded to, we're pleased with the Q1 margin performance beyond just the step-up, just the increase of the lapping the inventory step-up charge from last year, we had nice flow through on the incremental sales that we saw on a like-for-like basis, and we expect that to continue for the year. We expect this business \u2013 and while we're talking, our business, to be \u2013 going to be actually most profitable segments. And I think you'll see that is the year unfolds.","Jeffrey Harmening","To build on Don's comment I think the other reason we saw good profitability in the first quarter was because of our pricing. I know there's been a lot of discussion on pricing and Pet, but we saw seven points of price mix and we saw all \u2013 kind of all sizes of our Pet products improve in pricing in the first quarter, and while we sold 85% more of the small bag. We sold 220% more of the larger bags and so the, as we look at it. Our price per unit was up I think 15% or something like that. So in addition to what Don talked about in terms of the plan start-up. We also saw good pricing in the first quarter.","Jason English","Got it. Thank you very much guys. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Jaffray. The line is open. Please proceed.","Michael Lavery","Good morning. Thank you.","Jeffrey Harmening","Good morning, Michael.","Donal Mulligan","Good morning.","Michael Lavery","Could you just dissect price mix a little bit further, obviously there is a bit of a lift from just better momentum on Blue Buffalo and some of what you just referenced, within that segment as well, but are there any trade promotion timing shifts or anything we should watch out for in terms of pacing. And then a separate from that, can you just dissect a little bit what the drivers \u2013 is it some of the more weight outs or list pricing, what are some of the mechanics of how you're building the good momentum you're getting there?","Jeffrey Harmening","Well, I would say. Let me start with an answer. I mean pricing in Pet is probably the most complicated ventures because there are so many different sizes and formats available. And so if I go too far on the weeds, I'm afraid we may lose everybody. But what I say is that as we look at, we did take list pricing last January. So we did see some list pricing, we also saw some positive mix by bringing wilderness in.","And the other thing I mentioned our small sizes less than five pounds we actually, increased the price of that over the quarter by 15% and the price per pound is pretty high, and the small bags. And we sold a lot more of the larger bags the 10 pounds to 20 pounds and we increased the dollar sales a load by 220%, and the pricing of that was up 9%.","And so \u2013 and there are a whole lot of things going on. But I think that's why I read it back up to \u2013 we get seven points of price mix and total and some of it was less pricing and some of it is mix and we think we'll continue to see some pricing into the next quarter on less pricing and we'll see some more on the mix as well.","Michael Lavery","And I apologize. That's very helpful color. Maybe I've worded it poorly. But I meant total company, with that being a piece. Can you just touch on some of the broader levers, just as far as the rest of portfolio?","Donal Mulligan","Yes, Michael. This is Don. We continue to expect their price mix is going to be a positive contributor all year. Each of our segments have plans in place to drive price mix some through price, some through mix, some through a combination. I think if you look quarter-to-quarter, Jeff touched on some of the dynamics, you'll see in Pet.","One of the things I would highlight is the other thing that we touched on was the shift in timing of our promotional activity in EU, particularly in the UK and France, which is going to shift more into Q2 and Q1 on a year-over-year basis, that would be the other thing that I would point to.","We also do not expect weak prices to rebound. So the drag that we saw for weak prices in the first quarter in C&F will continue to expect volume to improve at our flour, but not necessarily the pricing component. Some of the main other that I think you're going to see fairly consistent and positive pricing through the year, not certainly at the level of the Plus 3 we saw in the first quarter, but the full-year we still expect it to be positive.","Michael Lavery","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. The line is open. Please proceed.","Robert Moskow","Hi, good morning.","Jeffrey Harmening","Good morning, Robert.","Robert Moskow","Hi, there. I've just two questions, one is your share gains in breakfast cereal have been really impressive, the execution has been great. Should we expect tougher comparisons for the rest of the year in terms of market share gains for breakfast cereal just because you're lapping some launches or do you think that you can continue that momentum?","And then second question is on Convenience and Foodservice, I get the impact of the flower, but your profits are down to in the quarter. And I was just wondering, I thought I remembered last year that you had taken pricing maybe ahead of inflation in your Convenience Store part of the business, and I thought that there was kind of a risk that, okay, at some point that pricing would have to come back down. Am I misinterpreting that? Or should we assume that your pricing in Convenience and Foodservice ex flour is still in line with inflation? Thanks.","Jonathon Nudi","HI. Rob. This is Jon. I'll take the U.S. Cereal question first. I would say we feel really, really good about our Cereal business in the U.S. we grew an absolute terms for the third consecutive quarter we've actually grown share for seven of the last eight quarters, and it's really behind very strong fundamentals starting with brand building, I tell you that we're more clear than ever on who are.","Core consumers are for each of our brands, whether that be your boomers for having that cereals where we're serving up cholesterol messaging and heart health; whether it's being on Reese's Puffs, collaborating with Travis Scott, or finally, on Wheaties, doing things like partnering with Serena Williams and the U.S. Women's National Soccer team. I think our marketing is as strong as it's been for quite some time, and that's really driving our baselines.","And then Jeff touched on the upfront remarks on innovation. We had five of the top six products in the category in fiscal 2019. And our innovation in fiscal 2020 is off to a good start with Blueberry Cheerios and Peanut Butter Chex. So we would expect to continue to perform well and we fully intend to continue to hold and grow our share leadership in the category.","Robert Moskow","Got it.","Donal Mulligan","And Rob, on C&F, your recollection is correct. We did \u2013 we start taking pricing at the end of our F 2018, we saw the benefit of that in our Q1 of F 2019 that's one of the contributors to the fact that we grew profit 14% last year, it would be top line 4% and the bottom line is 14%.","And set pricing \u2013 the pricing has held we are lapping it though. But we did have positive two points of price mix in Q1, which is a reflection of the fact that pricing has held, and we continue to expect with food service to have positive price mix for the full year.","Robert Moskow","Okay. So we shouldn't expect kind of a give back on profits as a result of that. It's like you've taken the pricing you've held it and you're now in line with your inflation?","Jeffrey Harmening","Yes. That's correct. We just in Q1, it was just lapping the initial \u2013 initial in case of the price increase.","Robert Moskow","Got it. Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. The line is open. Please proceed.","Alexia Howard","Good morning, everyone.","Jeffrey Harmening","Good morning.","Alexia Howard","All right. So just a couple of quick questions here, firstly on pets. I think one of the larger players, talked about increasing competitive \u2013 increasingly competitive pricing in the Pet Specialty channel, particularly around trial-sized bags.","Is that something that you saw? Or is it really just not something that particularly directly in competition with you clearly you've managed to take pricing and mixed up kind of across the board.","But I'm just curious about those competitive dynamics in there. And then sticking with pet are you able to make any preparations for the likely increase in meat prices next year because of African swine fever? Or do you believed that your mix of meat is likely to mean that you're really not that exposed to that potential increase in input costs? Thank you very much and I'll pass it on.","Jeffrey Harmening","Yes. So, Alexia, on the pricing, first, I would say from a macro perspective, kind of starting with consumer, you don't win in the Pet segment by taking prices down. You win in the Pet segment by delivering what parents are looking for, which is one of the reasons why private label is so low in Pet.","People are looking to feed their pets, the best quality product and we think in many cases that's Blue Buffalo. So that's kind of our starting philosophy. In terms of the small sizes, I can understand the commentary because our small sizes were \u2013 by maybe one of our competitors, because our small size, growth was up 85% in the food, drug and mass channel. But our growth overall was up 137%. And the \u2013 our small sizes are still in many cases are 100% premium to our largest competitor, so they're still premium priced.","And the prices in the first quarter on the small sizes were actually up double-digits on a price per pound basis. So when I look at it. Yes, we have more small sizes, but that's because we were growing more quickly in a new channel. It is certainly not our intention and it didn't manifest itself in the first quarter that we're going to be more competitive on price.","And I think that's why I spent some time also referencing the price mix for us was up 7%, so in terms of being more competitive. I suppose, if you consider that we entered pretty, pretty forcefully into a new channel. Yes, it's more competitive in that sense, but on a pricing sense actually no.","Alexia Howard","Great. And on the African swine fever?","Donal Mulligan","Yes. To the extent that \u2013 we're not going to give a forecast for next year's inflation, we'll take that into consideration as we're building the plan for next year. To the extent that we see inflation, we would have cost actions are pricing actions to offset it.","Alexia Howard","Okay, great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. The line is open. Please proceed.","Kenneth Zaslow","Hey, good morning everyone.","Jeffrey Harmening","Good morning.","Kenneth Zaslow","Are there any more initiatives? Or what's the runway on HMM? You don't talk as much about that as you used to, so I'm just trying to figure out, I know it's a consistent cost savings opportunity, but is there incremental opportunity. Is it still going at the same pace? Can you just give a little bit of parameters around that? And how much cost opportunities it will be, not just for this year, but going forward?","Donal Mulligan","Yes, Ken. Thanks for raising it. HMM is certainly one of our, I think, our key capabilities, and one that sometimes we take for granted. So I appreciate you raising it, because it is a strong contributor to our profit picture again it will be roughly 4% of our COGS this year, fully offsetting what is a bit of an elevated inflation period.","As you will know the kind of most recent new capability or aspect of global sourcing of HMM that we implemented was our global sourcing. That continues to pay dividend, not only in our savings, but you saw it in our working capital as well with continued extension on our terms and accounts payable, so it has a double benefit for us.","And we continue to add new capabilities. And as those manifest themselves and we have line of sight to the incremental savings that are available, we will certainly be vocal about that externally. As you look today, we are very comfortable with 4% of sales or \u2013 4% of COGS as a solid runway for our HMM initiatives.","Kenneth Zaslow","And then just my follow up is, can you talk a little bit about e-commerce? I didn't hear any details on that. I'm assuming it's still growing, but any sort of commentary on that would be helpful as well. I'll leave it there.","Jonathon Nudi","So, Ken. This is Jon. Maybe I'll talk about North America Retail. We continue to see nice momentum in e-commerce it was up about 50% in Q1. In North America, we continue to over index online versus bricks and mortar as our capabilities are strong and again we're working hard to make sure we are top of the basket. And we feel like we've got great capabilities that are again helping us to be advanced in this space. Continues to grow nicely, we think we're well positioned.","Kenneth Zaslow","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. The line is open. Please proceed.","Bryan Spillane","Hi, good morning everyone.","Jeffrey Harmening","Bryan, good morning.","Bryan Spillane","Just one question from me I think at the top you talked a bit about just how in the first quarter, sales were a little below expectations for the reasons you cited in the places where you did, but actually profits running ahead of plan. So I guess could you talk a little bit about what's driving that.","But I guess, more importantly, as we look through the rest of the year to the extent that profitability is running ahead of plan, would the bias be to spend that back especially given the success that you're having continuing the improvement especially in North American Retail? Is it just provide more flexibility in case stuff goes wrong? But just trying to get a sense of how we should interpret that?","Donal Mulligan","Sure, Bryan. I'll do the full year first. And you think about the year, as we talked about in July, we expect our strong margins to be stable for the full year. There's a couple of factors to take into account. One is the purchase accounting adjustment, that was a Q1 plus. I talked about positive price, mix which will be a benefit all year.","HMM and inflation will be largely offsetting through the year and our brand-building investment was up in Q1 and that will actually increase during the course of the year. So our strongest margins will be in Q1, largely because of the lapping the purchase accounting, but also because the brand building, while it was up, will increase during the course of the year. So that's why I think about the year how the margins are going to unfold.","Bryan Spillane","Okay, great. Thanks. And if I could just follow-up just in China, I think you made the mention about maybe slower traffic in the shops for I guess H\u00e4agen-Dazs in China. Just is there anything that we should be thinking about there in terms of just the macro environment getting slower, I think before you started the year you talked about maybe poor cost being up for Wanchai Ferry just a little bit more color on what's happening in China and just how we should think about that would be helpful? Thank you.","Jeffrey Harmening","Sure. Yes, in China, the growth did slow in our shops in the first quarter and that's not \u2013 that was not unexpected because we have seen the economy slowing there. It's still growing. So when we say the growth has slowed it has shown but it is still growing, which I think is important. And we've adjusted some of our tactics for our H\u00e4agen-Dazs shops to drive more traffic starting in starting in the second quarter.","And then on Wanchai Ferry we took prices at the end of last year because we saw the African swine fever and the pork prices go up. So we took some pricing, and we did so a little bit ahead of our competition. We've seen them starting to take pricing there.","So as we head into the second quarter we see improvement in our Wanchai Ferry business. And so in China, we saw our business in China decline a little bit, but not really a lot behind our expectations because we saw these macro forces at play.","And so our ability to get our China business back to growth really doesn't depend on a change in the macro environment. It really realize on tactics we've taken to drive more consumers in store and on our competition catching up with us on pricing on Wanchai Ferry, which is why we have confidence that we can improve that business heading into the second quarter.","Bryan Spillane","Great. Thanks, everyone.","Jeffrey Harmening","It's time for one more.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Strycula with UBS. Your line is open. Please proceed.","Steven Strycula","Hi, good morning, everybody.","Jeffrey Harmening","Hi, Steve.","Donal Mulligan","Good morning.","Steven Strycula","So one quick question for Don, and then a follow-up. So on the gross margin piece Don, if we strip out the Blue Buffalo contribution is it right to think that gross margins were up roughly about 30 basis points in the first quarter on a like-for-like basis, and given the brand building that you're doing? Can you speak to what specifically it is throughout the balance of the year? And why that steps up? And should that mean that maybe the run rate for the balance of the year is closer to like flattish. And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.","Donal Mulligan","Yes. That's the math is right on Q1. So the $53 million step-up in inventory rolling over is about 130 basis points, so it does account for most of the gross margin improvement. As the year unfolds we're going to \u2013 we're seeing a slight step up in our media, that will increase, we're also keen to build capabilities around data and analytics to get deeper in that area.","I think we talked about that a little bit in July, we've built e-commerce capabilities, we continue to invest there. We can do invest in our strategic revenue management all around how we manage and drive decisions through data, and you'll continue to see those capabilities being invested behind as the year unfolds.","Steven Strycula","Okay. And my follow-up for Jeff, so do we see that incremental spend for brand-building and data analytics. Is that going to be more SG&A? Or is that still, for accounting purpose, roll through COGS?","And then a strategic question is, the inventory drawdown that we're seeing in the U.S. is that at all tied to the evolution of click and collect, meaning how retailers are merchandising in their stores and inventorying them or just carrying fewer days on hand because of how click and collect impacts the business. Could you comment there? Thank you.","Jeffrey Harmening","Yes. So on the brand-building side, I would say without getting into specific on where it goes on the line of the P&L, what we're talking about on brand building is not increase \u2013 is not increased price promotion, it really is brand building and whether we do that through our customers or whether we do that through some sort of a mass media as Jon Nudi highlighted, I think our North America Retail Marketing is really good right now, especially in Cereal, but even for some of our other businesses and on Pet.","And so to the extent that we see an opportunity to improve our brand building behind things like Pet or Old El Paso or Cereal we'll continue to do that because we're seeing some pretty good returns and we like what we're doing. So I'm not going to get go line-by-line, but that's what we see. And then your second question\u2026","Steven Strycula","Inventory?","Jeffrey Harmening","On inventory, you want to talk about that?","Jonathon Nudi","Yes, sure. So Steve, I'd say the inventory reduction is probably less tied to click-and-collect, but related to data analytics and just technology. I think our retailers have better tools now, it's really I understand how much the inventory, they need to have in the warehouse, as well as on the shelf, and they're leveraging that technology to bring down their inventories and still have good in-stock position. So again, I think its technology and data analytics, not necessarily click-and-collect.","Steven Strycula","All right. Thank you.","Jeffrey Harmening","Okay. I think that gets us to full-time. Thanks everyone for your engagement and will be available throughout the rest of the day for any follow-ups. Have a great day. Thank you.","Operator","That does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines."],"9976":["General Mills, Inc.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Kris Wenker, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Kristen Wenker","Thanks, operator. Good morning, everybody. I'm here with Ken Powell, our CEO; Don Mulligan, our CFO; and Jim Murphy, President of our Big G Cereals Division. And I'll turn the call over to them in just a minute, but first, I'm going to cover my usual housekeeping items.","Our press release on first quarter results was issued over the wire services earlier this morning and is also posted on our website, if you still need a copy. We've posted slides on the website, also. They supplement today's prepared remarks. And our remarks will include forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions. The second Slide in today's presentation list factors that could cause our future results to be different than our current estimates.","And with that, I will turn you over to my colleagues, starting with Don.","Donal Mulligan","Thanks, Kris, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. As you've seen from our press release this morning, General Mills is off to a good start in fiscal 2014.","Slide 4 summarizes our results for the first quarter. Sales totaled $4.4 billion, up 8%. Segment operating profit increased 6% to $812 million that includes a 7% increase in advertising investment. Net earnings totaled $459 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.70 as reported.","These results are below year ago levels that include an $82 million increase in the mark-to-market valuations of certain commodity positions and a one-time tax benefit. Excluding items affecting comparability, our adjusted diluted EPS would be $0.70, a 6% increase versus last year.","Slide 5 shows the components of our net sales growth. On an as reported basis net sales increased 8%, including strong contributions from new businesses and three months of incremental contribution from new businesses -- from new products and three months of incremental contribution from new businesses, primarily Yoplait Canada and Yoki in Brazil.","Pound volume contributed 8 percentage points of growth in the quarter. Sales mix and net price realization added 1 point of sales growth and foreign exchange reduced that sales by 1 percentage point. Excluding 5 points of growth from new businesses, net sales were 3% above year ago levels.","Slide 6 details net sales performance for our U.S. retail business. In total, net sales increased 4%, led by our snacks, natural and organic, baking and cereal businesses. Introductory shipments of new products help drive these sales increases. Jim and Ken will talk more about this innovation in a few minutes.","Sales for our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment declined 1% in the first quarter. That's consistent with our expectations. Remember, we're focusing -- we continue to focus our product mix. Priority platforms, including banking mixes, cereal, yogurt, snacks and frozen breakfast posted solid sales growth in the quarter.","Slide 8 summarizes first quarter international net sales on a constant currency basis. Sales grew 25% overall, led by Latin America, where sales increased nearly 200%. This includes strong contributions from Yoki and double-digit growth in our base business. In Canada, sales increased 21%, led by incremental contributions from Yoplait. Sales for the Europe region declined 3%, reflecting the difficult operating environment there. And sales in the Asia-Pacific region increased 13%, led by double-digit growth in China.","Slide 9 shows our gross margin was 36.9% on both a reported and underlying basis in the first quarter. Excluding mark-to-market effects, our gross margin declined 130 basis points. The addition of Yoplait Canada and Yoki account for roughly half of that decline and the other half reflects higher input cost.","We are now 60% covered on our commodity needs for fiscal 2014 and we're still estimating 3% supply chain inflation for the year in total, with first half inflation rate expected to be higher than the second half. We continue to invest in consumer marketing to drive topline growth. As shown on Slide 10, our investment in media and advertising increased 7% in the first quarter, led by double-digit increases in media spending for U.S. yogurt and our international segment.","Slide 11 outlines our segment operating profit results for the quarter. Total segment operating profit increased 6% to $812 million, despite higher input costs and foreign exchange headwind and the increased advertising investment. U.S. retail profit increased 6%. International profit met strong year ago levels, which increased 56%. And Convenience Stores and Foodservice profit increased 10%.","After-tax earnings from joint ventures grew 4% to $24 million in the quarter, reflecting sales gains and strong levels of holistic margin management for cereal partners worldwide. On a constant currency basis, CPW sales increased 1% with growth in the U.K. and Asia largely offset by category weakness in Southwest Europe. Constant currency sales for H\u00e4agen-Dazs Japan matched strong year ago levels.","Completing our review of the income statement, corporate unallocated expenses excluding mark-to-market effects were up $12 million in the quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.3% as reported. Excluding items affecting comparability, the tax rate was 32.2% this year, compared to 31.4% a year ago, and average diluted shares outstanding declined 1% in the quarter. For the full year, we continue to target a 2% net reduction at average diluted shares outstanding.","Turning to the balance sheet. Slide 14 shows that our core working capital declined 2% despite the addition of new businesses driven by our focus on inventory reduction. Accounts payable and accounts receivable were largely offsetting in the quarter. So the first quarter completed, we remain on track to achieve our 2014 targets.","We expect to deliver low-single digit growth in net sales, fueled by product news and innovation across our base business and incremental contributions from new businesses. We expect operating profit to grow faster than sales, reflecting a robust pipeline of productivity issues and stronger profit contributions from new businesses. And we expect operating profit margin expansion in each of our three business segments. And we expect to deliver high single digit growth and adjusted diluted earnings per share to a range of $2.87 to $2.90.","With that I'll turn the microphone over to Jim Murphy.","James Murphy","Thanks, Don, and hello everybody. It's great to be with you on the call this morning and talk about the strong growth opportunities we see for our U.S. cereal business. Let me begin by reminding everyone why over 90% of U.S. households buy cereal. First and foremost it taste terrific and offers consumers of all ages a wide variety of flavor and texture choices. It's obviously quick and easy to make and it's affordable.","In fact, at around $0.50 a serving, that's the including the milk cereal beats most other breakfast choices on price. Cereal is lower in calories in most breakfast options and it's a very nutrient-dense food choice. In fact, fortified cereal provide more iron, folic acid, zinc and B vitamins than any other conventional breakfast food, plus there is all that whole grain and fiber.","The fact is ready-to-eat breakfast cereal, even your favorite presweetened variety, more than hold the zone in a side-by-side comparison with other nutritious foods. Slide 18 shows the nutrition side panel for a bowl of Cocoa Puffs with Skim Milk. This great taste in breakfast is just 150 calories. Those of you who count calories no, that's a tough number to beat. It's got no trans-fat, no cholesterol and very little sodium.","On sugar, well, take a look at your favorite brand of regular fruit flavored Greek yogurt and I'll bet you the number on that label is higher. Protein is one gram for Cocoa Puffs alone, but five grams including the milk. And when you get the listing of vitamins and minerals, cereal beats most breakfast food competition hands down.","With credentials like these it's no wonder that consumers love cereal and buy a lot of it. As I mentioned earlier, over 90% of the U.S. household purchase cereal each year, and on average they buy a box nearly every other week. That's one of the highest purchase rates across categories in the center store. Cereal household penetration and buyer rate is even higher in Hispanic households, one of the fastest growing segments of the U.S. population. Over the last three decades cereal retail sales have nearly tripled reaching $9.4 billion today.","One of the consumer behaviors following this long-term growth is the fact that many more people eat breakfast and skip it. Breakfast is truly a growth market. The number of breakfast occasions increases as the U.S. population expands. Breakfast at home is growing and today represents over 80% of all breakfast occasions. And cereal is the most popular breakfast food at home by far, featured in a commanding 32% of these morning meals.","General Mills has led U.S. cereal category growth over the past five years and we've added a full point of market share. We're off to a solid start in 2014 with sales in market share growth in the first quarter. So we like the growth at the breakfast occasion. Demographics trends favor cereal consumption as we look ahead and General Mills has performed well, yet I have seen some analysts' reports question the future prospects for the U.S. cereal category and I understand why.","Category unit volume has declined over the last three years, but we see three primary factors behind this recent trend: first; we believe that any food categories growth is the result of the collective innovation that branded players bring to that category, and frankly there hasn't been enough new product innovation from the branded manufacturers; second, there hasn't been enough product news behind the big category established brands; and finally, there hasn't been enough consumer-directed advertisings supporting this big category. These are not structural issues. These are issues of innovation and execution.","In Big G, we are taking specific steps to drive growth for our cereal business in fiscal '14 and beyond. Our plans include core brand renovation that is relevant to consumers. We're launching a strong slate of differential new product innovation and we're investing to develop innovative marketing ideas that bring increased consumer excitement to cereal. It's really a simple formula, but it works where we are bringing relevant product news and innovation to market, we are seeing the sales growth.","There is perhaps no better example of the power of product news in renovation than in our Chex business. In 2010, we repositioned this brand as gluten-free. Retail sales have increased at a double-digit rate since. And Chex grew another 7% in the first quarter, including contributions from the new vanilla variety.","Cereals is the biggest franchise in the U.S. cereal category by far. Today, one out of every eight boxes of cereals sold in the U.S. is a variety of Cheerios. And Honey Nut Cheerios is Americas' top-selling cereal brand. We're supporting Honey Nut with increased levels of advertising, including a new campaign with the Rapper Nelly called Must Be The Honey. Early response to this ad has been just fantastic with over 10,000 mentions on social media in just the first week. First quarter retail sales of our Honey Nut Cheerios franchise increased 4%.","We've also launched new advertising on the original yellow box Cheerios. This advertising reminds consumers about the heart health benefits and their emotional connection to this great brand. Baseline sales trends are responding with an improved run rate of 260 basis points in the last six months.","We're supporting this momentum in the second quarter with our Send Cheer to Teachers promotion. You can thank your favorite teacher with a clip postcard from specially marked boxes. There is more opportunity across this iconic Cheerios franchise and our news and innovation pipeline is full. I am extremely confident that this franchise will see broad-based growth going forward.","Lucky Charms another consumer favorite, turns 50 years old this year, but the brand isn't showing its age. Retail sales in the first quarter grew 11%. Part of this growth reflect success of new advertising directed to adults, who as it turns out account for nearly half the consumption of Lucky Charms. We have big plans for Lucky's birthday. We'll be celebrating with 50 days of surprises culminating on St. Patrick's Day.","Let's talk about the Breakfast of Champions. For those of you who weren't able to draft Adrian Peterson on your fantasy football team, now you can have them on your breakfast table in three ways. And we are partnering with Blippar to bring AP to life. Just download the Blippar app, point your smartphone at the Wheaties box and see what happens.","And just inside for Halloween, our monsters cereals are back. This year the count Boo Berry and Franken Berry are joined by two friends not seen in over 20 years, Yummy Mummy and Frute Brute. Initial shipments for the monster cereals are well-ahead of last year's pace and this just illustrates the power of cereal in pop culture.","Now, I've been talking a lot about established brands, but our 2014 plans also include great taste and new product innovation. Honey Nut Cheerios Medley Crunch continues to be the single biggest launch in the category this calendar year. Our new Hershey's Cookies and cream cereals are off to a great start. It's turning in the top-third of the total categories and outperforming other new items in the chocolate segment. This great taste comes with solid health credentials too, including a 100% whole grain and no trans fats.","I also believe it will be important to bring new benefits to the category to drive growth. Our Nature Valley Protein Granola delivers 10 grams of protein per serving. That's more than twice the cereal category average. The two varieties, oats and honey and oats and dark chocolate, this products taste terrific. After only three months in the market, it's already among the top-turning granola items.","And our new BFAST breakfast shake provides busy consumers with the balanced nutrition of a bowl of cereal and milk in a convenient shelf-stable drink. Distribution on this product is just getting started and we are leveraging both in store and grass root sampling events to drive product trial and awareness. In total, we're very excited about our new product lineup this year. We have additional new cereals scheduled for the launch in the second half.","New products certainly play an important role in driving category growth, but so does advertising. In recent years, measured media spending for total food and beverage is up modestly. Cereal category advertising has declined during that same period, so cereal has lost some share of voice.","However we've maintained strong levels of ad support in our cereal brands. Over the last two years, our cereal spending in measured media has increased 6% and today represents 41% of total category measured spending. So our share of voice is up and well above our 31% share of category dollar sales. Meanwhile, our share of the cereal shelf is well below our share of category sales. So we're working with retailers to expand our cereal distribution. In the first quarter, our share of distribution grew 80 basis points.","At the same time, we're staying very disciplined about the sizes and flavors we're launching in the category. As a result, our velocities or turns on the shelf have outpaced the category average in our brand of competitors. That trend continued in the first quarter of 2014. So our products play a very important role in driving sales growth in the cereal category.","To wrap up my remarks this morning, we are very bullish on the U.S. cereal category. Consumers love cereals for all the good reasons that I outlined for you today. In recent years the collective product news and innovation from branded cereal manufactures has not been sufficient to driver category growth. We've got plans to drive sales and profit growth for our cereal business in 2014 with product news and established brands, a strong new product lineup and effective marketing and merchandising initiatives.","Thank you for your time this morning. And now I'll turn the call over to Ken Powell.","Kendall Powell","Thank you, Jim, and good morning to one and all. You just heard about the terrific innovation plans we have in our U.S. cereal business. So I'll give you a quick summary of the innovation we're seeing elsewhere in the company. But first, let me offer a few observation on input cost trend and then general pricing and promotional environment.","We've noted that year-over-year declines in spot prices for certain commodities, notably corn and wheat, have prompted some questions about the potential for broad-based deflation in input costs. At General Mills, we buy and manage a very broad basket of commodities. So while some spot prices like grains are down others like dairy are up.","All-in, we still expect inflation of roughly 3% across our supply chain costs for the fiscal year that will end next May. In longer-term, we continue to believe that the trend on food industry input costs will be inflationary, driven by rising global demand for food and energy.","In terms of industry volume and pricing trends, we are seeing balanced growth across the 25 categories where we compete. That's true for the most recent quarter as well. This growth is modest, but it's nonetheless growth. We're working to fuel sales increases in our categories with higher levels of product marketing and innovation, and Jim shared several cereal examples with you in just a few minutes ago.","I'll cover the other key categories starting with yogurt. In the U.S. sales for our Greek yogurt business continue to significantly outpace the segment. Our momentum started with the highly successful launch of Yoplait Greek 100 last summer. Year one retail sales for this reduced calorie line reached $150 million, making this the single largest new product launch in Yoplait in the last two decades.","We're building on this momentum with the first quarter launch of Yoplait Greek blended yogurt. Advertising for this new line focuses on its winning taste profile. And we're continuing the regional expansion of Libert\u00e9 Greek. In total, our first quarter Greek yogurt sales grew nearly 100% more than double the growth rate of this segment. And we're innovating beyond Greek too, including new advertising and marketing initiatives behind our Core Cup business.","Over the last two quarters our U.S. yogurt net sales are up slightly with faster growth in unit sales. We're continuing to make steady progress on this key business and we expect to report further progress in the coming quarters.","Our U.S. Snack businesses are off to a terrific start this year, led by strong sales of Nature Valley Soft-Baked Oatmeal Squares and Fiber One protein bars. First quarter retail sales for our grain snacks business increased 8%. And we added over 3 points of market share. Layer bar sales increased at a double-digit pace in the quarter, led by strong sales of our new ALT protein bars. And our hot snacks sales were up 4% in the quarter, led by the new line of Totino's BOLD Rolls.","In Dry Dinners, we're seeing steady improvement in baseline trends as we ramp up distribution of new items and begin to activate our marketing plans. We've launched new flavors of Progresso Soup and continue to focus our advertising on the great taste of these ready-to-serve varieties.","First quarter retail sales increased 3% above strong year ago levels. And in refrigerated dough, new gluten-free batters and strong sales of Grands biscuits drove first quarter retail sales up 5%. In total, we're launching over 100 new U.S. retail products in the first half of 2014, with more to come later in the year.","This increased level of innovation reflects the benefits of the new organization structure we put in place last year. Our level of new product activity is up across our portfolio, including a significant increase in our newly created baking products and frozen foods divisions.","As our new items reach good store level distribution, we'll be activating the media and marketing campaigns for these businesses. We're ramping up activity behind our seasonal items such as soup, baking products and frozen vegetables. And we continue to improve the efficiency and impact of our advertising dollars with increased investments in targeted digital and multicultural media.","We also have a variety of second quarter merchandising events planned to drive customer and consumer excitement. We are expanding our Save Lids to Save Lives program, which benefits breast cancer research. Starting this month more than 25 General Mills brands will carry pink lids on over 340 million packages.","In total, General Mills will donate $0.10 for every lid redeemed up to a maximum total donation of $1.5 million. We also continue to expand our successful Boxtops for Education program. Since the inception of this program, we've raised over $525 million for schools across the country.","Turning to our U.S. Business in a way from home channels, total net sales declined slightly in the quarter as Don showed you. But we delivered net sales growth across our key product platforms in the first quarter. Operating profit for this segment grew 10%, reflecting this branded product strength as well as good grain merchandising performance.","Let me turn to our international business with a few comments on each region. I'll begin with Canada, where yogurt is our newest business. We are a leading player in the Greek yogurt segment. In just last month we added new Yoplait Yopa to our lineup.","Yopa offers the high protein, no fat benefits of traditional Greek yogurt in great tasting flavors like strawberry cheesecake and mango tango. We're supporting this product with a comprehensive marketing campaign that features Canadian-Greek actress, Nia Vardalos. Today our Yoplait and Libert\u00e9 brands account for 30% of Canadian yogurt category sales.","In Europe, first quarter sales in constant currency declined 3%, reflecting the tough operating environment in the region. Our results did include strong performance from new products, including H\u00e4agen-Dazs Secret Sensations and Old El Paso Mexican Rice kits. In yogurt, our U.K. launch of Libert\u00e9 Greek is off to a solid start and we're expanding our Calin line of yogurts into drinkable varieties in both the U.K. and France.","Our largest business in the Asia-Pacific region is Greater China, where we continue to see robust growth. First quarter sales in constant currency grew at a strong double-digit rate, led by H\u00e4agen-Dazs and our line of Wanchai Ferry frozen dim sum item. The overall Chinese economy maybe slowing a bit, but the demand for branded consumer food products continues to expand, as increasing number of Chinese consumers want foods that offer quality, convenience, nutrition and taste all at a good value.","And in Latin America, the Yoki business has just completed its first year with General Mills. New Yoki Kit F\u00e1cil dinner kits are off to a very strong start in Brazil. We're also introducing new flavors of popcorn, soups and beverages, and we're prioritizing the top 100 Yoki products that should be in every grocery store across Brazil. In total, we are very pleased with Yoki's performance. Retail sales in Brazil increased nearly 20% during the first year.","With that, let me summarize today's General Mills update. We're off to a solid start in 2014. We delivered net sales and profit growth on our base business with incremental contributions from new businesses. Our first quarter results have us on track to achieve our annual sales and profit targets.","We continue to be excited about the year. We have more impactful advertising and increased levels of innovation in market right now with additional efforts planned for the remainder of the year. We see a manageable level of input cost inflation this year and our categories are showing modest balanced growth.","Ultimately, we believe our categories and the strength of our brands are a source of competitive advantage for General Mills. We like our prospects for increasing sales and earnings in 2014 and longer term. So thank you for your time this morning and for your interest in General Mills.","With that, I would like to open the call for questions. Operator, please get us going.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley","Just to dive into the U.S. retail sales growth a bit more. I think it's clear that you made some progress here in the first quarter and we did see some sequential improvement. But 4% growth does seem like it benefited from a few factors like new product shipments and mix. So as we're thinking about modeling out that segment over the coming quarters and just how the sort of operating environment is evolving.","Just wanted to get your thoughts on whether there was an inventory benefit here in the first quarter that we should take into account and expect to normalize over the next quarter or two? And how should we think about the balance between price mix and volume across the coming quarters? Should we expect to see -- I'd assume this type of mix benefit persisting beyond the first quarter.","Kendall Powell","You partly answered it. It is in fact, we did ship lots of new products over the course of the quarter. And as all of you know, it takes a while for those to move through the channel and start to get counted at retail, so that's part of the gap that you mentioned. You talked about mix, you also mentioned inventory, and I do want to remind all of you that first quarter, a year ago, our merchandising pressure was a quite a bit below average in our inventories, as a result our retail inventories were low. So as we've normalized merchandising, we've seen the inventories normalize behind that. So you kind of identified some factors in the first quarter. You also as you note, we're quite pleased generally with the overall effort in the first quarter.","We like the new products. We're seeing some good trends across some important categories and we're encouraged by that. And going forward, I think we're looking for growth in low-single digits and it's always a little bit of all three. It's a little bit of volume and maybe a bit of price and a bit of mix and we do expect that Matthew to normalize here versus kind of a -- some of the year-over-year comps. In Q1 we expect to see that normalized as we go forward.","Don, I don't know if you'd want to add anything to that.","Donal Mulligan","I think you captured well. I mean as low-single digits is still our guidance for U.S. cereal sales and there is going to be a bit of volume, some mix. We saw that in the first quarter with cereal grain, our national organic products driving that sales growth and they have a positive mix benefit for us and we expect that it continues as the year unfolds.","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley","And then just with respect to quantifying to the extent we can the impact of those headwinds in the -- or those dynamics -- sorry not headwinds in the second quarter. With the inventory benefit that you may have seen here in the first quarter, would you expect second quarter sales to be generally in line with your full year targets or sort of towards the lower end of that range.","Donal Mulligan","Well, Matt, we're not going to give quarterly guidance. We'll just reaffirm that we expect our low-single digit sales growth with the mix of all those items to play out for the balance of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Quick question on the U.S. cereal business. I guess, two things, relative to the -- I guess, the debate that's going on into market about the health of the category and I guess some of the current concerns that we hear about. Can you talk a little bit about the effectiveness or the efficacy of merchandising, especially investing in price to drive list.","And I think there is some concern that maybe we started volumes -- category volumes have been so soft the last few years that we get into the temptation to begin to try to invest in price in order to drive some lift. So just your thoughts on where consumers are in terms of price if that's going to be a motivating factor.","And then second, just in terms of maybe demographic cohort, if you could just talk a little bit about how you think your brands are doing and maybe the category is with kids, with families, with low-income consumers, so just trying to get a sense of whether there is maybe a demographic cohort in the market that may need to addressed more definitively than maybe others.","James Murphy","So in commenting on the merchandizing, I said it in my prepared remarks, but product news and innovation and investment on the consumer side is what's going to drive this category. The temptation to increase merchandizing in order to do that is not an effective and not an efficient to grow the category long-term. And so we believe that the product news, innovation and investment from the branded players need to increase in order to make this category grow healthily in the future.","Your second question on demographics, we see that the families, the mainstream families who are after taste and branded value and fun in the breakfast occasion are strongest consumers right now. And it manifest itself through the strength of our all-family brands and I mentioned that in my remarks things like Lucky Charms and Honey Nut Cheerios that appeal to everybody in the family are very, very strong right now.","And so we don't see a weak spot really across the demographics. In fact, Hispanics, as I said consume more cereal than anybody and that's a growth driver for us in the future. So demographically cereal has got a lot of tailwinds actually going forward.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And just following up on that, just ageing boomers, is there are anything difference that's any different in terms of the category dynamic with maybe people 50 plus?","James Murphy","That's a way over index as well, so the two groups of consumers at over index are the families with the young kids and the 55-plus crowd and so as we look at that that is the demographic tailwind as I mentioned for the cereal category going forward.","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And from your perspective there is no change to that?","James Murphy","No.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Katzman of Deutsche Bank.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","I am glad Bryan included the 50-plus in the ageing boomers, I'm almost there. I guess I want to talk about the deflation comments you made, Ken, it seems like with emerging markets slowing down, less ethanol inputs from grain and stocks to use, ratio is going up that we could be in for a period of time where there are lower inputs. So I want to push back against that a bit, obviously inflations are tough one to predict overall, but I want to push back against that a little bit.","And then related to that we've heard that Wal-Mart went to 200 suppliers asking for 2% price cuts across the board and that dollar general was already lining up behind them on the back of this kind of deflation thesis, and so maybe react to that. And then I think I have a follow-up question for Jim on cereal.","Kendall Powell","For your first question, our premise on how the global economy is going to evolve is that we're going to continue to see globalization, economic growth and particularly in emerging markets, and by the way, while many of you have commented on the softening in emerging market economies overall. I mean I do want to point out that our business continues to be very strong in emerging markets.","We had a very strong quarter in China and we're seeing terrific growth in Brazil. And I think the reason is that we are selling Center of Plate, very basic everyday food items to these consumers, I mean we're selling dim sum and egg rolls in China that are being consumed every night. When you think of our product line in Brazil, it's a very middleclass product line.","Think of equivalent of helpers in the U.S. I mean that kind of captures I think the positioning of our brands in Brazil. So I'm very well targeted. These consumers continue to have growing disposable income and we're seeing tremendous growth in emerging markets and we think that's going to continue. And we think we're going to continue to see growing global demand for these basic commodities.","Now, in terms of your comment on stocks, I mean every year is a new year. And when it comes to the harvest, and so you won't see us predicting anything there other than every year is a new year. This year it looks like it's going to be a better harvest and we may see stocks improve, but its one year at a time on that one. And I think as we all know volatility is what we should expect there.","In terms of your comments on Wal-Mart, we haven't heard anything about that that would be new to us. In fact, I was visiting at Wal-Mart within the past several weeks and I will tell you that we had a very good conversation about innovation and what we can do to make sure that we've got high levels because of the belief that innovation drives traffic and it drives excitement in our categories. So we haven't heard anything about your comment on 200 suppliers and all that stuff.","And so anyway -- so thank you for the question. I think you've got a follow up for Don or Jim.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Jim actually, on Slide 34, I'm just trying to understand -- so I know that your share of category has been in the low-30s for a period of time. But I'm just trying to understand the share of distribution points is kind of call it a third lower or fourth lower. So is that because the other competitors are just whatever, throwing allowance money or merchandising money at the retailer to keep their distribution, kind of how long has this relationship between share of dollars versus share of distribution points been so skewed for you. And what are you doing to change that?","James Murphy","Well, it's really, the key factors is that are skews are just much bigger and more efficient and productive in the category. And so we are constantly reminding our retail partners of this fact and this really been the case for quite sometimes. If you think about it we have some of the biggest, most productive skews on Honey Nut Cheerios and Yellow Box Cheerios and the like, in the category.","And the challenge is to get the proper phasing on those big skews in the category, so that they don't run out of stock on them. But there is always the temptation to take a new skew in the category and put it on the shelf it's a constant battle with the retailers and reminder of the retailers to go back to more productive shelf sets.","Having said that, we have made a lot of progress here just in Q1, we're up 80 basis points as I mentioned in my remarks and so I think our story and the facts that we bring to our partners is starting to resonate at an increasing rate and you probably could expect that this gap starts to narrow over the course of time.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow of BMO.","Ken Zaslow - BMO","Ken, I have got just two questions as I look through your presentation. One is it seems like General Mills is broadening the efforts across your cereal brands like including Wheaties, which may have not been as focused as well as the Monster cereals. . So is there a chain in what you're doing across the portfolio, you look kind of like pulling levers on products that you not normally have done before. And my second question is how you reacted and can you just talk about the new entrants into the categories, the competitors like a kind or something that. Can you talk about those two issues?","Kendall Powell","Sure, first on the pulling levers on some brands that we haven't supported as much over the recent past. That's absolutely true. We see a lot of up of upside for supporting brands like Wheaties and Total and the like and we're doing it and we're doing it with different marketing vehicles. So it's not the standard TV plan. You're going to see a lot more in this social space as an example. So yes, that is upside for us. We have a lot of brands that are between half a share point and point that we can continue to increase the spending behind good marketing ideas. So that's the answer to your first question.","And on the second question, I think that there is an emerging segment within the category where Cascadian Farms and our new Nature Valley Protein Granola fit, and we call it the nature space. That is growing at quite a nice cliff. It's still small relatively and it's still relatively less productive than the mainstream. But nonetheless, we think we have two terrific brands to capitalize on that trend, Cascadian Farm in the organic side and now Natural Valley, which I think is going to be a really strong brand in the cereal category operating in that type of a space of natural ingredients you can see.","Ken Zaslow - BMO","Just going back to the first question, what drove the change though? Like what happened that all of a sudden you say, look we can now focus on these brands. It's just, to me these brands have been around for a long time, like what created that change?","Kendall Powell","We've been experimenting with marketing ideas, and we finally have likely pressed on it; and Wheaties is a good example, Monsters is another great example and we've got more in the pipeline on these smaller brands. This new era of marketing you can try a lot of ideas for very little money and really experiment with them and we're doing that quite effectively now. We're finding -- we're unlocking growth on some of these brands we haven't marketed for a while.","Ken Zaslow - BMO","So one general comment, Ken, and I am looking at Jim here to see if he would agree, but I think that the whole digital and social space opens up some opportunities to innovate that maybe we didn't have five years ago. We can really micro target and with the Monsters thing in way as Jim said in his presentation capitalizing on pop culture. So those kinds of media, I think create some opportunities and we're trying to get better muscles in those areas and we are and it seems to be working for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Growe of Stifel.","Chris Growe - Stifel","Just I had two questions for you if I could. The first one in relation to U.S. retail, the price mix contribution was strong in the quarter. It sounds like mix was a major driver of that. I want to also understand the degree to which promotion was a bit of drag against that or just understand the scope of how you're increasing promotions here early in the year, something that that they're being very surgical if it's the right term to use?","Kendall Powell","Well, I am not sure I fully understand your question. Let me repeat there was a difference in the level of promotion year-over-year. So first quarter last year I don't know if you recalled this, Chris, but we came out a little bit light and really over the course of our year we were, our self criticism was that our promotional plan was not really balanced the right way. And so this year we have a very balanced plan, a very steady pressure across over the course of the year. And the comparison in the first quarter is that there is more pressure in comparison to that quarter than a year ago.","Chris Growe - Stifel","And so that would have been a bit of a drag against the overall price mix contribution in U.S. retail, meaning that mix was maybe even little stronger in the quarter. Do you follow that?","Donal Mulligan","Yes. That is correct. And to your point it was, if you remember the promotion timing, particularly centered in cereal and grain snacks where we thought we were light a year ago and more normalized this year. And as I mentioned earlier those are two of our highest revenue per pound categories. So as we're seeing those sales grow this year, higher than the -- the volume grow higher than the U.S. cereal average. That is a highly favorable to our revenue mix.","Chris Growe - Stifel","And then the final question there for you was just on the international division. I had booked in a little stronger increase in profit this quarter. So I just wanted to understand, obviously you had a big increase in marketing, that would be one factor, any other factors that we should be aware of, whether it'd be European a little softer that would have weight on the growth this quarter and just understand kind of how we look for the rest of the year in that division?","James Murphy","Yes, Chris, our international profit actually came in right where we expected. It matched year ago levels, which were up 56% over the year before. The higher net sales obviously drove some profit growth. We had three items that offset that, you mentioned one, which is the 15% increase in our media support. We did have higher input cost inflation particularly dairy in Europe. And we had a foreign exchange drag. Importantly, our new businesses did contribute as expected and we continue to expect internationals full year, constant currency sales growth to be high-single digits and operating profit to grow faster. So we haven't had any change to our full year expectations for that segment.","Chris Growe - Stifel","And is there any of that your FX assumptions for the year, is that any worse or better as a result for the first quarter?","Kendall Powell","Yeah, they are a little worse, probably penny or two worse, that's factored into our reaffirm guidance.","Operator","And our next question comes from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","This is more of a technical question on the Nielsen data that you're presenting. The volume or I guess the unit volume that you showed is very consistent with the Nielsen data we're getting. But the unit pricing, that you're showing, which is positive versus a year ago for the company on a Nielsen basis is very different from the Nielsen data that we get. And I want to know as you saw all these monthly reports from the sell side showing your unit pricing down. What do you think the discrepancy was? We saw unit pricing down in just about every category and I guess it was not reflective?","Donal Mulligan","Well, I mean first of all, I think your comment on units is we are -- Rob, the numbers we show are category numbers not General Mills' numbers. If you're referring to, I think at Slide, maybe 39 in the deck the one that Ken showed. We showed volume and pricing for F '13 annual and F '14 first quarter. Those are category numbers.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","So your unit pricing is -- you're pricing below those categories then or your pricing is below the category pricing?","Donal Mulligan","Yes, and that's the merchandising phase that we talked about a minute ago.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Okay, I see. Can you give us a sense of the duration of the merchandising then. Is that something to expect throughout the year or is this kind of like a comparison issue versus year ago?","Donal Mulligan","It is primarily a comparison issue versus a year ago in the quarter.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan.","Ken Goldman - JPMorgan","As I look at our RTE cereal as a whole, velocities at least in Nielsen do seem to be coming down across the board and I realize you've highlighted some of the issues behind this, but I wanted to ask whether velocities are off enough where retailers, especially maybe some that you recently visited, Ken, might start thinking about maybe some accelerated SKU rationalization in the category. That does seem to be a large number of tail brands in cereal that may or may not be doing well. So just curious if you're hearing anything about the potential for I guess trade incented rationalization if you will when shelves reset next year or are we just not at that point at all?","James Murphy","Couple of things I would say. One is retailers know how important this category is to driving traffic to their store. It is still nearly $10 billion category and as you know a lot of retailers there trying to figure out how to drive traffic to their center stores and cereals still remain strategically incredibly important for them. The second thing I would say is even the tail of cereals on a SKU basis generates a lot of more productivity than a number of different categories within the center stores. So we haven't heard a lot of noise about retailers questioning the space that they allocate to cereal or questioning the strategic importance of it.","Ken Goldman - JPMorgan","Can I ask you a very quick follow-up? Just, Jim, what are you hearing on not just your brands, but across the category the current levels of inventory among some of your larger retailers? We have seen a higher level of de-loading across all packaged food lately. I am just curious how that's affecting things for the category as a whole?","James Murphy","Well, I think we're following the general trend of the entire food complex. I think you've heard that the retailers are reducing inventory modestly across the entire store and we're just serious part of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Driscoll of Citigroup.","David Driscoll - Citigroup","Jim, just wanted to continue on some of the cereal questions. I'd like you to maybe respond to or give me your thoughts on when we look at overall food we see that volumes are down in the aggregate of more than 100-plus categories that we track. You've pointed towards some specific factors category, marketing spending being below the 11 levels, new product introductions being down. But I don't believe you made any mentioned of just simply overall volume softness across the United States, maybe is that absent for a particular reason? Do you not believe that that has an effect here and that these isolated, this category marketing spending in new products are really the lion's share drivers of these issues, so maybe if you could just respond to that please?","Kendall Powell","David, let me -- this is Ken, let me jump in first and then I think Jim wants to make some comments because I think you do raised an important point. I mean Jim I think is very properly focused on the cereal category and what we know drives it, which is innovation and brand building and we're seeing that to be effective. As you go back the last couple of years though, there are some larger macro factors that did have an impact across categories.","And that of course was going back two years ago the pricing that all of us took in response to exceptionally high levels of inflation. For us it was over 10%, which really knocked a lot of categories off the rails going back several years ago. And really last -- it took us last year to see those categories strengthen as we got price points right and we saw consumers stabilizing comeback to the category.","So I think you're right, there was a larger macro factor. We believe primarily triggered by inflation and the pricing that went along with that. However, we see that sort of starting to recede, here in the rearview mirror we're seeing consumers a little healthier. And so we're very focused on the innovation and renovation that we know will continue to propel those categories.","James Murphy","Well, I think Ken said it well and I think I've said that everything in my prepared remarks that what I think is going to drive this category back to growth again. I have unwavering faith that cereal is an adaptable category and we'll meet the changing needs of consumer at breakfast and that's going to be done through product news and innovation and investing behind those great ideas.","David Driscoll - Citigroup","I appreciate those comments and Ken I really appreciate your follow-up on that because it seems to me that it's just impossible to explain this gigantic category in the absence of the context of the environment. A follow-up on SG&A if I can, impressive performance here of SG&A as a percent of sales, down about 70 basis points I think. Can you guys just comment on this was not marketing related. Marketing was up nicely. What drove this and what's the sustainability of it throughout this year and maybe beyond that?","Kendall Powell","Yes, David, you're right, the media spending was up. That actually we drove up SG&A. The balance of our SG&A was benefited from -- can you reply our HMM prices against our admin expenses. And we're also seeing the benefit of the restructuring actions that we took in the fourth quarter of fiscal '12 played out through this quarter as well. So we're at a sustainable level of spend in our SG&A.","David Driscoll - Citigroup","This is a good run rate as a percent of sales more or less?","Kendall Powell","Yes, that's a fair run rate.","Operator","Our next question comes from Diane Geissler of CLSA.","Diane Geissler - CLSA","I wanted to ask, Jim, a couple of questions about the cereal category. Can you tell me what does your research about actual consumption of cereals by consumers? Is it -- what I'm trying to get at here is how much of it is consumed at breakfast as breakfast. What's consumed sort of outside that day part? And then what do you make up the increased competition from away from home channels. It's become a big focus for a lot of other restaurant chains because it's one of the day parts that they are under indexed on and so everybody is rolling out breakfast and I guess I am just curious about how you see that as a competitive threat?","James Murphy","Let me just address the day part issue first. Over 90% of cereals consumed at breakfast currently. We see it as actually had growth opportunity for us, because we know that there is behavior out there that consumers eat cereals beyond breakfast as well, but it's still the fact is that most of it is consumed during that day part and we think it's a growth opportunity frankly to start marketing against that.","So the second part of your question is really the quick serve restaurants in the advent of breakfast and they spent a lot of money on it as you know and many of the big QSRs have picked up breakfast as a growth platform. Having said that breakfast at home is growing, and so it's not really in our view taking a lot of occasions away. It's basically, I think and our research suggests that it's really going after those who have skipped breakfast in the past predominantly and we're picking up as many of those skippers as they are. And so I think there both actually growing.","Kristen Wenker","Operator, let's sneak one more in here before we're done with the hour.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Lazar of Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays","Just a quick one, Don, and then just quick one for Jim. Don, I think you had said that you still expected or maybe this is a week or so ago, gross margins to be up maybe a little bit for the year as a whole even though you started off with them being down in the first quarter of about 130 basis points. So is that still the case and just your sense on what gives you the confidence around the visibility there?","Donal Mulligan","Our expectations for gross margins are unchanged from the guidance we gave in July that we reaffirmed at your conference couple of weeks ago, Andrew. As I've mentioned in my comments we expect and have seen inflation is going to be higher in the first half of the year and then we'll also begin to lap the comparisons on Yoplait Canada and Yoki starting next quarter. So that combined with increased savings from HMM as the year unfolds gives us confidence we're going to see improving margins as F '14 plays out.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays","And then, Jim, you guys obviously have a long and rich history of data and kind of a knowledge base around the overall cereal category over a long, long sort of period of time. And I am just curious as you look at all the data I assume you come up with periods of time where there maybe several years in a row where the category overall in cereal isn't kind of behaving the way you wanted to for various reasons.","But as you look back, I mean can you come up with similar timeframes where you had these sorts of category issues that have been typically invariably been solved through the things you're talking about whether it's brand building, innovation what not from all the category players. What I was trying to get at, is there anything really different here structurally now than maybe what you've seen in past periods like this?","James Murphy","Thanks for the question, Andrew, and in fact the answer is no to that. And if you look at the long history of cereal, let's just go back, say 30 years as I mentioned in my remarks cereals put on over 6 billion in sales over that time period, growing at about an average rate of dollar sales at about 3% compound annually over that time period, but it hasn't been 3% every year as you mentioned.","In my 21 years at General Mills, I've seen growth in the cereal category written-off a couple different times. I will just bring up a couple of examples. The first one is when bagels become phenomenon in the U.S. And everyone has got to move to bagels and no one was going to eat cereal anymore. And then low and behold we innovated on cereal and brought some new taste varieties and new textures into the category and the category rebounded.","The second time is when Atkins diet craze came a long and again everyone was going to move away from carbohydrates at that point. And then we brought whole grain news to the category. We brought fiber news to the category. We tend to be able to innovate our way out of this. And so the short answer is no, I don't see anything different about this time period than I saw the first two time periods around, but it's been comment on the branded manufacturers to bring the news and adapt in this highly adaptable category.","Kristen Wenker","All right, we are to the end of the hour here and so I've got to let my speakers go. I am sure there are some folks, maybe still in queue. Give us a shout if we can be of help.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

As a reminder, today\u2019s call is being recorded Tuesday, December 20, 2016.","Now I would like to turn the conference over to Jeff Siemon, Finance Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Jeff Siemon","Thanks Tony. Good morning and happy holidays to everybody. I\u2019m here with Ken Powell, our CEO; Don Mulligan, our CFO, and Jeff Harmening, our President and COO. I\u2019ll turn you over to them in a minute, but first I\u2019ll cover our usual housekeeping items.","Our press release on second quarter results was issued over the wire services earlier this morning. You can find the release and a copy of the slides that supplement this morning\u2019s remarks on our investor relations website. I\u2019ll remind you that our remarks this morning will include forward-looking statements that are based on management\u2019s current views and assumptions. The second slide in today\u2019s presentation lists factors that could cause our future results to be different than our current estimates.","With that, I\u2019ll turn you over to my colleagues, beginning with Ken.","Ken Powell","All right, well thanks Jeff, and good morning to one and all. I\u2019ll cover the key headlines for the second quarter","First, we feel good about the margin expansion progress and EPS growth we delivered in the quarter, and we continue to have confidence in our ability to deliver on our goal of a 20% operating margin by fiscal \u201918. We remain committed to our Consumer First strategy, and where we\u2019re getting the ideas right, it\u2019s driving growth, whether that\u2019s Annie\u2019s and Larabar in the U.S., Haagen Dazs outside North America, or Old El Paso around the world.","Even so, our net sales performance did not meet our expectations in the second quarter. We didn\u2019t have enough marketing support, meaning the combination of trade, media and new product news to drive improved top line results, and on top of that we saw a slowdown in food industry growth in the U.S. in recent periods. So we\u2019re making targeted adjustments to our plans in the back half to find the right balance of investment and return while still driving significant margin expansion. Jeff Harmening will take you through more details on our second half business plans in a moment.","As a result of our sales trend, we\u2019re revising down our expectations for full year net sales and segment operating profit, but we remain on track to deliver our EPS and margin expansion guidance and we\u2019re increasing our free cash flow growth expectations thanks to continued good financial discipline. ","Finally, we announced an important change to our organizational structure earlier this month. This change represents a significant step towards operating as a global company, allowing us to unlock global growth opportunities while continuing to drive efficiency and increase agility in our organization.","With that, let me turn things over to Don to provide more detail on our financial performance.","Don Mulligan","Thanks Ken, and good morning everyone. With that as a backdrop, let me get into the numbers, provide a summary of our cost savings efforts, and give you some more details on our updated guidance.","Slide 6 summarized our second quarter fiscal \u201917 financial results. Net sales totaled $4.1 billion, down 7% as reported. Organic net sales declined 4%. Total segment operating profit totaled $830 million, comparable to last year on a constant currency basis. Net earnings decreased 9% to $482 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.80, as reported. Adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes certain items affecting comparability, was $0.85 Constant currency adjusted diluted EPS increased 5% compared to last year\u2019s results.","Slide 7 shows the components of total company net sales growth. Organic net sales declined 4% in the quarter driven by seven points of lower organic pound volume growth, partially offset by three points of positive sales mix and net price realization. Foreign currency translation didn\u2019t have a material impact on net sales this quarter. The net impact of acquisitions and divestitures reduced sales growth by three points in the quarter.","Turning to segment results, total U.S. retail net sales declined 9% with growth in snacks offset by declines in the other operating units. Organic net sales were down 6% in the quarter. The difference between reported and organic net sales primarily reflects the divestiture of Green Giant, which impacts the meals unit results. Segment operating profit grew 2% versus last year with benefits from margin expansion initiatives more than offsetting lower volumes. ","In our convenience stores and food service segment, net sales declined 4% in the second quarter. This segment\u2019s Focus 6 platforms returned to growth with net sales up 2%, driven by growth in cereal, yogurt, snacks, mixes and biscuits. As we expected, net sales declined 10% on our non-Focus 6 businesses in the quarter, primarily due to market index pricing on bakery flour. We expect headwinds from flour index pricing, which impacts sales that are profit neutral to lessen significantly in the second half. For the second quarter, segment operating profit was up 6%, driven by benefit from cost savings initiatives, lower input costs, favorable product mix, and higher green merchandising [indiscernible]. ","Slide 10 summarizes our constant currency net sales and profit results for our international segment. Total international organic net sales declined 1% in the second quarter. At the region level, second quarter constant currency net sales in Asia Pacific region were comparable to last year, with double-digit growth in India offset by the restructuring of our snacks business in China, which we announced last quarter. This action will continue to be a headwind to sales growth through the first quarter of fiscal \u201918. Excluding snacks, net sales for the rest of our China business were up mid-single digits in the quarter. ","Latin America sales declined 2% in constant currency in second quarter, reflecting the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Organic net sales in the region were up low single digits. In Europe, constant currency net sales were down 3% with declines in yogurt offsetting growth for Haagen Dazs and Old El Paso. ","In Canada, sales were down 7% in constant currency, almost entirely due to the divestiture of Green Giant. Constant currency international operating profit declined 18% in the quarter due to currency driven inflation on products imported into Canada and the U.K. While we expect further headwinds from the British pound in the second half, the Canadian dollar impact should moderate significantly.","Turning to joint venture results on Slide 11, CPW net sales grew 3% in constant currency with broad growth across the Middle East, Asia, the U.K. and Australia. Haagen Dazs Japan constant currency net sales increased 21% due to strong new seasonal product performance and double-digit growth in handheld treats. Combined after-tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $30 million in the second quarter, up 27% in constant currency primarily driven by strong sales growth as well as lower administrative costs for CPW and lower input costs for Haagen Dazs Japan. ","As Ken said, we made good progress on our margin expansion goals in the second quarter. Adjusted gross margins were up 130 basis points with benefits from holistic margin management and our other cost savings initiatives more than offsetting low input cost inflation. For the full year, we continue to expect cost of goods sold HMM savings to more than offset our expectation of 2% inflation. Adjusted operating profit margins increased 160 basis points in the quarter, slightly ahead of our full year goal.","Slide 13 summarizes other noteworthy income statement items in the quarter. We incurred $53 million in restructuring and project-related charges in the quarter, including $24 million reported in cost of sales. Corporate unallocated expenses, excluding certain items affecting comparability, decreased $18 million. Net interest expense increased 2% from the prior year. We continue to expect full-year interest expense will be flat to last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.8% as reported. Excluding items affecting comparability, the tax rate was 32.4% compared to 32.3% last year. We now expect our full year tax rate will be roughly aligned with the year-ago rate of 29.8%. Average diluted shares outstanding declined 2% in the quarter. We now expect a 2% reduction for the full year compared to our previous guidance of down 1 to 2%. ","Turning to our first half financial performance, net sales of $8 million were down 7% as reported and down 4% on an organic basis. Segment operating profit declined 2% in constant currency and adjusted diluted EPS was up 1% as reported and up 2% in constant currency. ","Turning to the balance sheet, Slide 15 shows our further progress on core working capital. Our core working capital decreased 20% versus a year ago, and we continue to drive operational improvements across our business. This is the 15th consecutive quarter that we have reduced core working capital, and we have visibility to further reductions in the coming quarters behind continued efforts to improvements in payables. As a result, we\u2019re raising our fiscal \u201917 guidance on free cash flow growth from mid single digits to high single digits.","First half operating cash flow was $988 million, down 15% from a year ago largely driven by timing of trade and advertising accruals and taxes payable related to the Green Giant divestiture last year. Year-to-date capital investments totaled $318 million, and through the first half of the year we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and net share repurchases.","As Ken mentioned, we\u2019re taking another step toward operating as a global company by changing our reporting structure to maximize our global scale, unlock global growth opportunities, and continue to drive efficiency. We\u2019ve established four new business groups: North America retail, which combines our current U.S. retail segment and our Canada region in our international segment; Europe and Australia, which is currently another international region; Asia and Latin America, which combines the remaining two current international regions, and convenience stores and food service. ","As part of this change, we anticipate eliminating 400 to 600 positions worldwide, which we estimate will drive savings of $70 million to $90 million by fiscal \u201918. We intend to begin reporting results under this new structure in the third quarter and will provide restated historical data at that time. This announcement is the latest in a series of significant actions we\u2019ve taken since fiscal \u201915 to streamline our structure and drive savings. As always, HMM is at the center of this effort and continues to deliver significant savings in our cost of goods. In fact, between fiscal \u201915 and fiscal \u201917, HMM will generate more than $1.2 billion in cost of goods sold savings, which keeps us on track to achieve our target of $4 billion in savings from HMM this decade.","We\u2019ve announced additional projects since fiscal \u201915 to improve our organizational effectiveness while delivering incremental cost savings. As part of our initiative to streamline our global supply chain network, we will have closed 11 plants by fiscal \u201918 or 17% of our 2014 factory base. Including those plant closures as well as Projects Catalyst, Compass, and our new global reorganization, we\u2019ll have reduced approximately 5,000 positions by fiscal \u201918, or roughly 12% of our global headcount. We continue to reduce our administrative expenses and driven incremental savings through our implementation of zero-base budgeting. We estimate these projects will drive $700 million in aggregate cost savings by fiscal \u201918, above and beyond HMM.","We\u2019re progressing well on our goal to 20% adjusted operating profit margins by fiscal \u201918, which represents more than 300 basis point improvement over fiscal \u201916 levels. We continue to expect this margin expansion to come from three areas. First, a fiscal \u201917 COGS HMM savings net of inflation still makes up about 25% of our goal. At our investor day in July, we said the other two buckets were split roughly equally. Now that we\u2019ve provided visibility to our global reorganization, you can see that savings from our announced projects represent fully half of our margin expansion goal. The remaining 25% will come primarily from strategic revenue management, spending optimization efforts, and other cost efficiency initiatives.","Let me finish with second half expectations and full-year outlook. We expect modest improvement in organic net sales growth in the second half as we adjust our levels of support and continue to invest in Consumer First news that is working. We expect to deliver significant adjusted operating profit margin expansion thanks to our cost savings efforts, and that in turn will help drive double-digit growth in adjusted diluted EPS in the second half. Finally, we expect to accelerate our free cash flow growth behind further improvements in our core working capital.","I\u2019ll close my section by summarizing our updated fiscal \u201917 guidance, which you can find on Slide 21. Given our first half performance, we now expect full year organic net sales to be down 3% to 4%. As a result, we\u2019re now targeting total segment operating profit growth of 2% to 4% on a constant currency basis versus the prior guidance of 6% to 8% growth. We continue to expect adjusted operating profit margin expansion of 150 basis points. As I mentioned previously, we expect interest expense and our adjusted tax rate will be flat to last year, and we anticipate average diluted shares will decline 2%. We continue to expect adjusted diluted EPS will be up between 6% and 8% in constant currency. We now expect foreign currency translation will be a $0.01 headwind to full-year diluted EPS results. Finally, we\u2019re increasing our free cash flow guidance from mid-single digit growth to high single digit growth, reflecting continued strong core working capital discipline. ","With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jeff. ","Jeff Harmening","Thanks Don and good morning everyone. As Don mentioned, we posted organic net sales declines in the quarter with our growth and foundation businesses down 3% and 8% respectively. In some businesses, we met our expectations and in others we fell short. We didn\u2019t deliver the top line improvement we were expecting from the U.S. retail in the second quarter, with organic sales finishing down 6%. On the other hand, margin delivery was strong with U.S. retail operating profit margins up 270 basis points through 24.4%. We also expected better net sales performance for our convenience stores and food service segment, and we met that expectation with our Focus 6 platforms returning to growth this quarter.","Within our international segment, we expected improved organic net sales performance. We saw a top line improvement in Europe and in China offset by a slowdown in Canada, leaving total segment organic net sales growth in line with our first quarter results. Let me describe in more detail the drivers of our second quarter performance and discuss our operating plans for the second half of this year, starting with U.S. retail.","The operating environment here in the U.S. remains challenging. As you can see on Slide 24, the industry has experienced a slowdown in retail sales growth, including a decline in the most recent quarter as benefits from pricing have eroded and unit volume has remained weak. In our categories, average unit prices were up 3% last quarter but volume softness drove overall category retail sales down 1%. For our business, it was our five largest categories - cereal, yogurt, snack bars, refrigerated dough, and soup that fell short of expectations. As Ken told you upfront, we did not have enough marketing support in the form of trade and consumer spending and new product news to deliver the improvement we were looking for. We also saw a bit more competitive activity in some of these categories in the quarter.","In our other categories, our results were actually a bit better than our expectations, led by Old El Paso Mexican foods, Totino\u2019s hot snacks, and our natural and organic portfolio. We\u2019re adding back some support in the second half, but we will remain disciplined in our spending. We still believe prioritized investment against the best growth opportunities while continuing to drive margin expansion is the right thing to do for the long-term health of our business.","Retail sales for our cereal brands were down 3% in the quarter. Where we had compelling Consumer First messaging, we saw good consumer response. For example, our gluten-free Cheerios news and removal of artificial ingredients continues to drive growth in baseline or full-price sales. Consumers still love great tasting cereals. More cocoa in Cocoa Puffs is driving double-digit retail sales growth for this brand, and more cinnamon news continued to drive good performance on Cinnamon Toast Crunch, but overall we didn\u2019t get the quality of merchandising we expected and we didn\u2019t have enough marketing pressure to drive better results for our business in the quarter.","In the second half, we\u2019re adding incremental consumer spending to support news that\u2019s working, like gluten-free Cheerios and the removal of artificial ingredients. We\u2019ll also improve our in-store execution and we\u2019re securing better merchandising events with key retailers on some of our largest established brands. In total, we expect to continue to drive positive net price realization for our cereal business in the back half of the year. ","New products will also contribute to improved second half performance. We\u2019re bringing the taste of real fruit to Cheerios with a new Very Berry variety. It contains strawberries, blueberries and raspberries with no artificial colors or flavors, and of course it\u2019s gluten-free. Watch for it in the stores beginning next month.","On yogurt, we continue to see challenging performance in the second quarter with retail sales down 18% and our lite and Greek 100 varieties driving the majority of those declines. Retail sales for the yogurt category also turned negative in the quarter as elevated levels of merchandising generated less incremental lift and as the level of new products news slowed. On a more positive note, we\u2019re seeing good initial consumer response to our Annie\u2019s and Liberte organic yogurts that we launched in the first quarter. As we enter the second half, we\u2019ll build on our first half yogurt news. Together, the Annie\u2019s and Liberte brands already hold an 8% share of the organic yogurt segment. We expect these brands to have a more significant impact on our second half performance as we continue to expand distribution. ","We also renovated our Gogurt offerings in the first half, improving the value proposition with larger counts of individual tubes. Where we\u2019re getting the price right with retailers, it is performing quite well, so we\u2019ll look to expand that success in the remainder of the year.","We\u2019re also introducing new and renovated yogurt offerings in the second half that squarely meet consumer needs. Our renovated Greek 100 protein line appeals to consumers looking for a higher amount of protein for just 100 calories. It\u2019s made with real fruit and has a delicious thick texture that we think consumers will prefer.","Yoplait Dippers combine creamy Greek yogurt with the crunch of pretzels or oat bites. They offer spoon-free snacking and are a perfect afternoon pick-me-up. Yoplait custard yogurt is a silky smooth indulgent snack or dessert made with whole milk and just a few other simple ingredients. ","We know we have a good deal of work to do to turn around our yogurt business. We expect some improvement in the second half but won\u2019t return to growth this year. We believe the key to success will be fundamentally shifting our portfolio through renovation and innovation to give consumers what they want from their yogurt. That\u2019s the essence of Consumer First. The product news I just shared will help us make important strides towards that goal in the second half of this year, and we have a great pipeline of innovation, including an exciting launch in early fiscal \u201918 that should help build a strong foundation for the future.","On snack bars, Nature Valley retail sales were down 3% in the second quarter, so we\u2019re adding some incremental media support in the back half and we have a good line-up of new launches. We\u2019re expanding our successful biscuit sandwiches with a cocoa almond butter variety. We\u2019re launching new XL Sweet and Salty bars that are 50% bigger, developed with men in mind, and we\u2019re very excited about our new granola cups, which feature a crunchy whole grain shell filled with peanut or almond butter. They add an indulgent offering to the Nature Valley brand but with just 9 grams of sugar per serving.","Retail sales for Fiber 1 bars were down double digits in the second quarter, consistent with the decline in the adult segment of the bars category. As you may recall, Fiber 1 was the first brand to do the seemingly impossible - make fiber taste good, and we\u2019re making it taste even better with new layered bars that contain crisp grains, caramel and almond toppings and chocolate, and 9 grams of fiber per bar. ","On Larabar, retail sales were up more than 50% in the second quarter. In the back half, we\u2019re expanding Larabar offerings with a line of new fruits and grains bars. These bars contain a quarter cup of kale or spinach, giving Larabar consumers the nutrition they\u2019re looking for and just five simple ingredients per bar.","Refrigerated dough and soup round out our largest five categories in the U.S., and we\u2019re supporting these businesses with consumer news in the second half. We will be adding marketing support to Pillsbury refrigerated dough, and we have some news coming for Easter too. With our new shelf set of stand-up cans, we continue to expand across retailers.","Our performance on Progresso soup wasn\u2019t where we wanted it to be in the second quarter as we experienced heightened competitive activity and unusually warm weather; but winter is certainly here now, and we\u2019re ramping up our messaging behind our antibiotic-free chicken news. ","As I mentioned earlier, we saw good results in our other categories in the U.S. retail and we\u2019ll build on that momentum in the second half. Old El Paso has been generating growth within our meals platform in recent years. Consumer First innovation, including new flavors and formats of stand-and-stuff shells and tortillas drove retail sales up 6% in the quarter. Innovation is also working for Totino\u2019s hot snacks with retail sales up 6% in the quarter. We saw particularly good performance on pizza sticks, which were launched in the first quarter, and we\u2019ll introduce larger count sizes next month. We think this is a great example of knowing our consumer and reaching them with relevant products and messaging.","The Annie\u2019s brand continues to lead our growth in natural and organic. Retail sales for the brand grew 46% in the second quarter and our points of distribution are up more than 30% year-to-date in meals and measured channels alone. Retail sales for Annie\u2019s established items, like snacks and mac-n-cheese, grew 20% in the quarter, and we continue to build distribution on our category expansions in cereals, yogurt, soup, baked goods, and grain snacks. Next month, we\u2019ll introduce Annie\u2019s organic ready-to-eat popcorn. With the strength of this great brand as well as the performance of our other terrific natural and organic brands, we are well on our way to meeting our goal of $1 billion in net sales for our natural and organic portfolio by 2019.","So as we look to the second half, we have plans in place to drive improvement for our U.S. retail businesses. We\u2019re optimizing our marketing support across our five largest categories. We\u2019ll continue to build on what\u2019s working by investing behind our natural and organic businesses as well as Old El Paso and Totino\u2019s. We have a solid line-up of new products that are aligned with growing areas of consumer interest, and we\u2019ll continue to drive margin expansion for U.S. retail, building on the improvement we posted in the first half.","Let me turn briefly to our convenience stores and food service segment. As Don mentioned, net sales declined in the quarter driven in large part by negative impact of flour pricing; however, our Focus 6 platforms posted net sales growth, led by our yogurt platform with net sales gains for Yoplait Parfait Pro and increased cereal sales and schools. In the second half, we expect continued good growth from our Focus 6 platforms and a reduced headwind from our flour index pricing. We\u2019ll also bring more innovation to food service customers with new artisan breads designed for K through 12 schools. This includes pre-sliced premium quality ciabatta breads and flat panini breads that allow operators to make hot sandwiches with reduced labor and without additional equipment. In total, these efforts should result in improved top line performance for this segment in the second half.","Now let\u2019s turn to our international segment. Sales in our developed markets were mixed in the second quarter. Retail sales for Old El Paso were up high single digits in Canada behind stand-and-stuff taco shell innovation. In Europe, we posted high single-digit retail sales declines on yogurt, high single-digit growth for wholesome snacks, and high teens growth for Haagen Dazs, led by stick bars. In the second half, we\u2019ll build on what\u2019s working in developed markets and also bring new product news to our categories. Our Old El Paso stand-and-stuff business has been a good growth driver in recent years, and we recently launched a mini shell variety in Europe. We\u2019re expanding our successful Haagen Dazs stick bars into new European markets and adding new flavors to the line. On yogurt, we\u2019re focusing on improving our in-store execution and closing distribution gaps. We\u2019re also entering the fast-growing indulgent segment with our new Triple Sensations line. In Canada, we\u2019re launching Yoplait whole milk yogurt that has all-family appeal and will drive growth on our expanding natural and organic business with the addition of items like Larabar bites. ","China is our largest emerging market, and we still had good second quarter net sales growth there on Haagen Dazs, Wanchai Ferry, and Yoplait. Our Yoplait yogurt business continues to grow in Shanghai and we\u2019re gaining a foothold in Beijing, which we entered this summer. As Don mentioned, our results were partially offset by our snacks restructuring in China which is a headwind to sales but will be slightly accretive to underlying profit. In the EMEA region, Haagen Dazs stick bars launched in the first quarter and are performing well. In the second half in China, we\u2019re launching a new Wanchai Ferry kid\u2019s line in time for Chinese New Year. These dumplings come in colorful wrappers, are a smaller size for kids, and have nutritional ingredients like pork, salmon and shrimp that appeal to moms. On Haagen Dazs, we\u2019re launching new Fruit and Flowers ice cream flavors like Rose and Raspberry, and Elderflower and Blackcurrant that deliver a sweet, aromatic experience. In EMEA, we\u2019ll continue to drive growth on Haagen Dazs with new flavor of stick bars in our core client business, and we\u2019re launching frozen yogurt across multiple markets following its success in China.","For our international segment in total, we expect our underlying top line trend to improve in the back half and we\u2019re planning for operating margin expansion as transaction currency headwinds moderate.","Now I\u2019ll turn it back to Ken for some closing remarks.","Ken Powell","All right, thank you, Jeff. Let me just summarize our comments this morning. We continue to take a disciplined approach to the top line, focusing our investments behind our highest returning Consumer First ideas and eliminating activities that are not generating profitable volume. Our organic sales results didn\u2019t meet our expectations this quarter, so we\u2019re adding support and launching a solid line-up of new products to strengthen the second half. ","We delivered strong margin expansion and good EPS growth in the second quarter, and our HMM and other cost savings efforts keep us on track to deliver our fiscal \u201918 goal of a 20% adjusted operating profit margin. We updated our full-year growth goals to reflect a softer top line, but we\u2019re maintaining our EPS guidance and increasing our free cash flow growth target as we continue to drive operational efficiency across our businesses.","That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, you can open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","We\u2019ll get the first question on the line from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Go right ahead.","Robert Moskow","Hi, thank you. Jeff and Ken, I think investors are going to look at this guide down for sales and segment operating profit as kind of a referendum on the industry\u2019s efforts to reduce trade promo, reduce advertising as a means to improve margins and improve efficiency. I just want to understand how you\u2019re thinking about it internally. You say you\u2019re going to have to add back some marketing in the back half of the year on a selective basis, but can you give us a sense of comfort that the strategy for this year and for next year, that you\u2019re not cutting too far to the bone or that there\u2019s not going to be a bigger reinvestment in \u201918 to kind of make up for what\u2019s been lost in the first couple of quarters?","Ken Powell","Hi Rob, this is Ken. I\u2019ll start, and I\u2019m sure Jeff will want to jump in. So we think it\u2019s very clear that taking a very disciplined approach to spending, both trade promotion and consumer, is the right thing to do; and quite honestly, we\u2019re going through depth and frequency and executional approach across our trade promotion, and we have the ability to look at those and understand their impact almost deal by deal. We think that doing that and that approach is the right thing to do, we just don\u2019t want to promote in ways that create a loss for us. The same of course is true for consumer spending - we\u2019ve got to see the return, so I think we remain very convinced and committed to expecting strong return from our promotional and advertising dollars. ","Having said that, as we look back at the first quarter, we think there are cases where we cut too far or reduced spending too much in certain areas, so we\u2019re going to add back and correct as we go forward in the second half. I think you heard Jeff comment on some of the areas where we\u2019re going to do that. So fundamentally, we think discipline in this area is good and there are opportunities to improve, I think quite significantly, but we\u2019ve got to correct as we go forward into the second half.","Jeff, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d add anything?","Jeff Harmening","I would say importantly in some areas, we reduced our spending on trade, for example on Old El Paso and Totino\u2019s hot snacks, and we got it really right and we increased our revenues partially as a result of that, along with some good innovation. So there are areas where we feel really good about what we have done, and cereal is not far off either, to be honest. Cereal really is a matter of we think we\u2019ve got some great ideas, we just didn\u2019t spend enough consumer marketing support against those, which we\u2019ll add back. But fundamentally on the trade side, we didn\u2019t get that too wrong.","There are a couple businesses where we didn\u2019t get it as right as we want, and I would say Pillsbury refrigerated dough is one of those. So we\u2019re dedicated to the strategy and we got it right in some places, and in some places we didn\u2019t get it exactly we\u2019re right and we\u2019re making the changes that we need to.","Robert Moskow","Hey Jeff, can I ask a follow-up? You had one chart that\u2019s rather striking, that shows category pricing has gone negative for the first time in a long time in U.S. retail, but your price realization is up over 3%. How sustainable is that?","Jeff Harmening","Well Rob, I think it\u2019s a really good question. If you look at the--prices have actually deflated if you look at the total store, but it\u2019s really driven by the perimeter. So if you look at the perimeter of the store, that\u2019s really where you see pretty significant price deflation. In the categories where we operate, we\u2019re actually seeing modest amounts of price inflation, so we think we can generate pricing. We think we generated a touch too much in the second quarter, but we can generate price even in this environment because in the categories that we compete in, we\u2019re actually seeing some positive price realization.","Robert Moskow","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. We\u2019ll get to our next question on the line from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Go right ahead.","Bryan Spillane","Hey, good morning everyone. Just two quick ones. First one, I guess if we look at the guidance for the full year, could you just give us some color in terms of phasing? Will more of it be pushed into the fourth quarter in terms of the growth, or would we see some improvement in 3Q?","Don Mulligan","Bryan, this is Don. We expect a bit of sales improvement in Q3 and more in Q4. Obviously our cost savings build, cost savings initiatives build as the year goes on, so as a result of that, the EPS growth is much more heavily weighted to the fourth quarter versus third quarter.","Bryan Spillane","But we should see some sequential year-on-year sales improvement in 3Q versus where we were in 2Q?","Don Mulligan","Modest, a little bit in Q3, but most in Q4.","Bryan Spillane","Most in Q4 - okay. Then just one, and maybe it\u2019s more a follow-up to Rob\u2019s question, but if you look at the five largest categories in the U.S. where you feel short, did the competitors do something different than you expected, so where you were trying to optimize trade spend or there\u2019s some instances in these categories where maybe your competition isn\u2019t, and that\u2019s what\u2019s sort of causing the shortfall?","Jeff Harmening","Bryan, thank you for that. You know, what I would say in general about the operating environment, it\u2019s fairly rational. It is rational, but in some of our biggest categories, a couple of our biggest categories, we did see an increase in trade promotion in the second quarter. We saw it a little bit in soup where our lead competitor had a pretty poor fall last year and came back a little stronger, and then we saw a little bit in cereal as well, a little bit more promotional in cereal, and also in refrigerated dough. So for three of those categories, we saw some more promotional support than we had--than we had seen before, and that really in combination with our pulling back was part of the challenge we saw in the quarter.","Bryan Spillane","All right, thank you. Thanks everyone. Have a happy holiday.","Ken Powell","You too.","Operator","Thank you very much. We\u2019ll get to our next question on the line from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Go right ahead.","Andrew Lazar","Good morning everybody, and happy holidays. ","Ken Powell","Hi Andrew.","Andrew Lazar","A bit of a follow-on as well, and it\u2019s I guess a little more philosophical, but how important is the 20% margin target in fiscal \u201918 specifically, in light of a top line that was supposed to showing some modest growth through fiscal \u201918? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of having a specific margin target out there. I understand what drove the thinking around putting a target out there when you did, but we\u2019re in a bit of a different environment now, I think, and does that maybe limit you in what you may feel you need to do from a reinvestment perspective just to get the top line to stabilize? You know, having a certain margin target obviously is noble in a lot of ways, but if it comes on a significantly smaller sales base, it doesn\u2019t get you obviously to where you want to be. It\u2019s a little more philosophical, but I was hoping you could sort of take a shot at that.","Ken Powell","Well Andrew, again I\u2019ll start. I mean, it\u2019s been--as we look at the environment, which has been slower growth across consumer industries, and listened pretty carefully to our investors, people who hold our stock, there really has been a very, very high interest in margin in this environment, so we felt it was important to make it clear that we\u2019ve heard that interest, and it was helpful externally but I\u2019ll also tell you very helpful internally for us to set a very clear and important goal. ","I also want to tell you that the actions that we\u2019ve taken to achieve that have been highly positive for General Mills, and so the work that we\u2019ve done over the last several years to optimize our supply chain, getting the right capacity in the right place has been extremely beneficial to the company for the long term. The base that\u2019s there now is very highly utilized, the actions that we\u2019ve taken, in fact as we\u2019ve said a number of times, to open the door to kind of a second wave of productivity initiatives as those plants are highly utilized, that\u2019s been extremely positive for General Mills. The work we\u2019ve done on the administrative structure, just to get a lighter structure, the work that we just announced to optimize the structure for global growth with a North American segment, kind of a Europe developed marketing segment, Asia - that segment, these are really designed now for executional efficiencies, better sharing. They\u2019re just way more efficient.","So I understand the question, but I would just say that the work that we\u2019ve done and we\u2019ve put in place to achieve these stronger margin goals has, I would say, overall been very highly positive for General Mills and sets us up very well for the future. Obviously margin and free cash flow are very important metrics for us, we talk about them repeatedly. Top line of course is also super important, so we understand how important it is to get the top line to turn and we\u2019re very focused on that.","If you guys want to add anything?","Jeff Harmening","I\u2019ve got a couple things. I don\u2019t want to reiterate too much what Ken said, but I think it\u2019s important to understand that as we look at our business, there\u2019s different levers we can pull to drive shareholder return. Sales growth is clearly the one that has the longest term benefit and where our focus is, but there\u2019s clearly margin expansion, there\u2019s cash conversion, and cash returned to shareholders. At different points in our history, we\u2019ve pulled those at different strengths based on what the market can bear, and as we looked at the market over the past couple years and at least for the near term, with less available top line growth, we wanted to make sure that we were still delivering a competitive return for our shareholders and that meant more on the margin. So that was kind of one input.","The other is that setting a target, and Ken kind of touched on this, it does make you think differently. It\u2019s brought to bear more ideas in terms of where we can find efficiencies, and we\u2019ve done it throughout our P&L and our balance sheet. As a result, it\u2019s creating flex for us to reinvest back into our business, and I think those are all good things. But at the end of the day, the goal is to ensure that we are investing behind good top line growing ideas and then driving a competitive margin, and that\u2019s really where we--at the end of the day, those are the two key things that we look at.","Andrew Lazar","Got it. I appreciate that color. Thank you. Just a very quick one - the new top line guidance, what does that embed for what you\u2019re expecting for foundation and the growth portfolios? Before I think it was down mid-single digit for foundation and up low single digit for growth. I don\u2019t know if you have a new metric on those? Thank you.","Don Mulligan","We do, thank you, Andrew. As Jeff walked you through, a couple of our large growth businesses is where we were short in the first quarter and the first half. As a result, as we went forward today, our growth businesses will probably be a touch negative, minus low single digits versus the plus low single digits we started the year. The foundation businesses actually have held in well and will still be in the range of mid single digits, maybe at the low end of the range but still in that range, so that\u2019s how you would you think about our new sales guidance.","Andrew Lazar","Great, thanks so much. ","Jeff Harmening","I would add on to that, Don. For the U.S., we\u2019re expecting only modest improvements. The guidance that we\u2019ve given allows for only modest improvement in the top line in the U.S. while continuing to expand margins. As we look at the second half, our two biggest improvements will be in our convenience and food service segment as well as in Europe.","Andrew Lazar","Thank you.","Operator","Thanks very much. We\u2019ll get to our next question on the line, from the line of Ken Goldman with JP Morgan. Go right ahead.","Ken Goldman","Hi, thanks. I have two for Don, one quick one if I can, and then a longer one. Don, just to sort of follow up on a question earlier in terms of the pacing of the year, tax rate guidance I think implies roughly 27% for the back half of the year. As we model, should we model that evenly across both quarters, or is there maybe a timing factor that might give a disproportionate benefit to 3Q or 4Q?","Don Mulligan","The number is about right for the back half of the year. I\u2019d have to check the quarterly phasing of it. I know last year we had a plus in Q3 because of some U.S. tax legislation that came through. That may push a little bit more to Q4 as the opportunity, but quite honestly, I\u2019ll have to confirm that for you, Ken.","Ken Goldman","Okay, no problem. My longer one is about the free cash flow guidance, and bear with me through some math, if you would. Through the first half of the year, I think your free cash is down over 20% year-on-year. I know these things move back and forth and there\u2019s timing issues and so forth, and I\u2019m not curious about why things can jump and reverse in the back half, but it does imply a pretty sizeable second half - I think over 30% just to get to your guidance, which in turn implies free cash of about $1.4 billion in the back half, which General Mills has never quite achieved before.","So I guess I\u2019m curious, Don - is there something unique in the back half of the cash story we should be aware of? You talked about payables. Is capex going to drop? I\u2019m just trying to understand a little bit more of the drivers behind that, if I could.","Don Mulligan","Yes, it\u2019s a really good question. I\u2019m glad you asked it. There\u2019s actually three things, and they really all revolve around working capital. The first is a year ago we had a big payable from the Green Giant sale that hit our operating cash flow, even though obviously the cash that came in was in the financing section--or the investment section, excuse me. So we had a large liability that will not obviously recur this year, so that was $160 million, I believe, at this point last year. That will change the complexion of our working capital on the balance of the year.","The other is our trade and advertising accruals. As we\u2019ve said, our media, our trade was down in the first half, even a bit more than we had planned and anticipated. As we reinvest more in the back half, those accruals will come up, again favorably impacting working capital. ","Then lastly, and the one that\u2019s the most sustainable that will carry forward into F18 as well, is our focus on core working capital. Inventory was a bit higher than we wanted it to be at the end of the second quarter, and that\u2019s because volumes did not come in as anticipated. That will even out and come down as the year unfolds. Then most importantly as we continue to work on our payables and as we move our vendors to 90-day terms, we\u2019ll see that benefit start to accrete more in the second half and again more in \u201918 as well.","So it\u2019s all around working capital, and it\u2019s those three big items - the tax payable on the Green Giant divestiture a year ago that we\u2019re rolling over, the level of advertising and trade payables that will increase as the year goes on as we increase investments in those two areas, and then the core--continuing to work on reducing core working capital.","Ken Goldman","Is it still safe for us to model maybe $730 million, $740 million in capex? I think that was the guidance in the 10-K.","Don Mulligan","Yes, that\u2019s correct.","Ken Goldman","Great, very helpful. Thanks Don.","Operator","Thank you very much. We\u2019ll get to our next question on the line with David Palmer from RBC. Go right ahead.","David Palmer","Thanks, good morning. First to follow up on that segmentation approach and the related promotion shifts, do you think in some cases you could have done a better job of analysis ahead of time, such that you could have further minimized the volume fall-offs? Conversely, should we just realize that this process is going to have some unknowns, that you may have a competitive response here or there and there\u2019s going to be lumpiness in terms of net revenue realization, both positive and negative, by quarter?","Jeff Harmening","Yes David, we did a lot of analysis before embarking on this, this net revenue management journey, and the returns that we\u2019re seeing from our advertising and our trade are playing out as we expected them to. What I would say is the competitive atmosphere is dynamic, and what you will see from us is making sure we\u2019re making adjustments to those plans as we go along, which is what we\u2019re doing in the back half. So even though we get a lot of things right, some of the things we tactically need to adjust, and that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing us do in the back half of this year. So as time goes on, we\u2019re dedicated to it, but I would say that we\u2019ve analyzed deeply the second quarter and we\u2019ve already made some changes, even from the end of our second quarter, which is the end of November, until today. So I think what you\u2019ll see from us is making sure that while we remain dedicated strategically to net revenue management and optimizing our profitable volume, we\u2019ll make adjustments as time goes along and as we see the competitive dynamics change.","David Palmer","Just a small one on weather - do you think it played a role in that November quarter? It was a pretty warm quarter. Do you think it might have been a drag on the Pillsbury and Progresso brands, and perhaps with the cold snap we\u2019re seeing in December, some of the early signs are better for these platforms?","Jeff Harmening","Well you know, that may be the case to a small degree in soup and on baking, but I would say the bigger driver of our performance is always what we do and the spending we put in place and how effective our spending is or our new products are. So as we look at the second half of the year, I\u2019m certainly not opposed to it being cold, but for us we really look at what we can drive, which is making sure we make the tactical adjustments to our spending and what we think is a good new product line-up for the second half.","David Palmer","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. We\u2019ll get to our next question on the line from Jason English from Goldman Sachs. Go right ahead.","Jason English","Hey, good morning folks. ","Ken Powell","Morning Jason.","Jason English","Thank you for letting me ask the question. I\u2019ve got a couple, I\u2019ll just rattle them off quickly. First on gross margins, can you give us a view of what you\u2019re expecting for the full year, and also what the slope of input cost inflation looks like for that 2%? Is it kind of steady throughout the year, or is there any sort of ramp or de-cel to it?","Don Mulligan","So our gross margin, we increased 50 basis points year-to-date. We think it will be up closer to 200 basis points in the back half of the year, so full year will be below our original 150 guidance, probably more in the 100 to 120 range, but it will improve in the back half for some substantial reasons. First off, we\u2019ll get better volume leverage as we see improved sales in the back half. That is primarily from volume, so our gross margin will benefit from that. The comps from last year, if you look at our trend last year, our gross margin expansion was essentially all in the first half, and that was due to inflation phasing, where inflation accelerated during the course of F16. Last year, gross margins were up 170 basis points in the first half, was actually about flat in the second half, and actually Q3 was down 130 basis points, so again I think that gross margin expansion this year on a comparable basis will skew to Q4.","To your specific question on inflation, we think it\u2019s fairly stable through the course of the year, slight acceleration in the back half and fourth quarter, and obviously we\u2019ll see pretty steady contributions from HMM exceeding that inflation. Our cost actions will build during the course of the year. That will help gross margin in the back half, and then transaction FX, which for the full year will be about a $50 million drag for us, $35 million of that is in the first half, as I said in my comments. The pound will continue to impact us in the back half, but we think the Canadian dollar will be less so, so we will absorb the majority of the transaction FX negative in the first half, so that will be less of a drag in the second.","So really, those four things - the volume leverage that we\u2019ll get in the second half slightly better than the first half, the comps particularly around inflation phasing will favor the back half this year again, especially the fourth quarter, our cost actions will build around Project Century benefits, and then transaction FX still a negative but a lighter negative in the back half.","Jason English","That\u2019s helpful. 125 BPs for the full year still sounds pretty solid, even it\u2019s a bit below 150. Building on that, to get to your 150 full-year EBIT margin expansion, A&P is on track to add around 100 BPs to margins, and maybe you spend some back, let\u2019s say at 75, so between GM and A&P, you\u2019ll have 200 BPs of margin cushion there. Implying some SG&A leakage at margin despite all the aggressive cost cuts, is that just a product of some of the sales softness? Is it a cadence of the SG&A discipline? I don\u2019t know, maybe you could shed some light on that.","Don Mulligan","Yes, I\u2019m not following all your math on that, but from an advertising standpoint, in the back half of the year, we said in the last call we expect advertising after the first quarter to be down double digits for the year. We still believe that, probably mid-teens, which means it will be better in the back half, still down slightly, but importantly up in some key businesses. Matter of fact, if you look at our growth businesses in the back half, excluding U.S. yogurt which we\u2019ve always said we\u2019re going to really right-size our investment there, given our historical share of voice, excluding U.S. yogurt our growth businesses\u2019 advertising investment, media investment will be up low single digits in the back half. And again, it\u2019s fairly spread across the businesses that Jeff talked to, so we\u2019ll see that in the back half.","And actually, our admin continues to be below last year, both within SOP and then at the corporate level as well, so that\u2019s actually a contributor. Obviously what\u2019s different is the sales are lower and volume is lower than we started the year, and that\u2019s an offset. So again, I didn\u2019t exactly follow your math, but we expect to get 150 basis points of operating margin expansion. We\u2019ll get a good piece of that, as you noted, through gross margin and we\u2019ll get the balance through the rest of the P&L, but all lines, including administrative costs and overhead costs, will contribute.","Jason English","Okay, very good. Thank you.","Operator","Thanks very much. We\u2019ll get to our next question on the line from Chris Growe from Stifel. Go right ahead.","Chris Growe","Hi, good morning. ","Ken Powell","Morning Chris.","Chris Growe","Hi. Just had a couple questions for you. The first is without getting to future revenue growth guidance, I think there was a question that alluded to this earlier, just that you do expect your revenue growth to improve in fiscal \u201918. Is that degree of improvement changing such that you\u2019re relying more heavily on cost savings to achieve the operating margin target? I guess as I see the revenue growth weaker in this quarter but also weaker for the year, just worried that some of it could carry into fiscal \u201918 and could lead to a little more challenge in achieving the operating margin.","Don Mulligan","Hi Chris. I think that first of all, we\u2019ll--we don\u2019t want to give guidance for F18 in December, but to your point, the way this year is coming out, I think we\u2019ll have to look at all the components of next year. I think this year coming in softer is obviously going to have to play into how we look at next year. We think that second half will be, as we\u2019ve said, better and will build momentum through Q3 and Q4, so we expect to enter \u201918 with the top line going in a better direction. Obviously we\u2019ve talked in great detail about all the margin work that will continue to play out as we go into F18, so I think your point about entering F18 at a lower level than we expected of course has to be considered, and we\u2019ll give detailed guidance on all of that in June, as we always do.","Chris Growe","Okay. Then just a question for you on the international growth in sales and operating profit. It was a little weaker than I thought this quarter, so I want to understand just how the--or maybe what regions the performance is expected to improve, and then just understand when you talk about marketing and it being down in the first half of the year, is international going to see a heavier marketing investment in the second half as well that could weigh on the margin a bit? ","Jeff Harmening","Chris, thanks for that question. As we look at the second half of the year, the biggest improvement we\u2019ll see will be in Europe, which is a very profitable business for us. We improved that business in the second quarter from the first quarter. We had a tough summer based on the Haagen Dazs sales as well as the Yoplait integration, but we saw the second quarter improve on Haagen Dazs and as well as OEP - Old El Paso and bars, and we expect that to continue in the second half of the year. We\u2019ve got really good innovation on Haagen Dazs, good innovation on Old El Paso, and we continue to expand our bars business. So--and the integration of our Yoplait business with our European business will be largely behind us, so we expect improved performance from there. ","So I would say in the second half, you\u2019ll see that, but I also want to mention that what we see is that our two largest developing markets, China and Brazil, have returned to growth if you look at organic growth. They\u2019re a little bit clouded by some restructuring we\u2019re doing of our snacks business in China and of our acquisition of yogurt in Brazil, but underlying that, in China we\u2019re back to mid-single digit organic growth. We\u2019re growing our Wanchai Ferry business, we\u2019re growing Haagen Dazs, and we continue to see good growth from yogurt. We\u2019re back to growth in Brazil as well and we\u2019re executing better in Brazil, so we\u2019re back to growth there.","So as we look at the second half, we expect to see growth from our two biggest developing markets as well as improved performance from Europe.","Don Mulligan","Chris, the only thing to add, just as a point, is also that both of our joint ventures are performing pretty well. Haagen Dazs Japan had a good quarter, and I think importantly we now have, I think, two and maybe three quarters of improved performance in CPW really with performance across the board better in that joint venture. So internationally, we\u2019re also seeing improving contribution from those JVs.","Chris Growe","Okay, thanks very much. I appreciate it, and happy holidays to you.","Ken Powell","Thanks Chris.","Jeff Siemon","Great. Operator, I think we\u2019ve let everyone take two bites of the apple with questions. We probably have time for one more, maybe a second; but let\u2019s go for one more.","Operator","Certainly. We\u2019ll get to one more question on the line from the line of Steven Strycula from UBS. Go right ahead.","Steven Strycula","Hi, good morning guys. Have a two-part question. The first part would be just to recap, what would you say is the key explanatory reason as the revised guidance on sales? Looking back to how you guided in July, is it more the delta that we\u2019re seeing in the yogurt business, or was there a little bit of a surprise in meals? Just expected that the core U.S. retail trends would kind of improve, much cleaner aisle impact in major retailers. That\u2019s one.","The second question would be, what is your go-forward M&A strategy, given the U.S. market has been decelerating a little bit more recently and emerging markets remain volatile?","Jeff Harmening","This is Jeff Harmening. Let me take the first part of that question, then I\u2019ll hand it over to Ken for the second part, I guess. On the first piece, the first half of the year, we plan to take out unprofitable volume, and we\u2019ve talked about that and we certainly did that while improving our margins. But the combination of taking out a little bit more spending than we had anticipated, as well as the competitive environment being a little bit more promotional than we anticipated, that kind of combination is what led to our first half sales results, particularly in the U.S., being below what we expected them to be. Although we got it right in some places on our spending, in some places we need to make adjustments.","Ken Powell","On the M&A front, look - as we\u2019ve said, we continue to look in many places for opportunities to create value, and these would be acquisitions that could drive growth or synergy, or both. We would look both in the U.S. and internationally. We are quite interested in snackable ideas, snacking is very much on trend. Also, simplicity and natural is of interest to us. Bolt-ons to existing business are quite interesting to us. So if you look at the last 24, 30 months, we acquired Annie\u2019s, an organic business, Epic Provisions all-natural beef snacks, Carolina Yogurt, a bolt-on, and so those are the kinds of things we\u2019ve been doing and we continue to look in those areas.","Steven Strycula","Okay, great. Then one follow-up for Don. Just to make sure that I heard you correctly, the year-over-year earnings growth rate in the back half, fourth quarter is supposed to be more pronounced growth than the third quarter, if I heard you correctly. Is that accurate?","Don Mulligan","That is correct.","Steven Strycula","Okay. Thanks guys. Happy holidays.","Jeff Siemon","Tony, do we have time maybe for one more, if we can sneak on?","Operator","Absolutely. We\u2019ll take one more question on the line, from the line of David Driscoll from Citi. Go right ahead.","David Driscoll","Man, that must have been my holiday Christmas present. Thank you, and good morning. I really appreciate that. I do have a couple of good ones here. I wanted to ask about the volumes in U.S. RO. So it\u2019s down 10, and wanted to understand how much of this is unprofitable volume that frankly you don\u2019t mind jettisoning, versus good stuff that you\u2019re really disappointed to see go? So could we start there?","Jeff Harmening","Well David, this is Jeff. Obviously a large part of it is unprofitable volume, and that\u2019s why our U.S., despite the fact that if you can imagine, we had a lot of deleverage given that our volumes were down 10% in the quarter, why our operating margin was up 270 basis points because--and it\u2019s not the only reason, but for sure a lot of this was unprofitable volume that we don\u2019t mind losing.","I think there were a couple cases where we felt like we had--we feel like we have good marketing, good news, and some things we could optimize. I look at cereal advertising, for example - we love the returns we get from our gluten-free advertising and from no artificial colors and flavors, and that advertising we think we can spend more than we did in the second quarter because we like the returns on that and we think we have really good news. ","David Driscoll","Then bigger picture, the sales guidance is down two to three points, the segment profit guidance is down four points, so it kind of goes back to this unprofitable volume question. When I look at figures like that on the reduction, it sounds to me like the sales that you\u2019re now expecting, this change in sales guidance, this was good stuff. This was volume that you did not want to lose, yet you are, so it does seem as if, if I\u2019m reading all the tea leaves here correctly, that we\u2019re getting into some of the bone here rather than just taking out excess fat, i.e. unprofitable volume. Is that the right way to characterize what\u2019s happened within the sales guidance change?","Jeff Harmening","Well David, as I said, there\u2019s a large portion of the volume that was not particularly profitable, and we got rid of that; but I also said we didn\u2019t get it exactly right. So I think there are some pieces of that volume that are more profitable, especially the non-promoted volume on big brands like cereal and bars where we think we didn\u2019t get the spending exactly right. By spending more to improve the everyday sales of those businesses, we can drive both our volume and our profitability.","Don Mulligan","David, this is Don. The only other thing I\u2019d add in terms of--you know, if you look at how much we reduced our sales guidance by versus SOP, the other factor not to lose sight of that doesn\u2019t impact sales is our transaction FX. As I mentioned, we have a $50 million, roughly $50 million negative transaction for products shipped into Canada and into the U.K., and about $40 million of that frankly was--it\u2019s about $40 million higher than what we had planned. Obviously Brexit happened after we announced our guidance, and that\u2019s incorporated into these updated guidance figures as well. ","David Driscoll","Final question from me, Ken, with the sales guidance reductions, you still are very confident on the call about the 20% margin goal in 2018. Would you simply characterize that the change in sales here is just not so significant relative to this 20% goal, that investors need to be concerned about the achievement of the 20% goal in light of the sales performance? ","Ken Powell","Look - we want to do all three. Our core metrics are revenue growth, margin expansion, and the efficiency with which we generate free cash flow and return it to shareholders. So all of those, we think are very important to our investors, and we\u2019re very focused on all three. Clearly over the last several years, we\u2019ve been highly focused on a variety of very positive restructuring initiatives just in terms of increasing the efficiency of our business model. That\u2019s all been very good, and that\u2019s included eliminating some volume that was unprofitable. ","I think as we go forward and with the distractions of some of those things mostly behind us, we\u2019re very highly focused on generating top line growth. Obviously that\u2019s critical to sustaining our business model, and we\u2019re very focused on that. That will be very important, and we\u2019ll see things improve here in the second half and we\u2019ll be highly focused on continuing that momentum as we go into F18.","David Driscoll","Thanks so much, and happy holidays.","Jeff Siemon","Great. Thanks everyone for sticking with us. I know we didn\u2019t get to everybody, so I\u2019ll be on the phone all day. Please give me a ring, look forward to speaking with you. Happy holidays everyone.

Welcome to the General Mills Third Quarter 2013 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, March 20, 2013.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Kris Wenker, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.","Kristen Smith Wenker","Thanks, operator. Good morning, everybody. I'm here with Ken Powell, our CEO; Don Mulligan, our CFO; and Dave Dudick, Senior Vice President and Head of our Bakeries and Foodservice business, and I'll turn the call over to them in just a minute. First, I'm going to cover my usual housekeeping items.","Our press release on third quarter results was issued over the wire services earlier this morning, it's also posted on our website, if you need a copy. We've put slides on the website, too, they supplement today's prepared remarks. Our remarks will include forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions. And the second slide in today's presentation lists factors that could cause future results to be different than our current estimates.","And with that, I'll turn you over to my colleagues, starting with Don.","Donal Leo Mulligan","Thanks, Kris, and good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us today. Our third quarter results are summarized on Slide 4. Net sales grew 8% to more than $4.4 billion. Sales for our base business grew 2%. New businesses, primarily Yoki in Brazil and Yoplait Canada, contributed 6 points of net sales growth in the quarter. Segment operating profit grew 11%, led by double-digit gains for our U.S. Retail and Bakeries and Foodservice segments. Net earnings totaled $398 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.60, as reported. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, our adjusted diluted EPS would be $0.64, up 16% from last year's third quarter.","Slide 5 shows the components of our net sales growth. Pound volume contributed 9 points of growth in the quarter, that's primarily the addition of Yoki and Yoplait Canada, which together contributed 8 points of volume growth. Volume growth excluding new businesses contributed 1 percentage point of growth. Sales mix and net price realizations subtracted 1 point of sales growth, and foreign exchange had no impact on total company sales growth in the quarter.","Slide 6 shows net sales growth by segment. The U.S. Retail net sales grew 2%, as our Snacks, Small Planet Foods, Baking and Meals divisions all posted gains. U.S. Retail pound volume matched year ago levels.","International net sales rose 24%, as reported, and 25% on a constant currency basis, with good growth across all geographic regions. These results do include 20 points of growth, primarily, from Yoki and Yoplait Canada. Excluding new businesses and foreign exchange, International sales grew 5% in the quarter. And net sales for our Bakeries and Foodservice business matched year-ago levels.","Gross margin declined in the third quarter, as reported results include the impact of the mark-to-market valuation for certain grain inventories and commodity hedges we'll use in future periods.","Slide 7 also shows that excluding mark-to-market effects, underlying gross margin declined 60 basis points, primarily due to change in our business mix. We expect our underlying gross margin will be down again in the fourth quarter and down 60 to 80 basis points for the full year.","Slide 8 shows third quarter profit growth by operating segment. U.S. Retail posted a 13% increase, reflecting lower inflation year-over-year, lower advertising expense and continued discipline around administrative costs. International profit was flat for the quarter, reflecting the impact of the bolivar devaluation in Venezuela. For us, this will total around $23 million in fiscal 2013, with $15 million hitting in the third quarter. For the year in total, this represents a roughly $0.02 impact on EPS, that's consistent with the estimate we gave you in December. Excluding the bolivar devaluation, International operating profit would've increased 16% in the quarter. In Bakeries and Foodservice, profit grew 13%, driven by favorable net price realization mix, grain merchandising earnings and lower manufacturing costs. Dave will talk more about this business segment in a moment.","After-tax earnings from joint ventures increased 37% in the quarter to $21 million, led by H\u00e4agen-Dazs Japan. On a constant currency basis, CPW sales increased 1%, with continued good performance in emerging markets, partially offset by market softness in southwestern Europe. Constant currency sales for H\u00e4agen-Dazs Japan grew 5%, led by new products and strong brand building support. Through 9 months, after-tax earnings from joint ventures are up 6% to $77 million.","Corporate unallocated expenses, excluding mark-to-market effects, were $76 million this quarter, that's above last year's third quarter, primarily due to increased pension expense.","Third quarter interest expense declined $19 million, primarily due to favorable rates and mix of debt. We now expect full year interest expense to show a low double-digit decline from 2012 levels.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter, excluding items affecting comparability, was 30.8%, below year-ago levels, due to audit settlements and federal legislation passed during the quarter. We estimate our underlying tax rate for fiscal 2013 will be below 33%. That means the fourth quarter rate will be above last year's fourth quarter, which had the lowest quarterly tax rate of the year.","Turning to the balance sheet. Slide 11 shows our core working capital increased 3%, driven by the addition of Yoki. Excluding the impact of Yoki, core working capital actually declined in the quarter, due to our focus on inventory reduction.","Through the first 9 months, cash flow from operations exceeded $2.1 billion. Capital expenditures totaled $412 million, roughly comparable to last year. So as you can see on Slide 12, our free cash flow is up 40% so far this year to more than $1.7 billion. We're returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We have repurchased approximately 19 million shares of common stock this year, for a total of $745 million. For the full year, we continue to target a net reduction in average diluted shares outstanding. And as we indicated at the CAGNY conference, our goal next year is a net 2% reduction in shares outstanding.","Dividends paid through the first 9 months of this year totaled $652 million, that's up 9% over last year. In fact, as shown on Slide 13, General Mills dividends have grown at an 11% compound rate in recent years. And last week, we announced a 15% dividend increase to a new quarterly rate of $0.38 per share, effective with our August 2013 payment.","Slide 14 summarizes our financial performance through the first 9 months of fiscal 2013. Net sales were up 6% to more than $13 billion. Segment operating profit is growing faster than sales, up 9%. Net earnings attributable to General Mills totaled nearly $1.5 billion, and diluted earnings per share were $2.24. Excluding items affecting comparability, our adjusted earnings per share totaled $2.16, up 10% from a year ago.","As we look to the end of the year, we expect to generate continued good sales growth. We do expect fourth quarter EPS to be below strong year-ago results, due to increased merchandising levels in this year's fourth quarter, higher supply chain costs and a higher tax rate. Including these assumptions for the fourth quarter, we remain on track to achieve our fiscal 2013 financial targets. We expect net sales to grow at a mid-single digit rate, including low-single digit growth from our established businesses, plus contributions from new businesses. We expect segment operating profit to grow at a mid-single digit rate, and we've raised our full year earnings per share guidance a bit to a range of $2.66 to $2.68 before items affecting comparability.","With that, I'll turn the microphone over to Dave for a review of our Bakeries and Foodservice segment. Dave?","David E. Dudick","Thanks, Don, and good morning, everybody. I appreciate the opportunity to give you an update on our Bakeries and Foodservice business.","Let me start with a reminder of how we've transformed this business over the last 5 years. Under the leadership of my predecessor, John MacHuzick, we've sold or exited lower-margin product lines, streamlined our supply chain and implemented a direct sales force. We've also focused our resources on our highest margin products in the most resilient channels. As a result of these efforts, we've significantly improved the profitability of this business. Since 2008, segment operating profit has increased at a 14% compound rate, and our profit margin has expanded by nearly 600 basis points. This is top-tier industry performance.","And with margins that are approaching the General Mills corporate average, we are an increasingly important contributor to company operating profit.","Our momentum is continuing in 2013. As you can see on Slide 18, year-to-date net sales are down modestly. But year-to-date operating profit is up 16%, driven by favorable product mix, lower input cost and grain merchandising earnings. Our operating profit margin exceeds 16% through the first 9 months of the year.","Today, our Bakeries and Foodservice business is focused on 6 key product platforms: snacks, cereal, frozen breakfast items, yogurt, biscuits and baking mixes. These products account for nearly 3\/4 of our segment operating profit and represent our best prospects for long-term growth. We are also focused on the fastest-growing channels. Slide 20 shows that food and beverage sales in certain channels are expected to grow ahead of foodservice industry rates. For convenience stores, food products are becoming an increasingly important contributor to channel sales and profit, as gasoline and tobacco products are on the decline. In the education channel, the K-12 breakfast occasion is expected to grow at double the overall channel growth rate of 2%. And on colleges and universities, the collective purchasing power of students is $76 billion and rising.","And the healthcare channel is projected to grow ahead of industry rates in response to the growing needs of the aging U.S. population.","Moving forward, we will continue to focus our efforts on our most profitable products in these fastest-growing foodservice channels. Of our 6 key product platforms, 4 are consumer branded. These are snacks, cereal, frozen breakfast items and yogurt. Let me tell you a bit more about our efforts against each of these businesses, beginning with snacks.","In convenience stores, our direct sales force provides unique consumer insights and category management expertise to drive sales growth for our customers and for General Mills. We've increased C-store distribution for our snack products in each of the past 4 years, driving double-digit net sales growth and a 2-point increase in market share. Our Nature Valley Oats 'n Honey Bars, the top-turning gran snack bar in the entire convenience store channel. And we've just launched a great new product lineup in January, including Nature Valley Protein Bars and a new Chex Mix variety. We're quickly expanding C-store distribution of our recently acquired Food Should Taste Good natural snacks.","In cereal, our Outnumber Hunger initiative gives college and university operators and students an opportunity to help ease the hunger issue in their communities. With every student cereal purchased on-campus, General Mills will make a donation to a local food bank. In the K-12 channel, we're the cereal category leader in school nutrition programs and breakfast programs. Recent legislation of the K-12 school nutrition program recommends more whole grain at breakfast. Since all of our Big G cereals contain more whole grain than any other single ingredient, we have a great opportunity to expand our cereal distribution in the education channel.","The recommendation of more whole grains is good for our K-12 frozen breakfast business, too. Our Pillsbury branded waffles, pancakes and French toast are each an excellent source of whole grain, with 16 to 24 grams per serving. And these products are easy for operators to prepare, they can be heated and served right in the package. We've recently added Pillsbury breakfast flatbread and Pillsbury Mini Muffins to our lineup.","In yogurt, we are providing operators and consumers with solution-based innovation. Yoplait ParfaitPro gives foodservice operators an easy way to prepare layered yogurt parfaits. This year, we've expanded distribution of yogurt parfaits to nearly 1,600 campuses across the country, nearly double the level of just 3 years ago. We've added a Greek variety, and we've recently expanded our ParfaitPro business to convenience stores and other foodservice channels. We've enhanced our K-12 yogurt offering by improving the health profile of our Trix yogurt products. And we've expanded our healthcare channel Greek yogurt assortment to include Yoplait Greek 100.","In addition to strong brands, we also bring strong sales capabilities to our customers. Our direct sales force provides pricing recommendations, unique consumer insights, category management expertise and supply chain capabilities. This sales team is a competitive advantage for General Mills and our customers seem to agree. Fiscal year-to-date, our Bakeries and Foodservice division has been recognized by customers and industry organizations with 18 awards, reflecting our ability to provide our customers with great brands and unique insights to drive category growth.","We expect to deliver continued profit margin expansion moving forward, and here's what gives us confidence: first, we continue to invest behind our most profitable products in the fastest-growing foodservice channels. Second, we are leveraging the same HMM principles as our U.S. Retail counterparts, identifying and removing waste and redeploying the captured savings to invest in our business. Third, we continue to review our product portfolio for additional opportunities to refine and focus our efforts. And finally, we've built market share in a very difficult economic period, so we are well-positioned for sales and profit growth as the economy recovers.","With that, let me wrap up my overview of General Mills' Bakeries and Foodservice business. Foodservice industry sales are expected to grow at a mid-single digit rate in the years ahead, outpacing recent performance in traditional U.S. Retail channels. Our strategy of focusing on the highest-margin products and the fastest-growing channels is working, and we remain on track to deliver our targets for 2013, including segment operating profit growth at a mid-single digit rate or better, and another year of solid double-digit operating profit margin. And we see excellent growth prospects in 2014 and beyond.","I'd like to close by thanking the more than 500 employees of General Mills' Bakeries and Foodservice division. Their talents and dedication make me optimistic and excited about the future prospects for our business.","Thank you for your time this morning. I'll now turn the call over to Ken Powell.","Kendall J. Powell","Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everybody. You just heard about the very good results that Dave and his team are posting on our Bakeries and Foodservice segment. So now I'm going to review performance in our other 2 business segments, beginning with U.S. Retail.","As Ian mentioned at CAGNY last month, the U.S. operating environment is getting better. Across our categories, pricing trends are moderating and volume trends are improving. For our categories in aggregate, Nielsen Unit Volume increased in each month of the third quarter. And year-to-date, both volume and pricing contributed to Retail sales growth.","As shown on Slide 31, year-to-date net sales for our U.S. Retail business increased 1%. Through a combination of net price realization and mix, strong HMM performance, cost savings from last year's restructuring and lower media expense, U.S. Retail operating profit grew faster than sales, up 7% year-to-date.","In the U.S. cereal category, after 5 consecutive years of market share gains, we've lost a bit of share so far in 2013. But as our levels of merchandising improved in the third quarter, our share trend has also improved, and we expect further improvement in the fourth quarter, with both established brands and new cereals contributing to our momentum.","For example, our new advertising campaign is reminding consumers about the simple goodness of our iconic original Cheerios. Baseline trends are improving in response to this message and we'll support this baseline momentum with strong promotions, including our Spoonfuls of Stories free book program next month.","Adults make up nearly half of total Lucky Charms cereal consumption, so we've expanded our marketing efforts to include new advertising that targets adults, and results have been terrific. Since the new campaign started in January, Lucky Charms baseline sales have increased 16%. And in celebration of St. Patrick's Day, we just launched our Chase for the Charms mobile application, giving consumers the chance to chase down their favorite marshmallow charm and win great prizes.","We've also launched a strong slate of new cereal products. Honey Nut Cheerios is the single largest brand in the U.S. cereal aisle. Our latest addition to the franchise is Honey Nut Cheerios Medley Crunch, it started shipping in January and advertising began 8 weeks ago. Early consumer response has been terrific. We're adding new varieties of other popular cereal brands, too.","Fiber One 80 Calorie Chocolate cereal offers consumers 35% of the adult daily value of fiber and a great chocolate taste at just 80 calories per serving. And new Peanut Butter Toast Crunch builds on the success of our Cinnamon Toast Crunch franchise.","In total, our January cereal launches represent over a full percentage point of category sales and will help build momentum in our cereal business in the fourth quarter and into fiscal 2014.","In yogurt, our biggest innovation is Yoplait Greek 100-calorie yogurt. This product is expanding the buy rate of current yogurt consumers and bringing new users into the category. Yoplait Greek 100 is on track to deliver $100 million in year 1 retail sales. And for our Greek yogurt business in total, sales are significantly outpacing growth of the segment. We picked up 3 points of segment market share year-to-date.","For Yoplait Original and Yoplait Light, what we call our core cup business, we've improved our existing product lineup, added new varieties and better aligned our merchandising price points with competitive levels. And our core cup products are still very responsive to advertising. Baseline sales per point of distribution are up since we launched new advertising last fall. With declines in distribution, our core cup sales are still down for the year, but we're seeing a nice improvement in core cup unit volume turns, the key step in restoring this business to growth.","In the kids segment, Yoplait is the clear category leader, with a nearly 50% share. In January, we added 2 great products to our kid yogurt lineup: Go-GURT Twisted gives kids 2 flavors and 2 colors in every tube, and with 10% of the daily calcium and vitamin D requirements, no high fructose corn syrup and just 70 calories per serving, moms like it, too.","New Yoplait Pro-Force is a great-tasting higher protein yogurt for tweens. We're supporting this item with a robust digital advertising campaign.","Our U.S. yogurt plans also include regional expansion of 2 great brands. Year-to-date, Libert\u00e9 sales have increased at a robust double-digit rate, and we still have significant distribution growth ahead of us. Our Mountain High brand currently leads the large size yogurt segment on the West Coast. We are now expanding distribution to the remaining 2\/3 of the country. In the third quarter, retail sales increased 7%. And we're excited to offer this great-tasting, all-natural yogurt product nationwide.","For our yogurt business in total, we're very encouraged by recent trends. We are leveraging 3 great brands, Yoplait, Mountain High and Libert\u00e9, to deliver product innovation and impactful marketing programs to all parts of the category. We expect to see continued momentum in yogurt, including another quarter of sequential volume improvement as we wrap up fiscal 2013.","It's still cold outside, so let's talk about some favorite cold-weather consumer brands. Year-to-date retail sales for Progresso soup are up 7%, including an 11% jump in baseline sales. Our media spending is up double digits. We've increased Progresso points of distribution and household penetration, and we're gaining share in the now growing ready-to-serve soup segment.","Our Pillsbury and Betty Crocker brands are the dominant players in the $3.9 billion Baking Products category. We've just wrapped up a great holiday season with growth in volume, sales, profit and market share in the latest quarter. We really like our competitive position in this category, and we see terrific growth prospects ahead.","In the Frozen Food aisle, new Green Giant Seasoned Steamers is a big hit with consumers. Just last month, this line was selected as a Frozen Foods Product of the Year in a survey of over 50,000 consumers. We're seeing good growth across our established Totino's Pizza Rolls line, and in January, we added new Totino's Pizzeria varieties to the lineup. We also launched Totino's Bold Rolls into the Club Channel, targeting millennial males with the Buffalo Chicken variety.","As shown on Slide 45, we've expanded our Fiber One snack bars franchise with the launch of Fiber One Protein Bars. These have at least 6 grams of protein per serving and 20% of the adult daily value for fiber at 140 calories or less per bar. We're adding new varieties to our Nature Valley and Cascadian Farm product lines, and we've launched Green Giant vegetable chips.","Our snacks portfolio also includes some great natural and organic items. Year-to-date sales for L\u00e4rabar, all-natural fruit and nut bars, are growing at a double-digit pace. And we've just launched L\u00e4rabar ALT bars in the natural channel, adding a vegan-based protein bar to the lineup. We're supporting the launch of ALT with product sampling and a strong social media campaign.","So for our U.S. Retail business in total, we are nicely on track to meet our targets for 2013, with low-single digit growth in net sales and faster growth in segment operating profit.","Turning to our International business, year-to-date performance is shown on Slide 47. Net sales are up 23% as reported. This reflects contributions from recent acquisitions and mid-single digit growth on our base business. Segment operating profit increased at a double-digit rate as well, and that's despite the impacts of the bolivar devaluation in Venezuela and nonrecurring expenses booked last quarter to transition the Yoplait business in Canada.","On a constant currency basis, International sales are up 27% through the first 9 months of the year. We are posting good growth across all of our geographic regions. In the Asia Pacific region, our business in China is leading 14% constant currency sales growth. Sales in Canada are up 21%, reflecting the addition of the Libert\u00e9 and Yoplait yogurt businesses. In Europe, sales grew 16%, with good performance on the Yoplait, Nature Valley and Old El Paso brands. And in Latin America, sales have more than doubled year-to-date, reflecting the addition of Yoki.","We are performing well in many of our established markets. In Europe, we're seeing strong early results from new products launched in the U.K., including Calin, our functional yogurt brand and Greek-style line extensions of our Perle de Lait and Weight Watchers brand. Earlier this month, we launched Libert\u00e9 Greek into the U.K. as well. For our Europe yogurt business in total, year-to-date retail sales are growing at a mid-single digit pace, and we're gaining market share.","In our other European categories, household penetration levels are well below other developed markets, so we see terrific opportunities for growth. For example, retail sales for our Nature Valley Granola Bars are growing at a double-digit rate, and in Mexican foods, Old El Paso retail sales are up 7%.","We are also performing well in emerging markets. In Greater China, new H\u00e4agen-Dazs caf\u00e9s, strong mooncake sales and increased retail visibility are driving a double-digit increase in net sales for this business year-to-date.","Our Wanchai Ferry product line is moving beyond frozen dumpling into frozen noodles, tongyuan and wonton in existing cities. We're also expanding our frozen dumplings product line into new cities. In total, year-to-date sales are growing at a double-digit rate.","In Brazil, Yoki is posting double-digit sales growth in some of its largest categories, including popcorn, seasonings and side dishes. We see exciting opportunities for future product innovation, sales growth and margin expansion in this key emerging market.","So we're pleased with our International performance. Our base business is growing, and our recent acquisitions are on pace to deliver expected year 1 results. We remain on track to meet our targets for the full year. These are high single-digit net sales growth and operating profit ahead of last year for our base business and contributions to both sales and operating profit from acquisitions.","Let me also say a quick word about our Cereal Partners Worldwide joint venture. Through the first 9 months, constant currency net sales were up 2%. We are leveraging our large core brands, like Chocapic and Cheerios, and we recently launched Chocolate Cheerios in the U.K. The cereal category is posting growth in markets around the world. While there is some category softness in southwestern Europe, sales in other established markets, like the U.K. and Mexico, are up. And the category is growing even faster in emerging markets, in Latin America and Asia. CPW holds a 23% value share of the cereal category outside of North America, and we continue to like the growth prospects we see for this venture.","So with that, let me summarize today's update on fiscal 2013. We have robust levels of news and product innovation in markets around the world. We've delivered solid year-to-date performance, with a mid-single digit increase in total company net sales and double-digit growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share. And for the full year, we've raised our EPS guidance to $2.66 to $2.68 for fiscal 2013. And as we outlined at CAGNY last month, we will return to our long-term earnings model in 2014, including high single-digit growth in EPS and increased cash returns to shareholders.","So thanks to all of you for your time this morning and for your interest in General Mills.","I'll now ask the operator to open the call to your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question, coming from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I guess, I was -- within U.S. Retail in the third quarter, I was a bit surprised that despite a lot of the big gain in last year's third quarter in price mix, that price mix actually accelerated sequentially from, I think, 0 in the second quarter to up 2 in the third. So I'm trying to get a sense of what drove that and if that was primarily just a mix of products shift? And I guess, more importantly, given some of your language around the fiscal fourth quarter and what to expect in more in-store merchandising and such and the very tough comp with respect to pricing last year, should we expect price mix in the fourth quarter to be lower and then, I guess, heading into fiscal '14? And the reason I ask is because obviously, one of the concerns out there for the group is, given more modest input cost inflation and what have you, does it drive the industry to sort of get a bit more promotional, like we saw back in sort of '09 and 2010, which didn't end up that well?","Kendall J. Powell","Andrew, let me, maybe let me address the last point that you made first, and then, I'll turn it to Don. I mean, I think the short answer on Q3 is, that was driven by mix, but we can elaborate a bit and give you some commentary on what we expect in quarter 4. I think what I would say on -- just on pricing and promotion is, as you know, we've had -- we've sort of been carefully and selectively, but consistently, adjusting price points and merchandising frequency over the course of the year. As we look at our price points across our categories now, we think we are about where we need to be. And as we have gotten to those price points and mix of merchandising that we want, we've seen our baseline sales improve consistently, really over the course of the entire year. So we feel that we're about in the right place, with the exception of some aspects of the cereal category, overall, we think that -- which we've commented on -- overall, we feel that the merchandising environment is reasonably stable now. So we don't really expect any changes in the fourth quarter.","Donal Leo Mulligan","Yes, and Andrew, what I'd add to that is just to emphasize that it really was more mix favorability in the third quarter. We do expect that to moderate in the fourth quarter, because we do, as said before, our merchandising phasing is more backloaded this year. We're not going deeper, but just more frequency, and so we'll see that come through in probably lower price mix in the fourth quarter than what you saw in the third quarter.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. And is that -- is the gross margin that's implied in your fourth quarter, based on your full year guidance, is certainly below what we have been modeling and we've obviously been modeling a lower gross margin year-over-year anyway. So I assume that's partly driven by the price mix piece that you just mentioned.","Donal Leo Mulligan","Yes, it is.","Kendall J. Powell","And inflation...","Kristen Smith Wenker","Yes, I mean, just for a little bit of detail there, if you looked at merch a year ago in Q4, it would've been down 6%. So part of this is just the comp.","Operator","Our next question, coming from the line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. I guess, the first one is, let's say, a more simple question, but with the devaluation hit, the Venezuela, Don, the margins in International dropped quite a bit. Should -- are you taking pricing up relative to the deval there and so we should see margins recover in International as like, F 2013 comes to a close and F 2014 starts? Or is this lower level kind of what we should think of as the right one?","Donal Leo Mulligan","Well, the deval is obviously a onetime hit, for the most part, the restatement of the balance sheet. And Venezuela is a fairly small piece of our International business, so what you see in our margins in International is largely a mix, which will even out as we lap the acquisitions next year, so you'll start to see margin expansion, our normally planned margin expansion following that, so I wouldn't overread too much into the Venezuela piece.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then Ken, at CAGNY, I guess you and the board kind of made the decision, with what's been very good free cash flow over the years, to kind of take a pause on the M&A international side and return cash to shareholders. Can you kind of talk a little bit more about, kind of, why you're doing that? Is it that the organization is, let's say, maxed out on terms of its ability to take another deal on, or are the prices too high? Or that the stock is, in your view, too cheap, and that's why you want to return the cash via share repo? And then, obviously, you put the dividend up, too.","Kendall J. Powell","Yes. So Eric, I think what I said at CAGNY was that we have had an unusually high level of M&A activity over the last 18 months. And frankly, while we would like to expand our footprint internationally, and we've talked about that repeatedly, these opportunities came before us at a pace that we didn't really expect and were very high-quality as well. And so we were -- we took advantage of those opportunities and we were very, very active. As we look forward over the next period of time, we don't see anything of that size or scale, really, on our radar screen right now, and so that's one factor. And -- but I would say, generally, we don't expect our pace of M&A activity to be anywhere near what it -- as we, on a running rate basis, anywhere near what we saw during the past 18 months, which was just a very high level of activity. So I'd say that, that's the -- sort of, that's the guiding principle. And for next year, we expect M&A to be relatively low and we will be very much on model. That doesn't preclude going out over the longer term, that we might find an opportunity in other key emerging markets. There are a few that we've talked about, India for example. But we think those would be very manageable, and again, we don't have anything on our radar screen now.","Operator","Our next question, coming from the line of Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I just wanted to ask about the cereal category, generally. Your volumes overall have definitely appeared to have remained fairly soft, leaving aside all the cyclicality in market share. Can you just talk a bit more about competition within the day part? I know this is a commonly discussed issue, but any new observations you can add on why volumes haven't recovered more, even with a fair amount of promotional intensity from multiple players in the category?","Kendall J. Powell","Yes. I think it is -- obviously, breakfast is a very competitive occasion. Breakfast cereal is, by a wide margin, the most dominant component consumed at breakfast. We are in well over 1\/3 of all breakfasts and the #2 falls far below that, so we're the lion's share. But there is competition, clearly, for the breakfast occasion. Snack bars, which are adjacent to the category and where we've been very, very successful, is one of those competitors. And so we see a little bit coming from there. Hot breakfast, just eggs and bacon, and that sort of thing, we're seeing a little bit of resurgence there. So that, I think, is a competitive element. But mostly, Matthew, I think it's such a versatile category and it's so responsive to innovation. I think, clearly, the opportunity is for us to strengthen our innovation, strengthen the marketing. I think there are going to be other nutrition-oriented opportunities that we can innovate around. And I think as we do that, typically, what we see is a return to category growth, low single-digit growth, but we've seen that low single-digit growth in response to innovation that we lead over very long periods of time. So there's competition out there, there always will be, whether it's bacon and eggs or snack bars. But the category is so big, and there's so many opportunities for innovation that we feel very confident that we can bring innovation that will get us back on that low single-digit growth path.","Donal Leo Mulligan","Yes, I'd just add that, again, if you look over the longer term, this is a category that has grown low single digits, not each and every year, but certainly over time. Wide participation in the category in terms of penetration and high-frequency, and as Ken mentioned, by far, the highest frequency in terms of in-home breakfasts. So we believe it still has a lot of growth in front of us and to Ken's point, it really is about innovation and ensuring that we and other market leaders are supporting the brands the right way, and I think we're starting to see that in the category again.","Operator","Our next question, coming from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess, 2 questions for Dave, relative to Bakeries and Foodservice. One, I guess, is just in terms of the efforts you've made, the investments you've made in terms of having a direct sales force, how much of an advantage is that? Or maybe, how does that stack up relative to your competitors? Or is that sort of -- was that a function of catching up to what some of your other competitors are doing? Or do you feel as though you've actually got a more muscular sort of effort in terms of selling into accounts?","David E. Dudick","Well, I would say, first of all, we obviously started at -- a couple of years ago, we had a brokered sales force. So we've had experience with that. We still have brokers working in certain pieces of our business. The dominant piece of our sales force is our own sales force, and we do feel as though it's a competitive advantage for us. We have a chance to look at the ROI in both and because -- if you think about our channels, there's some specialized sales that go on within our channels, whether it's healthcare, where you're talking to dietitians, if it's K-12 with all the nutrition guidelines. And we really feel like they're able to carry our message and give a better oral argument and take our capabilities to our customers and our operators in a better fashion. So we actually do feel as though this is a competitive advantage for us.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And then, in the slide, I guess it's Slide 19, where you show the gross profit, 73% comes from the 6 key platforms. In the 27% that's Other, is the milling business in that Other piece?","David E. Dudick","Yes, it is.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So -- ConAgra has recently, kind of, taken the move to peel out its milling business and move it into a joint venture and I guess as we've kind of gone through the math in looking at that, it was definitely a much lower-margin business, relative to the rest of its Foodservice business. And I guess the implication here is that, that seems like it's the same here. So had you -- was that something that you had considered? Were you surprised by that move? Were there any -- would there be anything that would inhibit General Mills from being able to do something similar?","David E. Dudick","Well, you're right in that we, the Bakeries and Foodservice division, obviously, are heavy users of our mills. We've got a very lean and efficient operation right now. And in terms of the Ardent Mills, I think you're speaking of the Ardent Mills joint venture, and we're not -- I really don't want to speculate on the particulars of that today, but obviously, we're always looking for moves that would improve our shareholder value. So we are open to several things and we're discussing those on an ongoing basis. I think Don may have a couple of comments, too.","Donal Leo Mulligan","Yes, what I would just add to that is our mills are very highly utilized, so we get great asset leverage on them. To Dave's point, they're low-cost, they're also, in some aspects, integrated with our branded business, Bisquick, for example. And we do, like many parts of our portfolio, we look at them from time to time to see if there's a different way to structure them to extract more shareholder value and quite honestly, we've never seen the play. And so we like the participation we have with the mills and they're not a big part of our business, of course, but they are an integral part to some of Dave's businesses and some of our U.S. Retail businesses.","Kendall J. Powell","So Matthew, just one more comment going back on the -- on your question, your good question on sales. I would just add that across General Mills, we do use both. We use -- we have our own sales forces and sales leadership in both the Retail side of our business and in Foodservice. But we also use brokers, especially for the in-store piece, where that execution can be very efficiently done by brokers. But I guess I would tell you, our very strong view is that the sales capability is, it's a core strategic capability for us. We really want to make sure we're on the same side of the table as our customer and that we're helping them grow their business. And that means that we've developed a number of capabilities around category management, around supply chain, around in-store marketing, that we believe we can do most effectively and in advantaged ways on our own. And we think that's been a real top line driver for us historically, and that's why we run it the way we do.","Donal Leo Mulligan","And just to run that point to the ground, because we do have both in-house and broker sales force on both brands in our Bakeries and Foodservice and our U.S. Retail, we have a good line of sight on what the cost structure is of each, and we know that our direct is very competitive and to Ken's point, more effective in what we're trying to do to drive growth.","Operator","Our next question, coming from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","In recent weeks, we've heard both Kroger and Safeway talk about, I guess, featuring more better-for-you items and really, in Safeway's case, really making some dramatic changes to their layout. Safeway even talked about wanting to become a wellness store that just happens to sell food. So I'm curious if you're comfortable with your level of participation in this growing part of the store? Or if you feel you maybe need to accelerate your growth in healthier eating by really ramping up the pace of acquisitions for Small Planet? And I know you've said you wanted to do deals in that division, and you've done them in the past, I guess I'm just asking about the pace of those deals, what you're seeing in the market and whether you want to pick M&A up, given what some of your customers may be looking for?","Kendall J. Powell","So Ken, I think I would start by saying, we believe strongly that our broad portfolio is naturally advantaged when it comes to health benefits, and we've continued to improve our portfolio, really, over long stretches of time. Cereal, I think, is -- we know that consumers have a high regard for the nutrition profile of cereal. And as General Mills has added whole grain to our cereals over the years, so that we are now one of the leading sources of whole grain in the country, and done things like reduce sugar, that's only increased the perception of that. Our snack bar franchise, I think, is strongly health-oriented, that's really one of the key appeals of that product line. And then, as you go down the list, our soup business, our Progresso soup business, our Green Giant business, the entire yogurt category. So -- and we have metrics in place and incentives and management focus across the company to make sure that we continue to improve these products continuously. So just as an example, recently, we took the high fructose corn syrup out of Yoplait Original in response to what we were hearing from consumers and actually advertised that to a very great benefit. So as you think about consumer attitudes and changing consumer attitudes, think about the portfolio of General Mills, we think it is highly advantaged. And that's before you get to the organic and the natural products in our Small Planet division, which as you pointed out, we've been adding to with acquisitions. And I think that is an area that's of interest to us, and we will continue to look for opportunities there, because that is a growing area and it's, for a variety of reasons, the natural piece, the values embodied in organic that appeal to many consumers. So that will be an area of interest for us as well. But I think the core point is we have a very strong portfolio when it comes to health and nutrition.","Operator","Our next question, coming from the line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo.","John J. Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Don, just in terms of Europe and maybe even in terms of contributions from joint ventures, what are your thoughts there for growth into fiscal '14? I think it seemed maybe, up to this point, you're bracing for a bit of a slowdown on account of the economy, are you seeing anything different there in terms of being better able to weather the economy, is performance better than you thought, is there still some downside there? Just kind of curious about the European environment.","Donal Leo Mulligan","Well John, thanks for the question. We don't have specific guidance yet for F '14. We'll provide that in June. But our business in Europe continues to grow, which is different than many of our competitors. Ken outlined some of the key reasons, not only do we have great brands and great capabilities on the continent, but we also are less penetrated in most of our categories outside of Yoplait, obviously. And we're seeing that as a great growth opportunity. So we -- we are not immune to the economic realities of Europe. We're seeing it, certainly, in southwestern Europe in our cereal joint venture. But overall, we're seeing growth in Europe, and it's been -- year-to-date, it's still low-single digits to mid-single digits, and we like the shape of our business in Europe.","Kendall J. Powell","The only thing I'd add to that, John, is that Don's comments on cereal, where we are much more exposed to southern Europe, that European cereal category was running at less than 1% through the first half of their year. But the recent performances has been better, it's been closer to 2%. So anyway, one swallow doesn't make a spring, but we're seeing a little bit better performance in one of our most important categories in Europe. But overall, I think obviously, we are all very aware of the economic difficulties there.","John J. Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And Ken, just as a follow-up, in terms of the Yoplait business internationally, I mean, do you see opportunities there to take on more licensee businesses? Or is that kind of done for the time being?","Kendall J. Powell","I'm sorry, John, what were you -- to take on...","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","More licensee businesses, as you fold [ph] more...","Kendall J. Powell","So that, we've talked about that in the past, and that, I think, could be -- there could be further opportunities for us going forward, and we'll continue to explore, but absolutely nothing to announce on that today. But clearly, that's out there as an ongoing opportunity.","Operator","Our next question, coming from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I just had a couple of questions for you. I wanted to go back to an earlier question about -- and just to better understand what's going on in the fourth quarter with promotional spending. Is there -- you talked about an increase in frequency, not so much in depth, and I was just curious if that -- is the Q4 promotional spending meant to be a change from Q3, is there a pickup? I realize it's a comparable factor year-over-year. Is there an increase in Q4 at all as you get some of the new products on the shelf?","Kendall J. Powell","Chris, it's primarily the fact that we were lighter a year ago, so there is a comp there. I think there may be a bit more just around new products, but those would be very -- that would be a very specific kind of activity. But in general, as I said earlier in this call, having carefully moved our merchandising programs over the course of this year, we feel pretty good about where we're at right now.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, my other question for you was on International. And you've had a -- you had a couple of unique factors last quarter with Canada and this quarter with the Venezuelan bolivar, so you've had good underlying profit growth. Year-to-date, by my calculation, you've been about in line with your revenue growth, actually a little faster than revenue growth in terms of your profit increase. But in the last couple of quarters, it's been a little below the revenue growth. My question just is that -- just to understand the investments or sort of what's going on behind the scenes, that's -- where you're investing that's keeping profits from keeping pace of sales the last quarter or 2?","Donal Leo Mulligan","Your math is correct. Year-to-date, if you take out the bolivar and the Yoplait Canada transition costs, I'll call them, the earnings -- underlying earnings are growing faster than sales. And obviously, sales are growing pretty robustly at 23%. In International business, there's a lot of different markets, there's a lot of different dynamics. Quarter-to-quarter, you're going to see some of those movements. We tend to look over the full year multi-quarters and the trend that we're seeing in International is we're bullish on the growth. And as I mentioned earlier, on the margin expansion opportunities, too, which are masked a little bit this year, gross margin opportunities, as we bring in new businesses, which not surprisingly, have lower gross margins but faster absolute dollar growth opportunities for us. So you'll -- I think you'll see a cleaner picture and a clearer picture of that as we get into F '14.","Operator","Our next question, coming from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Actually, a question for Don, I think one of the reasons that investors are kind of concerned about a more aggressive promotional environment going forward is the perception that commodities are kind of deflationary. But I think what you're kind of pointing to is that your inflation is kind of rolling through, probably, at a higher level as we head into fiscal '14, specifically because it was higher in the fourth quarter. So higher inflation tends to be the thing that keeps the environment rational. So is there anything you can kind of, directionally, you can point us to for inflation in '14?","Donal Leo Mulligan","I'm not going to give guidance, but I do want to just make sure it's clear on one thing, because you do hit an important point. When you look at our fourth quarter, we gave guidance for the full year of gross margin being down 60 to 80 basis points. Obviously, you do the math, you can see it's going to be down by more than that in the fourth quarter. We've talked about the timing of merchandising and the lower merchandise levels a year ago that we're rolling over. But inflation is the other factor. We took some coverage to complete our full year coverage for commodities, especially grain commodities, in the fall. That was obviously impacted by the drought. That coverage only extends to the end of F '13. So that coverage, that higher cost coverage, if you will, does not extend into F '14. But to your point, again, without giving guidance for F '14, we expect more moderate inflation. We -- as we do our planning, we always plan for something in the low-single digit to mid-single digit inflation. We don't see it going to deflation, certainly as of today. We are aware of the concern that you articulated from investors in terms of where pricing can go even if we see deflation as an industry, and we don't foresee that as we sit here today.","Kristen Smith Wenker","[Operator Instructions]","Operator","Our last question, coming from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So U.S. Retail sales, organic sales, were better than we expected. This has been a pretty consistent pattern of you guys exceeding what's measured in Nielsen by a fairly meaningful magnitude. Can you help us as understand where the drivers of the excess growth are coming from?","Kendall J. Powell","Well, I would say on U.S. Retail, I guess my starting point would be, as we have worked price and merch over the last year, as we've done that, Jason, we've seen baselines in U.S. Retail across all channels improve very nicely and sequentially. I think we were down -- the baselines were down 5% or 6% in Q1, down 3% in Q2 and flat in the most recent quarter. So as we get our pricing in the zone, which has been our goal, the response that we are seeing is actually an improvement overall in the business and improvement in unpromoted sales. And so -- so that, I think, the response there has been very encouraging and has been a key driver in our performance.","Donal Leo Mulligan","I guess, Jason, the only thing I would add is, as you saw in this quarter, it's really that sales growth was a price mix, particularly, mix plus for us. So we don't see a -- part of the underlying question may be, are we seeing any pipeline build? We're not seeing that, it is really just a matter of the mix of the business coming through with a stronger top line.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, I was also just curious about sort of the unmeasured channels, there's still a big swath out there that's not going into Nielsen. With Small Planet foods, you guys have good momentum, I'm wondering if some of that's coming in maybe the specialty or natural channel or out of Club, are you seeing outsized growth in any of those channels?","Kendall J. Powell","Good growth in Club and as you said, good growth in natural. So yes, those are, obviously, important channels for us and we are doing well there. Very good growth, as Dave commented, in convenience stores, which is an increasingly important channel for us. So we're -- and that -- so we're very, we have very good sales focus on all of that channels -- on all of those channels, which goes back to the early discussion we had on the sales force, and we're seeing solid growth in those places.","Kristen Smith Wenker","Thanks, everybody. For those that are still in queue, sorry we didn't get all the way through. Give me a shout, I'll try and get your questions answered.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Have a great day."],"9985":["General Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS) Q2 2016 Earnings Conference Call December 17, 2015  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Jeff Siemon - Director, IR","Donal Mulligan - EVP and CFO","Chris O\u2019Leary - EVP, COO, International","Kendall Powell - Chairman and CEO","Analysts","Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley","Kenneth Goldman - JPMorgan","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by. Welcome to the General Mills\u2019 Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call.","During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder this conference is being recorded Thursday, December 17, 2015. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jeff Siemon, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Jeff Siemon ","Thanks, Melanie and good morning, everybody. I\u2019m here with Ken Powell, our CEO; Don Mulligan, our CFO; and Chris O\u2019Leary, Chief Operating Officer for International Segment. I\u2019ll turn the call over to them in just a minute, but first let me cover our usual housekeeping items.","A press release on second quarter results was issued over the wire services earlier this morning and is also posted on our website. You can find our slides on the website that supplement this morning\u2019s presentation. Our remarks will include forward-looking statements that are based on management\u2019s current views and assumptions. The second slide in today\u2019s presentation lists factors that could cause our future results to be different than our current estimates.","And with that I\u2019ll turn it over to my colleagues, beginning with Don.","Donal Mulligan","Thanks, Jeff. Good morning and happy holidays to everyone. Thank you for joining us today. As noted in our press release, General Mills\u2019 first half financial results were in line with our expectations. After a strong first quarter, constant currency net sales declined low single digits in the second quarter due in part to the divestiture of our North American Green Giant business. We delivered another quarter of margin expansion helping drive a mid-single digit increase in constant currency adjusted diluted earnings per share.","We\u2019re increasing our cost savings targets to $500 million by fiscal 2018, driven by incremental savings from Project Century and we\u2019re updating our full year fiscal 2016 growth targets to include the impact of the Green Giant sale. Excluding the Green Giant impact, we remain on track to deliver our original fiscal 2016 growth goals.","Slide five summarizes our results for the second quarter. Net sales totaled $4.4 billion down 6% as reported and down 2% in constant currency. Total segment operating profit totaled $839 million, 2% above the prior year on a constant currency basis. Net earnings increased 53% to $530 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.87 as reported. These results include a one-time gain of $199 million related to the Green Giant divestiture, $99 million of restructuring and project related expenses as well as mark-to-market valuation effects. ","Excluding these items affecting comparability, adjusted diluted EPS was $0.82, up 2% from last year\u2019s second quarter. Constant currency adjusted diluted EPS increased 5% compared to a year ago.","Slide six shows the components of total company net sales growth. Pound volume reduced sales by 3 percentage points. Positive sales mix and net price realization increased sales by 1 point, while foreign exchange reduced sales by 4 points. The Annie\u2019s acquisition and the Green Giant divestiture combined to reduce pound volume by 2 points and net sales growth by 1 point for the second quarter.","Turning to our segment results, slide seven summarizes U.S. retail performance. After posting 4% net sales growth in the first quarter U.S. retail net sales decreased 4% in the second quarter, driven by lower merchandise volume and the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Second quarter net sales were down 1% in the snacks and baking products operating units and declined at a mid-single digit rate in the remaining units. Year-to-date sales were flat to last year with growth in cereal and snacks.","In our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment net sales declined 4% in the second quarter. Our six priority platforms posted combined net sales growth of 3% for the quarter with the strongest growth in frozen meals and yogurt. Net sales declined in the remainder of the business driven by the exit of some low margin businesses in the fourth quarter of last year as well as market indexed pricing on bakery flour.","Slide nine summarizes our second quarter International segment net sales results on a constant currency basis. Net sales grew 3% overall led by Latin America where sales grew 17% driven by Mexico and Argentina, Brazil posted low single digit sales growth in the quarter. Canada sales were up 3%, net sales in the Asia-Pacific region increased 2% including double digit growth in India. And in Europe sales were down 2% with good growth in H\u00e4agen-Dazs offset by decline in Old El Paso as we lap the highly successful launch of Stand 'N Stuff Taco shells last year. For the first six months constant currency net sales in Europe are up 2%.","Slide 10 shows the second quarter adjusted gross margin excluding certain items increased 60 basis points. This was primarily due to our productivity efforts offsetting low input cost inflation. This marks the third consecutive quarter we\u2019ve delivered adjusted gross margin expansion. And we continue to estimate 2% input cost inflation for the full year.","Turning to slide 11, total segment operating profit increased 2% in constant currency. U.S. Retail profit declined 3% in second quarter due to lower sales including the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. This was partially offset by benefit from our cost savings initiatives and lower media expense. Through six months U.S. Retail segment operating profit is up 15% versus prior year. Constant currency International profit increased 19% in the second quarter, primarily driven by favorable price realization and lower input cost. And Convenience Stores and Foodservice profit was up 7% thanks to our cost saving efforts.","After tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $23 million in the second quarter down 6% in constant currency, due to lower volume for H\u00e4agen-Dazs Japan. Second quarter constant currency net sales increased 1% for CPW and declined 10% for H\u00e4agen-Dazs Japan driven by reduced new product activity. For the first half constant currency after tax JV earnings increased 5% and that\u2019s on top of a 9% constant currency growth in the first half of F\u201815.","Turning to slide 13, corporate unallocated expenses excluding restructuring and project related charges and mark-to-market valuation effects decreased by $6 million in the quarter. We recorded a one-time gain of $199 million related to the Green Giant divestiture. We incurred $99 million in restructuring and project related charges in the quarter.","Net interest expense decreased 5% from the prior year, due to lower average interest rate and lower debt levels. We continue to expect interest expense to be down mid-single digits for the full year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 37.4% as reported nearly 6 points above last year due to tax impacts of the Green Giant divestiture. Excluding this and other items effecting comparability, the tax rate was 32.3% this year compared to 33.5% a year ago. We continue to expect our full year tax rate to be comparable to last year. And average diluted shares outstanding declined 1% in the quarter in line with our full year expectations.","Now I\u2019ll turn to our first half financial performance. We posted constant currency growth across all of our key metrics. Net sales were up 1%, segment operating profit increased 12% and adjusted diluted EPS grew 18% compared to a year ago. ","Slide 15 shows that our core working capital declined 38% versus last year\u2019s second quarter. This was driven primarily by the elimination of Green Giant inventory and continued working capital efficiency gains. We\u2019ve now reduced core working capital year-over-year for 11 consecutive quarters. ","On slide 16, you can see that cash flow from operations totaled nearly $1.2 billion for the first half, 34% above last year primarily due to lower working capital and higher net earnings. Capital expenditures totaled $294 million through six months. Through the first half we returned more than $1 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.","Slide 17 provides an update of our cost savings initiatives. We\u2019re on track to deliver $400 million in cost of goods HMM savings in fiscal 2016 and we continue to make good progress on our incremental cost savings initiatives. Taken together these initiatives remain on track to deliver between $285 million and $310 million in annual savings this fiscal year.","In the first half of fiscal 2016 we announced plans to close four additional factories as part of Project Century, our initiative to streamline our supply chain network. As a result, we are increasing our fiscal 2017 savings target from $400 million to $450 million and we\u2019re establishing a $500 million savings target for fiscal 2018.","Slide 18 summarizes the impact of the Green Giant divestiture and constant currency net sales and earnings for fiscal 2016 and 2017. For fiscal 2016, we expect the Green Giant sale will reduce net sales and segment operating profit by approximately 2 points each and we expect a $0.07 negative impact to adjusted diluted EPS. We expect an additional 1 point reduction in net sales in segment operating profit in fiscal 2017 as well as a $0.03 reduction in 2017 adjusted diluted EPS.","Slide 19 provides a summary of our 2016 constant currency sales and earnings guidance, which includes the impact of the Green Giant divestiture. And to be clear the Green Giant divestiture is the only material change of this guidance. Our original guidance call for flat net sales, low-single digit growth in segment operating profit and mid-single digit growth in adjusted diluted EPS.","Adjusted for the impact of Green Giant, we now expect net sales to be down low-single digits, total segment operating profit to be flat last year and adjusted diluted earnings per share to grow at a low-single digit rate. Current exchange rates remain a $0.09 headwind to full year adjusted diluted EPS growth in 2016.","And with that I will turn the microphone over to Chris O\u2019Leary. Chris?","Chris O\u2019Leary","Thanks, Shawn and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to give you an update on the performance of our International segments so far this year. Our International businesses generate more than $5 billion in net sales and have been growing at a 14% compound rate over the past five years. While acquisitions have contributed to our results during this time period, our base business grew at a mid-single digit rate thanks to consumer first product innovation and renovation.","Our segment operating profit grew at a 20% compound rate over that same five year period and our operating profit margin increased by 250 basis points. Keep in mind; these figures include the impact of foreign exchange, which generally have been a headwind for us during this time period. There is a lot to like in our International business, just over 60% of our sales are in developed markets and we have posted strong growth here in recent quarters. In emerging markets we are feeling the impact of slowing economy in Brazil and China, but sales in our Latin America and Asia Pacific regions are still growing nicely in constant currency. ","Through the first half of fiscal 2016 International net sales declined 12% and operating profit declined 10%, reflecting significant foreign exchange headwinds. On a constant currency basis net sales increased 4% and segment operating profit grew 80%. Let me give you a little more detail on what is driving our growth across our four regions.","In Canada solid execution on the fundamentals is the primary driver of 4% constant currency net sales growth in the first half. In cereal we launched Shop at Lucky Charms this year as a new flavor choice for a brand with strongest style appeal with millennials. Cinnamon Chex is a gluten free option with no artificial colors or flavors. We recently introduced Nature Valley Muesli and Cheerios Plus, which features protein sliced almonds and granola clusters. This focus on consumer first innovation has helped our cereal business gain nearly half a point of market share so far this year.","Retail sales for our snacks are growing at a double digit pace and we\u2019ve gained more than 3 points of share on the strength of new grain snack product launches, like Nature Valley Nut and Seed bars and Fiber One crumble bars. First half retail sales for Yogurt business matched a year ago levels we are driving growth on our Libert\u00e9 line and recently introduced a Greek Yogurt Seeds variety similar to the Plenti product here in the U.S. and our Kid Yogurt business is growing on the strength of the yap beverages featuring The Minions.","Retail sales for Yoplait source declined in the first half as consumers shifted away from weight management options. We are working with retailers to implement the most effective shelf sets given changing consumer dynamics and we expect to drive improved Yogurt retail sales performance in the back half of the year. Innovation is driving our results in Europe with constant currency net sales up 2% so far this year. H\u00e4agen-Dazs is leading that growth. ","First half retail sales increased 16% on the strength of super-premium stick bars launched in France this summer. These high quality bars have had great visibility in stores as retailers leverage the well-known H\u00e4agen-Dazs brand. We\u2019ll continue supporting the line with advertising and promotions and we\u2019ll add two new flavors in the second half.","For Old El Paso Mexican Foods first half retail sales matched results in the same period last year, when sales grew 15% with the highly successful launch of Stand 'N Stuff Tortillas. We\u2019ve had more Stand 'N Stuff varieties coming in the second half, including whole wheat tortillas and crispy chicken dinner kits. Old El Paso restaurant take dinner kits, which first launched in Canada are our most recent introduction in Europe. These high quality kits give consumers an easy way to make a restaurant quality Mexican meal at home. ","We\u2019ve been supporting the line with advertising and strong levels of in-store promotions to drive trial and we\u2019ll be launching three flavors of restaurant-style [ph] sauces later this year. So we like our performance so far this year in developed markets and we have more innovation and product news coming in the back half.","In emerging markets we continue to experience headwinds in Brazil and China, but we are seeing strong growth in markets like Mexico, Central America, India and the Middle East. In Latin America constant currency net sales grew 9% through the first half.","In Brazil consumers are pressured and competition is high so we\u2019re leveraging our strong national sales organization to drive in-store visibility. Net sales in Brazil return to growth in the second quarter behind good product news. New Yoki ready-to-eat Popcorn is performing well and we are growing our Kitano Seasonings business with good advertising, updated packaging and marketing support in stores.","Outside of Brazil we are seeing good growth in the rest of Latin America. Constant currency net sales in Mexico are up double digits through the first half of the year led by excellent performance by Nature Valley bars and newly launched Fiber One grain snacks.","In the Asia Pacific region constant currency net sales were up 2% through the first half, slower than our usual rate of growth due to a more challenging consumer environment in China. Net sales for our Wanchai Ferry dumplings business declined in the first half as some consumers traded down to more value priced options. But where we\u2019ve provided a strong consumer benefit we\u2019ve seen good results. For example our new Wanchai plus dumplings are on trend with Chinese consumers\u2019 desires for better for you options.","This line contains more vegetables and lean meat and it offers first to market innovation with colored dough wrappers infused with natural vegetable juices. And our [indiscernible] product continue to perform well. We are bringing new varieties including rainbow colored wrappers to this line of Dim Sum in the second half of the year in time for Chinese New Year. Net sales for H\u00e4agen-Dazs ice-cream in China were up 2% through the first half led by strong sales execution at retail.","We also introduced frozen yogurt in our shops. We position this yogurt as an everyday light indulgent and have had positive response from consumers looking for healthier sweet treats. We are bringing more news to our shops in the second half with the great ice-on fire promotion running now and rose themed ice cream creations planned Valentine's Day.","Yoplait yogurt in China is building off of a good start this summer and our market share in Shanghai exceeded 8% last month. We\u2019re seeing particularly good performance on our premium Perle de lait as Chinese consumers appreciate its high quality, unique packaging and thick texture not typically seen in yogurts in China. Last month we added a new coconut flavor to the line.","We have a number of marketing activities planned for the second half of the year continue to drive trial, including advertising, more sampling and channel specific promotions. We will continue so we continue to like the growth prospects we see for Yoplait in China. In total, first half net sales for our business in China were down 1% in constant currency. While we have a variety of consumer focus news planned and expect some improvement for the second half we expect continues to conditions to remain challenging in the near-term.","Outside of China, the remainder of our Asia Pacific region has posted strong double digit growth so far this year. We\u2019re driving these results in Asia the Middle-East and Africa on the popularly of sweet snacking options, which is a $30 billion category in this market. First half sales for H\u00e4agen-Dazs ice cream grew 9% in constant currency, driven by new on trend fruit flavored varieties launched this summer.","We have been seeing increased distribution for our line of Betty Crocker cookie cakes, our first ready to eat sweet snack in the Middle-East. And we\u2019ve generated strong double digit net sales growth so far this year in India. Thanks to distribution gains on Pillsbury cake mixes and new chocolate spreads in value price sachet packages. We expect double digit sales growth to continue in the second half in the EMEA region as we see great opportunities for our sweet snacks in this fast growing market.","So we are pleased with our overall performance in our international regions. We have driven excellent regions. We have delivered excellent results in developed markets, we are focused on delivering improvement in Brazil and China and we expect continued strong growth in the rest of our emerging markets in the second half.","We are also committed to expanding our International segment\u2019s to profit margin. Let me give you a quick update on our recent restructuring efforts. Project Compass is our initiative to restructure our international businesses through increased organizational effectiveness and reduced administrative expense. We are in the process of folding Yoplait international operations into our European regions to increase efficiency and optimize our resources.","In total Project Compass remains on track to deliver $45 million to $50 million in cost savings. We also recently expanded the scope of Project Century beyond North America. We have announced closure of our pasta plant in New Zealand and the proposed closure of facility in the UK subject to work council\u2019s approval. Savings from these plant closures and Project Compass are included in the company-wide $500 million cost saving goals that Don referenced earlier. These initiatives are incremental to our ongoing HMM efforts and put us on track to exceed our goal of 150 basis point of operating margin expansion by 2020. I will share more details at the Cagny Conference in February.","So let me summarize my comments this morning. Consumer first renovation and innovation efforts are driving growth across all our geographic regions through the first half of the year with particularly good performance in developed markets. Brazil and China are challenging but stable and we\u2019re posting strong growth in the rest of our emerging markets. And we will drive margin expansion through continued HMM productivity efforts and the restructuring initiatives I have just described.","Thank you for your time this morning, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ken. ","Kendall Powell","Okay well good morning, everybody and thank you, Chris for that review of our International business. So I\u2019m going to spend a few minutes now providing an update on our other two segments starting with U.S. Retail. Our U.S. Retail net sales and segment operating profit performance are in line with our expectations through the first half of fiscal 2016.","Net sales totaled $5.3 billion matching prior year levels. Year-to-date segment operating profit is up a robust 15% driven by lower promotional and SG&A expenses. Retails sales for our aggregate categories in the U.S. are up 1% in the first half of fiscal 2016 after being flat in 2015. This improvement has been driven by better unit volume performance and we continue to see positive net price realization across our categories. ","The largest driver of improved performance has been in cereal, where category declines of 3% in fiscal 2015 have moderated to less than 1% thus far this year. We like the improvement we\u2019re seeing in our categories in the U.S., but our retails sales performance did not keep pace in the first half. We\u2019re encouraged by the early returns we\u2019re seeing on our snacks and cereal renovation news, but those gains were more than offset by lower merchandising levels in the first half.","Part of that was driven by our continued effort to reduce inefficient trade spending and we\u2019re making progress. Our lifts were up in the first half and outpaced our categories. The other factor driving lower merchandising was a broad based reduction in display across our customer base a situation which was particularly acute at a large customer.","In Yoghurt, the decline in dairy prices this year has coincided with increased competitive activity. This led to reduce merchandising and lower market share for Yoplait in the first half, we\u2019re working to increase our competitiveness, while maintaining profitability in the category in the second half.","Turning to our other large businesses we\u2019ve seen improved retail sales results for our meals and baking businesses thus far this year, thanks to solid execution. Let me now share with you some of our first half highlights and examples of how we\u2019ll strengthen our retail sales performance in the second half. Our top priority in U.S. Retail this year is to drive growth in cereal and our net sales are up 1% year-to-date. The launch of gluten-free Cheerios is an important component of our cereal growth plan and we\u2019re encouraged by the results thus far.","After baseline declines in recent quarters, gluten-free Cheerios varieties posted baseline sales growth in the grocery channels once we turned on advertising support in September. We saw minor slowdown the week of the recall and since then baselines have returned to growth.","To keep the momentum going, we\u2019re adding incremental media support on gluten-free in the second half and we have another gluten-free merchandising event planned in the third quarter. We\u2019ve also seen continued strong results on Cinnamon Toast Crunch this year. Our more Cinnamon renovation drove a 9% increase in retail sales last year and retail sales are up another 7% in the first half of 2016.","Earlier this year, we announced our plan to remove artificial flavors, colors and high fructose corn syrup from all Big G Cereals by 2017. Nearly, 80% of our brands will meet that claim by January. We\u2019ll begin marketing this renovation news in the third quarter with an in-store merchandising event, TV support, coupons and digital advertising.","We\u2019ll expand the Nature Valley brand in the second half with five new great tasting cereals. These launches add to the current Nature Valley breakfast portfolio that includes protein Granola, Granola bites, Muesli and hard oat meal. We also have a great slate of movie equity promotions planned for the second half. We\u2019re executing Star Wars merchandising events with customers in December and January featuring limited editions Star Wars packaging and impact premiums in new flavored Big G Cereals.","Later in fiscal 2016, we\u2019ll launch a Batman and Superman promotion featuring two new cereals and more in store merchandising activities. These new cereals feature a high impact foil embossed packaging and unique flavors which should appeal to teenage and millennial consumers. And we\u2019re increasing our U.S. cereal media investment in the second half behind some great campaigns. In total, we expect our renovation, innovation and investment plans will drive the improved retail sales performance for our Cereal business in the second half of fiscal 2016.","Our Grain Snacks business has a long track record of growing market share and our share was up again in the first half, but our retail sales growth slowed due to the lower merchandising levels I mentioned earlier. Our plan to strengthen retail sales performance starts with core brand renovations. We\u2019ve reformulated our Nature Valley Crunchy Bar line in the second quarter to make the product easier to buy. We turned on TV support for this news last month and base line sales have responded positively.","We continue to bring compelling innovation to our Grain Snacks business. We launched Fiber One cheese cake in the first half and it\u2019s already a top turning item in the category. Next month we\u2019re capitalizing on growing consumer interest in alternative nut butters with the launch of Nature Valley Nut Butter biscuits. And we are introducing a line of kid focused Grain Snacks leveraging movie equities. We\u2019re supporting our second half renovation and innovation news with a mix of television and digital advertising, featuring new campaigns for Nature Valley and Fiber One and we have a strong second half merchandising plan in place. ","So overall, we feel we have a good slate of news in Grain Snacks in the second half and the right level and mix of support. We expect momentum to build on this business as we move through the third and fourth quarters of 2016. I mentioned earlier that competitive activity had a negative impact on our first half U.S. yogurt sales and share. We have a stronger plan in the back-half to drive improved retail sales results.","Our merchandising support is increasing in the second half, including a One Up Your Cup event, which gives consumers snacking ideas to make the Yoplait yogurt they love even better. We will advertise behind One Up Your Cup and another Yoplait campaign highlighting, milk, fruit, cultures and of course great taste.","We have two significant new product launches rolling out next month too. We\u2019ll expand our Plenti Greek Yogurt line with six new Plenti Oat Meal varieties that combined Oat Meal and Greek Yogurt to bring consumers a more safety eating morning snack. In addition, we\u2019re bringing Annie\u2019s to the yogurt category with the new family focused line of organic yogurts made with whole milk and real fruits.","Our natural and organic portfolio continues to grow nicely. Annie\u2019s has grown retail sales and share in each of its core categories year-to-date and we\u2019ve extended the brand into organic soup cookies and yogurt categories. Jeff Harmening will share news on our next Annie\u2019s category expansion at the Cagny Conference in February.","In addition to Annie\u2019s we continue to see growth in our existing natural and organic portfolio. Our Cascadian firm organic Grain Bars business has grown retail sales 18% and retail sales for our Cascadian farm organic cereal business are up 8%.","So let me briefly share a few additional U.S. Retail highlights. Soup season is now in full swing and we\u2019re gaining share through improved merchandising performance. On Dessert Mixes our goal for the year was to improve our value to consumers by better matching competitive price levels. We\u2019re seeing results so far, our dollar share has stabilized and unit share has increased by more than a point.","Retail sales for Old El Paso increased 1% in the first half led by the shelves, refried beans and seasoning businesses. And in Totino\u2019s Hot Snacks we\u2019re launching Pizza Rolls renovations in the second half to strengthen our number one market position. So in total, we expect our U.S. Retail business to deliver improved retail sales performance in the second half driven by increased investments on key renovation news and excellent line up of consumer first innovation and a higher level of merchandising support.","Turning to our Convenience Stores and Food Service segment, our first half net sales were down 2% driven by the exit of some custom mix businesses and the impact of index pricing on our bakery flower business. However, our focus six platforms continue to perform well posting 5% net sales growth. First half segment operating profit was in line with last year and this performance is in comparison to 15% profit growth in the year ago period. Our frozen meals platform, which combines our successful frozen breakfast products and our more recent entry into Okay-12 school lunches led first half performance. Net sales increased at a strong double digit rate driven by the expansion of our Mini Bagel innovation.","We\u2019re seeing continued strong performance from our snacks platform with net sales up low-single digits year-to-date driven by Beugel and Chex Mix growth in the convenience store channel. Our cereal platform also generated low-single digit growth led by bulk packed varieties and our yogurt platform posted mid-single digit growth in the first half, fueled by good performance in Greek and ParfaitPro. In total we expect segment net sales and operating profit growth to improve in the second half, driven by continued good growth on our Focus 6 platforms and continued cost savings.","So let me close by summarizing this morning\u2019s remarks. We posted growth in constant currency net sales segment operating profit and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the first half. We have a solid plan to strengthen retail sales in the second half with innovation and renovation news as well as additional consumer and merchandising support. We\u2019re now targeting $500 million in cost savings by fiscal 2018 and we\u2019ve adjusted our fiscal 2016 guidance for the Green Giant divestiture. Excluding the impact of Green Giant we remain on track to deliver the growth goals we lead out at the beginning of the year. ","So with that I\u2019ll open the call for questions. Operator, please will you get started?","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please proceed. ","Chris Growe","Hi, good morning. ","Kendall Powell","Hey, Chris good morning. ","Chris Growe","Hi. I just had two quick questions for you. I want to ask first in relation to the retail -- your U.S. Retail sales performance, do you expect growth in the second half of the year for that business and I guess in relation to that I just want to get a sense of where inventories stands. Is that could be an effect on your reported sales growth in the second half as you see it today?","Kendall Powell","Yeah, so it will improve - we expect it to be flat in the second half Chris behind the activity that I talked about, which we can go into in later questions. But there is quite a bit more renovation, new products in the second half and so based on that there is more promotional event oriented promotional activity and there is also stronger media support. So we do expect that consumer movement to improve in the second half based on the phasing of our activities. ","Chris O\u2019Leary","And Chris just to confirm, Ken is referring to the comparable sales obviously in U.S. Retail the second half will suffer from not having Green Giant and not having 53rd week as you\u2019re modeling it. ","Chris Growe","Sure, yeah, okay that\u2019s great. And just a quick question then on yogurt and just it sounds like that\u2019s got a little bit more competitive in that category, is there a matter of getting sort of your key price points lower. And I was curious if that also -- if that true across Greek as well as conventional; is there one that\u2019s more getting a little bit more aggressive in terms of price competition.","Donal Mulligan","Yeah, well it\u2019s a little bit of both; it\u2019s some price point adjustments and some frequency. I mean we found as the promotional environment got a little hotter in the first half and as you heard in response to lower milk prices, there was just an increase in the pace of activity; frankly we were, just because of the timing of when various things can happen, we were blocked out of certain windows. And so as we\u2019ve moved forward and to adjust our price points and adjust our frequency both on Greek, Chris, and a little bit on core cup as well we know that our promotional frequency and quality will be improved in the second half. ","Chris O\u2019Leary","The other thing I\u2019ve mentioned Chris is just given the dairy prices and that adds more benefit to the Greek business so that uses more milk. It was also skewed to promotions focused on Greek and clearly our share in Greek is not as high as in the traditional yogurts. So as that evens up in the second half of the year, we think that we\u2019ll get a greater share of the merchandising windows in Yogurt in the back-half.","Chris Growe","I see that makes sense. Okay, thanks so much for your time and happy holidays.","Chris O\u2019Leary","Thanks, Chris, you too.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed.","Andrew Lazar","Good morning, everybody. ","Kendall Powell","Hey, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar","Just two quick things from me, one is at your Analyst Day in Boston I think you mentioned that General Mills would look to reinvest roughly one-half of the sort of incremental cost saves that you would generate this year and I am just trying to get a little update is that the pace that company is tracking at? And if so just are you getting the sort of return through the first half on that sort of reinvestment that you would have expected?","Chris O\u2019Leary","Yeah, Andrew I think we remained largely on pace for that same kind of mix of reinvestment as Ken alluded to some of the planned merchandising in the first half didn\u2019t happen we\u2019ll see that in the second half. So I would say we\u2019re probably a little lighter in some of that reinvestment in the first half of the year. And as we said we opened the year with a stronger profit performance than we expected in the first quarter and that holds through the first half. And so we\u2019ll see I think a greater portion in plan of our reinvestment in the back half, but I think you\u2019ll see that in advertising, you\u2019ll see it in merchandising and you\u2019ll see it in improved top-line performance as well.","Andrew Lazar","And then\u2026","Kendall Powell","Just to -- Andrew, maybe just to build on that a bit our media spend was down in the first half and will be in the U.S. and will be flat in the second half, our merchandising spending was down low-single digits in the first half, will be up in mid-single digits in the second half. So there is a significant phasing component to the way that year was planned and will unfold and we expect to see those second half activities give us a good return and some stronger consumer movement.","Donal Mulligan","Yeah, let me -- actually it\u2019s a great point; let me just build on that a little bit on advertising because I\u2019m sure that minus 15 in the quarter might popped up some folks and what I would say is that quarterly advertising expense can be variable. It was minus 10 for the first half, but that includes the ForEx impact and as you can see on sales ForEx has been about 5 point impact. So in constant currency advertising is not down as much as it was looking on a reporting basis. ","Now it was planned to be down due to Forex, but also because of some choice we\u2019ve made on our value oriented brands. As Ken alluded to it will be up in the back half on a comparable basis. And even on a reported basis we expect it to be about flat and that\u2019s taking into account Forex and the 53rd week and it will clearly be up on our priority businesses in the U.S. cereal, yogurt across Christmas businesses in International and we expect for the full year that advertising will move in line with sales growth and again up on the full year on those priority businesses.","Andrew Lazar","Thank you for that. And then I think on the last call you had mentioned gross margin expansion for the full year of roughly 50 to 100 basis points was probably a reasonable place to land. Any significant changes one way or the other on that expectation based on what you saw in the second quarter?","Donal Mulligan","Yeah first half came in at 170 basis points better we obviously lap some things in the first quarter on merch from F\u201915; we\u2019ll continue to see expansion in the second half, but it will be less than in the first half where it\u2019s still benefit from strong HMM, but will begin lapping some of the inefficient merchandising we took out last year and as we said we phased some of our merchandising to the second half of this year and inflation will increase in the second half from the first half. So the range of 50 to 100 is still the right guidance I would say coming out of first quarter, but frankly we\u2019re probably moving more toward the high end of that range.","Andrew Lazar","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC. Please proceed.","David Palmer","Thanks.","Kendall Powell","Hey, David.","David Palmer","Two questions. Good morning, first, scanner data looks to be pointing to a decline in promotion in merchandising activity in your Cereal business and back in the summer we could have imagined lot more activity behind the gluten-free repositioning for Cheerios, and I realized that Walmart itself might be part of this change, but was the lower promotion activity always the plan or was there perhaps a change in course a little bit after the recall, any color would be helpful?","Kendall Powell","Thanks for that David. So yes lower cereal promotion was part of the plan; we do have as you said gluten-free renovation, which is very important news for us which came on into the second quarter and that will continue very strongly into the second half, we have a couple of more events, but lower promotion was planned; we had fewer new products in the first quarter compared to some important new product launches a year ago and so there was less merchandising activity there.","I would say the thing that we anticipated but came out at us a little bit harder was decline in promotion in our largest customer and I think you\u2019re well aware of clean store initiative and just trying to get their stores more focused on the most important merchandising activities. We anticipated that the impact was a little more than we expected and that resulted in a significantly less display there. And also we anticipated this as well but a little more than we thought just adjustment of inventory as they move towards that policy. So, that was an area that we did expect, but was a little more a deeper impact than we had planned for.","David Palmer","And related to the gluten-free reformulation, if you look at some -- I am sure you see panel data that gives you some insight in terms of trial and repeat and awareness on gluten-free and maybe the uptick. Is this working out like you would have thought and it\u2019s different at all from the consumer response perspective that would be helpful. Thank you.","Kendall Powell","Sure. The consumer response has been very positive the baseline turns and so full priced non-promoted, sort of just true core baseline turns have been up very nicely through the first three months of that period even with that one week impact from the recall they\u2019re up between 3% and 4%. So we\u2019re quite pleased with how that has worked out for us so far I mean obviously the recall was a stumble, but the fundamental consumer reaction is in line if not a little bit better than we anticipated at this point. And we\u2019re going to continue to support that initiative quite heavily in the second half with more merchandising folk events and continued very good advertising.","David Palmer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Robert Moskow ","Hi, thank you. I wanted to know if you could help us tease out the gross margin expansion a little bit more 60 basis points in the quarter, but it also was a pretty easy comp to a year ago. And I wanted to get a sense of what were the cost saves component of that 60 basis points and how much was the easy comp? And then also is there any kind of dilution to gross margin or accretion that we should expect because of Green Giant divestiture?","Donal Mulligan","Yeah, Rob. As I said the inflation flow this year is a little bit reverse from last year was higher in the first half last year and then decelerated as the year went on this year is kind of reverse of that. So we are certainly benefiting this year in the first half from lower inflation. Our productivity the $400 million it tends to be fairly stable throughout the year, so there is not really facing to the productivity savings. So the result we\u2019re seeing this year that we\u2019re seeing greater kind of net inflation if you will productivity less inflation that we saw a year ago. And as I said we\u2019re rolling over the merchandising changes that we implemented starting in the second half of last year.","So as the year unfold, we will start lapping that piece of it we\u2019ll start seeing inflation accelerate a bit in the back half. Green Giant was a lower gross margin business; its operating margin was actually fine but it\u2019s a lower gross margin business so that will have a little bit of accretive impact on our business as the year unfolds. And there has been a lot of work at our International business and actually if you look in the quarter international was a significant contributor to our gross margin expansion and Chris I don\u2019t know if you want to add a few words on what we\u2019re doing from a margin stand point on our International business.","Chris O\u2019Leary","Obviously, it\u2019s a combination of good strong HMM efforts focusing on product mix obviously developed markets growing faster and emerging is contributing to part of that mix effort. But it\u2019s really get solid execution I guess the fundamentals.","Robert Moskow ","Okay. And then maybe just is there any kind of dilution in these numbers for all the reformulation and ingredient upgrades that are going on Don, is there a way to quantify that? ","Donal Mulligan","Yeah well there is part of our investment. It was a smaller piece of our reinvestment. But the other thing that take into effect Rob as we\u2019ve talked about is that you drive a little bit of volume in the businesses from those reformulations and you can see gross margin expansion and I think that you\u2019ve heard Jeff Harmening talked before about our experience with Cinnamon Toast Crunch where as we increase the Cinnamon content we did see higher cost per unit on a variable basis, but even the volume increases and sales increases it were high single to double digits. You leverage the fixed plan and you see gross margin expansion. So really is a case-by-case basis, but we do see reinvestment we often times don\u2019t see a gross margin percentage impact because of the leverage that you get on the plants.","Kendall Powell","Yeah and the only thing I would add to that is those margin moves around product renovation are they\u2019re obviously there, but in the context of our ongoing HMM programs and the restructuring initiatives we have underway and the zero based focus we have on administrative spending. I mean they\u2019re relatively minor in the larger picture and that sort of explains our conviction around our gross margin expansion goals.","Robert Moskow ","I\u2019m willing to try Cinnamon Yoplait if you want to give it a shot.","Kendall Powell","Remind me. So we\u2019ll do a special one just for you when you next come out here.","Robert Moskow ","Good, thanks. ","Donal Mulligan","Thanks Rob see you next month. ","Robert Moskow ","Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. ","Eric Katzman","Hi, good morning happy holidays everybody.","Kendall Powell","Hey, Eric.","Eric Katzman","Couple of questions I guess, why don\u2019t we start with the earnings per share guidance, Don I just want to be clear. So if we start with the 286 base and we go let\u2019s say up 1% to 3% and then adjust for the currency headwinds. You\u2019re getting to like a 280 to 286 range let\u2019s say. And I\u2019m just -- I guess I\u2019m not following because I think consensus was kind of closer to 90 or so going into this earnings report and you\u2019d already I guess given the heads up as to $0.05 to $0.07 dilution from Green Giant. So I\u2019m wondering is -- I know you can\u2019t control consensus but I\u2019m wondering is there something that investors or the analyst community was getting wrong because there is -- it\u2019s not a huge difference, but it seems like there is maybe a nickel or so of difference between what you\u2019re saying is no change versus where the analyst community was.","Donal Mulligan","Well I\u2019ll just start with just to reaffirming your point that I can\u2019t control the consensus I can try to influence it, but I can\u2019t control it. We started the year with mid-single digit expectations in our underlying business it\u2019s going to deliver that. We have seen the $0.09 ForEx headwind; I think we started the year with $0.04. So we saw that increase as the year unfolded I\u2019m assuming that the consensus has that factored in appropriately. We gave a range of $0.05 to $0.07 for Green Giant for this year and ends up being $0.07 I\u2019m not -- again I don\u2019t know in the 290 if people were using $0.05 or $0.07. So it\u2019s just -- I don't what peoples\u2019 assumptions were or inputs were on those two measures. And then I think the other thing frankly we had a strong first quarter and I think people might gotten ahead of what the full year was going to look like. And as we said again in the first quarter we had three quarters to go we saw the business performing as we expected. And we\u2019re still on track to deliver what we said back in July.","Eric Katzman","Okay, thanks for that. And then I guess again a full year question maybe for Ken. I mean do you expect in terms of your volume, will volume do you think can that be flat this year is that part of I know you don\u2019t always get into the details of your top-line other than the consolidated number. But can we start with all this ramp up of merchandising in the second half, new products you\u2019re talking about the categories maybe being a little better in some cases. I mean does your forecast assume that volume is flat this year?","Kendall Powell","Yeah flattish, yes.","Eric Katzman","Okay. And then -- thanks for that. And then I guess the last question is maybe just on yogurt from both the U.S. and a global perspective I mean it seems like that the company after getting struggling with the Greek phenomenon there\u2019s just so many brands that you\u2019re going to market with now and I\u2019m just wondering if that is part of the issue here that you got Annie\u2019s, you\u2019ve Plenti, you\u2019ve got Yoplait, you\u2019ve got Libert\u00e9, I can\u2019t keep track of all of them anymore and I\u2019m just wondering if that\u2019s do you think that that\u2019s part of the issue that you don\u2019t have the scale you used to when it was just basically Yoplait?","Kendall Powell","No I think I\u2019ll come on to your brand comment I think the issue is in the first half is primarily this kind of change in the merchandising context in the category that\u2019s clearly what happened driven by these dramatic declines in milk prices and as you know very-very well I mean we want to be in the zone on promotion, but that\u2019s not how we try to win. And so -- but we did see ourselves lagging the market there and we\u2019re going to adjust very carefully as we move into the second half and our performance will strengthen, but that was clearly the reason for what happened in the category in the first half and well beyond that. ","To your comment on the brand portfolio we have now that\u2019s a really good thing you should like that we\u2019ve got great core cup equity obviously in Yoplait, we\u2019ve come on very effectively over the last couple of years with our Greek varieties, but actually products like Libert\u00e9 which have a different positioning and naturalness and this sort of thing they are participating in another high growth segment of the market now and they are doing really well and the organic sector of the yogurt market is growing double digit and Annie\u2019s is a fantastic brand to put into that segment and that was a long held desire of Annie\u2019s when it was an independent company, but they didn\u2019t have the capability. So actually the fact that we have brands tailored to different consumers and different segments some of which are very high growth that\u2019s a tailwind for us right now we like that.","Eric Katzman","Okay, all right thank you for that happy holidays again.","Kendall Powell","Yeah, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.","Matthew Grainger","Hi, good morning everyone.","Kendall Powell","Hi Matthew, good morning.","Matthew Grainger","Thanks. Just on the International business so I guess a broader question on the portfolio, but given some of your recent steps to optimize the U.S. portfolio with Green Giant the addition of Annie\u2019s just wanted to get your expectations for bolt-on M&A going forward and specifically how you\u2019re thinking about the emerging markets portion of your business? We\u2019ve seen your key competitor become more opportunistic and talk about the attractiveness of making a few acquisitions recently when sentiment and valuations are bit a lower, so just curious how you\u2019re assessing that dynamic?","Kendall Powell","Sure so just a reminder internationally we focus on five global platforms cereal, ice-cream, yogurt, meals and snacking and you know we\u2019ve been focusing our efforts on emerging markets first China, Brazil and then EMEA trying to broaden out our footprint. With regard to bolt-on acquisitions we are open to that and looking for that.","The thing that the key difference between our businesses in the emerging world versus U.S. and Canada is we are not very broad. So we believe we can find -- if we can find the right bolt-on acquisition because our strategy has been to build first and foremost infrastructure and pipes in places like China, Brazil and India and then to start filling it out with those platforms. So I think we are looking I mean as part of our strategy but then obviously we can\u2019t control the pace because it\u2019s really what\u2019s available and what we like with.","Matthew Grainger","Okay so Chris from your perspective has anything changed in terms of the quality of assets available or the expectations of sellers?","Chris O\u2019Leary","No I wouldn\u2019t say, fundamentally no obviously the environment is changing, but I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s a sea change of difference out there but we continue to mine.","Matthew Grainger","Okay. And Chris actually if -- I wanted to see if you could provide a bit more detail on the margin progress in International, I know you touched on this, but constant currency profits were up nearly 20%, margins were the highest for discrete quarter that they\u2019ve been in years and you mentioned favorable mix, but can you talk about within the sub-regions maybe where you\u2019re seeing more progress on the margin side versus where you\u2019re investing more heavily and given the margins that we saw this quarters is that potentially indicative of a step up in absolute margins now that the cost savings is starting to come through?","Chris O\u2019Leary","Well, I\u2019ll get into much more detail in February, so suffice to say we are focused on this. We had a 19% growth in the quarter you got to remember there is also favorable dairy in there and there is a bunch of factors in there. But we are focused on this and we\u2019ve got more levers now that we are firing on, we\u2019ve got HMM, we\u2019ve got Century, we\u2019ve got Compass which will start flowing through. So, I\u2019ll give more details when I see you guys in Cagny.","Matthew Grainger","Alright. Look forward to it. Thanks.","Chris O\u2019Leary","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Kenneth Goldman ","Hi, thanks for the question. Ken, on the first quarter call Rob Moskow asked that we should I think expected pretty short uptick in the next few months, in terms of Nielson, top-line and you said yes, that\u2019s what you expect to see. I mean you sighted back-to-school falling in 2Q, you talked about the solid line up of merchandising on soup, baking and meals on a whole bunch of things. And the message that I took away and the message that I think a lot of investors took away was the things were going to get incrementally better on the top-line in 2Q because of timing not the opposite. So I am just trying to reconcile sort of what those words say with sort of what I am picking away today which is that the timing actually hurt you in 2Q for a couple of items maybe I just misunderstood what was said previously.","Kendall Powell","No, I think so thanks for the question Ken. So and just to your point on soup and baking, I mean we shouldn\u2019t lose the plot those are kind of doing what we wanted them to do and going to have a good soup season there and the baking business has substantially improved. And in cereal and snacks, we did of course have some good news in the second quarter particularly gluten-free Cheerios, which has been very important news and as I said there the baseline movement has been very much what we expected and we really like how that is developing and so that\u2019s been really good.","The story for us in the second quarter is that our merchandising just what didn\u2019t have the total impact that we had planned for it to have. So I would say event-by-event as we bring more focus and precision to our merchandising, our lifts were actually little bit higher than we planned, but just the frequency and the overall quantity was less than we thought with some very particular and deep reductions in our largest customer.","And so that, we did not anticipate and that caused the underperformance in the second quarter versus what we might have expected, fully expected. And just continuing intense promotional environment in Yoghurt and so as we\u2019ve said now we believe that we have addressed those as we go into the second half and as a result performance will improve.","Kenneth Goldman ","That\u2019s helpful. Can I ask a very quick follow-up the warm weather, RTS soup that looks so great right now, is that properly reflecting sort of what you\u2019re seeing I know you\u2019re not really talking necessarily about 3Q, but just a general sense soup sales are they disappointing to you right now?","Kendall Powell","Well, I mean I think you put your finger on it I mean that\u2019s very much cold winter is tend to be good for us and so far it\u2019s been an unusually warm season and we think that that\u2019s a key factor with sort of overall market right now.","Chris O\u2019Leary","But I mean in the last quarter our retail movement was still up and we gain share. So we\u2019d like to see the category movement better, but we\u2019re pleased that the effectiveness of our programs are working.","Kenneth Goldman ","Thank you so much.","Kendall Powell","Hey, thanks a lot Ken.","Jeff Siemon ","Melanie, I think that\u2019s probably all the time we have.","Operator","Okay, thank you.","Kendall Powell","Okay well I know we didn\u2019t get to everyone\u2019s question. So I\u2019m on the phone all the day so please feel free to give me a call if you have follow-ups. Thanks very much everyone. ","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today\u2019s conference call. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines."],"9982":["General Mills (NYSE:GIS) Q3 2015 Earnings Call March 18, 2015  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Kristen Smith Wenker - Senior Vice President of Investor Relations","Donal Leo Mulligan - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President","Bethany Quam - ","Kendall J.

Welcome to the Fiscal 2015 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, March 18, 2015. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kris Wenker, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Kristen Smith Wenker","Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. I'm here with Ken Powell, our CEO; Don Mulligan, our CFO; and Bethany Quam, who's President of our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment. Before I turn the call over to them, I'll cover my usual housekeeping items.","Our press release on third quarter results was issued over the wire services earlier this morning. It's also posted on our website if you still need a copy. You can also find slides on our website that supplement this morning's remarks.","Our remarks will include forward-looking statements based on management's current views and assumptions. And the second slide in this morning's presentation lists factors that could cause our future results to be different than our estimates.","So with that, I'll turn you over to my colleagues, starting with Don.","Donal Leo Mulligan","Thanks, Kris, and good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us today.","Slide 4 summarizes our results for the third quarter. Net sales totaled $4.4 billion, down 1% due to foreign currency effects. On a constant-currency basis, we posted 3% growth in net sales. Segment operating profit totaled $698 million, up 1% as reported and up 3% in constant currency. Net earnings decreased 16% to $343 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.56 as reported.","These reported results include $0.07 per share of restructuring and project-related charges, a $0.05 decline in mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions, $0.01 of acquisition integration costs and a $0.01 charge related to Venezuela currency devaluation. Excluding these items affecting comparability, adjusted diluted EPS was $0.70, up 13% from $0.62 a year ago. Constant currency adjusted diluted EPS increased 15%.","Slide 5 shows the components of total company net sales growth. Pound volume reduced sales by 1 percentage point while mix and net price realization added 4 points of sales growth. Foreign exchange was a 4-point drag on reported net sales growth. The Annie's acquisitions -- the Annie's acquisition contributed 1 point of volume growth and 1 point of sales growth in the quarter.","Let's turn to segment results. Slide 6 summarizes U.S. Retail performance. Net sales were up 1% led by double-digit gains in Snacks and Yogurt. Net sales for our Cereal business essentially matched last year's level while Meals and Baking Products were lower for the period. Annie's sales, which are included in the Snacks and Meals totals, contributed 2 points of net sales growth for the segment. U.S. Retail operating profit increased 1% in the quarter to $521 million.","We continue to see excellent growth in our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment. As you can see on Slide 7, net sales in the quarter increased 6%, and segment operating profit was up a robust 11%. Our 6 focus platforms are leading this growth with strong double-digit net sales gains in frozen breakfast, Yogurt and Cereal. Bethany will give you a detailed update in a moment.","Slide 8 summarizes third quarter International results on a constant-currency basis. Net sales grew 6% overall with growth in all 4 geographic regions.","In Latin America, net sales increased 20% driven by inflation-linked pricing in Argentina and Venezuela. Sales for the Asia\/Pacific region were up 4% led by double-digit growth in the Middle East and India. Net sales in Canada increased 4%, and constant-currency sales in Europe were 3% above last year led by another strong quarter of growth for Old El Paso.","Slide 9 shows that third quarter adjusted gross margin declined 90 basis points. This is primarily due to higher supply chain cost and unfavorable mix. We're now roughly 95% covered on our commodity needs for the full year. In the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted gross margin will roughly match last year's levels, reflecting the impact of lower trade expense and moderating input cost inflation.","SG&A expense as a percent of sales declined 110 basis points in the quarter. Our combined investment in R&D, advertising and media was lower in the period. However, excluding those items, as well as Annie's integration costs and Venezuela currency devaluation, SG&A as a percent of sales was still below the prior year. As we start to see savings flow through from Project Catalyst and our expense policy changes, we expect SG&A, excluding media and R&D, to be down as a percent of sales for the full year.","After-tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $13 million in the quarter compared to $23 million last year. The decrease was primarily due a $4 million asset impairment charge for CPW's South Africa business and unfavorable foreign exchange. In addition, third quarter constant-currency net sales for CPW were down 3% versus last year, reflecting continued challenging category conditions in Western Europe. In contrast, H\u00e4agen-Dazs Japan posted constant-currency net sales growth of 7% behind good results for core mini-cups and multipacks. For the full year, we now expect after-tax JV earnings to be below last year due to the asset impairment charge and foreign exchange.","Slide 12 summarizes a few other income statement details. We incurred $74 million in restructuring and project-related charges in the quarter. On February 12, the Venezuelan government instituted a new foreign exchange market mechanism. We booked a charge of $7 million in the third quarter associated with balance sheet remeasurement of our Venezuelan business.","Excluding those items, as well as mark-to-market effects and Annie's integration costs, corporate unallocated expenses decreased 24% in the quarter. That primarily reflects lower corporate overhead expense and increased pension income. Net interest expense was 6% above last year due to higher debt levels, partially offset by a lower average interest rate.","The effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.5% as reported. Excluding items affecting comparability, the tax rate was 27.5% this year compared to 33.6% a year ago. The lower tax rate in the quarter was driven by the effect of new U.S. tax legislation, certain favorable discrete tax items and changes in earnings mix by country. We now expect our full year adjusted effective tax rate to be 100 basis points lower than last year's due primarily to favorable earnings mix by country.","Turning to the balance sheet. Slide 13 shows that our core working capital declined 9% versus last year's third quarter driven by improvements in payables and receivables. This is the eighth consecutive quarter that we reduced our core working capital versus the prior year.","Cash flow from operations totaled $1.6 billion for the first 9 months. This was down from last year, reflecting lower net earnings. However, we expect our full year operating cash flow, including cash restructuring charges, to be comparable to last year's levels, including the 53rd week and the addition of Annie's.","Capital expenditures totaled $491 million through 9 months. We continue to estimate full year capital expenditure of $750 million, including the incremental spending related to Project Century. We paid $750 million in dividends and spent nearly $1.2 billion to repurchase shares thus far this year.","We've been highly efficient in cash generation in recent years. Since the beginning of fiscal 2011, we've converted 97% of our net earnings into free cash flow, and we're disciplined about returning that cash to shareholders. Slide 15 shows that we returned almost $10 billion to shareholders in the last 5 years, which represents more than 100% of our free cash flow during that time. We're maintaining this commitment to strong cash returns. Last week, our board approved a 7% increase in our quarterly dividend rate to $0.44 per share.","Slide 16 provides a brief update on our productivity and cost savings initiatives. Our ongoing focus on holistic margin management or HMM continues to generate savings. We're on track to deliver more than $400 million in HMM savings this year and $4 billion in cumulative savings over the course of this decade.","We're also making good progress on the new cost-saving initiatives we announced earlier this year. We've reached the necessary labor agreements on plant closures related to Project Century. Actions associated with Project Catalyst are largely completed, and we're making good progress implementing changes to our overhead-related policies and practices. We're on pace to meet or exceed the $40 million in cost savings targeted for fiscal 2015. And we're still targeting more than $350 million in savings by fiscal 2017, above and beyond the ongoing HMM savings I referenced a moment ago. We've included a table in today's press release footnotes and in the appendix of today's slides that summarizes these project-saved [ph] costs and savings.","For the fourth quarter of 2015, we anticipate net sales will grow at a high single-digit rate in constant currency, including the benefit of Annie's and the 53rd week. This combination of sales growth, savings from HMM and our recent cost savings projects, the lower tax rate and lower shares outstanding should result in double-digit constant-currency growth in adjusted diluted EPS for the quarter. For the full year, we continue to forecast low single-digit growth in net sales, a low single-digit decline in segment operating profit and low single-digit growth in adjusted diluted EPS, all in constant currency.","Our strongest operating performance this year is coming from the team in our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment. To tell you more about that, I'll turn the microphone over to Bethany.","Bethany Quam","Thanks, Don, and good morning. I'm pleased to give you an update on our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment.","On Slide 19, you see that U.S. consumers spend more than $1.3 trillion every year on food and beverages. Nearly half of that is food eaten away from home.","In recent years, as unemployment has moderated and consumer confidence has slowly improved, food-away-from-home has captured an increasing share of food spending. Technomic is forecasting this share to hold steady in the years immediately ahead. So you can see this is a great market for our U.S. food brands.","Now when you think of food service, you probably think first about restaurants, but our business is much broader than that. We sell to multiple channels from schools to health care to convenience stores. These are some of the fastest-growing channels within the food service industry. In total, General Mills delivers products to more than 1 million U.S. locations, where people eat food away from home.","Over the past 10 years, we've taken many actions to sharpen our portfolio, focusing on the highest-margin businesses and divesting lower-margin performers, things like bread concentrates and frozen pie shells. Since fiscal 2005, we've trimmed our number of SKUs by 65%. We've also streamlined our supply chain network and now operate just 8 high-performing manufacturing facilities. And we are reaping the benefit of a direct sales force that is solely focused on our product line.","The results of our actions is a portfolio that is leveraging our company's well-known consumer brands. More than 80% of our sales come from products that are branded to consumers or the food service operator. As we've transformed our portfolio and divested businesses, our overall sales trend has been essentially flat over the past several years.","However, net sales are up 4% through the third quarter of this year, and we expect to deliver mid-single-digit sales growth for 2015.","Where you see the most significant impact of our portfolio focus and our restructuring work is in our profit growth. From the low point of the financial crisis in 2008, segment operating profit has increased at a 10% compound rate, and it is up another 14% fiscal year-to-date. We've also generated strong growth in our profit margin over time. Today, our profit margin is in the mid-teens and close to the company overall margin.","So today, we are focused on 6 key product platforms: Snacks, Cereal, Yogurt, frozen breakfast, biscuits and baking mixes. These 6 platforms combined generate nearly $900 million in sales or close to half of our total segment sales. But more importantly, these platforms account for 2\/3 of our segment operating profit.","Net sales for these 6 focus platforms have been increasing at a 4% compound rate over the past 5 years. And so far for this fiscal year, sales are up 9%.","Now let me give you a couple of examples of how we are putting the consumer first to drive new growth on these platforms. Yoplait is the leading yogurt brand in food service, and net sales are growing at a double-digit pace so far this fiscal year. GoGurt, as a choice in McDonald's Happy Meals, is contributing to this growth but so, also, is our Yoplait ParfaitPro. This is a great example of how we find new growth by being consumer and customer first. Consumers like yogurt parfaits. They are a fresh, convenient way to buy yogurt in the perimeter of stores, and consumers love the combination of yogurt and fruit. But making layered parfaits was time-consuming for food service operators and generates a lot of waste when yogurt was scooped out of large tubs. We solved this issue by putting yogurt in an easy-to-dispense bag so it can be piped directly into glasses quickly and easily with little mess and waste.","Our frozen breakfast products are growing at a double-digit rate. K-12 schools serve more than 13 million breakfasts each and every day, and cafeteria operators are looking for options that can be easily and neatly eaten in classrooms. We developed a line of Pillsbury frozen breakfast items that are heated right in the bag and meet the nutritional requirements for school meals. We recently have added cream cheese-filled mini bagels to this line, and they are performing very well. We also introduced a breakfast item under the Old El Paso brand.","Now our Cereal business is growing in schools, too. Last year, participation in school breakfast increased 5% and is up 50% over the past 10 years. Cereal is a key school breakfast offering, and General Mills is the cereal share leader in K-12 schools with our bowl-pack offerings, as it is nutritious, easy to serve and a good value. We have recently added Gluten Free Cinnamon Chex to our offerings. And on college campuses, our bulk cereal is the growth driver with particularly good performance on granola. In total, net sales for our cereals are up 6% so far this year.","Now you've heard us say that snacks are the new meal, and consumers are buying these snacks in a variety of outlets from school cafeterias to hotel lobbies to convenience stores. Sales for our Snacks are up 9% so far this fiscal year led by strong performance in schools, where our cereal bars and Simply Chex snacks meet the new Smart Snack regulations that call for less fat and sugar and more whole grains, fruits, vegetables and protein.","We're also bringing innovation to convenience stores, where 60% of all food purchased is eaten right in the car. We're introducing Chex Mix Popped salty snacks and gluten-free Nature Valley nut bars as C-store consumers are also seeking better-for-you snack options.","We also have a small but growing Natural & Organic snacks business, led by Food Should Taste Good and L\u00c4RABAR. These brands are posting good performance on college campuses and in business and industry outlets, and we're excited about the opportunities ahead for Annie's snack items in food service. This brand is a great fit for colleges and universities as well as K-12 schools.","The good growth we're posting across all of our platforms is due in part to the strong capabilities that we bring to our customer. This starts with our national sales force. Having a dedicated sales force gives us direct access to food service operators and distributors, where we gain insights into how they use our products and focus attention onto our brands. We use those insights to develop new products and creative solutions to meet the needs of our operators and the consumer, which, in turn, drives new growth for us.","So I hope I've given you a good sense of the strength of our Convenience Stores and Foodservice business and the growth opportunities we see ahead. So to summarize, we've made great strides in transforming our portfolio, and we believe we are well positioned to drive growth in this large food service market. We're focusing on 6 key product platforms within the fastest-growing channels in the industry. And with our branded portfolio and strong sales execution, we posted good performance in recent years, and we'll have another strong year in fiscal 2015. We expect to deliver on our plan with mid-single-digit net sales growth, and we'll do a little bit better than our plan with double-digit segment operating profit growth. We are excited about the prospects we see ahead for our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment.","With that, I'll turn it over to Ken Powell.","Kendall J. Powell","Thanks, Bethany, and good morning to everybody. We think our Convenience Stores and Foodservice business is an underappreciated source of sales and profit growth for our brands in the U.S. You'll hear more about this business and the new growth we see ahead at our Investor Day in July.","So now let me give you an update on our 2 operating segments -- our other 2 operating segments, starting with U.S. Retail. Third quarter net sales performance for U.S. Retail showed a clear inflection from our first half trends. Annie's contributed to Snacks and Meals results, and the base Snacks and Meals businesses, Yogurt and Cereal, all posted sequential improvement in net sales growth rates in the quarter. We have a broad portfolio of U.S. Retail categories, and it's a rare year when all of them are growing share.","As you see in Slide 34, dessert mixes and frozen vegetables are 2 categories where we're seeing more significant share declines this year, and we have work to do to fix these businesses. But we are gaining share in our priority categories of Snacks, Yogurt and Cereal, and our year-to-date share is up in categories representing over 2\/3 of our measured sales.","Our innovation and marketing focus is on putting the Consumer First to drive new growth. Nowhere has this been more successful than in our U.S. Yogurt business, where investment in core brand renovation, new products and consumer marketing has driven strong performance this year. This strength is broad-based with growth across almost all of our segments.","More and more consumers are discovering the great taste of our Greek yogurts. Retail sales for our Greek varieties were up 43% in the third quarter, behind the continued success of Yoplait Greek 100 and the introduction of new Greek 100 Whips!, which are off to a good start.","We recently removed all artificial colors and flavors from our Kid Yogurts, and we introduced new items featuring movie equities, like Star Wars and Frozen. We're seeing 7% growth for this business, and retail sales for original-style Yoplait increased 17% in the quarter. We're now rolling out a 25% sugar reduction across the entire Yoplait Original line. We expect this news will help generate more good growth for Yoplait.","Consumer First renovation, innovation and investment have returned our overall U.S. Yogurt business to sales and profit growth. We're now the fastest growing of the major yogurt manufacturers, and we're gaining share at an accelerating pace, including more than 2 points of share growth last month.","Our Cereal business is following a similar playbook. We're investing in core brand renovation, innovation and consumer marketing to keep our cereal brands relevant with evolving consumer preferences. We continue to see strong growth for our granola cereals, which are on trend with consumer interest in less processed food. Retail sales for our Nature Valley, Cascadian Farm and Chex granolas increased by 26% last quarter. Our protein cereal varieties also enjoyed excellent growth, with retail sales more than double last year's level.","And great taste will always be a driver of growth for Cereal. For example, Cinnamon Toast Crunch posted another quarter of strong growth, and we've had very positive consumer response to the relaunch of French Toast Crunch in January. Combined retail sales for these cereals increased by 13% in the quarter, and dollar share rose to nearly 4.5% of category sales. So we saw pockets of good growth in the third quarter, and our total Cereal net sales essentially matched year-ago levels. But our goal is to grow our Cereal sales so we have more work to do.","At CAGNY, we announced that we're embarking on a broad investment plan designed to renovate our Big G portfolio for today's consumers. Gluten-free Cheerios is the first step in this plan. We're taking 88% of the Cheerios franchise, which equates to 11% of the total Cereal category, gluten-free. It is important to note that this is a processing change, not a reformulation.","Oats are the primary ingredient in Cheerios, and they are naturally gluten-free, but trace amounts of wheat, barley and rye find their way into the oat supply chain in the fields or in shipping. One of our engineers developed a mechanism for sorting out those other grains, leaving us with pure oats. So consumers will be able to enjoy the same great-tasting Cheerios that they love with the added benefit of knowing that they are gluten free.","With nearly 30% of U.S. consumers expressing an interest in gluten-free foods, we think this change is a big deal. We know some consumers have turned away from cereal to seek gluten-free options at breakfast, and we think that having the largest franchise in the category gluten free gives them a reason to return to the category. Our Retail customers are certainly excited about this news. Consumers will start to see gluten-free Cheerios packages on shelf in the first quarter of fiscal 2016.","We are leading performance in the U.S. Cereal category, gaining almost 2 points of share over the last 8 years. Our investment in wellness renovation is designed to foster new growth in 2016 and beyond. I mentioned that gluten-free Cheerios is the first step in this plan. We'll tell you more when we outline our fiscal 2016 plan this summer.","Our Snack business continues to deliver on consumers' interest in convenience, great taste and better-for-you alternatives. Our grain snacks posted 4% retail sales growth in the quarter led by Fiber One Streusel and Nature Valley Nut Crisp, new products. Continued distribution gains and investment in sampling and digital marketing for L\u00c4RABAR helped deliver double-digit retail sales growth for nutrition bars, and Chex Mix and Gardetto's posted 3% retail sales growth behind large-size varieties.","Over in the frozen aisle, our Totino's hot snacks business continues to perform well with retail sales up 4% in the third quarter. This brand has found success with innovation like new blasted-crust pizza rolls and by leveraging digital media to target millennial consumers with messaging focused on convenience, value and great taste.","At CAGNY, we mentioned our goal of building our Natural & Organic Food business to $1 billion in sales by fiscal 2020. This portfolio includes Annie's, Cascadian Farm, L\u00c4RABAR, Food Should Taste Good, Muir Glen, Mountain High, Immaculate Baking and Libert\u00e9. Sales for these brands across U.S. Retail and Convenience Stores and Foodservice segments totaled more than $160 million in the third quarter, up 60% versus last year, including the addition of Annie's. But even without Annie's, net sales for the rest of our Natural & Organic brands increased at a double-digit rate.","We're making good progress on the Annie's, integration. We've consolidated our natural channel sales support with Annie's broker. We're bringing our HMM process to the Annie's team to build out a multiyear productivity pipeline, and we're actively working on the next new category launch for the Annie's brand. The leader of Annie's, John Foraker, and the rest of the team continue to run the Annie's business out of the Berkeley, California office, and we're excited about the future growth prospects for our combined Natural & Organic food portfolio.","So let's turn now to results for our International segment. Our Europe region posted another quarter of growth with constant-currency net sales up 3%. Retail sales for Old El Paso increased double digits, thanks to continued strong performance on our Stand 'N Stuff tortilla innovation. H\u00e4agen-Dazs retail sales were down 1% in the quarter. We're introducing using a new premium line of H\u00e4agen-Dazs stick bars in France in the fourth quarter, giving us a strong offering in the largest segment of the category, handheld ice cream treats. And third quarter retail sales for Yoplait increased 1%, including 4% growth in France, where our Yopa! high-protein yogurt has established a leadership position in the Greek-style yogurt segment.","In Canada, third quarter constant-currency net sales were up 4%. Retail sales for Yogurt increased 1% with good growth on Libert\u00e9's extra creamy Greek line launched earlier this year. Cereal retail sales were flat to last year, and we saw particularly good performance on Cinnamon Toast Crunch and EDGE protein cereal. Our Old El Paso and Snacks businesses continued to deliver strong results in retail sales, thanks to innovation like Old El Paso Restaurante kits and Fiber One Delights snack bars.","Net sales in Latin America were up 20% in constant currency, including low single-digit growth in Brazil. We saw strong double-digit growth for La Salte\u00f1a in Argentina. A new advertising campaign drove growth on Yoki meals, and new Nature Valley Fruteria and Fiber One snacks helped Mexico sales increase double digit.","In our Asia\/Pacific region, constant-currency net sales increased 4% in the quarter. We saw strong double-digit sales growth in the Middle East, thanks to the launch of our new Betty Crocker ready-to-eat cookie bars as well as new H\u00e4agen-Dazs varieties, like mango raspberry.","In Greater China, constant-currency net sales were down low single digits driven primarily by low sales for Snacks and H\u00e4agen-Dazs shops. Our shop sales have been impacted by the government's extension of gift card redemption terms from 1 to 3 years. We'll lap this change at the end of the fiscal year. We did see nice growth in our Wanchai Ferry tangyuan business in the third quarter due in part to new innovative flavors and forms of crystal tangyuan launched just in time for the Chinese New Year.","So I'll close our remarks this morning by reiterating the message we shared at CAGNY. The key to delivering new growth for our business is to put the Consumer First. We do that by renovating our established brands to meet current consumer needs, by innovating to create new products that consumers love and by investing in strong consumer marketing messages delivered with the right vehicles to meet consumers where they are.","Where we are doing this well today, we are seeing new growth. In U.S. Retail, I've shared examples, including the renewed growth of original-style Yoplait, the success of new protein-rich cereal varieties and the great marketing on Totino's hot snacks. Bethany gave you a look at the new growth we're driving on our brands in U.S. away-from-home channels, and we're seeing Consumer First efforts drive growth across our international developed and emerging markets. We're developing plans for fiscal 2016 that are designed to build on this momentum and expand the impact of our Consumer First strategic focus, and we'll provide details on those plans on our fourth quarter earnings call.","So that concludes our prepared remarks. I'll ask the operator to open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. First, Annie's, when it was independent, had concept tested a variety of categories that moms would be open to having an Annie's version of that category. How broad do you think Annie's can go? Do you think this brand can be in almost any of your Meals or Snacks categories from soup to toaster pastries?","Kendall J. Powell","David, this is Ken. So you're right. They -- that team -- that Annie's team had been working quite hard over the years to identify other areas where the brand could be extended. And I think one of the many benefits of the combination that we're seeing as we move to the integration is to see how General Mills' innovation and formulation and manufacturing capability complements so well the desires of the Annie's team to extend the brand into new areas. Prior to the combination, it was very difficult for them to go into some of these areas because they're technically difficult. And so we think that the combination of the 2 companies is really going to open up the scope for expansion into new areas. I think some of you have read that we showed a line of soups at the recent natural food conference, and so that was a very high priority area for Annie's. But they were really unable to find the right way to do that. Obviously, we have lots of capability in that area, and we'll be launching that line of product this summer. I will tell you there are a number of other very high potential areas that the brand could be extended to, and we'll talk more about those when we review our plan with you in June.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then second and lastly, you talked about changes in how you're going to bring products to market and how you're going to be working on your innovation pipeline, perhaps bringing products to a select group of retail stores, listening to the consumer more. I'm wondering if that is a fundamental change that you're going to be making broadly across your entire pipeline. Or is this more of a select type of thing? Could you give us a sense of how much of a fundamental change you're making on your innovation as a company?","Kendall J. Powell","Okay. So and David, is the question with respect primarily to Annie's or it's a general question about innovation across the company? Or...","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Well, I was thinking that perhaps this was something of a learning you got with perhaps some of the more entrepreneurial businesses that you've acquired and how they were doing things. But perhaps this was being brought as a best practice to your overall company. I'm wondering if this is -- how broad that is and how much more of a local market testing tinkering approach, consumer-centric approach you're taking in your overall business or if that's more specific to some of these smaller brands.","Kendall J. Powell","Okay. Thank you, David. And so the answer to the question is that really over the last half dozen years, we have been looking very closely at the entrepreneurs that we compete with, the smaller companies that we compete with, and we have studied in detail how those kinds of small companies develop and bring their products to markets. And we've learned a lot from doing that. And I would say a couple of the key lessons that we've learned is that the entrepreneurs who develop those products are very, very, very close to the ultimate consumer who will buy the product. Sometimes, the consumer is themselves or family members. And so that learning has really underscored our desire to put our marketeers and our consumer research specialists in the homes of the people who will be buying our products. This is so-called consumer empathy. We think it's really, really important. And in many ways, it's replacing big and broad-scale tests that we used to do, which, in a way, moves our marketeers out of the process and distances the consumer from them. So we've got a very high premium on getting our folks right next to the consumers who were going to buy these new products. The other area where we've really focused is rapid prototyping of the idea so that we can get a tangible representation of a new product in front of consumers very early in the process and learn directly from the consumer very rapidly. And these are lessons that we're learning from these small companies. And when you do them the right way, the result is you go fast, you make decisions rapidly. You're very connected to the consumer, and so you're more on target more often. So I could go on for another 20 minutes. I won't, but we have changed quite a bit the approach that we take to new product development, very much learning from small companies and entrepreneurs.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So can I just ask 2 questions? The first one is around the negative mix that you mentioned on the gross margin. Could you just help us out, understand what product categories are causing that negative mix shift? What's growing? What's shrinking?","Donal Leo Mulligan","Sure, Alexia. This is Don. The mix with Yogurt was actually -- Bethany's business in C & F is a lower gross margin business but obviously doesn't have the same kind of advertising support. So from an operating profit standpoint, still very competitive with the rest of our businesses. Those will be the 2 that I would point out in the quarter.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay. Great. And then at CAGNY, you were referring to the long-term earnings growth algorithm. I mean, it seems as though you've been pushing really hard on the cost-cutting front this year with the $400 million in savings. You've got a lot of innovation coming to the pipeline. Your advertising spend is being cut a little bit it seems. And at the moment, the volumes are still down on an underlying basis. So I guess the question that comes as we look out over the next couple of years, how confident are you in that there is a return path to that long-term earnings growth algorithm? And really, just what do you think pulls you around the corner back onto that?","Donal Leo Mulligan","Thanks, Alexia. So we very much believe in the long-term growth model that we outlined at CAGNY. And even in a period of -- where our category is a little bit softer, I mean, the reason that we continue to believe very strongly in that model is because where we effectively are meeting the consumer where they're at today with the right kind of innovation, we see very striking growth. And so for us, it's a question of continuing to focus very much on the consumer, bring the right pipeline of innovation and restore the growth momentum on our businesses. And we've given you a number of great examples of how that's working for us this morning. The Convenience and Foodservice success that Bethany outlined for you is almost entirely driven by innovation that has resulted from a very high focus on the consumers in that channel. We've talked at length about Yogurt, and when you look back over the last couple of years, the renovation and innovation that we brought to that product line, it's not surprising that we're now seeing very good growth. So we just intend to apply those principles where we have businesses that are not growing to our satisfaction. And we think as we do that, we'll return our businesses to on-model performance.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi Research.","David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Two quick questions. First on dairy. I was just curious how stable are yogurt prices given the decline in dairy cost? And how price sensitive do you see the Yogurt category?","Kendall J. Powell","You want to take that?","Donal Leo Mulligan","Yes, the pricing in Yogurt, looking at the U.S. in particular, has been very stable. We made -- about 1 year ago, we made some tactical price moves. But since that time, it's been very stable even with the movement in dairy. So we think that's a very rational -- rationally priced category right now.","David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then just go ahead.","Kendall J. Powell","Well, I would just add, I think that consumers are still very focused on value in this economy, and so as Don just said, the prices have been stable through periods of higher dairy prices and periods of lower dairy prices. I think the industry as a whole has worked very hard to maintain relatively stable prices.","David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Back in November, you guys called out kind of 3 issues that affected your year: just kind of overall slowdown in category growth, the baking mix and kind of frozen vegetable promotional issues and I think some inventory destocking. Can you just give us a quick update on those 3 factors, and how they're trending today?","Kendall J. Powell","Okay. I'll start, David, and I'm sure Don will want to jump in. But in terms of this -- the category momentum, it's a little better on our core categories. I know you guys have your own data, but as we looked at the Nielsen, the Cereal category, if you look at the last 12 months, was down around 4%. Last quarter or last 3 months, it's been down around 2%. This is on a dollar basis. It's still down, but that's a little better. Obviously, we have more to go, but we believe we're seeing some moderation there. The Yogurt category last 12 was up 3%. That's accelerating as we look at the last 3 months. It's up a little over 4%. So we like that. The Snack category on the last 12-month basis was actually down a little bit, I think 0.5%. That has turned over the last 3 months to be, I think, up between 1% and 2%. So in our core categories, we're seeing some positive momentum, and we like that but still more to go, particularly in the Cereal category, where we're very focused, and we have a very good pipeline of innovation coming. On the baking mix issue, there really are 2 components for us there. One is that we launched a very extensive line of Hershey's branded products a year ago, and there was lots of pipeline build around that launch. Some of those items have done well and sustained. But as we've lapped what was a fairly big launch, we've just been down versus that launch. And then as we've said, there are some promotional pricing issues selectively in that category, and we continue to position ourselves to address those. So that's still very much a work in progress. And your last -- I think your last point was what, David?","David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Inventory destocking by retailers.","Kendall J. Powell","Okay, inventory, yes. I think it's -- we don't really see that. It was down a little. I think there was some destocking. It might have been up a little bit this quarter. I mean, it's -- at the end of the day, over any 12-month period, sales through stores and our deliveries match very, very closely, and so we don't really overly focus on that.","Donal Leo Mulligan","Yes. And David, just to -- we've -- since we changed our guidance in November, we've held to it. Obviously, there's some puts and takes. Ken touched on a couple of those, but the couple of things I'd highlight is we've had some businesses that have performed better. Bethany's Convenience Stores and Foodservice business has continued to strengthen as the year unfolded. Our U.S. Yogurt business, as Ken overviewed, has performed better as the year has played out. Our developed markets internationally, Europe has continued to be strong. We've seen a little bit of rebound in Canada as you saw in the sales numbers this quarter. The Annie's acquisition has come in as expected. Our tax rate has improved a bit, and that's really due to the earnings mix internationally. So that's something that we think we'll sustain.","On the downside, as we said, the emerging markets have tempered the growth a little bit, plus we had some service issues in our Brazil business. So that's been a little bit more of a headwind than we expected. And on the gross margin, it's been a little -- it took a little longer than we expected to pullback on all the trade spending, but we have been seeing that, and you saw that come through in our price mix this quarter. And quite honestly, the ForEx movement has hurt us a little bit from a transaction standpoint on our gross margin a little bit more than anticipated. So again, there's puts and takes, but if you list them, there's a lot of positives to look at as the year has played out.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I think you guys touched on this a little bit, but I was hoping we can go a little bit deeper on gross margins. I think for most of us who are modeling this, it's been an area of disappointment this year, particularly as we look at some of the input cost trends out there. So maybe you could talk a bit about what you're seeing from just a raw input cost, aside from some of the investment you're making whether it be in process or product. And then touch a little bit more deeply in terms of the portfolio mix issues, I think, you referenced in the press release. What's driving some of the compression? And how enduring that may be?","Donal Leo Mulligan","Well, Jason, yes, it's a very fair question given that gross margin hasn't performed the way we expected -- hasn't played out the way we expected this year. A couple of factors, I'll dial through them. Trade, in terms of pulling back on some of the inefficient trade that we started talking about last summer. It has taken a little bit longer than we anticipated, but as I mentioned, we're starting to see the positive impact of that as we look at our price mix this quarter, but that has been a drag as the year's unfolded. Mix, as I alluded to, the growth in our Yogurt business has been very encouraging, but it is slightly dilutive from a gross margin standpoint, as is the C & F business. We've seen negative volumes in our U.S. business, and so there's been some deleverage there. And then a smaller piece would be the FX and the translation impact. But the first 3 are the primary drivers as the year unfolds. It is not higher inflation. Matter of fact, as the year plays out, we think our inflation, by the time we close the books, could actually round down to 2% versus the 3% we had been tracking. And HMM is very much on track. So those 2 pieces we feel good about. I think what's important to remember also is that we're undertaking a large Project Century to optimize our North American supply chain. None of those benefits have been played through yet in our gross margin. We would expect to start seeing some of those in F '16.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And I want to ask another question. It's somewhat related but not in a big way. It stems from some of the press reports out there and I don't -- about potentially divesting Green Giant. I don't expect you to comment specifically on Green Giant, but I would like just to ask a question more broadly about how you're thinking about your portfolio. You've got some on-balance growth. Some high-margin businesses are anchoring you down. Some lower-margin businesses are driving your growth. You talked about that on gross margins. You clearly have been trying to accelerate some of the growth of some of the lower-margin stuff because it's where the growth is, and you've demonstrated willingness to sort of buy in to transform the portfolio. Are you willing to examine some of the maybe high-profitable, high-cash generative assets that don't have much growth or potentially growth anchors and consider unwinding them or divesting them on a go forward?","Kendall J. Powell","Jason, I think the only thing to say is what we've said in the past, that -- which is that we do continually review the portfolio and looking for opportunities to strengthen or alter. And so we're constantly doing that, and I don't really think that I would have anything to add to that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I know you don't want to talk about fiscal '16 yet, but the trends in gross margin do continue to fall below our expectations, but you have this big shelf of savings coming through also. So I guess, can we think conceptually about fiscal '16 being a stabilization year for gross margin? Or should we think, \"Boy, there's a lot of product renovation you still have to do. Shifting the mix still has an impact.\" And is there another year of potential erosion ahead? And then secondly, the SG&A savings, how big can those savings be for fiscal '16? I know you've quantified some of it, but can you give us a sense for '16?","Kendall J. Powell","Well, first of all, Rob, we'll give you -- as we always do, we'll give you a good level of detail on what we're anticipating for inflation, and HMM and these sorts of things when we meet with you in June.","Kristen Smith Wenker","July.","Kendall J. Powell","Or July. I beg your pardon. I stand corrected. So we'll come on to that then. We've given you, I think several times now, how we expect the savings from our various projects to accumulate over the next 3 years, and I think every time we see you, we update those. Those will be quite significant in F '16, both from the restructuring side, administratively, and we'll start to see supply chain savings come through as well. And we've given you those numbers and actually updated them, I think, a couple of times. So those are going to start to come through. So -- and will be positive. So I guess the way I would leave it is just to say we'll give you a good level of detail here in a couple of months.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. I mean, there's some you've quantified already. But then there's other projects you've added on top. So I wanted to know if there was going to be more. Maybe you can just say if there going to be more savings on top of what you've already quantified, well, [indiscernible] July.","Donal Leo Mulligan","Yes, Rob. We've already -- yes, we've already provided an overview of the 3, Project Century, Project Catalyst and the other overhead policy and practices changes that we're making, and those will accumulate to more than $350 million in savings by F '17: $260 million to $280 million next year, and that's obviously an increase from the $40 million plus that we'll get this year.","Kristen Smith Wenker","And you'll have another year of HMM next year.","Donal Leo Mulligan","Yes, as Kris mentioned, we'll have another year of HMM on top of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess one kind of management question and then one specific. Why don't we deal with the specific one first. If I look at, Don, if I look at corporate expense, unallocated corporate over time, this quarter was the lowest you've had in many years. And even if I look at the last couple of quarters, you're kind of on a run-rate basis, let's say, I don't know, $150 million, call it, and that's well below what you've been reporting. So I know it's a tough number to forecast, but is there -- how should we think about that kind of going forward with the impact of the restructuring action, which, I assume has some impact on unallocated corporate, not just the segments.","Donal Leo Mulligan","Yes, well, last year, I think if you strip out the mark-to-market and other items, make comparables around $250 million in corporate unallocated. This year, we'll kind of zero in around that same level, and you're seeing the benefit -- we'll start seeing the benefit this year of the -- of Project Catalyst. In both years, you saw the impact of lower incentive payment given the performance. So assume we get back to the performance we expect, I would hope actually corporate items would go up a little bit, but you'd see that being paid for by higher operating profit as well.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. All right. And then I don't know if I asked this, Ken, the last time, but I'm just trying to understand why we should be comfortable with Small Planet Foods being basically broken up and put into the various other, let's say, conventional food segments? I mean, right? Isn't that...","Kendall J. Powell","Yes, yes. No, you did ask that, but it's okay.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","At least I'm consistent.","Kendall J. Powell","Yes, it's okay. Actually, I think you've asked it twice. But it's a good question, and the reason that we made that change, first of all, remember we've been selling marketing and learning about these categories for 10 years now, over 10 years. And what we noticed for particularly the snacking area, think products like L\u00c4RABAR and Food Should Taste Good, we were coming into -- see, some of our -- these large major customers, are -- we were coming in with a snack presentation and an overview and thoughts on growth for Snacks 2 to 3x depending on what the product was. And these products are -- they're growing. They are -- I wouldn't necessarily say yet, that they are mainstream, but they are certainly in the process of mainstreaming. And so our belief is that we are better off going in and telling the Snack story once with all of our brands, whether they're Nature Valley or Food Should Taste Good or L\u00c4RABAR, getting our sort of holistic view of that category and how it's going to grow one time, one story to these customers. And what we're seeing in the early days of that is very positive. So for instance, L\u00c4RABAR had a terrific quarter. And so I guess I would tell you we really believe that this is the right approach. And don't worry about it. I will also tell you that we have some centralized marketing capability around these Natural & Organic snacks that we've retained because they use sort of a, in many ways, a different and more -- a person-to-person marketing model, and we've maintained that capability. So that exists centrally for all those brands to call on. I will also tell you that Annie's has a very powerful natural channel sales capability that is unique and differential to what General Mills had. And so while we will be using our divisional structure and our centralized U.S. Retail sales focus to expand distribution into traditional channels, all of the products that I mentioned in my remarks, L\u00c4RABAR, Food Should Taste Good, Immaculate Baking, we're going to funnel the selling for those brands to the Natural channels through Annie's. And that -- so there are a number of ways to -- and there's great synergy there, and they're very, very good at that channel. And our growth will accelerate in that channel as a result. So there's a little bit of detail and texture behind what we've done, but we're doing these to accelerate sales and accelerate our impact with retailers. And the early signs, so far, are quite positive on it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Todd Duvick with Wells Fargo.","Todd Jeffrey Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes. Don, I guess this is probably for you. The way we calculate it, your leverage is a little elevated compared to where it has been, and I know Annie's probably added to that. But can you talk broadly about your leverage. Where you are today? And if you maintain a target leverage range, and also a target credit rating?","Donal Leo Mulligan","Yes. Happy to, Todd. That's something that, obviously, we look at very, very rigorously. And we are a little above our targeted leverage ratio. It's driven primarily as you know, by Annie's. We do expect that as we go into F '16 to improve. Our target ratio was probably a turn or 2 lower than where we are today. And our target credit rating is a BBB+, where we're pleased that we're a notch above that from Moody's perspective. But we've been maintaining that same guidance in terms of the leverage and the credit rating for a number of years now, and that has not changed.","Todd Jeffrey Duvick - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then with respect to your short-term debt balance, it is also elevated. Should we expect to see you in the market terming out a portion of that? And I guess related to that, do you have kind of a target in terms of how much floating rate debt you have versus fixed rate debt?","Donal Leo Mulligan","Yes, we would typically look at floating to be, say, 1\/3 -- 30% to 35% of our mix. And we will be terming out some of that debt certainly over the coming months.","Kristen Smith Wenker","Thanks, everybody. If there are folks still in queue, sorry we didn't get to you. Give me a ring, and we'll try and help you out. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, March 20, 2019.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Jeff Siemon. Please go ahead. ","Jeff Siemon","Thanks, Jason, and good morning to everyone. I\u2019m here with Jeff Harmening, our Chairman and CEO; Don Mulligan, our CFO; and Jon Nudi, who leads our North America Retail segment, who\u2019ll join us for the Q&A portion of the call. And I\u2019ll turn it over to them in a moment, but before I do, I\u2019ll cover a few housekeeping items.","Our press release on our third quarter results was issued over the wire services earlier this morning, and you can find the release and a copy of the slides that supplement our remarks this morning on our Investor Relations website. Please note that our remarks this morning will include forward-looking statements that are based on management\u2019s current views and assumptions. The second slide in today\u2019s presentation lists factors that could cause our future results to be different than our current estimates.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn you over to my colleagues, beginning with Jeff.","Jeff Harmening","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone.","There are three things I hope you\u2019ll take away from today\u2019s call. First, we had a strong third quarter with solid execution leading to positive organic sales growth and significant operating margin expansion. Second, our year-to-date performance and fourth quarter plans give us confidence that we will meet or exceed all of our key fiscal 2019 financial targets. Specifically, we are raising guidance for full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share and free cash flow conversion. And we expect net sales will finish toward the lower end of our guidance range, and adjusted operating profit will finish toward the higher end of the range. And third, our improved execution and strengthened performance this year reinforce our view that a balanced approach to top and bottom-line growth centered on our Consumer First strategy will drive long-term value for our shareholders.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Don to walk through our financial performance in the quarter. Then, I\u2019ll come back to provide an update on our fiscal 2019 priorities and share a few highlights of our year-to-date performance.","Don Mulligan","Thanks, Jeff and good morning everyone.","Slide five summarizes our third quarter financial results. Net sales of $4.2 billion increased 10% in constant currency, including contributions from the Blue Buffalo acquisition. Organic net sales increased 1% in the quarter. Holistic margin management savings, positive net price realization and mix, continued strong cost control and the addition of the higher margin Blue Buffalo business helped drive significant margin expansion in the quarter, resulting in adjusted operating profit of $730 million, up 25% in constant currency. And adjusted diluted EPS of $0.83 increased 6% in constant currency, driven by adjusted operating profit growth, partially offset by higher net interest expense, adjusted effective tax rate and average diluted shares outstanding.","Slide six shows the components of net sales growth in the quarter. Organic net sales were up 1%, driven by positive net price realization and mix across all segments, partially offset by lower contributions from pound volume. Foreign currency translation was a 2-point headwind to net sales. And the net impact of the Blue Buffalo acquisition and the divestiture of our La Salte\u00f1a business in Argentina added 9 points to net sales in the quarter.","Turning to our segment results on slide seven. North America Retail organic net sales were up modestly in the quarter, rounding down to flat. Our consumer takeaway trends improved in the quarter and track more closely to our shipments with U.S. Nielsen measured retail sales flat versus last year and share gains in the majority of our top U.S. categories.","Net sales results improved sequentially for all our U.S. operating units. Growth on U.S. Cereal and U.S. Meals & Baking was offset by declines in the Canada, U.S. Snacks and U.S. Yogurt operating units. This net sales performance benefited from recent innovation, including Pillsbury Sweet Hawaiian baked goods and positive initial results on Cinnamon Toast Crunch churros, plus as we anticipated on our second quarter earnings call, stronger merchandising performance led to improved net sales results in U.S. Cereal and U.S. Snacks. And even with this greater merchandising, price mix continued to contribute 2 points to the segment\u2019s net sales growth.","U.S. Cereal net sales exceeded our retail sales growth in the quarter, bringing year-to-date net sales growth in line with retail sales when adjusted for non-measured channels. U.S. Meals & Baking net sales growth reflected strong performance on our key seasonal businesses as well as growth on Totino\u2019s hot snacks, Old El Paso shells and tortillas, and Annie\u2019s Mac & Cheese.","Segment operating profit increased to 12% in constant currency driven by benefits from cost savings initiatives, lower SG&A expenses and positive net price realization and mix, partially offset by input costs inflation.","In Convenience Stores & Foodservice, third quarter organic net sales increased 3% versus prior year. Our Focus 6 platforms generated 4% net sales growth, led by strong performance at our Pillsbury Stuffed Waffle and Chex Mix snacks in convenience stores as well as Cinnamon Rolls and other frozen baked goods in the foodservice channels.","Segment operating profit increased 15% in the quarter, primarily driven by benefits from cost savings initiatives and positive net price realization and mix, partially offset by input cost inflation. Third quarter organic net sales for our Europe & Australia segment were down 2% as declines on yogurt and the negative impact of a continued challenging retail environment in France were partially offset by growth on snack bars and ice cream. Nature Valley and Fiber One snack bars delivered another quarter of strong double-digit retail sales growth as we secured distribution gains and brought successful innovation to market.","H\u00e4agen-Dazs retail sales also grew double-digits, as we expanded distribution on stick bar, mini cup and pint innovations. Segment operating profit in Europe & Australia was down 1% in constant currency, driven primarily by higher input costs including significant dairy inflation and currency-driven inflation on products imported to the UK, partially offset by benefits from cost savings initiatives, lower SG&A expenses and favorable net price realization and mix.","In our Asia & LatAm -- Asia & Latin America segment, organic net sales increased 7% in the quarter. We drove double-digit retail sales growth on snacks in India and the Middle East behind expand distribution and compelling marketing on Pillsbury and Betty Crocker snack cakes. Nature Valley also performed well in the Middle East and Latin America as we continued to build distribution.","In China, our Wanchai Ferry business delivered another quarter of solid growth, driven primarily by Chinese New Year activations on core dumplings. H\u00e4agen-Dazs continued to grow across Asia & Latin America behind successful innovation like new Mochi and peanut butter flavors of pints and stick bars, further development in e-commerce and continued expansion of H\u00e4agen-Dazs shops. Segment operating profit totaled $20 million compared to a loss of $2 million last year, driven primarily by organic net sales growth and lower SG&A expenses, partially offset by higher input costs. For our Pet segment, third quarter net sales increased 4% on a pro forma basis on top of 15% pro forma growth in last year\u2019s third quarter. Significant growth in FDM and e-commerce channels was partially offset by declines in Pet Specialty.","Segment operating profit of $73 million was $2 million below prior year on a pro forma basis, driven by plant start-up costs and intangible amortization. Excluding these two items, Blue Buffalo operating profit would be up high-single-digits and margin up over 100 basis points versus last year.","Slide 12 covers our margin results in the third quarter. Adjusted gross margin increased 170 basis points and adjusted operating profit margin was up 230 basis points over the prior year. The strong margin results were driven by increased COGS HMM savings, benefits from positive net price realization and mix, continued strong cost control at SG&A and the addition of the higher margin Blue Buffalo business, partially offset by input cost inflation.","Slide 13 summarizes our joint venture results in the quarter. Cereal Partners Worldwide net sales increased 2% in constant currency, driven by solid growth in our Asia, Middle East and Africa as well as Europe regions, partially offset by declines in Latin America. H\u00e4agen-Dazs Japan net sales were down 5% in constant currency, driven primarily by decline in our crispy sandwich and stick bar varieties. Combined after tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $12 million in the quarter compared to $17 million a year ago, primarily due to our $4 million after tax share of a restructuring charge at CPW.","Slide 14 summarizes other noteworthy income statement items in the quarter. Restructuring, impairment and other exit costs of $60 million reflected our recently announced global supply chain optimization actions including the planned closure of our yogurt facility in California. We recognized a $35 million loss on the divestiture of our La Salte\u00f1a business in Argentina. Corporate unallocated expenses, excluding certain items affecting comparability, increased by $24 million in the quarter.","Net interest expense increased $42 million compared to last year\u2019s total that included $16 million in one-time expenses related to the Blue Buffalo acquisition, which were excluded from adjusted earnings.","The adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.9% compared to 15.2% a year ago, primarily driven by year-to-date adjustment during last year\u2019s third quarter related to U.S. tax reform. And average diluted shares outstanding were up 4% in the quarter.","Slide 15 summarizes our financial results through nine months. Net sales of $12.7 billion increased 9% in constant currency. Organic net sales were flat to last year. We\u2019ve driven year-to-date expansion in adjusted gross margin and operating profit margin resulting in an 11% constant currency growth in adjusted operating profit. And nine-month adjusted diluted EPS increased 3% to $2.39.","Slide 16 provides our balance sheet and cash flow highlights through nine months. Our core working capital totaled $498 million, up 12% compared to the same period last year, due entirely to Blue Buffalo\u2019s addition to our balance sheet. Excluding Blue Buffalo, core working capital was down double digits, driven by continued benefits from our terms extension program.","Operating cash flow totaled approximately $2 billion compared to $2.1 billion in the prior year, primarily reflecting little less benefit from changes in accounts payable. Capital investments totaled $368 million. And we\u2019ve converted 113% of adjusted after tax earnings into free cash flow, helping fund nearly $800 million in year-to-date debt reduction. And we paid $884 million in dividends, so far this fiscal year.","Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we continue to expect significant top and bottom-line growth for Blue Buffalo as we benefit from our launch into new FDM customers, and the expansion of our Wilderness sub line into FDM channels. We expect organic net sales growth to moderate from Q3\u2019s results as North America Retail shipments are expected to return to modestly lagging retail takeaway as they did in the first half and as our other three legacy segments compare against their strongest quarterly sales growth performance in fiscal 2018.","Finally, we expect fourth quarter margins to be down versus last year, reflecting the comparison against significant margin expansion in last year\u2019s Q4, as well as higher incentive compensation and brand building investment, this year.","I\u2019ll close my portion of our remarks by updating our fiscal 2019 guidance, which you can see on slide 18. We now expect constant currency net sales and organic net sales to finish towards the lower end of our previous guidance ranges of 9% to 10% growth and flat to up 1%, respectively. We now estimate constant currency adjusted operating profit to finish toward the higher end of our previous range of 6% to 9% growth. Net interest expense is now expected to total approximately $535 million for the full year. Our full-year adjusted effective tax rate is expected to be in a range between 22% and 23% or one point below our most recent guidance. We\u2019re raising our guidance for constant currency adjusted diluted EPS to range between flat and up 1% compared to the previous range of flat to down 3%. We\u2019re also raising our expectation for free cash flow conversion to at least 105% of adjusted after tax earnings, which is ahead of our previous guidance of at least 95% and we continue to project currency translation will be a 1% to 2% headwind to full year net sales growth and will not have a material impact on operating profit or EPS for the full year.","With that, let me turn it back over to Jeff to give some color on our performance against our fiscal 2019 priorities. Jeff?","Jeff Harmening","Thanks, Don.","On slide 20, you can see the three priorities we laid out at the beginning of the year: Grow the Core; Transition Blue Buffalo; and Deliver Financial Commitments. I\u2019m pleased to say that through nine months, we\u2019re on track to achieve each of these priorities.","At our Investor Day in July, we outlined five keys to growing the core including improving our U.S. yogurt and emerging market businesses, strengthening our innovation, stabilizing our U.S. distribution, and driving greater price mix. Year-to-date, we\u2019ve driven improvement in each of these areas, compared to our 2018 performance.","We returned to share growth in U.S. yogurt; emerging market organic sales are up high-single-digits through the first nine months of the year, well ahead of last year\u2019s growth rate; we\u2019ve improved our sales from innovation; we\u2019re growing our share of U.S. distribution; and we\u2019re driving 2 points of positive price mix year-to-date versus 1 point last year. These results are translating into stronger retail sales performance in our U.S. business.","On slide 22, you can see that we\u2019ve driven steady improvement in our Nielsen measures sales results with the 2-year trend reaching positive territory in the most recent quarter. We\u2019re also competing more effectively within our categories with year-to-date market share gains in 7 of our 10 largest U.S. categories. While we know there is certainly still more work to do, we\u2019re encouraged by the significant progress we\u2019ve made since fiscal 2017. With that as a backdrop, let me share some specific examples of our year-to-date performance against our Grow the Core priority in each of our platforms around the world.","We\u2019re encouraged by the improvement we\u2019re seeing in U.S. Cereal where category trends have improved consistently since 2017. We\u2019re also pleased with our U.S. Cereal retails performance in the third quarter with measured channels retail sales up 1% as we restore more normal merchandising levels. After nine months, we\u2019re gaining market share and expanding our position as a number one manufacturer in the category.","These results have been fueled by strong innovation, holistic brand building activations and benefits from price mix. Five of the top six new products in the category are Big G Cereals, including Cheerios Oat Crunch, Cinnamon Toast Crunch churros and Fruity Lucky Charms. Retail sales for our Chex franchise are growing year-to-date, thanks in part to our holiday season partnership with the Grinch movie, and our strategic revenue management actions have helped drive one point of positive price mix for our cereal business this year.","Beyond U.S. Retail, we\u2019re also growing cereal in our Convenience & Foodservice segment with net sales up low single digits through the first nine months of the year, led by strong performance in the K-12 schools.","Now, let\u2019s turn to the U.S. yogurt where we\u2019ve grown market share year-to-date. While our overall retail sales are below last year, we\u2019ve positioned our portfolio for future growth with our focus on fast-growing, simply better yogurt segment and our core Go-Gurt and Original Style Yoplait product lines. Simply Better is a small, but rapidly expanding part of our portfolio and we hold the number one position in this segment.","Our year-to-date retail sales grew the strong double-digit rate behind Oui by Yoplait and our new Oui Petites launch. Go-Gurt and Original Style Yoplait represent more than 50% of our portfolio. Year-to-date retail sales for these product lines were up low single digits driven by Go-Gurt equity flavors and dunkers innovation as well as Original Style Yoplait and more real fruit news and all family consumer messaging.","Our Greek & Light products were down double-digit through nine months as we right-sized distribution on shelf. And for the remainder of our portfolio including product line such Yoplait Whips and our Kid Cup business, year-to-date retail sales were down but we expect trends to stabilize as we adjust our product assortment.","Overall, we feel good about our U.S. Retail yogurt improvement this year and we look to continue that improvement in fiscal 2020. Outside U.S. Retail, we generated low single digit net sales growth for yogurt in Convenience Stores & Foodservice channels in Q3, driven by our ParfaitPro product that provides an easy way for operators to prepare on-trend offerings, like coffee coolers.","We also like the way we\u2019re competing across many important regional businesses this year. In the U.S., Pillsbury refrigerated baked goods had a strong key baking season with retail sales up 2% year-to-date and 3% on the latest quarter, fueled by our Made at Home media campaign and strong innovation like our new Sweet Hawaiian biscuits and crescent rolls.","In Convenience Stores & Foodservice, year-to-date net sales in the frozen baked goods platform were up mid single digits, driven by expansion of our frozen product line, including cinnamon rolls, cookies and puff pastries across all their channels.","Totino\u2019s hot snacks retail sales were up 5% through nine months, driven by a fully integrated videogame partnership campaign and our expansion of value size offerings. And we continue to generate excellent growth on Wanchai Ferry in China. With retail sales up 7% so far this year, due to strong activation on the core, innovation and compelling marketing like our New Year\u2019s ritual consumer campaign around the Chinese New Year holiday.","The second component of Growing the Core in fiscal 2019 is increasing growth on our four global accelerate platforms. Global retail sales for Old El Paso were up 3% year-to-date, led by the U.S. where retail sales increased 7%, due to gains in distribution and consumer investment. Our making taco night easy campaign continues to resonate with consumers, and our highly successful in-store Old El Paso taco stand displays will be back in stores beginning in Q4 of this fiscal year.","Our broad portfolio of natural and organic brands resonates with consumers and positions us well to win across categories. Year-to-date retail sales increased 3% with strong growth on Annie\u2019s Mac & Cheese and Fruit Snacks as well as Muir Glen tomatoes, partially offset by decisions we\u2019ve made to eliminate some unsuccessful category expansion volume.","On Annie\u2019s Mac & Cheese, we renovated our classics skews and increased our support behind the business, resulting in double digit gains in distribution and retail sales. In fact, Annie\u2019s is now the number one boxed Mac & Cheese at a number of our customers. We\u2019re also driving solid performance on Annie\u2019s Fruit Snacks behind our new Sour Bunnies innovation. And we refreshed the packaging on our Muir Glen product line to showcase the premium nature of the products which is translated into double-digit retail sales growth, so far this year.","We continue to see two different trends behind our international and North America snacks bars businesses. International bars growth continued at a strong double digit rates. Europe & Australia is driving retail sales growth with strong in-store execution and distribution gains, resulting in broad-based year-to-date share gains. Innovation has been a key driver of that growth including Nature Valley nut butter biscuit lines, as well as Fiber One popcorn bars and cake bars. In our Asia & Latin America segment, we had another strong quarter. In fact, we\u2019ve doubled net sales and our bars business in Asia this fiscal year. This growth has been driven by the investments we\u2019ve made in distribution expansion, innovation and consumer engagement. Pillsbury branded cookie cakes and pastries in India have been a cornerstone of this growth. And we\u2019re building on that success by partnering with the Indian Premier League Cricket in Q4 with an exciting line-up of in-store, on pack and consumer promotions that feature some of the biggest names in sport just in time to kick off the season, this coming weekend.","Retail sales for our U.S. snack bar business were down mid-single-digits year-to-date and we continue to work to improve our trends in this important platform. On Nature Valley, we are focused on improving the fundamentals and are looking forward to the launch of a new crispy creamy wafer bar that will start shipping in the fourth quarter. Our Fiber One bar performance in the U.S. has remained challenged. As we mentioned on our Q2 call, we expect declines in the near-term as we cycle through distribution losses, especially on tail SKUs. ","Looking ahead to the next fiscal year, we have plans to renovate the Fiber One product line to increase its relevance with weight management consumers. On a positive note, a lot of our retail sales were up high-single-digits through the first nine months of the year behind expanded distribution, innovation and brand support. And protein one performance continued to strengthen as we\u2019ve tapped into consumer need for on-the-go great tasting snack bars with high protein and low sugar. On H\u00e4agen-Dazs, our final accelerate platform, retail sales through the first nine months of the year were up 12% led by double-digit growth in Europe, driven by a mini cup expansion in the UK and peanut butter innovation in both pints and sticks.","Now, let\u2019s move to the second priority this year, successfully transitioning Blue Buffalo into the General Mills family. We feel great about the progress we\u2019re making here and we\u2019re incredibly optimistic about the future of Blue, as we\u2019re still in the early innings of the pet food category\u2019s transformation toward wholesome natural products. We remain on track to deliver double-digit top and bottom-line growth from Blue Buffalo in fiscal 2019. Our FDM expansion is currently underway and is progressing as expected. I\u2019ll share more details on this effort in a moment. And we expect to see significant margin expansion for Blue Buffalo in Q4, driven by increased HMM savings, synergies, benefits from strategic revenue management actions we implemented earlier this year and strong product mix, driven by the FDM expansion.","While Blue Buffalo\u2019s quarterly net sales results have varied this year, driven by the timing of our channel expansion, we\u2019re encouraged the brand continues to win with that pet parents. Aggregate year-to-date sales for Blue were up high-single-digits and we\u2019ve continued to gain market share in the category. From a channel perspective, Blue continues to drive strong performance and share gains in FDM. Through three quarters, Blue retail sales in FDM were up triple digits and we continue to grow and gain share including importantly our first wave of FDM customers where third quarter retail sales were up double digits versus the second quarter. And Pet Specialty year-to-date retail sales for Blue were down double digits, as we expected. This channel remains important for blue and will continue to partner with Pet Specialty customers to bring variety, unique innovation and education to serve pet parents and the channel.","In e-commerce, which makes up roughly 25% of the Blue Buffalo net sales, we saw category retail trends slow in the third quarter. Still, Blue\u2019s retail sales continue to outpace the category, leading to further market share growth. Blue\u2019s year-to-date e-commerce retail sales were up 24% and we continue to see tremendous growth ahead in this channel as more pet parents look for pet food online where Blue is the number one brand.","Slide 32 provides some additional details about our fourth quarter expansion plans for Blue Buffalo. As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re launching Blue into new FDM customers in Q4, which will double the brand\u2019s ACV distribution by the end of the fiscal year. In addition, we\u2019re taking Blue\u2019s second largest product line Wilderness and making it available to FDM customers for the first time, starting in March. The success we\u2019ve seen with the Life Protection Formula line in FDM over the last 18 months has meant that Wilderness is being added incrementally across our FDM customer base. We expect a combination of launch of Wilderness and FDM and the expansion of Blue into new FDM accounts will result in sales growth of more than 30% in the fourth quarter.","In addition to growing our core and transitioning Blue Buffalo, we continue to have a good line of sight to achieving our third priority, delivering our financial commitments. The combination of significant COGS HMM savings, increased price mix from our strategic revenue management efforts, strong cost and capital discipline and continued improvement in our core working capital are translating to EPS and cash flow expectations that are ahead of our initial guidance from last July.","I\u2019ll close our prepared remarks this morning by reiterating today\u2019s key messages. We delivered strong third quarter and with solid execution leading to positive organic sales growth and with significant margin expansion. We\u2019re doing what we said we do this year and we\u2019re on track to meet or exceed all of our fiscal 2019 financial targets. And our results increase our confidence in our consumer first strategy and our global growth priorities and reinforce our view that our balanced approach to top and bottom-line growth is the right model to drive long-term value for General Mills shareholders.","With that, let\u2019s open the line for questions. Operator, can you please get us started?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed. ","Andrew Lazar","Good morning, everybody.","Jeff Harmening","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Lazar","Hi. Don, just a quick one for you. Just kind of back of the envelope math, it would seem that sort of pricing in North America Retail maybe because it could have accounted for maybe roughly one half of the base business gross margin expansion that the Company saw in fiscal 3Q, does it seem broadly sort of right to you? And I think at the CAGNY you\u2019d said that maybe a higher portion of pricing moving forward would be of a more of the list price variety. And is that playing out sort of broadly as you expected, including your thoughts on elasticity to volume? Thank you.","Don Mulligan","Sure, yes. As we -- we\u2019re delivering on the second half drivers that we outlined in our Q2 call and that we reiterated at CAGNY, and it\u2019s a combination of things, Andrew. It\u2019s increased HMM savings. We said global sourcing will continue to drive higher benefit to us. We\u2019re seeing that come through. It is the positive price mix that you referenced. We saw an uptick from 2% to 3% in the quarter, continued strong cost controls across SG&A and increase to contribution from the higher margin Blue Buffalo business. So, all of those came through, as we expected in the quarter. And I wouldn\u2019t necessarily put one out there kind of equally weighted, I wouldn\u2019t pull one out as a particular driver but they all benefited our margin and they all came through largely as we expected.","Andrew Lazar","And then, elasticity, is that generally -- I think, it was -- in North America Retail it was positive 2% price mix, negative 2% volume. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s roughly in line with how you expected it to play out, or as improvements in yogurt and snack bars continue maybe that elasticity looks even a little less onerous as we go forward?","Don Mulligan","Well, I\u2019ll let Jon maybe speak to what we\u2019re seeing in the market. But, if you look at our third quarter for North America Retail versus the first half, price mix was -- contributed 2 points again, but volume growth was 2 points better. There was some strengthening of the volume while we held our price contribution.","Jon Nudi","Yes. Andrew, I would just say -- I\u2019d say elasticities are playing out as we expected. And remember, obviously we did take some [indiscernible]. We are really leveraging the full toolbox of strategic revenue management as well, so, pack price architecture as well mix and promotional optimization. So, as you pull each of those levers, they have a different impact to the volume. And I would say our models keep getting better and better, and they\u2019re very much in line results -- our results are in line with what we expected.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","John Baumgartner","For Jeff or Jon, I just wanted to come back to North America Retail, just given the improving Nielsen baseline takeaway and the elasticity that Andrew mentioned. But, I guess, in light of shipments versus takeaway noise in Q4, can you speak to the performance just in light of focus on non-price promo this year? I guess, to what extent are you seeing improvement in terms of shelf stays or quality merchandise, again? I guess, what metrics should we be looking at in gauging the conversion of those efforts going forward?","Jeff Harmening","Yes. Just generally, I guess, as we look at our business, I mean we feel like the fundamentals continue to get better. So, as we think about SRM outside of [car lot] [ph], again I think that\u2019s driving several of our businesses and big businesses at that. And again, as we make some of those moves, I think the distribution is playing out as well. So, as we look holistically at our business, new products are working really hard for us. And that\u2019s driving our business, which we feel really good about. SRM is playing out the way that we hoped as well.","And then, the middle of the P&L HMM is really delivering too. So, as we look across our businesses, we like the momentum, the top-line, like the middle of the P&L. And again things seem to be playing out as we expected. And importantly, again, I think, we\u2019re looking for consistency moving forward. And we think that we\u2019ve got a business model now that will drive consistent top-line, performance across the business and make sure we deliver on the bottom-line as well.","John Baumgartner","And then, Jon, just on the cereal business, when -- I mean, you outperformed the category in the quarter. How do we think about shipments versus takeaway in Q4? And then, the category itself has softened in terms of volumes. How much of that are you seeing from your increased substitution from your QSR breakfast or frozen breakfast versus just something more just kind of transitory in nature?","Jon Nudi","So, John, maybe I\u2019ll start with just the question about shipments versus takeaway. So, for Q3, our RNS was ahead of our takeaway by a couple of points. If you remember back to Q2, it was actually the opposite. So, for the year, our takeaway is actually very much in line with the reported net sales, and that\u2019s in line with what we\u2019re seeing across the segment as well. So, there\u2019s really nothing notable from an inventory standpoint. We actually were encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing in the category. So, Q3, we saw the best category performance we\u2019ve seen and several years down only a half point. There\u2019s a lot happening underneath the category in terms of pack price architecture, both from ourselves, as well as some of our competitors. But, if you look at underlying pull-through and the way that consumers are responding to innovation as well as our marketing, we\u2019re actually quite encouraged about the category and very encouraged about our business, which is performing much better than it has over the last several years.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JP Morgan. Please proceed.","Ken Goldman","Thank you. Good morning. Two for me if I can. First, there\u2019s a few areas of the business that I think, it\u2019s fair to say, are not working quite as well as you\u2019d like. I think you mentioned U.S. Snacks, H\u00e4agen-Dazs Japan, I think in the press release, you talked about France, and maybe Yoplait in France and I\u2019m not sure which categories in France, but Yoplait across Europe and Australia, maybe. Can you just give us a little bit of idea of when you expect some of those businesses to turn around, which ones you think will be maybe a little less onerous in terms of turning around? And then, I guess, that leads to my next question, which is typically on your third quarter, give at least some, what I would call, soft commentary on the out years, is there anything that you can provide right now as we look into fiscal 2020 that\u2019s helpful? Not necessarily quantitatively, but just in terms of headwinds or tailwinds we should be thinking of as we think about modeling into next year.","Jeff Harmening","Let me take the first part of that question and I\u2019ll hand it over to Jon Nudi for maybe some additional commentary on U.S. Snacks and then Don maybe can handle the second piece. On the growth for the year, first, I would say, our growth is largely played out as expected, and even for the low end of our guidance range on sales, I mean it\u2019s a pretty narrow range to begin with. I mean, it\u2019s a 1 point range from flat to up 1%. So, we feel like we\u2019re in the range of what we thought at the beginning of the year. As you mentioned, it\u2019s true, there are give and takes every year to where your volume is going to be. And so, yes, it\u2019s been a tougher year in France, particularly on yogurt but really in France with inflation on ingredients and difficulty in achieving price gains. But, that\u2019s been offset by a really good year for us in the UK, where we\u2019re leading the growth of all food manufacturers in the UK. Obviously, the same thing in U.S. Retail where it\u2019s been a little tougher in Canada but our meals and baking business has done really well. And we talked about Pillsbury earlier this year, but also Totino\u2019s and Old El Paso, and we\u2019ve been as pleased with that as we have other things. So, they\u2019re always offsets like those. The one that really we feel like we need to do better on and we can do better on really starting next fiscal year is going to be our U.S. Snacks business. And I\u2019ll let Jon talk a couple points on that.","Jon Nudi","Yes. So, Ken, Jeff mentioned this upfront, as we look at our business, really two brands are challenges for us. Fiber One I would say is more structural, as modern weight managers are really looking at four different macros and the products that fit their diet. So, as Jeff mentioned, we are renovating Fiber One and actually quite excited about the product that we\u2019re going to roll out in Q1 -- Q1 of fiscal 2020, and we\u2019ll share more on that as we get closer.","Nature Valley, I would tell you, actually we feel generally good about the underlying health of that business. The biggest driver of our underperformance this year has really been innovation. And if you look historically, Nature Valley has really been driven by broad-based innovation that hits on really broad need states. This past year, the need states we went after were a bit more narrow and a bit more niche in terms of the areas we focused on, and the results are much smaller as a result. As we look to next year, we\u2019ve got a great new product coming out actually in Q4 of this year, which is a crispy creamy wafer bars. We\u2019re really excited about that. The retailer response to it has been quite good and our consumer testing looks very positive as well.","And then, we will have some more news in the back half of fiscal 2020 as well in Nature Valley. So, I do believe you\u2019ll see Nature Valley trends improve as we move into fiscal 2020. And again, Fiber One has some big news coming there. But, we\u2019ve got some significant work to do on Fiber One.","Don Mulligan","Ken, anything forward-looking out of -- beyond F19, we typically don\u2019t give guidance and we\u2019re not going to this year until June. But I\u2019ll tell you, as Jeff alluded to at the beginning of our call, we\u2019re very pleased with the execution that we\u2019re seeing this year, and we can certainly expect that to continue to strengthen as we move into next year.","Ken Goldman","Thank you, everyone.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi. Please proceed. ","David Driscoll","I wanted to ask a couple of Pet questions. So, on the Wilderness brands, it\u2019s significant news that you\u2019re going to be taking it from exclusive to specialty to moving it into FDM. When you did this with Life Protection, there was a very kind of methodical, progressive rollout of Life Protection throughout the food and mass channels. Will the Wilderness rollout be similar, both in the pacing of how you roll it out to different retailers and in the size of the rollout? Would you expect to get a significant amount of shelf space that\u2019s incremental to what you currently have with the Life Protection in the food and mass channels?","Jeff Harmening","David, let me try to take those kind of one at a time. I hope I hit on all the things you asked, maybe even a little bit more. Just for context, we launched the Life Protection Formula 18 months ago and now we\u2019re launching Wilderness in the FDM. And in the Pet Specialty channel, Wilderness is roughly 40% of our sales. It\u2019s almost as big as the Life Protection Formula brand itself. So, this launching of Wilderness into food, drug and mass is not a small endeavor; it\u2019s a big endeavor, and it\u2019s a big endeavor from a logistical standpoint, but also what it can do for our sales, which is one of the reasons we\u2019re confident we can grow at 30% plus in the fourth quarter.","I mentioned in my comments, which might seem like a throwaway. But, the fact we\u2019re performing well on FDM is really important, and because as we bring in Wilderness, we\u2019re seeing the Wilderness launch being highly incremental to our assortment and our current customer base to Life Protection Formula, because they see the growth that Blue Buffalo has driven for them in a category so far and they know what the importance of the Wilderness brand.","In terms of -- we\u2019ll certainly be thoughtful about how we expand Wilderness. But, one of the benefits I think of the General Mills brings to Blue Buffalo businesses is being able to get into more customers faster. And so, while we\u2019d be thoughtful about where we bring in Wilderness, you\u2019ll see the ACV on Wilderness expand a lot more quickly than we did on -- than we do on Life Protection Formula, and that\u2019s because we\u2019re less thoughtful. It\u2019s just because we have greater capability with the combined Blue Buffalo and General Mills than we did before.","And I will also add for a bonus that we said we\u2019d get up to ACV of 65% by the end of April. I can tell you at the end of February we\u2019re already 58%. So, we are a long way to our goal already, gaining about 22 points of distribution in month of February alone on Blue Buffalo. And I think this just shows what the combination of Blue Buffalo and General Mills can achieve.","David Driscoll","Okay. And then, I just have about two more related questions on this. The first one is just that when you do the Wilderness move, is there anything kind of extra special that you\u2019re doing for these Pet Specialty retailers to ease the pain of taking this from exclusive to Pet Specialty and moving it into FDM? And then, to Don, on this stuff, like in the fourth quarter, I think our math is working out -- and I really just want to check the math here, that we\u2019ve got to get double-digit profit growth in Blue ex inventory change, we have to have like fourth quarter Blue Buffalo profitability at like $120 million and that\u2019s like double last year\u2019s numbers, such you expect a big jump. I just want to make sure that we\u2019re not making a mistake this morning on the mathematics? Thank you, guys.","Jeff Harmening","Well, on -- look, David, the important -- the Pet Specialty channel is really important to us. And just like the natural and organic channel was, we rolled out Annie\u2019s and L\u00e4rabar and things like that. And we\u2019ve already had lots of discussions with our pet retail -- our Pet Specialty customers about what we can do for them. There are a lot of things we can do for them that are differentiated we do with other customers. And, pet grooming would be one example and tying that to pet food sales. And so, whether it\u2019s through promotions or whether it\u2019s through unique innovation or whether it\u2019s through pet detectives and having people on the floor, there are a lot of things we can do to drive sales in Pet Specialty. And we\u2019re actively working with our big customers to make sure that we can do that because we want to make sure that Blue Buffalo is successful and available to pet parents, no matter where they shop.","Don Mulligan","And David, on the profit growth, we do have significant profit growth and we expect to see significant profit growth in the fourth quarter. It\u2019s going to be leveraging the 30 plus percent sales growth that Jeff alluded to. One thing I wanted to make sure you capture is the impact of the purchase accounting in the quarter as well because we don\u2019t have to quite double our sales growth to -- or our profit growth, excuse me, to get to our number for the full year. ","Jeff Siemon","David, this is Jeff Siemon. I think, remember, our double digit profit growth for the full year is excluding purchase accounting charges. So, I would -- that is -- that will be roughly 65 to 70 million of total purchase accounting charges for the year. So, we said, we\u2019d grow double digit excluding those impacts.","Jeff Harmening","Very strong double digit growth.","Jeff Siemon","That\u2019s right.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Steve Strycula with UBS. Please proceed. ","Steve Strycula","Hi. Good morning. Question for Jeff. So, we\u2019ve heard some noise that a large U.S. e-commerce etailer is pushing CPG manufacturers more to a third-party marketplace system versus first-party. For investors on the line, how do we think about the context of what this might mean for General Mills in terms of impacting business dynamics? And ultimately, how do we think about what the margin economics might be directionally for a third-party system relative to first-party system? Thank you.","Jeff Harmening","Yes, the -- first, I will let specific retailers talk about their business specifically. I think, it\u2019s better that they talk about than we do. I\u2019m not sure I see the same trend that you talk about. But, I think importantly for e-commerce in food, I think there are couple of important things to remember. In food, maybe unlike some other categories, I think there got to be a lot of winners in e-commerce with regard to food, it\u2019s not going to just be one pure play who\u2019s going win in food. I see the strengthening of quite a number of our traditional retail customers, and whether that is through delivery or click and collect. I think, the playing field on for e-commerce is going to be kind of wide open. I think, there\u2019re going to be multiple winners, not just one.","The second, I would say that we\u2019re well-positioned in e-commerce and our sales are up more than 50% this year. And I mean, everybody can quote big numbers in e-commerce because it\u2019s growing rapidly. But, I think as important as the fact we\u2019re up 30% is that we over-index in the customers where we are in e-commerce, there are bricks and mortar. And that\u2019s because of the strength of our brands. And whether that is Cheerios or Nature Valley or Yoplait or Blue Buffalo, the reason that we over index, for me is because we\u2019ve got great brands and great brands travel across channels. And so, we think the economics for us and e-commerce are going to be good. And where -- our goal is to win across our customers, because there are certainly going to be more than one winner in e-commerce and food.","Steve Strycula","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, a quick follow-up to that. If I heard you correctly on your prepared remarks, you said that for blue Buffalo\u2019s e-commerce business, it is still growing solid double digits, but it may be slowed a bit sequentially. Was that more of a transitory issue, something that\u2019s happening in the supply chain, or should we just think that we\u2019re growing on top of very large numbers already, and that\u2019s the natural cadence of the business?","Jeff Harmening","Yes. That\u2019s a good question. I think, the key for -- we talk about e-commerce and Blue Buffalo is that the category for e-commerce and pet food slowed in the third quarter. Blue Buffalo is still gaining share, we\u2019re still growing double-digits. But, our growth slowed primarily because the category slowed, but within that context we\u2019re doing well. And the question is, do I think that e-commerce is going to be transitory? And I don\u2019t -- I think e-commerce may pick-up again in Pet, especially as we roll out across food, drug and mass. Because if you think about the places where we are and the place of where Blue Buffalo is going, there is certainly a strong e-commerce business and developing e-commerce business and food, drug and mass. And I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if that in the coming quarters e-commerce growth picked up again in Pet due to the rollout of e-commerce capabilities across our FDM customers.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.","Rob Dickerson","So, two questions, one on Pet and then just one on kind of margin expectation progression as we think into next year, and given a little nuances in Q3 and Q4 this year. So, I guess, one on Pet is just -- I think we heard at CAGNY from you, expectation was the mass distribution gains shouldn\u2019t be margin dilutive; entering mass, obviously, was Wilderness now. So, as we think through getting to Q4, right, where they sell in, but then really into 2020 where we need to have the velocities obviously turn, so you can sustain the product on the shelf. I\u2019m just curious, can give just kind of brief overview as to what the strategy really is at, let\u2019s say, one large mass customer to increase the buyer base above, incrementally, not just share shift between channels but kind of wide more people should be buying Blue Buffalo, because it\u2019s offered in more locations versus just shifting their purchase destination? That\u2019s first. Thanks.","Jeff Harmening","Well, no, I think it\u2019s a fair question. I think, I talked a little bit about this at CAGNY. So, if I\u2019m repeating myself, I apologize. But, the most important thing as you look at is household penetration and what\u2019s going on in the household penetration. And as we\u2019ve expanded, Blue Buffalo across channels, our household penetration continues to rise. And so, now, it\u2019s north of 35%, I think household penetration, which is about maybe threefold from where it was a year ago. Jeff can check me on that math and get back to you. But, it\u2019s up quite significantly. I think that is actually the key because as we\u2019ve expanded distribution we brought in more household, more pet parents, where they sell it. And so, I think the evidence is actually already there that as we\u2019ve expanded across channels we\u2019ve grown household penetration and not just cannibalized our own sales.","The second thing, and this is consistent with what we\u2019ve seen before on things like Annie and L\u00e4rabar and EPIC. And so, I know that this maybe a surprise to some, it\u2019s actually not surprising to us and following a very familiar pattern what we\u2019ve seen on other natural and organic businesses.","The second point you raised is important, and that\u2019s about how are we turning where we currently are. And that\u2019s why I mentioned the first four customers we\u2019ve been at year, how are we doing. I mean, our turns are really good. And as evidenced by the fact that our Q3 business is up double-digits where it was in Q2 and because when we bring in the Wilderness, it\u2019s going to be incremental. And the only reason it\u2019s going to be incremental is because what we have there right now is turning well. And so, that\u2019s really the key. That\u2019s behind -- the reason for that is because Blue Buffalo is a really good brand and Billy Bishop and his team have done a nice job with in-store signage and display but also really good advertising and marketing campaigns. And so, they have built a great brand, which we\u2019re capitalizing on. And so, the key is, we expanded it to make sure that not only we\u2019re growing distribution which we are but our turns are doing well. And look, even places where we\u2019re -- our business is down, I mentioned Pet Specialty we\u2019re down double digits, our turns are actually pretty good. It\u2019s the fact that we\u2019ve actually lost some distribution. So, our business is still turning at these places. So, we just have less distribution than we were before. I think, that\u2019s encouraging and it\u2019s one of the reasons why eventually our plan is to get back in the game with Pet Specialty because the terms of Blue Buffalo in those places are actually pretty good. It\u2019s just our distribution is down. So, that\u2019s really the -- we feel confident about. As we roll out the Blue Buffalo, we\u2019ll continue to gain pet parents, which is just a household penetration and that our sales will be incremental because that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen to-date.","Rob Dickerson","And then, just quickly, as we think about fiscal 2020, I know you\u2019re not giving guidance, but I\u2019m just curious, obviously, Q3 margin did a lot better than people expected I think on average. Q4 there is a little give back, just given the timing of shipments relative to takeaway and incentive comp, et cetera. But it seems like the core drivers of just better margin or stabilized margin at least into next year, which should be pricing, saving synergies, and then, mix, partially on North America business in Cereal and also partially just given the Buff. Seems like those were still sustainable, right? I mean, if we are thinking into next year, is there anything in each of those three buckets that really would change or do they just stay as the drivers of stabilized or improving margin? Thanks.","Don Mulligan","I think, firstly kind of Ground on this year, as you alluded to, we came in where we know was well ahead of where the consensus was, but frankly versus our own internal expectations, Q3 was a bit stronger on the margins, but not materially stronger. We had a bit better gross margins because our plant performance was stronger. We had a bit better operating margins because of that and because of good cost controls. And EPS came in a little bit better on top of that because of tax rate was a little bit better. So we had some improvement in the middle of the P&L, and down through tax rate, and that\u2019s would flowed through to our new guidance for this year, but it was little bit better than we expected, but not as outsized, as certainly maybe what\u2019s compared to the Street.","As you mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we see tougher comps. Our gross margin was at a high point last year, it grew in the quarter last year, so we\u2019re lapping that. And as you mentioned incentive, and as I said in the call, we have higher brand investments in the quarter. So for the full year, we expect our margins to be a bit better, our operating margins to be a bit better than where we started the year. And in our most recent guidance, we think they will be flat to slightly down, which is a bit stronger than what we thought a quarter ago. As we look to next year, our focus is going to be on staying very balanced. We want to make sure we have a mix of top line growth and margin expansion. We are not going to lean strongly in one way to the other. We know we have to deliver a balanced year to have sustainable model and that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to be focused on as we build the year. The factors you mentioned in terms of pricing, strong HMM, the added benefit of Blue Buffalo stronger margins should all carry through.","Jeff Harmening","I would build on Don\u2019s point. I\u2019d say, the quarter was better than what was expected externally. That\u2019s fair, and our profit are little bit better. I would broaden the lens, and look at the last year for us. And we had a tough Q3 last year, that\u2019s no surprise or secret, but I really like the way the General Mills team has bounced back from that. And I think you see the strength in execution and it\u2019s not an accident We are really focused on how well we are going to execute, and whether that\u2019s SRM or e-commerce or brand building, how we forecast the business and there is no reason to think our ability to execute well is going to diminish next year. And that\u2019s I think what allowed us to deliver on our commitments this year, is that, we have, we\u2019ve delivered on the core what we said and we\u2019ve delivered on Blue Buffalo what we\u2019ve committed and that end is what we looking for as a Company and so there\u2019s no reason to think that that won\u2019t diminish. At the same time, I mean, while we feel good that we\u2019ve executed well and our performance has improved and we feel good about that, there is still more work to be done and we\u2019re not yet to a sustainable top line and bottom line model, where our shareholder return has a flywheel that we expect of ourselves over the long term and that hopefully you expect out of us. And so we\u2019re not going to give specific guidance for F 2020, but I can tell you our goal is going to continue to work toward getting closer to that sustainable model, that\u2019s going to continue to build value for shareholders and we\u2019ve taken one step this year. And we are, I would say, pleased, but not yet satisfied and we\u2019re pleased with what we\u2019ve done, but we\u2019ve got more work to do, and we\u2019re going about the business of doing that.","Operator","The next question comes from line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Robert Moskow","So, the inventory has shifted around a lot this year and you\u2019re not alone. There are several other packaged food companies that had inventory builds in January. And so I\u2019m asking Jon Nudi, have you had any conversations with big retailers as to whether their inventory strategy has changed at all? It seems like every year they are working hard to try to reduce those levels, but as you plan the business going forward, do you think we\u2019re at a sustainably higher level that\u2019s appropriate for the business or do you think that it makes sense to continue to expect over the year? [Ph] Thanks.","Jon Nudi","If you think about our retail partners, just like us, continue to stay focused on working capital, and I think leveraging technology and processes and systems to improve working capital. So, we would expect them to continue to get better in terms of being able to operating with less inventory. So, that\u2019s our going assumption as we move forward. And I think for the year again you see that. So, our takeaway is about a point better than our reported sales, and I think that\u2019s what we\u2019d expect for Q4 and into 2020.","Robert Moskow","So again, so, you think you lag retail consumption by about a point in fourth quarter, is that right?","Jon Nudi","We do, we do. Yes.","Operator","The next question comes from line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Jason English","Good morning, folks. Congratulations on a strong quarter, and thanks for the question. I\u2019ve got two quick questions, first on the all-in inflation outlook. I know you\u2019re beginning to cycle what was an uptick last year. As you cycle over that, are you seeing your all-in rate of inflation subside? And if so, kind of to what levels are we settling in that?","Don Mulligan","Jason, we still see inflation coming at around 5%. It may be a couple of basis points lower than when we started the year, but we\u2019re still seeing inflation in grains, packaging, other commodities. Logistics from a percentage standpoint is the biggest change. And then we\u2019re seeing higher inflation in our European business, which is trending higher than that 5% full year guidance and we really seeing it in dairy and vanilla. So there hasn\u2019t been a material change to our outlook in inflation. It might be just a touch lower, but still rounding to 5%.","Jason English","And I wanted to touch on your divestment plans. It\u2019s something you\u2019ve announced and intend to pursue over a year, about a year ago now I guess. Why is it taking so long? And while we\u2019re waiting, clearly some M&A multiples have begun to contract in the space, there\u2019s a lot of company shopping assets and your cash flow conversion is rock solid as you point out. Are those dynamics giving you pause and causing you to reconsider whether or not you want to go down that path?","Jeff Harmening","Thanks for the question. I appreciate that, Jason. No, it hasn\u2019t forced us to reconsider whether we want to go down that path. But I think the point you mentioned, we\u2019ll only go down that path if it makes -- to the extent it makes sense for General Mills\u2019 shareholders, as it did when we exited Argentina this last quarter. And so, I would reiterate, we are not doing divestitures, which is roughly about -- we think roughly about 5% of our portfolio. We are not doing it, because we need to generate the cash. We are clearly already doing that. We\u2019re doing it because we believe that by divesting some businesses that are slower growing, will not only help improve our organic growth rate, but also help our improved focus on some of the businesses that are going to be really important for us to invest in. So it hasn\u2019t really changed. What\u2019s changed on the timing and I know it can seem slow and -- but for me, I would call it thoughtful and that is that coming into this year, especially after our Q3 last year, we said, we better execute well on our core business and transition Blue Buffalo effectively. And if we do that, we think that shareholders will reward us and that feels to be like is the case. And that whether we do divestitures or not, people are going to look back on our core and look on to whether we\u2019re transitioning Blue Buffalo successfully. And we feel like we\u2019re on the path to doing both of those.","And so our attention certainly is still on divestitures and looking at what we would do from that standpoint. And so, it hasn\u2019t been anything other than that. We felt like we had a job to do, and we feel like we\u2019re well on our way to doing that. And so we\u2019ll continue to evaluate divestitures and we\u2019ll do it if we think it makes long-term sense for General Mills shareholders. And if it doesn\u2019t, then we\u2019ll come back and tell you that it doesn\u2019t. But for now, that\u2019s still our plan.","Jeff Siemon","All right. It looks like we\u2019ve hit the bottom of the hour here. So, I think we\u2019ll go ahead and cut it off. I know there is a number of people we haven\u2019t gotten to, and my apologies for that. But, I\u2019ll be available all day for additional questions. Thanks everyone for your time and attention this morning and have a wonderful day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, June 25, 2014.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Kris Wenker, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Kristen S. Wenker","","Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone. I\u2019m here with Ken Powell, our Chairman and CEO; and Don Mulligan, our CFO, and I\u2019ll turn the microphone over to them in just a minute. First, I got to cover my usual housekeeping items. Our press release was issued over the wire services earlier this morning. It\u2019s also posted on our Web site, if you need a copy. You can also find slides on our Web site that supplement our remarks this morning and our remarks will include forward-looking statements that are based on management\u2019s current views and assumption. The second slide in the presentation lists factors that could cause our future results to be different than our current estimates.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Don.","Donal L. Mulligan","","Thanks, Kris and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Our plans for fiscal 2014 call for sales and earnings growth consistent with our long-term business model, along with increased cash returns to shareholders. As we\u2019ll discuss today, we made good progress building our worldwide food businesses, and we returned more than $2.7 billion in cash to shareholders through a 17% dividend increase and significant share repurchase activity. But, our sales and operating profit performance in 2014 was disappointing.","In the fourth quarter, promotional spending in developed markets was less effective than we planned and input cost inflation was a bit above our forecast. Net sales and adjusted gross margin fell short of our targets.","Our fourth quarter results are summarized on Slide 5. Net sales totaled $4.3 billion, down 3% versus last year. On a constant-currency basis, net sales were down 1%. Adjusted segment operating profit, which excludes a charge associated with Venezuelan currency devaluation, totaled $733 million essentially even with year ago results.","Net earnings and diluted earnings per share were both up double-digits as reported. As we indicated on the third quarter call a significantly lower tax rate and lower shares outstanding were strong contributors to EPS growth in the final quarter.","Our reported results also include a $0.09 per share charge for the Venezuelan currency devaluation, a $0.06 per share gain on the sale of several Idaho grain elevators and a $0.01 gain for mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions. Adjusted diluted EPS which excludes these and certain other items affecting comparability, increased 24% to $0.67 per share.","Slide 6, use of the components of our fourth quarter net sales growth. Foreign exchange reduced sales growth by two points. Pound volume was 2% below last year levels. And sales mix and net price realization added one point to sales growth.","Slide 7, shows fourth quarter net sales results by segment. For U.S. Retail, net sales declined 1% overall. Pound volume for U.S. Retail grew by 1%. This was offset by negative price and mix.","International segment net sales declined 7% as reported and 2% on a constant currency basis. Pound volume declined 6% from last year\u2019s levels, which included one extra month of results for Europe and Australia. Price and mix added 4 points to the segment\u2019s net sales growth.","Net sales for our convenience stores and food service segment, grew 1% overall in the quarter, with pound volume essentially matching year ago levels. However, looking at just our six priority platforms, which are snacks, cereal, yoghurt mixes, biscuits and frozen breakfast, combined net sales grew 5%.","On Slide 8, you can see that adjusted gross margin, showed a slight decline in the fourth quarter. This primarily reflects lower net sales and higher input cost inflation than anticipated in the quarter. For 2014 in total adjusted gross margin was down 80 basis points to 35.4%, reflecting the change in business mix with incremental months results for new businesses added in 2013, as well as higher input costs. Our input cost inflation for the full year totaled 4%, higher than we planned, primarily driven by dairy costs.","Our full year results are summarized on Slide 9. Net sales for 2014 grew 1% to reach $17.9 billion. On a constant currency basis, net sales increased 2%. Adjusted segment operating profit fell 2% to $3.2 billion. Net earnings attributable to General Mills, totaled more than $1.8 billion and diluted earnings per share were $2.83. Adjusted diluted EPS grew 4% to reach $2.82. U.S Retail net sales in 2014 essentially matched prior year results at $10.6 billion and operating profit decreased 3% to $2.3 billion.","Slide 10 shows you the sales results by division. Snacks, Small Planet Foods and Big G cereals led performance for this operating segment. For convenience stores and food service net sales declined 2% in 2014, driven by a 2% decline in pound volume. Operating profit for the segment was also down 2% to $307 million.","Net sales performance was essentially in line with our plan, reflecting our ongoing strategy of focusing business mix on key product platforms and the most resilient customer channels. Net sales for our six priority platforms grew 4% for the full year.","2014 net sales for our international business segment totaled $5.4 billion, up 4% as reported and up 8% in constant currency. Adjusted segment operating profit grew 4% to $535 million and increased 10% in constant currency.","On Slide 12, you can see international constant currency net sales rose in three of our four geographic regions. Sales in the Europe and Australasia region declined 4% to $2.2 billion reflecting the comparison against 13 months of results in fiscal 2013.","Canada sales totaled $1.2 billion, up 5% in constant currency. This reflects low single-digit growth in base business net sales and three incremental months of Yoplait.","Latin America sales crossed the $1 billion threshold was strong growth and the base business and a full year of Yoki reported results. And in Asia Pacific region constant currency sales grew 9% to exceed $980 million driven by another year of double-digit growth in Greater China.","Slide 13, summarizes 2014 joint venture performance. On a constant currency basis net sales for Cereal Partners Worldwide were flat and Haagen-Dazs Japan sales grew 9%. After tax earnings from joint ventures, total of $90 million, a decline of 4% in constant currency reflecting increased consumer spending at CPW.","Turning to the balance sheet, Slide 14 shows the components of core working capital. We continue to make solid progress in this area, with core working capital down 9% in fiscal 2014. Since fiscal 2011 we reduced core working capital by 19% while growing net sales by 20%.","Cash flow from operations totaled $2.5 billion for the year, compared to $2.9 billion last year. This decline primarily reflects a decrease in other current liabilities due to year-over-year differences and accruals for trade promotion and income tax.","Fixed asset investments totaled $664 million for the year resulting in free cash flow of $1.9 billion. We return more than $2.7 billion of cash to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends in fiscal 2014. Dividends per share increased by 17%, the current annualized rate of $1.64 per share represents a yield of 3% at recent prices for GIS stock.","We have a strong track record of returning cash to shareholders. In recent years, our dividends per share have increased at a 13% compound rate, and our average shares outstanding have declined 1% per year, that\u2019s despite causing briefly on share repurchases to fund the strategic acquisitions of Yoplait and Yoki.","Fiscal 2014 was a good year for General Mills\u2019 shareholders. A combination of share price appreciation and dividends resulted in a 13% total return for the year. That\u2019s some of the very tough returns generated by our peer group, and it\u2019s consistent with our goal of delivering double-digit shareholder returns.","Let\u2019s now shift to fiscal 2015. General Mills now generates 35% of our sales and a meaningful share of our profit outside the U.S. And we expect this international waiting to grow in the years ahead. So, we\u2019re transitioning to providing our guidance to you in constant currency.","Slide 19, summarizes some of the key assumptions we build into our fiscal 2015 growth plans. We believe it\u2019s prudent to assume food and beverage industry growth in developed markets improves at a very modest pace over the course of the year.","Our fiscal 2015 includes a 53rd week, which is where it\u2019s roughly two points of top line growth. We are targeting mid single-digit, constant currency net sales growth including that extra week. We\u2019ll continue to generate cost savings and reinvestment funds to our robust pipeline of HMM issues. This business discipline has been our first line of defense against input cost inflation for many years.","In fiscal 2015, we are targeting more than $400 million in COGS in HMM alone. This should offset inflation, which we estimate at 3% this year. We are targeting mid single-digit constant currency growth in segment operating profit. We plan to reinvest the profit benefit of the 53rd week to support increased media spending and start-up expenses related to several key fiscal 2016 product launches. One example of the start-up expenses for our new Yoplait factory in China.","Finally, we are beginning to work a new cost reduction initiatives designed to boost our efficiency and sharpen business focus behind our key growth strategies. We began a formal review of our North American manufacturing and distribution network, with the goals of streamlining operations and identifying potential capacity reductions.","We\u2019ve initiated efforts focused on further reducing overhead costs. Together these new initiatives are targeted to generate $40 million in free tax savings in fiscal 2015, with additional savings in fiscal 2016. We\u2019ll share more details with you in the coming months as we determine our specific action plans.","Let me say a quick word about pension expense. We continue to include pension expense in our reported results. In fiscal 2014, the return on our planned assets was 15% in the overall funded status at the end of the year was 100%. Our fiscal 2015 pension expense will be down modestly versus last year driven by our actual asset returns. The discovery for fiscal 2015 is unchanged from last year at 4.5%.","Slide 21 provides a summary of our guidance for 2015. We\u2019re targeting mid-single digit sales growth in constant currency. Adjusted gross margin is projected to improve modestly from 2014 levels. We expect our media investment to grow faster than sales. We project our segment operating profit will grow at a mid single-digit growth on a constant currency basis.","Our plan assumes a high single-digit increase in interest expense, reflecting a shift to more long-term debt and our expectation of rising interest rates over the course of the year.","We\u2019re assuming adjusted tax rate comparable to last year\u2019s 32.2%. We expect joint venture earnings to grow at a high single-digit rate in constant currency due primarily to sales growth and lower levels of input cost inflation for CPW.","We plan to continue returning cash to shareholders through share buybacks. In May, our Board approved a new 100 million share repurchase authorization with no expiration. For fiscal 2015, we are targeting a 3% to 4% net reduction in average shares outstanding. And we expect high single-digit constant currency growth and adjusted diluted earnings per share. At current exchange rates, we\u2019d estimate a three set headwind to full year adjusted diluted EPS growth in 2015.","One other guidance note. We expect our first quarter adjusted diluted EPS to be below year ago levels. That primarily reflects our plans for increased merchandising expense with a higher number of new product launches in the period along with tax rate phasing. We\u2019re excited about our operating plans for 2015. We plan to deliver consumer-focused renovation, product news and innovation across all elements of our portfolio.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ken, who will share our planned highlights across each of our segments. Ken?","Kendall J. Powell","","Okay. Well, thank you, Don and good morning to one and all. As we move into fiscal 2015, our number one priority is to accelerate top line growth. We\u2019ll do that by sharpening our consumer first mindset with particular focus on four growing consumer groups: the growing middle class in emerging markets, U.S. multicultural families, Millennials and consumers over age 55. With these growing consumer groups and our broad portfolio there are plenty of growth opportunities and our plan is to go out and get them.","In U.S. Retail we expect mid single-digit growth in net sales for 2015, including the benefit from the 53rd week. We expect segment operating profit will grow roughly in line with sales, with benefits coming from top line growth, HMM and new cost reduction efforts, partially offset by investments in product innovation and advertising.","We\u2019ve made several leadership changes in this business as we start the New Year. Jeff Harmening became Chief Operating Officer for U.S. Retail as of May 1. David Clark now leads the Yoplait division, changing places with Becky O\u2019Grady who now is in charge of our international H\u00e4agen-Dazs Business Unit. Jon Nudi has moved from our U.S. Snacks division to run our Europe business, prompting some additional moves within our U.S. divisions. You\u2019ll notice some familiar faces in new jobs. The new face is Liz Nordlie who is promoted to President of Small Planet Foods.","I have great confidence in this team. They\u2019ve each established a lengthy resume of results across a wide variety of General Mills\u2019 businesses and I\u2019m enthusiastic about the fresh thinking they are already bringing to the businesses.","So at the risk of stealing a bit of thunder from Jeff\u2019s presentation at our Investor Day in a couple of weeks. Let me share his team\u2019s priorities for 2015. And they are; investing in our cereal business for growth, returning our U.S. yogurt business to growth, accelerating our strong performance in better for you snacking, leveraging the good momentum we have in Totino\u2019s hot snacks, Old El Paso Mexican products and baking products and continuing to foster our strong culture of HMM.","So, let me give you a few details on these priorities beginning with cereal. Sales in the U.S. cereal category declined in fiscal 2014, down 4% in measured outlets. Full category performance was a bit better than that including stronger results in non-measured channels. Our cereal performance has outpaced the category in recent years. Big G net sales grew slightly last year and they are stable since fiscal 2010. We\u2019ve grown cereal market share in three of the past four years and we\u2019ve gained accumulative 20 basis points of share over that time.","The growth plan for Big G in fiscal 2015 begin to it product news and strong advertising support on several large establish brands. We are rolling out some great taste focused renovations more Cinnamon Toast taste and Cinnamon Toast Crunch, new fruitier tasting tricks. And we\u2019ll invest behind some strong new advertising on Lucky Charms and Cheerios. Consumers today are seeking more protein at breakfast and we are responding.","The 2014 launch of Nature Valley protein granola exceeded our expectations. This year we\u2019ll grow distribution and broaden the line with new Peanut butter and dark chocolate Peanut butter varieties. We recently launched a new line of Cascadian Farm protein granolas. These are certified organic choices for consumers. And we\u2019ve brought protein to the leading franchise in the category. New Cheerios protein is available in Cinnamon Almond and oats and honey varieties. Early retailer and consumer response is quite encouraging.","As you know, consumer interest in gluten-free offerings also was growing. Retail sales for the Chex franchise increased by over 6% last year, behind strong consumer messaging and the introduction of Vanilla Chex. This year we are increasing our media spending behind Chex at a double-digit rate. We are also launching a new platform. Gluten-free Chex hot oatmeal.","I know many of you are anxious to see renewed cereal category growth and frankly we are too. We are confident it will happen. This is a category consumers love. In fact, U.S. consumers ranks cereal as a top 10 food and beverage choice in the same list as sandwiches, fruit, coffee and juice. We are very focused on doing our part for the cereal category and growing sales for our cereal brands in 2015.","So, let\u2019s turn to yogurt. Sales for this category grew 6% in the U.S. in 2014, but our overall yogurt sales didn\u2019t grow and that was a disappointment. However, we have our business moving in the right direction. Retail sales of our Greek yogurt grew 41% last year and our share of the Greek segment is now running at 10%.","In addition, our Original Style Yoplait business posted retail sales growth for the full year in 2014, with results strengthening in recent months. In fiscal 2015, we\u2019re expanding our Greek Taste-Off event across the country with sampling in stores nationwide this summer.","We\u2019ll continue to grow our distribution on Greek thanks to the business momentum and some excellent new items, including new flavors of Greek 100 and Yoplait Greek yogurts. We\u2019ll build on Original Style Yoplait positive momentum leveraging a snack-focused advertising message that has all-family appeal.","The big news on Yoplait Light in the first half is the removal of aspartame across the entire line, which will hit shelves in the fall. And we\u2019re modernizing our lineup of flavors including Red Velvet Cupcake and Apricot Mango Sorbet. In addition, we\u2019re bringing a high level of fun to the kid\u2019s yogurt sections with Minions, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Hello Kitty equities. With positive momentum on Greek and Original Style Yoplait and strong plans in place across the business, we believe we will return Yoplait to sales growth in 2015.","For our grain snacks businesses retail sales have grown by 50% since fiscal 2010 and we\u2019ve increased our share from 29% to 41% of the category by leveraging highly differentiated innovation.","In 2015, we\u2019re expanding our successful Fiber One franchise with streusel bars, a great tasting snack that delivers whole grain, real fruit and 20% of your daily value of fiber, all with just 150 calories. We\u2019re targeting Hispanic households with the launch of Nature Valley Fruteria bars, featuring whole grain and visible pieces of fruits in very appealing flavors including strawberry apple and mango strawberry. And we\u2019re introducing great tasting extensions of proven franchises, like coconut almond Nature Valley Protein Bars and blueberry Nature Valley Soft-Baked Oatmeal Squares.","Our natural and organic snack brands enjoyed great results in 2014. L\u00e4rabar retail sales increased by over 30% last year. We\u2019re now launching two new chocolate varieties of L\u00e4rabar ALT protein bars and for the first time we\u2019re extending the L\u00e4rabar brand beyond nutrition bars with the launch of L\u00e4rabar Renola. Renola is granola reinvented, a simple grain and gluten-free mix of nuts, fruits, seeds and spices. The three varieties: Cinnamon Nut, Cocoa Coconut and Berry can be consumed as a snack, a topping or as a cereal with milk.","We\u2019re broadening the Food Should Taste Good brand with the introduction of Pita Puffs. This crisp snack delivers the satisfying crunch of a pita chip in an innovative new puffed form. And we\u2019re bringing the culinary appeal of Food Should Taste Good to the cracker aisle with a new line of gluten-free brown rice crackers in delicious flavors like sea salt, peppercorn blend and tomato basil.","We\u2019re also launching Fiber One cookies nationally this quarter. This is a great tasting product for consumers looking to satisfy their cookie craving without the guilt. These cookies have just 120 calories and 20% of your daily value of fiber.","Our better-for-you snacking businesses have clear momentum and so do several other key businesses in our U.S. Retail portfolio. Retail sales for Totino\u2019s hot snacks have grown 10% in the last two years to reach over $0.5 billion in measured sales alone. In fiscal 2015 we\u2019ll work to build on that success with our Zero to Pizza Pronto advertising campaign. We\u2019re also innovating with new barbecue chicken and spicy taco style varieties.","Old El Paso is leading the Mexican category with measured sales up 4% and share up half a point in fiscal 2014 and this is thanks to differential innovation like our Stand \u2018N Stuff tortillas. This year we\u2019re bringing bold nacho cheese flavor to our Stand \u2018N Stuff taco shells and we\u2019re significantly increasing our media investment to accelerate momentum on this very exciting brand.","On our Baking Products businesses, we\u2019ll continue to invest in the digital advertising efforts that Ann Simonds shared with you on our third quarter call. We\u2019re addressing consumer desires for affordable indulgence with the launch of Pillsbury filled cookies and Cinnabon bakery-inspired cinnamon rolls. And we\u2019re expanding the successful Immaculate Baking brand from the refrigerated dough case into the dry mix aisle. So that\u2019s a taste of the very full marketing plans we have in U.S. Retail. You will hear much more on this business from Jeff Harmening in July.","We finished fiscal 2014 with good sales momentum in our Convenience Stores and Foodservice business. For fiscal 2015, we\u2019re targeting renewed top line growth for this segment with net sales forecast to grow at a mid-single digit rate, again including the 53rd week. Positive mix and strong HMM delivery are expected to help segment operating profit grow at a high single-digit rate.","Let me give you a few examples of how we\u2019ll be driving net sales growth in fiscal 2015.","First, McDonald\u2019s recently announced that they will be offering Yoplait Go-Gurt in Happy Meals at more than 14,000 locations across the U.S., beginning in July. We\u2019ve developed a new snacking product for the K-12 channel, new snacking products for the K-12 channel, like Nature Valley Crisps and Simply Chex, products that meet the USDA\u2019s new snack nutrition regulations.","We\u2019ll continue to drive growth in the Convenience Stores channel with innovations like Chex chips and Totino\u2019s Pizza chips. Bethany Quam who was recently promoted to President of the Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment will share more details with you next month.","For our International segment, plans call for a high single-digit constant currency growth in net sales and operating profit in 2015. Our consumer first approach is as important in our International business as it is in the U.S. Let me share some highlights of the great product news and innovation we have planned starting in our developed markets.","In Canada, we\u2019re bringing relevant innovation to the cereal category. We\u2019re targeting healthful foodie consumers with our launch of an ancient grains variety of Cheerios. We\u2019ve just introduced Nature Valley protein granola to Canada following fast on the heels of its successful introduction in the U.S. And on Lucky Charms and Cinnamon Toast Crunch we\u2019re investing in taste focused advertising targeted to adults.","Our Libert\u00e9 yogurt holds a leading position in Canada\u2019s Greek yogurt market. We\u2019re launching a new sublime of Libert\u00e9 Greek featuring higher fat indulgent flavors. We\u2019re also introducing new Yoplait Source yogurt with stevia, capitalizing on growing consumer interest in natural sweeteners.","We\u2019ll continue to tap the U.S. snacks innovation pipeline to bring new products to Canada. Nature Valley breakfast squares are launching this month. And Old El Paso is bringing some new restaurant quality entrees to the Mexican aisle. In Europe, we\u2019re adding new fruit varieties to the core Haagen-Dazs portfolio and we\u2019re launching Haagen-Dazs triple sensations, a breakthrough innovation which delivers three layers of indulgence in every bite.","We continue to play a leading role in developing the Greek style yogurt segment in Europe. We\u2019re supporting our recent launches of Libert\u00e9 Greek in the U.K. and Yopa!, high protein yogurt in France with new flavors and pack sizes in the first half of this year. And we\u2019re expanding our Old El Paso Stand \u2018N Stuff tortillas and dinner kits throughout the regions.","So let\u2019s shift to emerging markets where our focus on the growing middle class consumer is driving strong growth for our businesses. Fiscal 2014 was another year of double-digit growth for us in China and we intend to keep our foot on the gas in 2015. We\u2019re expanding the Haagen-Dazs retail line with new flavors like blueberries and cream. We\u2019ll reinforce the super premium equity with increased media investment in existing geographies and we\u2019ll continue to expand the brand with new shops and retail outlets in new cities across the country.","On Wanchai Ferry, we\u2019ll strengthen our brand leadership in the dumpling segment by inviting consumers to taste the best of the season with new varieties like asparagus and shrimp. And we\u2019ll drive differential growth in the tangyuan segment by expanding our breakthrough crystal tangyuan innovation. We\u2019ll also continue working toward key milestones, including the plant commissioning and regulatory certification that will enable us to launch Yoplait into the fast growing yogurt category in China.","In Brazil, our fiscal 2015 plans call for another year of double-digit net sales growth. We\u2019re capitalizing on Brazilian consumers\u2019 passion for the World Cup with Yoki\u2019s Bring the Party to your Home campaign. This leverages our annual Festa Junina in-store merchandising event. And we\u2019ve launched a line of world flavors, Yoki snacks, featuring flavors from many World Cup countries. We\u2019re increasing media investment behind compelling messages like Kitano seasonings Clean Plates campaign. And we\u2019re investing behind the recent launch of Betty Crocker dessert mixes.","After the U.S., the Middle East is the second largest market for Betty Crocker in the world. Our team there is building on consumer interest in sweet snacking with new varieties of Betty Crocker mixes, including molten chocolate cake and chocolate cheesecake, supported with high levels of consumer spending.","In India, we\u2019ll drive trial and awareness of Pillsbury value-added mixes and Parampara meals by more than doubling consumer support while expanding distribution. Emerging markets continue to lead CPW\u2019s growth. Next month we\u2019re adding Fitness Chocolate to our market leading brand portfolio in Southeast Asia, targeting consumers seeking permissible indulgence. And we have big nutrition news rolling out across our kid cereals line in Latin America centered on less sugar, same great flavor message. That gives you a sense for the strong growth plans we have across our international business in 2015. Christ O\u2019Leary will share details with you in just a few weeks.","So in summary, General Mills fiscal 2015 plans are centered on the objective of faster top line growth fueled by sharper consumer focus news and innovation. We have a very robust slate of product news, renovation and innovation that we\u2019re bringing across each of our business segments. We\u2019re maintaining our strong HMM focus and we\u2019ve launched new efforts designed to contribute $40 million in pretax savings this year with more to come in fiscal 2016. And above all, we\u2019re focused on our commitment to deliver earnings growth and strong cash returns to our shareholders. So we look forward to talking more review about these plans during our investor event on July 8.","So with that, I\u2019ll open the call for questions. Operator, would you please get us started?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Eric Katzman \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, good morning, everybody.","Kendall J. Powell","Hi, Eric.","Eric Katzman \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Two questions, I guess. Ken, you clearly have stated with all the details on the new products that top line is the focus. It looks like promotional spending just for pretty much everybody, including yourself, has not been as effective. So could you kind of talk a little bit about the comment that like media spending is going to be up, I think you said greater than sales? Kind of how does promo fit into that? And then I have a follow-up on the cost savings restructuring effort.","Kendall J. Powell","Okay. Well, good morning, Eric and thanks for the questions. Let me make a few comments. We continue to be very focused, as you point out, on innovation, new products, renovation of core brands and of course the advertising that\u2019s necessary to really communicate those ideas to consumer and of course when we get that combination right that\u2019s when we see top line growth, clear benefits coupled with very compelling advertising. So that is core to our plan and continues to be core and I described I think a number of instances of how we\u2019ll play that out.","On the merchandising side of your question, I\u2019d make a couple of points about sort of what we saw in the fourth quarter and our focus going forward. First of all, while we did not see the efficiency that we\u2019d hope for I just want to underscore we\u2019ve seen relatively stable merchandising price points. So it\u2019s not a question of that price point erosion or more aggressive levels of promotion.","It really for us related to execution. We just see more and more of the players interested in getting merchandising. There are limited number of places in the store to get that high quality that we want, which is really good placement on end-aisle displays coupled with the feature support that we know drives efficient merchandising.","So as we look at those metrics and variables, particularly in the second half and fourth quarter of year, we saw some slippage there. So we look at it as why we are quite disappointed, we kind to analyze and think our way through these things. We think it\u2019s an executional issue. We just have to make sure that we\u2019ve got our customers focused on the right big brands and executing in the right way with high quality display support in store and the right level of communication. So we\u2019re going to \u2013 and recognize it\u2019s more competitive, focus on execution. We\u2019ve got very good sales capability and that\u2019s sort of how we\u2019ll approach that as we go into 2015. Does that get at it for you, Eric?","Eric Katzman \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then, I guess on the review on the cost side of things, obviously, kind of similar, everybody is looking at what is the right cost structure, capacity utilization. I guess it\u2019s early days, but it just seems that $40 million relative to your EBIT, which is kind of approaching $3 billion, is kind of relatively modest. Should we think about this as being a much bigger kind of program or is this really kind of just adjusting some utilization rates in select businesses?","Kendall J. Powell","","So, Eric, I mean, let me make a comment and then I think Don wants to jump in. I mean you should think of that number as a partial year number and I think as we\u2019ve noted we\u2019ll expect that to grow in out years. Beyond that in terms of more detail on how we\u2019re approaching this and what we\u2019re thinking, we don\u2019t have those to share with you today and so we\u2019ll come back at those later, but I think it would be correct to say that\u2019s a partial year that we\u2019re capturing there and we expect that to increase going forward.","Donal L. Mulligan","","Yes, Eric. What I\u2019d add is as you\u2019re well aware we have been under HMM discipline for close to a decade now. That has allowed us to continue to drive efficiencies in both our supply chain as well as our overheads, which has avoided the need to take a lot of large scale restructuring actions.","That said, on a very target basis we do think we see some opportunities. To Ken\u2019s point, we expect to be back to you in 90 days or so with more specifics on portions of it. It will play out beginning this year. Think about those savings falling more in the back half and then they will expand in F16 and we\u2019ll give you a line of sight on that when we\u2019re revealing out more specifics.","Eric Katzman \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. I\u2019ll pass on. Thank you.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Kendall J. Powell","Hi, David.","David Palmer \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","","Good morning. U.S. Retail has been at the center of the shortfall in the last few years versus your high single-digit targets. It seems to be key to the turn in your fiscal 2015 guidance in addition to the impact from cost reductions and the extra week. Assuming that is fair, what areas of U.S. Retail do you expect to improve the most into the next year and why would those be the areas that you expect to improve? Thanks.","Kendall J. Powell","David, thank you for the question. There are three focused areas in U.S. Retail. One area focuses to continue really and accelerate our very strong momentum in snacks. We\u2019ve had great success there. We have a very strong innovation pipeline. You\u2019ll see more of that innovation in the first half. I will tell you there is more good innovation coming in the second half. So first things first is to keep the momentum going in a very, very successful part of our portfolio.","The next two priorities Yoplait yogurt and cereal. Let me talk about each of those a little bit. In the yogurt category, I would say that the dynamics of that category are shifting in our favor right now. While Greek yogurt is obviously a very big part of the category now, it\u2019s been stable at 46%, 47% of the category now for 6 months or 7 months. And that means a couple of things, I mean first of all we have terrific Greek offering now.","We have a full slate of Greek products in many styles and formats. We introduced a number in the second half of last year. We are introducing 20 more in the first half of this year. And we are seeing \u2013 and these are very, very good products, consumers like them. We are seeing our share expand, and so we\u2019re finally getting real traction in that large Greek segment.","On the other hand, the fact that the growth of the Greek segment has stabilized, it really means that there is room for these other segments, I think to get traction now. And so, we are clearly seeing that in our core cup business on these Yoplait brands.","We saw Yoplait Original grow last year. We\u2019re seeing that momentum continue behind reformulation, and a very effective advertising. We\u2019re going to be renovating and reformulating Yoplait Light. In the first half of this year, we\u2019ll be taking aspartame out and putting Stevia in, which we think our consumers are going to like a lot, and gives us some good news to talk about. We\u2019re seeing some traction in our kid brands. So overall, as we look at that yogurt category, we just think that the dynamics are going to be a bit more in our favor, in our full portfolio.","And then finally, on cereal, we\u2019ve got a very clear point of view on what\u2019s happening there. Taste brands are doing really well. So whether it\u2019s Honey Nut Cheerios or Lucky Charms or Cinnamon Toast Crunch, big great tasting brands. Those are all growing for us behind product quality, and very good in advertising. And so, we\u2019re going to keep doing that and we\u2019ll build on that.","The consumer definition of health is changing in the cereal category. Clearly, they are interested in protein, clearly there are things that they \u2013 some consumers want to avoid like gluten, and so you\u2019re going to see us build on those trends with new product offerings and continued renovation.","And remember, we grew our cereal business this year. And we believe strongly that we\u2019ll grow it next year, and that we understand what\u2019s happening in that category very well. So anyway, long answer to your question, but those are the three priorities. And we\u2019re very focused on them, and we\u2019re optimistic that we\u2019ll be able to make those gains.","David Palmer \u2013 RBC Capital Markets LLC","","Thanks. And see you next week.","","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Andrew Lazar \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","Kendall J. Powell","Hi, Andrew.","Donal L. Mulligan","","Andrew.","Andrew Lazar \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Ken, I want to come back just for a minute to the promotional efficiency question from before. I\u2019m trying to get a sense of whether this is other sort of companies in the grocery space having up their game in terms of sort of in store selling capabilities that\u2019s allowed them to be more successful in getting some high quality space or is it just that, in the environment we\u2019re in, they\u2019re just pushing with more, let\u2019s say moneys are spending to get some of it, which will fade at some point. And have you seen something like this dynamic sort of in your experience before? And then I\u2019ve got a follow-up.","Kendall J. Powell","","Okay. Andrew, I mean I would say, look we have a very good competitive set in our space. And so, as you know very well. Our view is just the sheer number of new items and number of new competitors certainly in a \u2013 for instance in yoghurt space, just lots of people coming in with new items. And so the competition for a limited number of quality display options, I would say is increasing.","And so we continue to have very, very high confidence in our sales capability. We\u2019re really good at what we do there, and we think we know the ingredients to successful execution. I mean it always boils down to getting the right, really category driving products on display in the right way at the right price point, which we know what that is, and again those are, we\u2019re not pressing harder.","We know what the right price point is; and with the right kind of feature support. So we know what to do. We\u2019ve diagnosed that Q4, and we think we can go out and get it. There is just more competition and demand. So we\u2019ll have to up our exceptional game.","Andrew Lazar \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I appreciate that. And then, with respect to pricing in yogurt moving forward, I guess particularly in Greek, you\u2019ve got a couple of things you\u2019ve got, obviously higher dairy prices or costs. You\u2019ve got a financial owner that now has a stake in one of your competitors. You\u2019ve got perhaps some of the growth in Greek, filling out some of \u2013 all of this significant capacity that\u2019s come on stream over the last couple of years. Those factors would suggest to me the opportunity for pricing to stabilize or kind of move in the right direction as we move forward.","And I think there have been some moves already to that effect by some players in Greek. Some of you may have suggested that, maybe they\u2019ve taken pricing and General Mills has not yet moved in that regard. So trying to get a sense on, would you expect that to kind of move in the right direction, and is that part and parcel of how General Mills thinks about it too?","Kendall J. Powell","Well, Let me just say that, I would agree with your observation that we\u2019re seeing price stability. Obviously we don\u2019t comment prospectively on pricing and that sort of thing, but I agree with your observation. We also of course are seeing some moderating dairy inflation; and it\u2019s always hazardous to predict what commodity prices are going to do as well, as you know. But we\u2019re encouraged by what we are seeing on that front.","So dairy inflation will be a key variable for us next year. And we like the direction it\u2019s going in now, and I think we\u2019re observing price stability in that Greek segment right now.","Donal L. Mulligan","","Yes. I think Andrew, I just add a few, if you look at the Nielsen in the fourth quarter, pricing in Greek was stable and we were very much in line with that on both the movement in $1 per cup basis. So we feel good about our pricing competitiveness, and where it is, and the stability in the category.","Andrew Lazar \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard from Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Alexia Jane Howard \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC","","Good morning, everyone.","Kendall J. Powell","Hey Alexia, how are you?","Alexia Jane Howard \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC","","Good, thank you. I\u2019ve two questions. Firstly, it looks as though comparing the third quarter results with the data that came out today is, those cereals and the Frozen Foods have declined quite sharply over the last quarter. Given that you\u2019re expecting to get back to growth at least in cereals, how quickly do you expect that to happen during the course of fiscal 2015. And then, I have a follow-up.","Kendall J. Powell","Okay. I don\u2019t know that I have sort of quarter-by-quarter outlook for you right now, Alexia. Again going back to fundamentals, we feel encouraged by the fact that we were able to grow that business this year in the down category, and I won\u2019t repeat for you the litany of innovation that we\u2019re bringing fundamentally.","We think that these things are \u2013 they work and that\u2019s why we are doing more of them. I mean they effective for us. So we are going to stay on that game of product renovation, we\u2019ll be very focused on advertising that works and all these things that I\u2019ve talk about and we expect over the course of the year to see that business grow. And as I talk with merchandising support, we\u2019ll sharpen our focus on execution there. And our goal is to grow that business again in 2015.","Alexia Jane Howard \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC","And then just hopping back to Eric\u2019s question about the promotional effectiveness declining this quarter, do you think it\u2019s partly to do with some consumer shifting to less heavily processed products, and if so, what do you do with the promotions on that brand, those brands, do you step it up and try to chase more volume even if the volume response isn\u2019t there or should you maybe be taking the prices upwards, and using that extra cash to channel into products that you are seeing grow like the snacks area?","Kendall J. Powell","Well, I think your last point, Alexia, let me sort of address several of the points, certainly we\u2019re observing where the growth is coming across our portfolio. And we continue to increase the pace of innovation and the level of support behind our snacking business because that\u2019s a real growth opportunity. Having said that though, again, we have \u2013 we know where the growth is in the cereal category right now, and we think we know how to get it. And just to repeat myself, high taste indulgent products are performing very nicely for us. And so we are going to add support to those. So, Honey Nut Cheerios are the biggest brand in the category grew for us, this year.","Lucky Charms and Cinnamon Toast grew, so we will keep renovating these highly differentiated products and we will support them well and we will add to them, because they work. But to your other point, we also know that consumers are interested in more protein, and we do see more breakfast going to for instance Greek Yogurt, as an example, or our other protein based breakfast. That\u2019s why we were expanding our range of protein based cereal offerings.","Nature Valley protein granola has been quite successful for us. So, we are going to shift resources to that kind of innovation. It\u2019s early days and I mean, literally we are just weeks into this, but it looks like Cheerios protein will strike a chord. So, to your point Alexia we are \u2013 we do really study the market closely. We look to see how consumer preferences are shifting and our innovation plan and approach is very coherent and how it follows those trends and those preferences, and which I think is the core of your question.","So, thank you.","Donal L. Mulligan","And Alexia the only thing I would add to that is you touched on median and where we are going to put our investments. And you had mentioned and you noted that it is going to be up faster than sales next year. But I think you\u2019ll also see it, be more differentially put against those ideas U.S our old businesses for example that Ken touched on behind cereal, behind snacking, behind yogurt to potentially more differentiated step than we had in past years.","Alexia J. Howard \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC","Thank you, very much, I will pass it on.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Granger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Matthew C. Granger \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","","Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks for the question.","Donal L. Mulligan","Hi, Matthew.","Kendall J. Powell","Good morning, Matt.","Matthew C. Granger \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, just one clarification, I guess on the guidance for operating profit growth. First, you highlighted an expectation of mid single-digit segment operating profit growth, but you\u2019re also coming off a fairly significant decline this year in corporate expense. Can you just walk through some of the drivers of lower corporate expense this year and whether some of those might revert going into 2015?","Donal L. Mulligan","Yes, first of all to be clear obviously the corporate items of the unallocated are outside of the segment operating profit, segment operating profit will grow in line with sales. It\u2019s going to be \u2013it\u2019s going to improve off the growth rate this year, driven partially by the higher sales growth that we are projecting for next year. And the lower inflation, so greater gross margin expansion. So that is the fundamental driver in next year\u2019s number.","In terms of this year, our corporate unallocated was corporate items was down for a few reasons, compensation incentive was down year-over-year that is surprising given the results. And then there was the miscellaneous other corporate items benefit rate et cetera, that were beneficial \u2013 that were captured in F14 numbers.","Matthew C. Granger \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","","Okay. Thanks, Don. And just one question on Yoplait, I mean China specifically. I know you\u2019ve talked a few months ago about breaking ground on a manufacturing facility there and planning a gradual roll out. Just wanted to see if you could give any update on what type of progress you\u2019re expecting for this year. And whether there is any prospect of having a product to commercialize at some point later in the year?","Kendall J. Powell","Yes, it\u2019ll be Matthew it\u2019ll be later in the year. I mean we\u2019re making \u2013 we were building a plant. I mean we\u2019ve been very clear on that and we are \u2013 this is an exciting multibillion dollar category. In China we\u2019ve great capability to bring there and we will obviously have more details to share with you as we get closer to the launch. But we\u2019ll have very good capability and we intend to launch very high quality, very competitive offerings into that market.","And we will start as we always do in the specific region in China and prove out the business model and make sure that we\u2019ve got our capabilities aligned the right way and then we will expand. But we are obviously very enthusiastic about this opportunity and I think it\u2019s a great growth platform for General Mills in China.","","Matthew C. Granger \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay, all right, thanks very much, Ken.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with City Research. Please go ahead.","David C. Driscoll \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","","Thank you, good morning everyone.","Kendall J. Powell","","Hi, David.","Donal L. Mulligan","","Good morning, David.","","David C. Driscoll \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Don, I wanted to go to the gross margins in the fourth quarter. In late March on the third quarter call, you laid out an expectation of pretty substantial fourth quarter gross margin improvement, and I thought you were pretty clear back then about strong expectations for HMM delivery and favorable input cost. Today it seems like the miss is being more explained like it was a revenue issue because of these promotional items kind of what happened and why did the gross profit margin miss your expectations by so much?","Donal L. Mulligan","","Thanks for the question and that was where the miss was in the quarter. It was not HMM or productivity that came in as expected. It was inflation came in a bit higher and our trade expense related to the promotions that we talked about the promotion efficiency or inefficiency obviously not only hits the top line but impacts gross margin as well. So there is really those two items which didn\u2019t play out in the quarter as we had expected in March. And they\u2019re probably both responsible about half of the miss those two items are equally responsible for the miss in the quarter.","David C. Driscoll \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Okay, can you give us some color on the drivers of inflation in fiscal 2015?","Kendall J. Powell","","Yes, we have 3% inflation as you know we have a fairly broad market basket, I guess one thing to note, it probably was highlighted by the fact that we identified dairy is the driver of the F14 variances. Dairy is becoming a larger piece of our basket not quite as large as grains, but in that same 5% to 10% range. Yes, we looked and because of that breadth of input cost and again, we talked about inflation is really all of COGS that we\u2019re talking about.","It\u2019s very broad grains of 5% to 10%, dairy 5% to 10% many other products in the 5% range including energy both from packaging and distribution. And so we\u2019re seeing some favorable movements on grains, whether it\u2019s energy, sugar, even dairy, as of today versus a year ago are still higher and we see them driving that inflation for next year.","","David C. Driscoll \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","","Final quick one, sorry thank you. Final quick question 53rd week is that \u2013 is it correct to say, it\u2019s two points to the revenue line no impact to the profit line and as a consequence of that second statement, we should not have any negative issues related to this particular 53rd week affecting F16 because always we have to deal with that right now, so is that all fair?","Donal L. Mulligan","","Yes, we expected the extra week will generate about $0.05 of EPS which as we said we\u2019re investing back this year to help drive top line growth.","David C. Driscoll \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","","So, no impact to profit and then that would be true then on the F16 there is no reason to call that out as a factor affecting that particular year?","Donal L. Mulligan","","We expect to reinvest this year. Yes","David C. Driscoll \u2013 Citigroup Global Markets Inc.","Okay, thank you.","","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Ken B. Goldman \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, thanks for the question. Not just for Mills, but across a lot of larger US-based food names, we are in a bit of a challenging cycle here. I guess I am wondering in your view how do you break this trend? What is the smoking gun? Do we need better innovation, stronger marketing, more efficient promos? Is it all of the above I guess? I am just trying to understand, Ken, in your review, what is the main problem we are all experiencing across packaged food at the moment and maybe how you go about fixing it?","Kendall J. Powell","","Can I \u2013 I wish there was one silver bullet, it would make it easier for us, but I think it depends on the category, I mean clearly snacking is a trend, a positive trend, and so maybe that is a key factor of that and we\u2019re very focused on the snacking trend, and it\u2019s not just the snacks in our snack businesses, we see yogurt becoming more and more of a snack food and in fact one of the reasons for the resurgence of our core Yoplait businesses is that we\u2019re seeing more snack usage and we\u2019re actually talking about the product and its snack versatility in advertising.","And so we\u2019re seeing it play out there, we are seeing our hot snack products, Totino\u2019s do very well. We are seeing our natural and organic snack. So I think that there is a snacking play. I think that as I said I think that consumer definitions of wellbeing or health are changing, and so we need to be very in tuned to that, and we\u2019ve talked about the protein trend not just in yogurt, but across the number of categories and how that\u2019s playing out and how we are looking to capitalize on that. And we talked about how consumers are look to avoid some different things and some things that maybe weren\u2019t on their radar several years ago with gluten being exhibit one.","So, we are in changing times. We are marketing company so our job is to understand the change and capitalize on it, find opportunity there, and so I think it\u2019s more than one change, as I tried to say. But it\u2019s more snacking, it\u2019s changing definitions of health and wellness, but as we get clear, I think, understanding of those and better understanding of what exactly the consumer wants there, we will get better at giving them, giving those products to her and these again should become opportunities for us.","Ken B. Goldman \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks and then one really quick follow-up. Advertising spending in the fourth quarter, very basic math here and this easily could be wrong. Was it down low double digits, high single digits? Could you just confirm that it was down fairly meaningfully in the fourth quarter?","Donal L. Mulligan","Yes, that\u2019s right. We had some add-ins last year, late last year that we are rolling over and just from an accrual base ends up catching up with you in the quarter. The full year numbers are more important number to look at it. It was not about if 3% and that also included within our U.S. business some shift for media to other consumer like sampling behind our yogurt business, which had a fairly significant impact on that number.","Ken B. Goldman \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks, we will see in a couple of weeks.","Kristen S. Wenker","Operator, can we sneak one last one in here.","Operator","Certainly, our final question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.","Kenneth B. Zaslow \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Hey, good morning everyone.","Kendall J. Powell","Hey, Ken.","Donal L. Mulligan","Hey, Ken.","Kenneth B. Zaslow \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Ken, you changed up the leadership in North America. So my question to you is what are you looking to accomplish under the changes and what will be the greatest strategic changes? Are we going to start to see something different? And just kind of putting it all together is moving people around versus inserting new talent from outside, what was the thinking on this because it seems to be maybe a strategic evolution here. Is there something going on? Can you help us out?","Kendall J. Powell","Yes, so what I\u2019m looking for thank you for the question. I think what you will see is greater focus, greater prioritization, more fluid allocation of resources, and some of your the earlier questions on the call alluded to that, and higher pace of activity. I mean it\u2019s clear that, it\u2019s just its more competitive out there with innovation and ideas coming from both small, very small companies and big companies and so. So along with the way we focus and prioritize, it\u2019s important for us to just pick up the pace and so of innovation and so, you will see all of those things.","Kenneth B. Zaslow \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Was there any thought about bringing in outside talent or anything like that or do you think you have the right team for this North American leadership?","Kendall J. Powell","Yes, we have quite a strong team and we are developing and moving and promoting people based on the results that they have achieved over time, and so we have a very effective leadership team in North America well led and I think you will see these points that I made just a minute ago.","Kenneth B. Zaslow \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","And my last question, usually you talk about acquisitions where there is priority using cash flow. You didn\u2019t talk about that at all. Can you just \u2013 I know last year you guys said that you were not thinking about acquisitions. Is it back on the table? Just talk about it broadly. Obviously you are not going to give exact examples, but I just want to know broadly.","Kendall J. Powell","I\u2019m happy to talk about it and you are right we are not going to give exact examples, but yes, M&A is still part of our strategy. We were clear that F14 was the year of consolidating some large acquisitions we done, and then returning cash to shareholders, and if we did both of those things very effectively. We have continued to work during F14 to look at new opportunities in the same markets, the same areas that we have talked about previously getting deeper in emerging markets and better -- snacking in the U.S. or in developed markets more broadly, and as things eventuate we will certainly share with you.","Kenneth B. Zaslow \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","","Great, thank you.","Kristen S. Wenker","Thank you, everybody. Give me a shout if you still have questions.

And welcome to the General Mills Second Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Conference Call. During today's presentation, all participants will remain in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, December 18, 2019.","It is with pleasure that I now turned the call over to Mr. Jeff Siemon. Please go ahead, sir.","Jeff Siemon","Thanks, Bridget, and good morning to everyone. I'm here this morning with Jeff Harmening, our Chairman and CEO; and Don Mulligan, our CFO. Also joining us this morning for Q&A is Kopi Bruce, our Vice President of Financial Operations who will take over for Don as CFO on February 1st, as well as Jon Nudi, who leads our North America Retail segment.","I'll turn it over to the team in a moment but before I do let me cover the usual housekeeping items. A press release on our second quarter results was issued over the wire services earlier this morning, and you can find that release as well as the copy of the slides that supplement our remarks this morning on our Investor Relations website.","Please note that our remarks will include forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions. In the second slide in today's presentation risk factors that could cause our future results to be different than our current estimates.","And with that, I'll turn you over to my colleagues, beginning with Jeff.","Jeff Harmening","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I'll kick off this morning's remarks with our key messages on slide 4.","I'm encouraged by our second quarter performance both on the top line and bottom line. This includes broad-based improvements in our organic sales trends with strong performance in pet, good results in North America retail and a significant sequential step up in our remaining three segments. We generated strong first half earnings results, while increasing media investment behind our brands. And our cash discipline drove double digit growth and free cash flow, which allowed us to reduce our debt by more than $600 million through six months.","In the second half, we'll step up our investments in brand building and capabilities and future growth initiatives. And we expect to see further improvement in our organic sales growth. And importantly we will remain on track to achieve our fiscal 2020 goals for sales, profit, earnings per share and we're raising our guidance for free cash flow conversion. ","Slide 5 summarizes our Q2 financial results. Net sales were flat to last year at $4.4 billion. Organic net sales grew 1% led by strong growth in Pet. All five segments contributed to profit growth with adjusted operating profit up 7% in constant currency, driven by HMM cost savings, lower consumer promotion expense and favorable manufacturing leverage, partially offset by input cost inflation and higher media investment. The manufacturing leverage favorability was driven by higher inventory balances at the end of the quarter which is a timing benefit that will unwind in the back half of the year.","Second quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $0.95, up 11% in constant currency. Driven by higher adjusted operating profit, lower net interest expense and a lower adjusted effective tax rate.","On Slide 6, you can see our three priorities for fiscal 2020. As I reflect in our first half results, I'm proud to say we've made good progress on all three. First, we're on track to deliver accelerated organic sales growth in fiscal 2020. We improved top line growth in North America retail in the first half compared to fiscal 2019 and we generated double digit growth in the Pet segment. I will share details on these results in a moment. Our second priority is to maintain our strong margins. In fact, we're a bit ahead of our plan on the bottom line for the first half, which gives us flexibility to step up investment in the second half and strengthen top line growth. ","Our final priority is to maintain a disciplined focus on cash to achieve our fiscal 2020 leverage target and we're well on our way to achieving our goal of 3.5x of net debt to adjusted EBITDA by end of year. With these priorities in mind, I will now cover our Q2 results by segment before turning it over to Don to review our performance on margins and cash and outlined back half expectations. ","Slide 7 summarizes components and net sales growth in the quarter. Organic sales were up 1% versus last year, primarily driven by organic volume. FX was a 1 point drag in the quarter resulting in flat reported sales. ","Turning to segment results, beginning on slide 8. Second quarter organic sales for North America Retail were in line with year ago levels. Net sales grew 5% in U.S. Cereal and were up 2% in Canada on a constant currency basis. Net sales declined 1% in U.S. meals and baking; 2% in U.S. Snacks and 4% in U.S. Yogurt. Looking at our first half in market results, we grew share in five of our top 10 categories which comprised roughly 85% of our U.S. retail sales. ","Constant currency segment operating profit increased 4% in the second quarter driven by HMM cost savings and favorable manufacturing leverage, partially offset by input cost inflation and higher media investment.","With this as a backdrop, let's dive a bit deeper into our first half performance in North America retail starting with cereal. I'm very pleased by our performance in U.S. Cereal, driven by strong execution against the fundamentals. We grew our U.S. cereal retail sales modestly in fiscal 2018 and in fiscal 2019 and our results accelerated to 2% growth in the first half of fiscal 2020. We've expanded our share leadership position through investment behind compelling consumer ideas such as our Cheerios heart-health campaign which drove 4% retail sales growth on the Cheerios franchise in the first half of the year. We benefited from consumer support behind Cinnamon Toast Crunch and our partnership with Travis Scott on Reese's peanut butter pops. ","And innovation continued to add to our growth with strong first half performance on Blueberry Cheerios and Cinnamon Toast Crunch Cheerios. I am also excited about the plans we have for the rest of the year to build on our leadership position in cereal. We'll continue to invest in our brands including strong support behind a Cheerios heart-health news with more than 100 million Americans having some form of heart disease, Cheerios is on a mission to inspire happy hearts. For a limited time, we're changing some of the iconic Os into hearts supported by new advertising and updated box design and a social media campaign. ","In addition to increased brand investment, we're launching a strong lineup of innovation in the second half including an oats and honey variety of Cheerios Oat Crunch, Hershey's Kiss Cereal, and Trix Trolls. ","Turning to US Yogurt on Slide 10. We improved our U.S. Yogurt retail sales in fiscal 2019 behind our strategy to expand into faster growing segments of the category and to support our core brand building investments and on trend equity news. Our goal in fiscal 2020 is to further improve US Yogurt with a strong lineup of innovation, brand building and product news. In the first half, our retail sales took a slight setback as we lapped a period significant investment on Oui by Yoplait and had a more meaningful headwind from distribution.","At the same time, we are encouraged by growth on our core products with retail sales for our original style yogurt up 1% and Go Gurt up 10% through the first half of the year. We fully expect to strengthen our U.S. Yogurt performance in the second half of the year behind several specific initiatives. Our second half innovation lineup field a new features and new coconut base dairy-free offering on Oui by Yoplait with a rich and creamy texture of Oui delivered in our signature glass pot.","We'll launch a new limited edition line of Original Style Yoplait and four signature Starbucks flavors and we will launch Just 3 by Yoplait, a new line of traditional yogurts with just three simple ingredients.","We will also increase our consumer support in the second half on our core products and on Oui by Yoplait. And finally, we'll face reduced distribution headwinds as we move into calendar 2020.","In total, we expect these efforts will result in improved retail sales growth for our U.S. Yogurt business in the second half of the year. ","Now let's turn to U.S. Snacks on Slide 11. Coming off a disappointing fiscal 2019, our goal in fiscal 2020 is to improve our performance behind innovation, renovation, brand-building support and in-store execution. We're pleased that our U.S. Snacks improvement in the first half. Retail sales for Nature Valley improved behind a stronger back-to-school merchandising season and a successful launch of Nature Valley Crispy Creamy Wafer Bars. Retail sales for Fiber One have also improved since we reformulated the product line to be more relevant for modern weight managers. ","While we're still lapping distribution losses from earlier this calendar year, our churns per point of distribution, an important leading indicator of growth has stepped up meaningfully across both of these important brands. On Fruit Snacks, we drove 3% retail sales growth in the first six months of the year and we returned to share growth in the second quarter behind strong performance on Disney equity fruit snacks.","Our back-half plans on U.S. Snacks include continued contributions from Nature Valley innovation and the Fiber One renovation, greatly improved distribution on bars and increased brand building behind both bars and fruit snacks, all of which should drive another step-up in our U.S. Snacks retail sales trend in the second half. ","We're focused on competing effectively everywhere we play including our $4 billion US Meals & Baking operating unit. We returned soup to both retail sales and share growth in the first half. Retail sales for Progresso were up 3%, primarily driven by product renovation on Rich and Hearty. First half retail sales for Old El Paso grew 6% and we grew share behind increased distribution and consumer news and price realization across channels. We had a great year on Pillsbury refrigerated dough in fiscal 2019 driving more than one point of share growth. We've continued to grow share in the first half of fiscal 2020, thanks to distribution gains, contributions from new products like Sweet Biscuits and good results on cookies.","Retail sales in the first half declined 3% due to the latter Thanksgiving holiday. However, fiscal year-to-date retail sales for Pillsbury through the first week of December which adjusts for the holiday timing were actually up low single digits.","In total, we're off to a good start and we feel good about our plans for the key soup and baking season. And we believe we are set up to have a successful year on U.S. Meals & Baking. Overall, I'm encouraged by our first half results in North America retail. In the second half, we will drive improvement in U.S. Snacks and U.S. Yogurt, while lapping more challenging retail sales comparisons in U.S. Cereal. And we remain on track to achieve our goal of improved full year organic growth for the segment.","Shifting gears to our Pet Segment on Slide 13. I am pleased to say that we had a great second quarter with net sales up 16%. Our Q2 growth was driven by strong growth in the Food, Drug and Mass and E-commerce channels, positive price mix and a benefit from the timing of shipments in advance of holiday merchandising. This net sales performance was led by strong double digit growth on Blue's two largest product lines, Life Protection Formula and Wilderness. Looking at end-market performance, we drove first half all channel retail sales up low double digits. And we grew share in the pet food category.","On the bottom line, second quarter segment operating profit grew 14% versus a year ago, driven by higher net sales, partially offset by higher media expense. ","On Slide 14, you can see how the key components of the pet segments first half double digit retail sales growth breakdown by channel. Retail sales were up more than 100% in the Food, Drug and Mass channel as we benefited from our expansion to new customers and the launch of Wilderness into the channel and last year's fourth quarter. Importantly, retail sales for Food, Drug and Mass customers who have carried Blue more than 12 months were up 45% in second quarter. As we expected, retail sales in Pet Specialty continued to decline by double digits. This is an important channel though for Blue and we continue to support the channel through unique programs and innovation. And Blue continues to win in the rapidly evolving E-commerce channel with retail sales up high teens through the first six months of the year. ","Looking to the second half of the year, we have an exciting lineup of consumer initiatives such as our Blue years at resolution promotion, we will invest in media support behind our broad portfolio of products and we'll continue to drive distribution, ensuring we have the best of Blue everywhere pet food is sold.","For the full year, we remain well on track to deliver 8% to 10% like-for-like growth in the Pet segment excluding the benefit of the calendar differences in fiscal 2020. We remain confident in the long-term opportunities for Blue Buffalo and we're excited about the growth prospects ahead.","Shifting gears to the Convenience and Foodservice segment on Slide 15, organic sales were flat in the quarter. A four point improvement over our Q1 results with volume growth offset by unfavorable price mix. The Focus 6 platforms led the segment with 2% growth behind Cereal, Frozen Baked Goods and Yogurt with strong contributions from our two ounce equivalent grain cereal offerings and bulk Yoplait Yogurt.","Second quarter segment operating profit grew 5% versus a year ago driven by COGS HMM savings partially, offset by input cost inflation and unfavorable price mix. In the second half of the year, we'll continue to see strong performance in the Focus 6 platforms led by our K-12 schools. ","In Europe & Australia, second quarter organic sales were down 1%, a four point improvement over Q1 results with declines on yogurt partially offset by growth on Old El Paso Mexican Foods and Snack Bars, two of our accelerate platforms that also drove mid single digit retail sales in the quarter. Second quarter segment operating profit increased 45% in constant currency, driven primarily by a timing difference and brand building investments that was neutral through the first half of the year .","Looking to the second half for Europe & Australia, we will improve top line growth versus the first half due to increased merchandising and brand building support behind Old El Paso Mexican Food and our portfolio of Snack Bars including Nature Valley, Fiber One and LARABAR. And in Q4, we will begin the lapping impact of reduced Haagen-Dazs distribution in France.","In Asia & Latin America, second quarter organic sales increased 1% which was also a 4% improvement over the first quarter. In Latin America, growth was driven by route-to-market changes in Brazil resulting in improved performance on our Yoki brand.","In China, net sales were up due to expanded distribution and pricing actions on Wanchai Ferry. In India, sales declined as we continue to change our distribution network to focus on more strategic and profitable outlets. Second quarter segment operating profit in Asia and Latin America was up 42% at constant currency, driven by lower SG&A expense, partially offset by lower volumes. We expect a step up in second half growth in Asia and Latin America, driven by benefits from our strategic revenue management actions and continued distribution expansion on Wanchai Ferry. ","With that, I'll turn it over to Don to cover joint ventures, margins and cash as well as our back half expectations. Don?","Don Mulligan","Thanks Jeff and good morning, everyone. Let me begin on Slide 19 by summarizing our joint venture results in the quarter. Cereal Partners Worldwide posted top line growth for the fifth consecutive quarter with constant currency net sales up 1%. That growth was broad-based including positive results in the UK, Australia, Turkey and the Middle Eastern markets. Haagen-Dazs Japan net sales declined 6% in constant currency, driven by slower category performance in the quarter.","Second quarter combined after tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $25 million, up 11% from last year, driven by positive price mix and benefits from cost savings at CPW, partially offset by lower net sales at HDJ. ","Turning to total company margin results on Slide 20, second quarter adjusted gross margin and adjusted operating profit margin were up 80 basis points and a 110 basis points respectively driven by COGS HMM savings and favorable manufacturing leverage, partially offset by input cost inflation and increased media expense. As Jeff mentioned, the favorable manufacturing leverage was a timing benefit resulting from higher inventory balances at quarter end. We built inventory in the second quarter to protect service while we worked through labor contract negotiations. With those negotiations now successfully concluded, we expect inventory levels to normalize which will result in unfavorable de-leveraged in the back half of the year.","For the full year, we expect input cost inflation and COGS HMM savings will each be approximately 4% of cost of goods. ","Slide 21 summarizes other noteworthy Q2 income statement items. Unallocated corporate expenses excluding certain items affecting comparability increased by $6 million in the quarter. Net interest expense decreased $13 million, driven by lower average debt balances. The second quarter adjusted effective tax rate was in line with our full year expectations at 21.9%, but was favorable to our 23.8% rate a year ago, primarily driven by the timing of discrete tax benefits and more favorable earnings mix. And average diluted shares outstanding were up 1% in the quarter.","Now let's cover our first half results on Slide 22. Net sales totaled $8.4 billion, down 1%. Organic net sales were flat in the first half with positive price mix offset by lower volume. Adjusted operating profit was up 7% in constant currency, driven primarily by positive price mix, one time purchase accounting adjustment in the Pet segment in last year's first quarter. And the timing benefits referenced earlier, partially offset by higher input costs.","Adjusted diluted EPS of a $1.74 increased 12% in constant currency, driven by higher operating profit, lower interest expense and a lower adjusted effective tax rate. ","Slide 23 provides our balance sheet and cash flow highlights for the first half of FY20. First half cash from operations was $1.4 billion, up 4% from the prior year driven primarily by higher net earnings. Our core working capital balance totaled $429 million, down 19% from a year ago driven by continued improvements in accounts payable. Capital investment in the first half totaled a $158 million. This resulted in free cash flow of $1.3 billion, up 14% from last year. We paid $596 million in dividends and reduced debt by $655 million in the first half of fiscal 2020.","Slide 24 outlines our expectations for the second half. We expect to maintain our in market competitiveness in North America retail. And we will continue to drive strong retail sales growth for the Pet segment. We expect total company organic net sales growth to accelerate in the back half due to improved results in the Convenience Stores and Foodservice, Europe and Australia and Asia and LatAm segments, as well as the extra month of results in Pet, as we align net business to our fiscal calendar. We expect second half profit to be impacted by mid-teens percent increase in brand building investments. Increased investments in capabilities and future growth initiatives and the unwinding of the favorable manufacturing leverage and pet shipment timing benefits we saw in Q2.","From a phasing standpoint, we expect year-over-year profit results to be more favorable in Q4 than Q3. Given that Q4 includes the extra month of sales for pet and the 53rd week for the remaining segments. As Jeff mentioned upfront, we are reaffirming our key fiscal 2020 guidance metrics for sales, profit, EPS and leverage and increasing our guidance for free cash flow conversion. You can see our current expectations for these measures on Slide 25. Namely, we expect organic net sales to increase 1% to 2%. We continue to expect the combination of currency translation. The impact of divestitures executed in fiscal 2019 and contributions from the 53rd week in fiscal 2020 to increase reported net sales by approximately 1%.","Constant currency adjusted operating profit is expected to increase 2% to 4%. The benefit of the extra fiscal week is being reinvested in capabilities and brand building initiatives to drive improvement in the company's organic sales growth rate in 2020 and beyond. Constant currency adjusted diluted EPS is expected to increase 3% to 5% from the base of $3.22 earned in fiscal 2019. We continue to estimate that foreign currency will be immaterial to adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS.","Given our strong first half results, we now expect to convert at least a 105% of adjusted after tax earnings into free cash flow, which is up from our previous guidance of at least 95% conversion. And we'll maintain our fiscal, our disciplined focus on cash to achieve our targeted yearend leverage ratio of 3.5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA.","Now I'll turn it back to Jeff for some closing remarks.","Jeff Harmening","Thanks Don. And before we close, I'd just like to take a minute and acknowledge the key leadership transition with Don Mulligan's upcoming retirement. After a distinguished 21-year career in General Mills, including the last 12 years as CFO. Don will be retiring at the end of this fiscal year. He'll be stepping into an adviser role effective February 1st and retire on June 1st of 2020. As most of you listening already now, Don, has served the company and his function with distinction. He is true expert in this field and has provided steady leadership throughout his tenure. As you can see by our results so far this year, he has certainly running through the day. Today, on his 50th earnings call, I'd like to personally thank Don for his contributions to the company and for the counsel he has provided to me in his role. We'll certainly miss him and wish him all the best as he begins a new chapter. ","I'm also pleased to introduce Kofi Bruce, who will be taking over as CFO effective February 1st. Kofi has been with General Mills for 10 years in a variety of roles including Treasurer, Segment Finance Leader for Convenience and Foodservice and most recently as Vice President of Financial Operations. Kofi brings a wealth of external perspective from prior experiences at Ecolab and the Ford Motor Company. Kofi is well suited for this role given the breadth of experience, his track record of delivering exceptional results and his passion for developing talent our organization.","In closing, I would like to summarize today's key messages. I am encouraged by our performance. We drove broad-based improvement in organic sales trends in the quarter; generated strong first half earnings and free cash flow results and we reduced our debt.","In the second half, we will increase our investments in growth and will further improve our top line trends. Importantly, we remain on track to meet or exceed all of our key goals for fiscal 2020. ","With that let me open up the line for questions. Operator, can you get us started?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","And our first question comes from the line of Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. ","KennethGoldman","Hi. Good morning, everyone and Don, thank you for all your help over the years. I wanted to ask a couple of questions. First are you thinking, this is more of a technical question but on slide 24 you had mentioned that Blue Buffalo is the only business not to have an extra week? But I thought previously we were modeling this and maybe I just didn't understand it correctly, we were previously modeling five extra weeks in the fourth quarter. And then subtract a week that went away in the first quarter that gets us four in net for the year. So I thought we were previously guided to having an extra week in Buffalo. Blue Buffalo for that fourth quarter but maybe I missed it, I thought it was five total.","JeffSiemon","This is Jeff Siemon. You're right. We have --the extra month is five incremental weeks in Q4. As we define organic versus non organic, all that change in Blue Buffalo falls under our organic sales definition. The extra, the 53rd week in the remaining segments is above and beyond in the inorganic calculations.","KennethGoldman","Okay so nothing has changed there just to make sure.","JeffSiemon","No, correct. ","KennethGoldman","Okay. Thank you. And then my next question is you have a little bit of controversy on your hands at least in the investor community right now obviously on the grain-free side. We met with you guys a month ago, you didn't sound very concerned about it. Has your concerned level changed at all in the last few weeks about grain free and some of the FDA reports out there? Or are you still not really necessarily seeing consumers react as feared?","JeffHarmening","Yes. Thanks for the question, Ken. I mean contrary to what's been written we actually really haven't seen an impact on our businesses as witnessed by the strong Q2 results on Blue Buffalo including Wilderness which happens to be grain-free. That along with Life Protection Formula really led our growth in the quarter. I do think it's important to take a step back and remember why we get into this in the first place. And what we bought was a great brand and a great category and brand that travels across different diet types both grain containing and grain-free and travels across channel. And you can see that with our results in E-commerce and FDM.","And so while there has been a lot of talk of grain-free, we haven't seen it in our business and our trends even in Pet Specialty really haven't changed on grain-free. And I also think it's important that in this discussion we don't lose sight of the fact that the FDA has really, they have not identified a call to link or drawn any conclusions. They have -- they have brought it to people's attention clearly, but they have not drawn call to link. And I would also like to say that along with our human food, we work closely with the FDA and the rest of the pet industry as well. Now there has been slowdown in grain-free and category but there are a lot of moving pieces.","I mean part of that's probably a shift to Blue Buffalo and part of that is channel shifting and all the rest. But there has been a slowdown in the grain-free segment although blue Buffalo and our grain-free products we really haven't seen that.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner of Wells Fargo. Please proceed.","JohnBaumgartner","Thanks for the question. Jeff, I also wanted to stick with the topic of DCM and maybe just looking at it differently. Can you frame the situation as you see it maybe in terms of options for the portfolio and supply chain? Whether it's with reformulations or anything else. Like how do you think about the optionality there?","JeffHarmening","Well. I mean I think I'll start that--look, I'll start answering that question with something I mentioned briefly and Blue Buffalo plays really well across all diet types. And I think that's really important to note. The second thing, I guess, I would like to say that we have some product lines that even though they are technically grain-free they also have a -- they are also benefited high-protein. So I look at Wilderness and while it's grain-free it's also true that it's high in protein and many consumers buy because of that. We don't have-- we certainly don't have any plans to reformulate products, but if we ever needed to we can certainly shift.","We currently can make some shifts and make some changes. As I said, we don't have plans to do that now because we haven't seen an impact. And we don't feel the need but should that need arise, we certainly can.","JohnBaumgartner","Great. And then, Don, very strong quarter for margins. You mentioned the benefits there from the manufacturing leverage but how is the pacing coming through from the global sourcing and some of the logistics work you're doing, both in North America and Europe? Where those initiatives stand kind of going forward in terms of incremental benefits for the back half and then maybe into fiscal 2021?","DonMulligan","We continue to see strong return on the investments we made in global sourcing for example. Our HMM is tracking on plan. It will fully offset our 4% inflation this year. It tends to be --it is running fairly consistently quarter-to-quarter. We expect both in the front and the back half for inflation and HMM to kind of run in lockstep. And that's what's an elevated HMM results partially driven by the global sourcing that you referenced.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Please proceed. ","AndrewLazar","Good morning, everybody. Happy holidays. I guess, first off more of a quick one. I guess , Don, are you able to help maybe quantify or maybe put some parameters around the benefit from some of the timing that you talked about in pet shipments and manufacturing leverage in any retail that is set to unwind in the second half. ","DonMulligan","Sure, I guess I'll step back first and just talk about margins more broadly. We are pleased with the way the middle of the P& L is developing this year. You're seeing a consistent improvement in our expansion and our gross margin. And even when you strip out lapping, the inventory step-up on pet from last year and the timing benefit this year you are seeing a 30 to 40 basis point improvement in margins and gross margins in both the first and second quarter. And you're also seeing that we're investing back in higher media which has been running mid single digits and actually increased in the second quarter versus the first quarter. And our admin is well controlled. So we're getting leverage there which is leading to the improved, through the first half of the improved operating margin as well. ","So we like to structure. As we look to the second half, there are three things that we referenced. We're going to see a step-up in our brand investment. That's going to be in the mid-teens and to put in perspective; we run an annual media budget of last year was around $600 million. We will also see increasing in investments. We talked at the beginning of the year about getting deeper in data analytics to support our strategic revenue management and E-commerce activities. And we will continue to invest in those and increase that investment in the second half. We've also start spending some money on pet innovation which again will benefit beyond --our beyond our F-2020. ","And the last piece is the shipments. And the reason I recap them or the timing, excuse me. And the reason I recap them because really that is the order of impact as well. So I want to make sure the first two pieces are not lost. So third on the timing, there are two components. It's the manufacturing leverage in North America retail which will --which was created as we increased inventory in the second quarter and we will unwind largely in the third quarter. And then a small benefit from shipment timing in pet. Together, those will be about $25 million benefit or benefit in Q2 reverse in the second half again largely in the third quarter. But again, there are three components. All are material and the timing is actually the smaller of the three.","AndrewLazar","Great and that's helpful. And then your comment on pets are good segue to my next question which is thinking about the runway for growth there, this fiscal year obviously you're seeing the benefit from the white space distribution fill and the FDM channel and not only from Life Protection Formula but Wilderness sub-brand as well. Is the opportunity as we head into fiscal 2021 become less about channel fill and more about I guess product form? Thinking about like wet and treats. And if so, I guess what does the analysis suggests to you around the magnitude of that opportunity as we go forward? Thank you.","JeffHarmening","As we look ahead, Andrew, I mean I think one of the things I would say, first of all, that we're most encouraged by it. If you look at the growth we have in pet distribution we've had for more than a year it's up 45%. And so the idea that once distribution stops or growth stops is not something that we subscribed to. And that actually follows what happens in human food. A lot of times when we launched new products into a channel, people are still finding those products for a couple of years. And so it's actually not surprising to us that we will see continued growth in pet and channels where we already exist. It's actually quite good. So as we look at, as we look at F-2021, the first thing I would tell you, even though we have a quite a bit of distribution already, we should -- I think pet parents are still going to be finding Blue Buffalo especially in the food, drug and mass. So I think we will see continued growth in that. ","On Pet Specialty, we'll look to turnaround some of those trends in the pet specialty because we think that we can do better and through promotions that are suited to that channel, as well as some new product innovations, Carnivora is just the beginning and continued. [Tech Difficulty]","AndrewLazar","Can you hear me guys?","JeffSiemon","Yes. Andrew, sorry. ","AndrewLazar","We are back. ","JeffHarmening","Don just said in 50 calls this is a first for him. [Multiple Speakers] So, I am going to first refer to Jeff, Jeff was I think probably talking for a little while longer about our pet growth opportunities. ","AndrewLazar","Yes. We got cut off, I'll tell you, yes, I could help you there. We got cut off right after Jeff had said we still see opportunity obviously in some of the core channels that you're in and then you were just going to kind of transition to the next part of the point.","JeffHarmening","Great, okay, good. I don't want to miss. It was sheer brilliance, Andrew. ","AndrewLazar","We'll never know. ","JeffHarmening","I am sorry, it was nice. Look, the other thing I was saying that it was in the other opportunity is really through innovation through wet and treat and one of the things we will be -- we are spending more money in the back half of this year on is on innovation. And you will see that come to fruition in F-2021 and to dimensionalize it, the wet and treat part of the pet food category is about 45% of the categories almost $15 billion in sales and we weigh under-index. So our share of dry dog food is probably about 10%. Our share of wet and treat us somewhere in the 3% to 4% range and so the opportunity is enormous. And so as we look to next year, we think we can grow through continuing to do what we do well which is build the Blue brand, continue with pet parents finding in a channel and through wet and treat innovation. ","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed","DaraMohsenian","Hey, good morning, guys. So two questions. First, just in U.S. Retail Cereal had a strong quarter. It's a continuation really the solid results you mentioned over the last couple of years with the growth. But obviously it was also an easy comparison this year with the merchandising shift last year and one of your key competitors has talked about increasing merchandising in that business. So, Jeff, I was just hoping for a bit of a state of the union there on your cereal performance to key growth drivers going forward and where you're focused and expectations for the back half of the year? ","And then a similar question on U.S. Yogurt trends did weakened sequentially in the quarter. I think you've had some greater competition on the low end. So maybe you can talk about the competitive environment in Yogurt. Your prospects for the back half of the year and with a number of the drivers you mentioned, do you think that business could actually get to growth in the back half of the year and expectations? That would be helpful. Thanks.","JonNudi","Dara, this is Jon Nudi. I will jump in and take both those questions. On cereal, we feel really, really good about our performance to date. The quarter was a terrific one. We were up 5% from an RNS standpoint. And it's really being driven by fundamentals. If you look at our marketing, we feel great about where we are in our major brands. In fact, we had the best quarter on cereals in over a decade with our total Cheerios franchise up 6.5%. Jeff mentioned some of our kids' cereals and Reese's Puffs and Travis Scott collaboration. So feel really good about our marketing and our big brands, at the same time our innovation is quite strong as well.","In fact, we have the top four new products introduced over the last year in the category and nearly 50% of all the new category volume from new products is coming from General Mills. So feel really good about the fundamentals. And you mentioned the comp; we were a bit softer last year in Q2 from a merchandising standpoint. And obviously, we benefited from that. Our comps get a bit more challenging in the back half but as I look at the fundamentals behind marketing and innovation, we feel like we're going to compete very effectively as we move through the back half of the year. So we feel really, really good about cereal. ","And importantly, the category was actually flat for the first time in quite some time in the quarter as well. It continues to get better over time. And we feel good about the future of the category and certainly the way that we're competing. Switching to Yogurt. As Jeff mentioned, our goal that we set at the beginning of the year was to improve from a minus two that we delivered in fiscal 2019. We took a bit of a step back. We were down 3% through the first half. And really two major drivers of that, one was that we lost some significant distribution at several major customers last January. We'll lap those distribution declines next month. And again, we think that'll be an inflection point. And also in the summer of fiscal 2019, we brought up the second line on Oui. And as a result, we spend a tremendous amount around marketing support to really drive that business. ","In fact, in Q2 last year, wheat was up almost 40%. So our comps normalize in the back half on Oui. And that will help us from a comp standpoint. We feel really good about our core business. Original style Yoplait or Yogurt was up 1% in the quarter. Go Gurt was actually up 10%. We had some really great taste news. And we feel good about our new product lineup for the back half as well as Jeff mentioned, we are launching a new nondairy Oui which has coconut based. So we've got a Starburst promotion as well. So we believe that Oui are still on track to meet our objective of improvement from the minus two and we see Yogurt strengthened as we move through the back half.","DaraMohsenian","Okay. Can you just talk a little bit about some of the low-end competition you are seeing? And if that's an issue how you view that in Yogurt? Thanks.","JonNudi","Yes. I would tell you I don't think that's something that we're super focused on. Again, we think that across each of our lines we are very clear view of who consumers are. Our OSY, Original Style Yoplait, again that's where we probably see the highest private label interaction. And as I mentioned, we grew 1% even seeing private-label gain pretty strongly. So we believe if we focus on innovation and building our brands, we can be successful. And again, we believe that we're going to have strengthened the back half and meet our objective. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","JasonEnglish","Hey, good morning, folks. Congratulates on your pending retirement Don and welcome Kofi. Looking forward to working with you. I want to bring us back to Pet with a couple of quick questions on it. First performance in pet specialty, I guess I'm surprised by the continued double digit erosion particularly in context of the much improved results you are seeing out of Petco and PetSmart and the Carnivora launch. Can you give us some context around what's driving the sustained share losses there?","And also the teens type growth on E-commerce, obviously, strong in absolute quantum of growth. But we're hearing Nielsen talk about 40% plus growth in e-comm. And obviously, we've seen the robust results continue at Chewy. The data suggests you may be losing share in E-commerce as well. If you could weigh in on your perspective there?","JeffHarmening","Yes. With regard to pet specialty, the results aren't particularly surprising to us in pet specialty. It doesn't mean we liked them and we're not working to turn them around. And the reason we've had tough results in pet specialty, I think there are two reasons. One is that in two of our biggest players were down on distribution quite a bit. And until we start lapping that which should be in the back half of the year we will continue to be down in. The second is we haven't had a lot of --we haven't had a lot of off-shelf placements on marketing in those channels which we're also looking to turn around.","And so that's not all that surprising. The other thing is that the E-commerce channel does interact quite a bit with pet superstores. And we've had strong performance in E-commerce over the years including this latest quarter. And so that's probably accounts for some of those declines as well. But we're working. It's an important channel for us. And even if we're not surprised, it doesn't mean we're happy. And so our goal will then be to improve that performance in the near term.","When it comes to E-commerce, there has been a lot written about e-commerce and I think especially about I think Chewy announced I think last quarter a 40% growth in their business. I think it's important to remember that their growth also includes pharmacy and hardgoods and not only pet food. In terms of our growth, we feel great with a number one pet food online. We're the number one CPG brand online. And we continue to grow with pet parents. And so in terms of market share there are probably three different sources for market share. We used two of them and according to that we're actually growing share in the channel. We haven't used Nielsen, frankly, because their data has not been as reliable as we would have wanted it to.","To the extent that that changes here overtime we will pick up Nielsen. But we stopped using them because the data was not as robust as we needed it to be. I think it's also important to remember that Nielsen includes all E-commerce channels not just pure-plays like Chewy and Amazon but things like Target and Walmart and all the rest.","JasonEnglish","Got it. That's really helpful. One more and I'll pass it on. On the portfolio overall, you obviously have a sizable grain in offering as well as grain-free. Is there a meaningful margin delta between those two? And also what's the general price spread between those two? Thank you.","JeffHarmening","I would say for Wilderness, our pricing is higher on average than it is for the rest of the line and our margins are very robust. I'm not going to get into specifics of that, but our margins are very robust. And so as those with all our pet food. So I would say Wilderness is our biggest grain-free line and it's got good margins and higher price point.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed. ","FaizaAlwy","Yes. Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. So I had a couple of questions. First, I just wanted to go back to the DCM issue only because as you are aware it's a big. It's a big focus point for investors. And one is it's clear that you are not seeing an impact on from retail sales. But are you seeing any impact as you're looking at consumer sentiment out there? And is there anything sort of beneath the retail sales where you're potentially concerned about DCM at all?","And then my second question is just a little bit broader question around your priorities. I guess if you just look at this quarter alone, you could come up with the perspective that you are prioritizing profitability and deleveraging, which is great and I don't mean to look at it on a glass half empty point of view. But maybe could you give us a little bit more comfort in terms of your priorities around top line growth and sort of what's driving this shift in investments toward the back half versus this quarter? Thank you.","JeffHarmening","Yes. So on DCM, I'll probably reiterate a statement I made a little bit earlier, which is to say that we haven't seen an impact on our business from this. Now there are a lot of moving pieces with channels and distribution bills and all the rest, but we have not seen an impact on our business from the discussion of DCM and there has been quite a bit of discussion. There's been a slowdown in the grain free segment within the category. So that also has to be said and some channels are impacted more than others, particularly the Pet Specialty channel more than the Food, Drug, and Mass channel. And so we'll certainly keep an eye on that. But from what we see now, it hasn't had an impact on our business and of course we're dedicated to -- Blue Buffalo was created with a mission to create the healthiest pet food possible and we'll maintain on that mission.","And with regard to DCM and any other issues affecting pets, we're in constant communication with the FDA as well as the rest of the pet industry. In terms of our first half versus second half and kind of what we're prioritizing, I guess I would say our goal has been for the last few years and again this year is really stay in the middle of both. And we're increasing our organic sales, but we want to make sure we do that in a way that is disciplined. And I think if you look at our full year, we'll be able to accomplish that and we'll be able to accomplish that by increasing our organic growth rate and we'll accelerate that in the back half of the year as well as raising guidance on our free cash flow conversion and maintaining our guidance on our profitability.","So if you look at the whole year, I would say that our goal is to increase our organic growth rate but to do so in a way that is as efficient as possible. It is true that in the first half of the year we accelerated our profitability more than we did our organic growth and I think you'll see a little bit of a change to that in the back half of the year as we spend more on brand building and we have confidence in the ideas that we have. We've got really good ideas on really big brands. So whether it's in Snacks with Nature Valley and Fiber One or whether it's in Yoplait Yogurt or whether it's on things like Cheerios or Cinnamon Toast Crunch, we have really good marketing ideas on really big brands and so we're going to -- you'll see us spend behind that in brand building in the back half of the year to accelerate organic sales growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.","StevenShemesh","Good morning. This is actually Steve Shemesh on for Nik. Just another quick one on Pet. As we approach the leadership transition in Blue, just wanted to get a sense of if there have been or will be any significant operational changes? And I guess on that point, will Blue still have a somewhat independent sales force or is that going to be integrated into the broader General Mills sales force? Thank you.","JeffHarmening","Well, first I would say that our Pet performance seems to be pretty good right now. So we're going to keep doing what we've been doing and add innovation on top of that. A couple of things I think to remember. The first is that the Bishop family; Billy and Bill Senior and really Chris; they'll still be involved in the business as advisors going forward. And I just had a conversation with Bill yesterday and so they bring a lot of pet expertise and they will continue to bring that expertise. It just won't be in an operational role, it will be in an advisory capacity. The second is that we have a strong leadership team in place that's going to carry over.","So we have someone who's been in Blue Buffalo for a long time leading our marketing organization and leading supply chain. We have an HR professional that's been there for a while as well as someone in finance. So the leadership surrounding Bethany who is going to remain in place and they've been very effective. And then finally, Bethany herself. We have a tremendous amount of confidence in Bethany and she's a great culture builder and has proven she can drive growth as she has in CNF and she's excited to do the same thing in Pet with the team around here. So we feel good about the leadership transition. Obviously the Bishops are fantastic and we will miss them, but they will remain involved and we have a great deal of confidence in Bethany and the rest of the herd.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","RobertMoskow","Hi, thanks for the question. Two things. In the guidance for the back half, I think consensus is expecting operating profit to be flat to down already. Is that kind of what you're thinking if we had to isolate third quarter in particular because of the comparisons and the $25 million and all of that? I wasn't sure from the script. It sounded like you thought -- it sounded like the opposite, but I couldn't tell. And then secondly, I noticed in the press release that lower consumer promotional expense was one of the drivers of the gross margin being higher. Does that include trade promotion or is it specific consumer promotions that you're talking about and to what extent is that I guess being offset by the higher media expense? And maybe you can give us little more clarity on how much media is going to be up for the year. Lot of questions in there, but yes.","JeffHarmening","All right, I'll do my best Rob.","RobertMoskow","Sorry. I tried to be clear if nothing else.","DonMulligan","So for the second half if you just do a squeeze, we're 7% on operating profit. We're 7% up in the first half, our guidance is 2% to 4% so it squeezes to flat to slightly down in the second half. I mean that's just the math and as we alluded to, there is particularly pressure because of the unwinding of the inventory and the Pet sales timing in Q3. And we'll also see a step-up in our media and in the capability building in Q3 and through the second -- through the fourth quarter. So you will see those pressures come through probably more acutely in the third quarter than the fourth quarter and the fourth quarter obviously will also benefit from the extra month in Pet and the extra week across the business. That's the phasing.","The promotional expenses were not trade, they were actually in we call other consumer so they're in SG&A. And to your point, they were down a touch, but media was up strong mid-single digits in the quarter. And again as we said in the second half, we expect media to be up mid-teens in the balance of the year. So we continue to invest behind our brands. We're seeing it more directly in our media budget and media spending this year and we expect that to step up in the second half.","RobertMoskow","And Don, can you give us any color on trade spending like there's been a shift in the industry overall toward higher trade spend and lower brand building. Are you saying that your trade spending is going to be about the same and then in addition to that, you're going to increase the direct to consumer as well? How would trade spending be affected by this If at all?","DonMulligan","I'd say it's not. The media spend is in addition. I'll let Jon talk a little about the trade in a second, but I'll just go back to the comment I made to Andrew's question is. If you step back and look at the shape of the P&L the way it's coming in this year, you're seeing the benefit of all the work that we're doing in terms of gross margin. Ex the timing and the purchase accounting adjustment from last year, gross margin is expanding about 30 basis points to 40 basis points in the first half and that was in both quarters. Media is up mid-single digits through the first half and again accelerated in the second quarter and our admin expenses have been held in check. And so, we're leveraging those to drive operating margin expansion and that's what we expected to do during the year. As Jeff alluded to, we actually came in a bit more -- with a bit higher profit in the first half than we had originally anticipated and that gives us some flexibility to invest in the back half. That investment is going to be in media, in capabilities, in future growth initiatives such as the Pet innovation not in higher trade. So Jon, if you want to comment a bit about the environment you're seeing.","JonNudi","Yes. So Robert, our trade spending in the US is relatively stable year-over-year. We're leveraging strategic revenue management to try to get more from those dollars and leveraging that whole toolkit but relatively stable. And we're really excited about the opportunities on the brand building side. I'd tell you that we've got probably more ideas than ever in terms of where we can get behind and there are proven drivers and invest behind big brands like Cheerios with heart health news, we're seeing amazing results. So we'll be competitive and compete in our categories from a trade standpoint and will build our brands where we have media as well. So, we feel really good about the few we have to drive our business forward.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Laurent Grandet of Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed.","LaurentGrandet","Yes, hi. Good morning, everyone. And congrats, Don, and welcome, Kofi. Just to follow up on the US share growth category. Could you please update us on how you see the state of the Yogurt business, the recent relaunch of YQ, I mean the launch of Good Valley and Oui by Yoplait that we certainly can't see in Nielsen. And also could you share your aspiration for Oui dairy free that you just announced and how it fits with your overall plan base strategy that most probably include your investment in KKL? Thank you.","JonNudi","Sure, Laurent. This is Jon. So as I mentioned earlier, we were a bit softer in the first half than we'd like on our Yogurt business. And as I mentioned, we feel like we've got drivers in place to improve in the back half. Some of the things you asked about our Good Valley as well as YQ, I would tell you candidly they did not perform as well as we would have hoped through the first half. I would say distribution is a bit below -- lower than what we would have liked, particularly on Good Valley. We've got some real pockets of success and we're drilling in to understand what's working and how we can expand that brand out. As we move to the back half, we are excited about our innovation line up. As you know, plant-based yogurt is growing nicely, it's still relatively small and we think that coming with the repackaging will be a real point of difference and we love the product as well. So we think that will help us as we move forward and play in a really important part of the category that's growing quickly.","So we'll continue to innovate and iterate in that category. I'll tell you there's probably more innovation in Yogurt than the other 25 categories we compete in the US and we as a result, recognize that we have to have a strong pipeline and continue to bring ideas as the consumer is continually looking for new things in the category.","LaurentGrandet","Thank you very much. And have you got the time for our second question. So I'd like to understand I mean the rest organizational change between I mean Dana McNabb moving from Cereals to Europe, I mean any update on that transition? I mean how it is, which would impact I mean European business you think. And also I mean how you fill her shoes in the US so the business that's working very well for now.","JeffHarmening","Yes. So, the transition is going smoothly. Dana is being replaced in Cereal by Ricardo Fernandez, who is an exceptional leader with really good knowledge of the Cereal category. So one of the things I feel great about is that we have a very good team of people Cereal experts here at General Mills. And I would also say Dana has had a great team in Cereal and they're remaining in place. So we've got good people in marketing and finance and operations and so the rest of that team is remaining in place and they're a very talented group. And so my expectation is that we'll continue to grow Cereal as we have in the US. Dana is a fantastic leader. She knows Europe very well. She spent time with me at CPW so I know Dana well. And so she knows the European market context. She's a very good marketer, she really likes to grow. And so looking forward to what she can do with that business and continue similar trajectory we've had on Old El Paso and maybe even improve it further and improve what we've done on bars which has been really good and Haagen-Dazs.","And then she'll have a chance to make sure we get our Yogurt business in Europe back to growth, which has underperformed along with the rest of the yogurt category. So, she's a terrific leader who understands the market and she'll be starting there in about 10 days.","End of Q&A","Jeff Siemon","All right. Bridget, I think -- unfortunately I think that's all the time we have. So, thanks everyone for your questions this morning. I know we didn't get to everyone so please feel free to follow-up over the course of the day. And Happy Holidays, everyone. Thanks for listening in this morning.","Operator","And that does conclude today's presentation. We do thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Have a great rest of the day and Happy Holidays, everyone."],"10137":["General Mills, Inc. (NYSE:GIS) Q4 2017 Earnings Conference Call June 28, 2017  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Jeff Siemon - Vice President, Investor Relations","Jeff Harmening - Chief Executive Officer","Don Mulligan - Chief Financial Officer","Ken Powell - Chairman and Former Chief Executive Officer","Analysts","Andrew Lazar - Barclays","Ken Goldman - JPMorgan","David Driscoll - Citi","Jason English - Goldman Sachs","Bryan Spillane - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Chris Growe - Stifel","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the General Mills Quarter Four Fiscal 2017 Earnings Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Wednesday, June 28, 2017.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Jeff Siemon, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Jeff Siemon","Thanks, Nelson and good morning everyone. I am here with Jeff Harmening, our new CEO and Don Mulligan, our CFO. Also here is Ken Powell, our current Chairman and former CEO, who will share a few remarks in a moment.","Before I turn the call over to them, let me cover our usual housekeeping items. Our press release on fourth quarter results was issued over the wire services earlier this morning. I\u2019ll remind you that our remarks this morning will include forward-looking statements that are based on management\u2019s current views and assumptions. The second slide in today\u2019s presentation list factors that could cause our future results to be different than our current estimates.","And before we get to our usual earnings commentary, I would like to turn the call over to Ken Powell, who last month wrapped up 10 years leading General Mills as CEO and he was continuing on as the Chairman of the Board for an interim period. We don\u2019t have time this morning to cover all of Ken\u2019s accomplishments over the past 10 years nor what he want us to. So, we will stick to just one that is near and dear to our hearts, shareholder return. During Ken\u2019s tenure as CEO, total return for General Mills\u2019 shareholders grew at an 11% compound rate, 350 basis points ahead of the broader market. So as a shareholder and an employee, I would like to say thank you for your leadership Ken and congratulations.","Ken Powell","Well, thanks Jeff and good morning to all of you. First of all, let me say what a great honor it\u2019s been to serve General Mills as CEO during the past 10 years. This is a great company with an outstanding culture of integrity, a powerful mission, a steadfast commitment to shareholders, and a never ending focus on serving our consumers. And it really has been an honor for me to serve such a terrific organization and I look forward to continuing to serve as Chair of the Board.","I am pleased with how General Mills has evolved over the past decades. We are far more global. We have added many on-trend brands to the portfolio. We have a much leaner operating structure and we have made many important strides in our commitment to the environment and sustainability. And all the while, we have continued to attract and retain the best talent in our industry. Thanks to our strong values and our performance culture. As I look at General Mills today, it\u2019s clear that we compete in a challenging era where the pace of change is greater than ever. And to win in this environment, it is absolutely imperative that we deliver innovation-driven top line growth. And you will see that from Jeff and Don as they take you through our presentation this morning and you will hear more detail at our Investor Day event on July 12. And finally, I want to thank our investors and the analyst community for your commitment to our industry and for your candid and constructive engagement with General Mills management. We appreciate everything you do and I know that Jeff and his team look forward to working closely with you in the years ahead.","So, with that, I will turn the call over to Jeff Harmening.","Jeff Harmening","Thank you, Ken and thank you for your leadership and your service to General Mills and thanks for providing outstanding guidance and mentorship to me over the years. I am honored to be taking the reigns and I am excited to write the next chapter of a book that spans a 150 years history of this great company. I am looking forward to continuing the track record of value creation that both you and your predecessors have delivered for General Mills\u2019 shareholders.","Now, let\u2019s turn back to the business for this morning\u2019s call. Fiscal \u201817 was a year of significant change for General Mills. We implemented a new global organization structure, continued our journey to become a truly global food company. We also accelerated some important cost savings efforts to improve our efficiency. These efforts went according to plan and we are happy with those results. But it\u2019s clear some actions did not go according to plan. We have pulled back too far our investment in some key categories and our overall execution was not up to our normal standards. Our sales and profit suffered as a result. Still we were able to deliver 6% constant currency growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share and we returned $2.7 billion in cash to our shareholders.","As we look forward, our top priority for fiscal \u201818 is to make significant strides toward returning our business to sustainable top line growth. Our plans call for investment and product news and innovation to accelerate growth for businesses where we have positive momentum and to improve those that are underperforming. We will also increase investment in capabilities like e-commerce and strategic revenue management, which are critical for growth today and will be in the future. With the biggest changes to our global structure and our supply chain now behind us, we expect to get back to executional excellence this year. These efforts will help us to deliver 200 to 300 basis point improvement in our net sales trends in 2018 compared to our 2017 results. On the bottom line, we expect profit and earnings per share growth to reflect strong cost savings partially offset by volume declines and investments I just mentioned.","We have made significant progress to expand our adjusted operating profit margin over the past two years. We continue to see opportunities for future of margin expansion, including an increase in adjusted operating profit margin in fiscal 2018.","But we will moderate the pace of expansion as we invest to restore top line growth. Looking forward, we are focused on delivering a balance of sales growth and margin expansion, along with strong cash conversion and cash returns to create top tier returns for our shareholders.","With that as the back drop, let me turn it over to Don to review our fiscal 2017 financials and provide details on our 2018 guidance.","Don Mulligan","Thanks, Jeff and good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s jump right into our fiscal \u201817 financial performance starting with the fourth quarter results summarized on Slide 9. Net sales totaled $3.8 million, down 3% on a reported and organic basis. Total segment operating profit totaled $673 million, up 4% in constant currency. Net earnings increased 8% to $409 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.69 as reported. Adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes certain items affecting comparability, was $0.73. Constant currency adjusted diluted EPS increased 14% versus a year ago.","Slide 10 shows the components of total company net sales growth in the quarter. Organic pound volume reduced net sales growth by 7 points and was partially offset by 4 points of positive mix and net price realization. Now, let me turn to full year fiscal \u201817 financial results. Net sales totaled $15.6 billion, down 6% as reported and down 4% on an organic basis. Total segment operating profit totaled $3 billion even, down 1% in constant currency. Net earnings decreased 2% to $1.7 billion and diluted earnings per share were $2.77 as reported. Adjusted diluted EPS was $3.08, up 6% in constant currency.","For our North America retail segment, organic net sales declined 4% in the fourth quarter, an improvement over the third quarter trend as we saw better performance in measured and non-measured channels. Full year organic net sales were down 5%. At the operating unit level, U.S. snacks posted net sales growth of 1% in the fourth quarter, an improvement over last quarter led by growth in Annie\u2019s, Nature Valley, and Larabar, which offset declines in Fiber 1. Cereal net sales were down 1% in the quarter, with growth on Lucky Charms, Cinnamon Toast Crunch and Cheerios offset by declines on Chex and Kix. U.S. meals and baking net sales decreased 1% in the quarter, with growth on Totino\u2019s hot snacks offset by declines on Pillsbury refrigerated dough. The full year net sales decline for U.S. meals and baking was due to the divestiture of Green Giant business in fiscal \u201816 as well as declines on soup and refrigerated dough.","Canada constant currency net sales increased 2% in the quarter, with growth on Old El Paso and Betty Crocker. Full year Canada constant currency net sales declined 2% due entirely to the Green Giant divestiture. U.S. yogurt net sales declined 22% in the quarter and 18% for the full year. Constant currency segment operating profit growth increased 9% in the fourth quarter behind benefits from net price realization and reduced media expenses. Full year constant currency operating profit declined 2% reflecting the impact of the Green Giant divestiture.","Fourth quarter organic net sales for our Convenience Stores & Foodservice segment were comparable to last year. This was the third consecutive quarter of sequential improvement. Full year segment organic net sales declined 3% with 2% growth on our Focus 6 platforms led by mid single-digit growth on cereal and yogurt, offset market index pricing on bakery flour and declines on frozen dough products. Segment operating profit grew 6% for the full year, driven by lower input costs and benefits from our cost savings efforts.","In Europe and Australia, organic net sales decreased 9% in the quarter and 4% for the full year. Remember that last year\u2019s fourth quarter included an extra month of results for Yoplait Europe as we aligned that business to our fiscal calendar. Excluding the difference, organic net sales would have been up low single-digits in the quarter led by growth in H\u00e4agen-Dazs and Nature Valley. Constant currency segment operating profit declined 26% in the fourth quarter and 9% for the fiscal year, impacted by the difference in reporting periods. Excluding the extra period, Europe and Australia operating profit was down mid single-digits for the full year due to currency driven inflation on imported products in the UK.","In our Asia and Latin America segment organic net sales grew 8% in the fourth quarter including a double digit percentage benefit from an extra month of results from Brazil as we aligned that business to our fiscal calendar. Good growth in China and India was offset by the continued challenging environment in Latin America. Full year organic net sales increased to 3%. Segment operating profit declined $5 million in the quarter reflecting higher SG&A expense. For the full year segment operating profit increased to $84 million from $69 million a year ago.","Turning to the full year joint venture results on Slide 16, CPW\u2019s fiscal \u201817 net sales grew 3% in constant currency with growth across all regions. H\u00e4agen-Dazs Japan constant currency net sales increased 8% for the full year driven by continued momentum on recent innovation. Combined after tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $85 million for the year, down $3 million versus last year primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency and an asset write-off for CPW, which were partially offset by volume gains on H\u00e4agen-Dazs Japan. Constant currency after tax earnings were down $5 million. We delivered on our cost saving goals for the year with cost of goods sold HMM savings totaling $390 million and aggregate savings from our previously announced projects totaling $540 million. These cost savings more than offset inflation which rounded down to 1% for the full year and help to drive strong margin expansion. Full year fiscal \u201817 adjusted gross margin was up 50 basis points and adjusted operating profit margin increased 130 basis points to 18.1% of net sales.","Turning to the balance sheet, our quarterly core working capital increased 9% year-over-year as the timing of receivables and higher inventory balances were partially offset by continued progress on accounts payable. Despite the increase in core working capital this fiscal year end, we made significant progress in reducing core working capital over the last 5 years. Since 2012 while net sales are up mid single-digits, we have driven core working capital down by over 50%. And importantly, we expect our receivables and inventory balances to normalize in fiscal \u201918. In addition, we still see opportunities for further benefits from payables which together should drive down our core working capital this year. Full year operating cash flow was $2.3 billion, down 12% from the year ago, driven by the higher core working capital balance, changes in income taxes payable and lower incentive trade and advertising costs. Fiscal \u201817 capital investments totaled $684 million as a result full year free cash flow was $1.6 billion or 86% of our adjusted after tax earnings. Over the last 3 years our cumulative free cash flow represents 97% of adjusted after tax earnings above our 95% conversion target. And we expect fiscal \u201918 cash conversion to be above that 95% as well. We paid $1.1 billion in dividends in fiscal \u201817 and dividends per share were $1.92, up 8% from last year. Net share repurchases totaled $1.5 billion and we reduced average diluted shares outstanding by 2% for the full year.","Slide 20 highlights our key assumptions for fiscal \u201818, industry trends in the U.S. in the last few quarters have been challenging and we are not planning for a significant turnaround in those trends this year. We expect our organic net sales trends will steadily improve from the first quarter to the second and improve again in the back half. We estimate we will deliver cost of goods sold HMM savings of approximately $390 million, which will more than offset input cost inflation of 3%. And we will generate $700 million of savings for our previously announced projects of roughly $160 million above fiscal \u201817 levels.","Turning on Slide 21 you can see a summary of our fiscal 2018 guidance. We expect organic net sales to decline between 1% and 2%. We plan to increase media investment for the year. We project total segment operating profits to be in the range between flat and up 1% on a constant currency basis. As Jeff mentioned upfront, we plan to expand our adjusted operating profit margin in fiscal \u201818. We expect both interest expense and our adjusted tax rate to be in line with fiscal \u201817 levels. We are targeting a net reduction of 1% to 2% in average diluted shares outstanding. We expect full year adjusted diluted earnings per share to be up between 1% and 2% in constant currency with EPS down in the first half reflecting lower sales and the phasing of our cost savings initiatives and brand investments. EPS will be up in the second half as sales trends improve. We estimate foreign currency will be $0.01 headwind to full year adjusted diluted EPS in 2018. And finally as I mentioned earlier, we are targeting to convert more than 95% of our adjusted after tax earnings to free cash flow this year.","Now, I will turn over to Jeff to provide more color on our fiscal \u201818 plans.","Jeff Harmening","Thanks Don. As we enter fiscal \u201918, it is critical that we improve our top line performance across our businesses, but specially here in the U.S. We began to see some improvement in our U.S. retail sales trends in the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201817. While our yogurt declines continued in the quarter as we expected we saw about a 1.5 point improvement in retail sales trends on the remainder of our businesses. With the best results in May driven by strong merchandising execution and lower price gaps. And we expect to drive further improvement over the course of fiscal 2018. As we shift our focus to 2018, we remain committed to our Consumer First strategy and our growth and foundation segmentation, but we now we need to make some executional changes to improve our top line performance. For example, we are leveraging our new global organization structure to make global prioritization decisions on our biggest growth platforms such as H\u00e4agen-Dazs ice cream, snack bars and natural and organic. We are investing in our brands with increased media spending and a higher level or new product innovation. And we will be in the zone on promotions and merchandising on key seasonal businesses like soup and refrigerated dough. And we will leverage our capabilities to win with growing channels and customers in the U.S. and around the world.","As I mentioned our new global structure is allowing us to make global prioritization decisions. For fiscal 2018 we have identified four global priorities that are most critical to improve our top line growth trends. First, we plan to grow our global cereal platform including CPW behind compelling product news, innovation and advertising investment. Second, we expect to improve our U.S. yogurt performance through fundamental innovation. Third, we will invest to drive differential growth across several global platforms where we have good top line momentum already. And fourth, we will manage our foundation brands with appropriate levels of investment.","Now, let me walk you through each of these priorities in a little more detail to give you better picture of our plans for fiscal 2018. There are four pieces to our global cereal platform. In fiscal \u201817, we grew net sales for cereal partners worldwide and our Convenience stores and Foodservice business. And we grew market share for a Canadian cereal business. While our U.S. retail cereal net sales were down 3%, our focus in fiscal \u201818 is to improve our U.S. retail performance while continuing to grow in the other three areas. We will do that by investing behind wellness and taste news which are two trends driving growth in the cereal globally.","Our U.S. Cereal portfolio is advantaged when it comes to wellness. Our entire line has whole grain as the number one ingredient. We removed artificial flavors and colors from almost every product. And we have the largest gluten-free portfolio in the category. In fiscal \u201818, we are going to leverage our wellness advantage by investing behind a new campaign across the Big G franchise called Good, starts with G. We are using TV and digital media to highlight our great taste from real ingredients, our whole grain, our fiber content and our large gluten-free portfolio.","For the digital component, we are using precision targeting to tailor our messages to individual consumers with an emphasis on Hispanic families and empty nesters. Wellness news was the key driver of CPW\u2019s growth last year. This year, we are increasing our media investment in wellness campaigns like whole grain number one, which is helping raising awareness of our cereals wholesome ingredients in markets around the world. We are also investing behind Cheerios campaigns that highlight the good ingredients we use, the wellness benefits consumers receive and the causes they support by buying our products. In the U.S., that includes our most recent Cheerios campaign called Good Goes Round. And in Canada, we will continue to support our effort to bring back the Bs. Wellness news is also working on our Foodservice cereal business, with net sales up mid single-digits last year driven by our K-12 schools and college and universities. We will leverage our gluten-free news and our market leading granola portfolio to drive further growth in these channels in fiscal 2018.","It\u2019s also important to note that great taste is also helping to drive growth in cereal. So, in fiscal \u201818, we will invest behind taste news across our U.S. and international brands. For an instance, on Lucky Charms, taste news is all about the marshmallows. We drove 3% retail sales growth on Lucky Charms in the U.S. this past year and we have an even stronger plan for fiscal \u201818 with four quarters of marshmallow news. In our first quarter promotion, we are offering a limited number of lucky consumers, a chance to win Lucky Charms\u2019 Holy Grail, a box of Lucky Charms with only marshmallows. Sadly, General Mills\u2019 employees are not eligible to win. The popularity of Reese\u2019s Puffs continued in fiscal \u201817 delivering 7% retail sales growth in the U.S. Reese\u2019s Puffs\u2019 consumers love chocolate and peanut butter flavor and really love the connection to their favorite sweet snack. So, we are investing in consumer messaging in 2018 to tap into that Reese\u2019s brand love. Cinnamon Toast Crunch has delivered 6% compound retail sales growth over the past 3 years. So, we are going to build on the success with a significant expansion of our Toast Crunch portfolio. We are introducing three new flavors, strawberry, blueberry and apple cinnamon that deliver exceptional taste and will invest in TV and digital advertising, coupons and in-store merchandising to generate awareness for the expanded franchise.","And finally, our taste cereals and CPW are also driving growth. And we will look to extend that success in fiscal \u201818. For example, we will expand our recent launch of Lion Wild into new geographies and channels. So by investing in our wellness and taste news and increasing our level of new product innovation, we believe that we can generate growth for our global cereal portfolio in fiscal 2018. We continue to believe that U.S. yogurt is an attractive growth category, with per capita consumption still well below levels in Western Europe and Canada. We help build the category over the last four decades by bringing fundamental innovation that introduced new benefits and expanded yogurt\u2019s consumer base. For instance, we developed blended yogurts that improved the taste profile of the category. We led the development of the light segment with Yoplait Light, targeted toward weight managers and we led the kids segment by creating yogurt in a tube. But we were late to respond as Greek yogurt developed early in this decade and our sales have suffered as a result. It is clear that our path to returning our U.S. yogurt unit to growth is to get back to leading fundamental innovation that helps build new segments and bring new consumers to the category.","So, let me introduce to you, We by Yoplait. This is a new style of yogurt to the U.S. market and has its roots in our French heritage. We use the traditional French recipe with whole milk and real fruit and flavors carefully cultured in glass jars over an 8-hour period. The resulting product is delicate and smooth and satisfies consumers\u2019 growing interest in yogurts that deliver remarkable taste with just a few simple ingredients. We have created a full line of 8 delicious flavors and we are leveraging our scale to deliver our product at a price point that is premium, but affordable. We are supporting this launch with a full surround of TV and digital advertising as well as in-store sampling. We by Yoplait will lead the development of an emerging yogurt segment, which we call, Simply Better. This is an important step in improving our U.S. yogurt performance, reshaping our portfolio and helping the category return to growth. These products are beginning shipping this week. So, look for them soon in your local stores.","In addition to building new yogurt segments, we are expanding our portfolio into fast growing emerging segments in the category. One of these is organic yogurts. We have entered the segment last year with Annie\u2019s and Libert\u00e9. These products are performing well on shelf and we are focusing on continuing to build distribution in 2018. And we will expand our portfolio with innovation on Annie\u2019s in the back half of the year. We also see an opportunity to drive growth with yogurt products that target snacking occasion. This year, we are expanding our yogurt snacking portfolio by launching 6 flavors of Yoplait mix sense, which bring a fun snacking option to the taste-oriented consumer who loves traditional Yoplait yogurt. We are excited about these initiatives, but they will only represent a portion of the news and innovation pipeline that we have developed for U.S. yogurt. We will talk more about some more initiatives at Investor Day and throughout the year.","Our third global priority centers on four global platforms, where we see differential growth opportunities. They are H\u00e4agen-Dazs ice cream, snack bars, primarily under Nature Valley, Fiber 1 and Larabar brands, Old El Paso Mexican foods and our platform of natural and organic brands in North America. Collectively, these platforms represent roughly $4 billion in net sales and we see great prospects for growth for fiscal \u201818. On H\u00e4agen-Dazs, we have a leading super premium brand in the large and fast growing global ice cream category and we have excellent manufacturing and distribution scale. We see considerable opportunity for H\u00e4agen-Dazs to grow penetration through new occasions, to expand existing product line through innovation, and to enter into new geographies. The impulse segment is the largest and one of the fastest growing segments in the ice cream category and we have just recently entered with our line of stick bars. Their performance helped drive double-digit retail sales growth in Europe last year.","In fiscal \u201818, we have planned to aggressively expand stick bar distribution around the world and we have launched new many stick bars to continue our growth. We also continue to innovate in our core cup and pint lines. We are rolling out of the host of new products this year like mini cups in the UK and fruit and flower flavors in Asia. And we have incremental growth opportunities for H\u00e4agen-Dazs through geographic expansion. Last year, we launched the brand in Australia, one of the highest ice cream consumption markets in the world. It\u2019s off to a great start and we will continue to expand the brand\u2019s awareness and distribution presence in fiscal \u201818.","Turning to snack bars, we see tremendous opportunities for growth on our brands both in the U.S. and internationally. In fiscal \u201818 we are increasing our innovation levels on Natural Valley and U.S. retail outlets, with plans to launch more than 20 new items. We are getting behind coconut, one of the fastest growing flavors in snack bars with their launch of toasted coconut sweet and salty nut bars and coconut butter Nature Valley biscuit sandwiches. We also recently brought Nature Valley granola cups to Convenience stores and Foodservice channels and they are off to a great start. And we are supporting all of this activity with a double-digit increase and media on the brand.","We are also extending our long track record of growth on Larabar. We are launching a crunchy line of Larabar nut and seed bars and we are also bringing news to the highly incremental Larabar Bites line with two new flavors caramel sea salt and Chocolate Hazelnut. We are increasing our Larabar consumer investment double digits and we are targeting a 30% increase in distribution this year. The snack bar categories in Europe and Australia is also large, still pursuing the same innovation led strategy in Europe that made us market leaders in the U.S. Innovation on Fiber 1 and renovation on our Nature Valley protein lines drove strong double digit retail sales growth on snack bars in Europe this year. This year we are borrowing another highly successful U.S. innovation by launching Nature Valley nut butter biscuits, which will hit shelves in the UK this fall.","Retail sales for Old El Paso grew in the U.S., Canada and Europe last year driven by great innovation and marketing that highlights the brand\u2019s convenience, taste and connection to fresh ingredients. Our Stand 'N Stuff innovation has led growth for the brand and we are continuing to innovate on this platform finding new ways to create new eating occasions. We launched Stand 'N Stuff minis in Europe last year to help consumers to create taco advertisers and this year we are introducing Stand 'N Stuff mini kits to help consumers to create taco tastings with a variety of sauces and ingredients included on the kits. We are also supporting the brand around the world with strong levels of media.","Our net sales for our North America natural and organic portfolio including our fast growing Libert\u00e9 brand in Canada have already reached more than $1 billion and there is still room to grow. For example, Annie\u2019s, our largest natural and organic brand grew penetration almost 60% last year, entered four new categories nationally and grew distribution by double digits yet at only 16% household penetration, significant upside remains. We have a broad set of plans in fiscal \u201818 across our natural and organic platform. I already mentioned our plans on Larabar and our U.S. yogurt brands.","On Annie\u2019s we are growing in snacks including our recent entry into ready to eat popcorn and we will continue this rollout in fiscal \u201918. In Canada, we are launching Libert\u00e9 Crunch which combines crunchy inclusions with Libert\u00e9\u2019s market leading Greek yogurts. Net sales for our Epic Provisions brand of natural meat snacks doubled last year. We have recently launched jerky sticks and expanded into salty snacks and we are continuing to grow distribution for this on trend brand. In total, we are excited about these differential growth platforms and our segments have put sufficient resources behind them to accelerate their growth in fiscal 2018.","Our fourth priority is managing our foundation brands with appropriate levels of investment. We missed the mark last year on our promotional spending on soup and refrigerated dough. So in fiscal \u201818 is to be \u2013 our goal is to be in the zone on pricing during the key season. We are not looking to win on price and we won\u2019t go back to the levels of investment from 2 years ago. But we know we need to be more competitive this year. In addition, we are continuing to invest in targeted consumer news where we see strong returns. This fall we are launching a line of organic soups under the Progresso brand, combining our organic expertise with Progresso\u2019s top soup flavors. And we are taking refrigerated dough out of the can with two new varieties of Pillsbury pizza dough. In addition to our four global growth priorities, I mentioned that we are investing in capabilities and focused on winning with growing channels and customers in 2018. One example of this is e-commerce. We have a strong e-commerce team who has invested in tools and capabilities and secured strategic partnerships with leading e-commerce retailers. As a result our e-commerce sales grew 62% in the U.S. last year, 32% globally and our market shares online over indexed versus our market shares in bricks-and-mortar. Shawn O'Grady will provide more details on our e-commerce capabilities globally at our Investor Day in two weeks.","So let me close today\u2019s remarks by summarizing our key messages. Fiscal \u201817 was a challenging year, but we finished the fourth quarter in line with our expectations with organic net sales improvement in three of our four operating segments. In fiscal \u201818 we are investing in our brands and capabilities to significantly improve our top line growth trends. We are moderating the pace of margin expansion as we focus on top line improvement. And we remain committed to our Consumer First strategy and our shareholder return model which balances sales growth and margin expansion with a disciplined focus on cash.","With that we will open up the call for questions. Operator, can you please get us started.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed.","Andrew Lazar","Good morning everybody and congratulations again Ken.","Ken Powell","Hi. Thank Andrew.","Andrew Lazar","Two quick questions for me if I could, I guess first off, I want to go back to the outlook for \u201818, I think you discussed not assuming category trends that will differ much or will be similar to what you saw in fiscal \u201817 and \u2013 so I am trying to get a sense if that\u2019s based on just a follow-up process that that\u2019s where trends are now and I guess I am getting at is there an understanding by let\u2019s say General Mills or even the industry as a whole of maybe what\u2019s cause this more significant down shift in the industry category trends through the beginning of this calendar year or is that expectation now based on a more let\u2019s say data based understanding of, this is really the underlying rate of where category growth is going to be for the foreseeable future, maybe the first one?","Jeff Harmening","So Andrew what I will say is that our assumptions for category growth are based on our projections as we look forward and wanting to make sure that we are reasonable on our assumptions as we look for our growth in fiscal \u201818. And our 200 basis point to 300 basis point improvement in our sales trends is really on trying to hit on being more competitive in the categories that we are in and not expecting our categories to improve dramatically, so it really is a reflection of our belief that we need to get back to competitiveness in the markets where we are in. But it\u2019s not predicated on markets improving dramatically and we just wanted to make sure that we were sufficiently conservative I suppose on our estimates on that and clear that our main focus really is to get back to competitiveness in the markets where we are in.","Andrew Lazar","Okay. Thanks for that. And the FY \u201818 organic sales guidance seems prudent given the year we are coming off of, I guess we have had some questions about whether in 2018 whether that\u2019s the year perhaps may be to promise less in the way of actual earnings growth given the need for more reinvestment what\u2019s expected to be somewhat of a back half loaded year from an earnings growth standpoint and still likely negative volume leverage on the P&L, so perhaps you can just talk us through a little bit more of your thinking along these lines and sort of what bridges to the EPS growth given and I think you also have if I am not mistaken like $40 million incentive comp headwind as well that you may have mentioned on the last quarter, so I am just trying to get sense if all that comes together and gives you the comfort that you can do you need to do to get back to top line growth even in the context of delivering some earnings growth?","Jeff Harmening","Let me take the first part of the question and talk a little bit about top line growth and how that relates to earnings and then I will turn it over to Don to talk about how that reflects back to EPS. But on the top line growth, we feel good about our ability to generate the top line growth we have suggested. And it\u2019s really based on a few key elements that I touched on. One is certainly that our media expense is going to grow this year where it was down double digits last year. And our new product innovation is going to be higher and we are going to be in the zone on pricing for some key brands. I would also say that we weren\u2019t very pleased with our execution this past year and we are highly confident that we are going to be to execute well this year, because we had our plans set later in the year. So on the top line, we are convinced that we can deliver the 200 basis points to 300 basis points improvement that we see. Having said that to the extent that, we find opportunities that have a high return as the year unfolds, we will certainly be glad to reinvest and to continue to try to grow our top line further than that if we see that there are good opportunities to deliver a good return. On the operating profit side I mean top line certainly is our top goal, but we are also committed to continuing to deliver margin expansion and the plan that we laid out reflects that. And we have got very good HMM as we have for the past decade and we have some other sources of cost efficiency which you see coming through. So we are remaining disciplined on the cost side and making sure that we have enough media and trade and innovation support to improve the business that we would look at. How that translates into EPS, I will let Don take that from there.","Don Mulligan","Yes. So, Andrew, as we have talked about in the call, there is several things contributing to profit improvement next year, HMM at $390 million will exceed our inflation, even though inflation will be elevated in F \u201818 versus F \u201817 and 3%. And we have another $160 million in cost savings \u2013 incremental cost savings coming through. In addition, while our price mix will be less of a contributor in \u201818 than in \u201817 it will still be a positive contributor. So, we have those three positives. It will be offset by volume declines still in the year and that will be particularly felt in the early part of the year. In Q1, for example, we expect our organic sales to closely near what we saw in \u201817, for example. And then we will see investments. An investment will span a number of areas. We have talked about media being up and that will certainly be one. But we are also investing in things like taking Yoplait to more cities in China to expanding our H\u00e4agen-Dazs stick bar business, geographic expansion in Europe, building capabilities like e-commerce and SRM and getting started on our process transformation work. And these will show up \u2013 they won\u2019t all show up in media and I want to make that clear, while media will be up, many of these investments will be seen in COGS or in SG&A, but that will be \u2013 that is embedded in the guidance. And then as you mentioned, incentive, which I think next year is going to be about $45 million to $50 million drag. So, the combination of those things allows us to be comfortable with the flat to plus 1 SOP. The EPS will expand a bit more, because it will benefit from the share reduction of 1% or 2%. And that\u2019s really the biggest driver between SOP growth and EPS growth next year.","Andrew Lazar","Great. Thanks, everybody. See you in New York.","Don Mulligan","Thanks, Andrew.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Ken Goldman","Hi, good morning and Ken, best wishes from me as well.","Ken Powell","Thanks.","Ken Goldman","Question I guess for both you and Jeff, initially, one of the reasons behind driving cost savings was to generate fuel that would be reinvested in the business and push revenues even higher sort of generating that virtuous cycle. So, in a way this is a sort of symbiotic to pursue sales growth and margin expansion at the same time. And I think it\u2019s still the case, but the way you are talking about these goals now, where the company needs to balance the effort to grow margin versus growing sales. That\u2019s slightly different, right. It almost implies that the goals are somewhat mutually exclusive in a sense. So, I am just curious am I reading that right? Has something changed? And if so, why is it harder for the company than it thought to drive this virtuous cycle with cost savings really sparking investments in driving that top line? It\u2019s a little bit different wording from you guys than what it used to be. I am just trying to sort of figure it out a little bit.","Jeff Harmening","Yes, Ken, this is Jeff. So, thanks for the question. What I would say is that on the \u2013 we are still dedicated to both growth on the top line and becoming more efficient and we do not think I am usually exclusive. So, this coming year, I mean, our intent is to grow our top line by 200 to 300 basis points, whilst continuing to still grow our margins. So, I want to be clear to everyone that we still intend to do that. What you see is that when we talk about the muted margin growth, it really is a reflection primarily of pricing and the pricing that we were hoping to get this past year, but in this current environment, it\u2019s really challenging. And so as we look at our cost savings initiatives, whether they are HMM or other initiatives, we feel great about those and great about our ability to deliver those. The thing that has really changed from a year ago is that we are anticipating that we can generate more pricing in the current environment. And that pricing has certainly deteriorated over the past year and the pricing environment was not what we anticipated. And so what you hear from us really is that, our strategy is basically the same. We don\u2019t think that there is a dichotomy between choosing growth over our margins, but that our ability to take pricing has impacted our ability to generate the margins we had originally anticipated. We are still proud of the margin growth we have generated over the past few years, 200 basis points of margin growth and we will continue that margin growth journey, but that\u2019s really the big difference. And we also know I suppose that really getting back to supporting our brands the way we need to is going to be important to our top line growth to create the virtuous cycle that we are looking for.","Ken Goldman","Thank you. That is helpful. And then quick follow-up from me and I know you touched on this a little bit, but just to get a little more color, your sales in North America retail this past quarter, they were meaningfully higher than what the scanner data would have suggested. Can you just walk us through again some of the drivers of that gap? Again, I know it\u2019s not exact, but just helping us out directionally would be appreciated.","Jeff Harmening","Yes. Look, I appreciate you asked that question. I am guessing that there are others on the line probably have the same one. So, we saw about a 3 point gap in our sales between our movement and our RNS in North America here in the last quarter. And the most important thing I want to leave you with is that only about 10% of that gap is shipments ahead of consumption. And of that, that was primarily cereal for June merchandising. And we ended the year in 2017 about the same place we did the prior year. So, there is not a big inventory build up would then brings the question, okay, then what\u2019s the rest of the 90%? And about 40% of that is growth in non-measured channels that are not contained in Nielsen and we have seen an acceleration in growth. I have told you we feel good about our e-commerce business and certainly we are growing well there. And so our growth in unmeasured channels has increased to about 100 to 150 basis point gap between what we had seen before. So, that\u2019s about 40% of the difference that you see. And the other 50% is not so intuitive, but it\u2019s really important than that. The pounds gap was only about 1.5 points and that\u2019s because the price mix in Nielsen is different than what we see in our business. And probably that is due to some margin compression on the part of retailers and so as they compete in the marketplace. And so it is not so intuitive, but I guess it\u2019s important to note. So, on the pound basis, that really covers the other 50%.","Ken Goldman","Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi. Please proceed.","David Driscoll","Great. Thank you. Good morning. And Ken, I would like to wish you all the best and congratulations on retirement.","Ken Powell","Thanks a lot.","David Driscoll","Okay. So want to just get into little bit of follow-ups from I think what Andrew was asking about, but I want to take it in a slightly different direction. When you think about the fiscal \u201817 organic revenue and volume declines of negative 4% and negative 7% respectively, how much of this is self-inflicted, if I can use that phrase versus broader industry trends? And I see like that\u2019s still not entirely clear. You made many statements about the execution wasn\u2019t what you want, but I am trying to get a sense here of, do you think half of the problems that have happened on the top line are something that were generated internally by decisions the company made? And a follow-up if I may.","Jeff Harmening","Look, I\u2019d say David it\u2019s a good question. Look, I think that certainly more than half of the businesses we saw were due to the decisions that we made in the execution that we saw. And you see that primarily in our soup and refrigerated dough businesses and how much market share we lost this past year whereas in the year before we actually gained share in both of those categories. And it\u2019s really hard for innovation and other ideas to work when your pricing it so off. And I would say that the reductions we made in spending in yogurt, which we had anticipated were certainly part of the challenge as well. The part that was not necessarily self-inflicted, but we are going to have work to correct this next year was our innovation in yogurt, we know we have needed to improve. And so as we look at this past year, certainly more than 50% of our challenges were things that we think are entirely fixable. In fact, we think the vast majority are entirely fixable this year to make us more competitive. And the environment itself, yes, it was a little more challenging at F \u201817 than the years before. It\u2019s about 1.5 points less than it was in the year before in terms of the market and we are expecting the F \u201818 category to be about the same as F \u201817 but honestly we think the vast majority of our challenges are correctible both in the U.S. and other places as well.","David Driscoll","Well, I think that\u2019s really good to hear. And my follow-up would just simply be then when we look at the guidance and its negative revenue growth on top of the negative revenue growth, the self-inflicted items would seemingly be things that would turn into, I thought as people don\u2019t like this phrase, but easy comps. And then just the ability to see a rebound in some of these categories, because we feel like that\u2019s in the forecast, would you agree with the idea that you are \u2013 last year it didn\u2019t go so well, so you need to set out a forecast here that\u2019s extremely reasonable and gives you cushion here kind of day one, is that I don\u2019t know how you would like to phrase it, but from the outside perspective, we are trying to judge the degree of difficulty of hitting the forecast you laid out today? Thank you.","Jeff Harmening","Well, the \u2013 a couple of things I mean certainly our comps are easier especially in the second and third quarter. But we actually don\u2019t allow that as a reason to get back to growth here in the building here at Minneapolis, so well it may be true. What we are focus on are the fundamental actions we are going to take. And Jon Nudi and his team have done a great job putting together a plan that we are highly confident in. And in terms of the have we set a mark we can hit, yes we have given guidance that we are confident that we can hit. And looking to the extent that we can exceed it, we will certainly try to exceed it. But what we don\u2019t want to do is try to jump out of our shoes with outrageous category expectations from the beginning. We would rather [ph] make sure that we have category assumptions and growth assumptions that are reasonable and build on those. And that\u2019s what we have done in this plan both on the earnings side and on the growth side.","Don Mulligan","And the other thing that I would add David is that there is momentum we have take into consideration and as you saw F \u201817 unfold, we saw some negative momentum in Q2 and Q3, we began turning that in Q4, but it doesn\u2019t turn overnight and so we will continue to see that momentum improve as year unfolds that\u2019s why I indicated earlier Q1 we don\u2019t expect to see a lot better performance than in Q4, but we expect Q2 to be better and the second half to be better still. So our expectation is that we exit F \u201818 on much better footing than we are today and certainly that will help us get to that guidance.","David Driscoll","That\u2019s good color. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.","Jason English","Hey, good morning folks. Thanks for squeezing me in. And let me echo the sentiment to Ken. Ken, congratulations, best wishes.","Ken Powell","Thanks Jason. Thank you.","Jason English","Yes. It sounds like you are just going to be out golfing everyday you still got your hands fold for sure.","Ken Powell","Maybe every other day.","Jason English","That\u2019s okay. Yes, I will take that. I am jealous. Alright, back to the issues at hand, you mentioned sort of the current pricing environment and obviously there has been a lot of consternation around that of late with some of the pressure we are seeing on private label, some of the pressure we are seeing with retail margins, etcetera, but contrast with your results, I mean the pricing that you have achieved in North America is frankly impressive in this environment, can you unpack that a bit for us how much was mix and how much was real pricing and how much was trade and give us little more context in terms of what you are seeing and what you expect on the forward?","Don Mulligan","Jason, I appreciate the positive comments on our pricing as we said we got a little ahead of ourselves in some cases and hurt on the volume side. But we are pleased that we need to get the pricing in place it was an important contributor this year being \u201817. I won\u2019t bring up precisely the price and mix, but one other things that you see in the pricing is that as we did less merchandising and we had more base line it was a positive mix from that standpoint and it\u2019s also positive mix from a product and category standpoint that helped as the year unfolded. Looking forward, we still expect to see price mix benefit in F \u201817 \u2013 it\u2019s F \u201818. Thank you, Jeff. As I said for the total company it would be less than in \u201817 and it\u2019s really driven by North America and we expect it to be positive, but lower and as Jeff alluded to it\u2019s really about getting in the right zone on some key brands and particularly Pillsbury and Progresso. But we expect the other segments actually to be up on price mix in F \u201818. Our Convenience and Foodservice business will see a stronger bakery flour pricing as that recovers, we are going to be pricing for some higher inflation which includes the Brexit impact in the UK and higher dairy inflation and obviously in Asia and Lat-Am have a lot of the emerging market inflation that comes through us in pricing. So we expect price mix to still be a contributor in \u201818 albeit at a slightly lower level than we saw in \u201817.","Jason English","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And then one other sort of really high level question and it pertains to you, but it also pertains to the industry at large, because the pattern is pretty pervasive, but speaking to you specifically over the last 5 years or 6 years advertising media spend shrunk by around 30%.","Over that same duration your North America retail volume shrunk by nearly 20%, is the relationship there or I guess why shouldn\u2019t we believe there is a relationship there and if we do underwrite to view this relationship, shouldn\u2019t there be a need for the industry at large including yourselves to really pull back a lot more money into really getting back to nurturing the brands here?","Jeff Harmening","Well, Jason that\u2019s a good question. I am not \u2013 although I am not going to speak on behalf of the industry, let me talk about us. And of course as I need to make sure that we nurture the brands. And I think that\u2019s a really good point and that\u2019s exactly what we are going to be doing in F\u201818 and that\u2019s why our media spending is up a little bit but there is a lot of ways to nurture brands and to grow them. I mean it\u2019s also why we have to have our pricing into the zone, because lot of media spending if your pricing isn\u2019t the right place it doesn\u2019t really work that\u2019s why innovation is going to grow, that\u2019s why we are building capability in e-commerce and strategic revenue management. So I think you are right on the point that we need to make sure that we continue to nurture our brands. Media is one element, but so is getting our pricing right, making sure our innovation is on point, that\u2019s why our Consumer First strategy is important and that\u2019s why we are continuing to build our capabilities especially in e-commerce.","Jason English","Thanks a lot guys and see you soon.","Jeff Harmening","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.","Bryan Spillane","Hey, good morning everyone.","Jeff Harmening","Good morning.","Bryan Spillane","I guess just two quick \u2013 two follow-ups I guess to some of the previous questions and I guess first just to Jason English is question is a question about spending, so the reinvestment in 2018, should we think of that as sort of being base level of spending that you will grow off of in \u201819 and beyond or is it more episodic, you are kind of increasing spending this year, but you will have to maintain those levels going forward?","Don Mulligan","Bryan, I think you should think about \u2013 I think as we think about our investment in you have Jason and I think you are referring to media, but we would say more broadly is we expect our investment behind our brands to go ahead of our sales levels. And you are seeing that in F\u201818 and I think it is more or less for \u201819 and \u201820 you should assume the same.","Bryan Spillane","Okay. And then I guess the second just to follow-up I think it was to Ken Goldman\u2019s question \u2013 response to Ken Goldman\u2019s question earlier, Jeff you talked about how in that gap to the Nielsen data that 50% of it is maybe retail or margin, why wouldn\u2019t we be concern that doesn\u2019t become an issue maybe for the manufacturers or for General Mills, if there is a need for the retailer to be investing in price I guess or spending more and the retail trends aren\u2019t very good, right, the store traffic isn\u2019t good, why wouldn\u2019t we have to maybe be concerned that there may be a need for more investment at retail?","Jeff Harmening","Well. I can only forecast ahead of what\u2019s going to happen as always \u2013 always a tricky business. I mean, for me the retailers\u2019 voice has been competitive. And even if this past quarter, we saw a tick-up in competitive activity. I mean I guess I would always say that you hope for decades, I mean retail grocery industry has been really competitive. And I assume it would be really competitive going forward. And the way that we win is through great brands, well articulated through marketing and great product innovation. And I think that as long as we continue to do that, we will see success maybe we have been doing on H\u00e4agen-Dazs and we have seen success. We done on Lucky Charms this year and we saw success. We have done on Old El Paso and we saw success. We have done it on Annie\u2019s and we saw success. So even though it wasn\u2019t the year we wanted and some businesses didn\u2019t work the way we wanted, I will say that we have a number of businesses around the world that met or exceeded expectations. And the similarity among all of them is that we got great brands, we got great products, we invested behind them and we innovated as well, that\u2019s the combination I think as long as we do that then we will like the results we see.","Bryan Spillane","Alright. Thank you.","Jeff Harmening","We are trying for one more question here.","Operator","Alright. Thank you our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please proceed.","Chris Growe","Thank you. Good morning.","Jeff Harmening","Good morning.","Chris Growe","I just offer my congratulations to you as well, Ken. Wish you all the best there.","Ken Powell","It\u2019s my pleasure.","Chris Growe","Sure. Thank you. So just make it quick here, I just had \u2013 I wanted to ask and I think we have all kind of asked this in some form, but as you think about the pressure against the consumer this year whether it\u2019s merchandising activity or obviously some increase in media expense, how much of that broadly growing in fiscal \u201818? It\u2019s going to be up as a percentage of sales it sounds like, how much \u2013 can you give a little more quantification on how much that could be growing this year?","Don Mulligan","Well, Chris, I am not going to, I guess, quantify it for you, but again as I listed to Andrew\u2019s question, we have some margin improvement pluses coming through in HMM over inflation in the cost projects and in price mix and even offsetting some of that with volume declines, I mean, there is still a pretty significant gap between that and the earnings expectations we have for the year and that gap is really filled by the investments that we expect to be making.","Chris Growe","Okay. And then just from a high level standpoint, there has been a lot of discussion about the Amazon, the Whole Foods potential acquisition and merger and certainly a lot of questions from investors, what they could mean for your companies. I know one of the things you are doing is investing in e-commerce this year. So, not an in-depth question here, but just to understand kind of what that means to you and kind of a preparation of General Mills and kind of where they stand in preparation for an increase in e-commerce sales as that occurs here in the near future?","Jeff Harmening","No, thanks for that question, Chris, I mean, obviously, it\u2019s one that\u2019s on the minds of lot of people these days and has been for us for long time. I think with regard to e-commerce, I think there is couple of key things on a high level to keep in mind. The first is that where we have engaged in e-commerce, whether it\u2019s here in the U.S. Our sales online have broadly outperformed our sales in the store. And so we feel good about our ability to win in e-commerce environment. The second is that if e-commerce is going to be broad across many customers, there is not just going to be one customer, even though that lot of talk about the Amazon and Whole Foods deal, I mean, all of our major customers have e-commerce components. As we have experienced around the world, there are variety of customers who participate in e-commerce and so it\u2019s not going to be just one winner. The third is that we have got great relationship specifically with Amazon and we have got great relationships with Whole Foods. In fact, some people will probably be surprised to know that we are actually vendor of the year for 2 years in a row with Whole Foods and we have our e-commerce growth has been \u2013 we have been really pleased with it. And our growth \u2013 and our natural and organic are really pleased with it. And so if those are two trends that are going to continue, we feel like we have done our job so far. But look, that\u2019s going to continue to evolve. And though we are satisfied with what we have done so far, we are going to keep evolving as the marketplace evolves. So, we feel like we are pretty well positioned.","Chris Growe","The investments you are making say this year that puts you in a position where you are ready to accelerate the growth in e-commerce. So, is this an ongoing sort of related investment for General Mills?","Jeff Harmening","Well, I think that Chris, I think that the growth in e-commerce, especially here in the U.S., but is going to accelerate. And so to the extent that accelerates, then we will accelerate our investment broadly in e-commerce, but really with the growth of the e-commerce business. But we see growth in e-commerce here in the U.S. as really prevalent in China and Korea. I mean, that\u2019s where we see the highest penetration of e-commerce and food and growth. So, we expect that channel to continue to grow.","Chris Growe","Okay, thank you.","Jeff Siemon","Great. I know we didn\u2019t get to everyone. So, please I am around all day, give me a ring and happy to answer any additional questions. Thanks so much for your time this morning.","Operator","Thank you.

You can also find slides on our website that supplement this morning\u2019s presentation. I\u2019ll remind you that our remarks this morning will include forward-looking statements that are based on management\u2019s current views and assumptions, and the second slide in today\u2019s presentation lists factors that could cause our future results to be different than our current estimates.","With that, I\u2019ll turn you over to my colleagues, beginning with Don.","Don Mulligan","Thanks Jeff, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss our first quarter fiscal \u201917 results. ","General Mills\u2019 performance in the first quarter was mixed. We made good progress against our 2017 adjusted operating profit margin and adjusted diluted EPS goals, but as Ken will tell you, our organic net sales results did not meet our expectations. We expect our sales growth to improve in the balance of the year as we see continued growth in certain businesses and as we execute a number of consumer first actions across our portfolio. We\u2019ll also lap easier net sales comps in the remainder of the year.","Over the course of our remarks this morning, we\u2019ll note the businesses that saw particularly challenging comparisons this quarter. On the bottom line, we continue to progress towards our 20% adjusted operating profit margin goal, and we announced further margin expansion initiatives in July. We are reaffirming full-year fiscal \u201917 growth targets today.","Let me review our performance in the quarter. Slide 5 summarizes first quarter fiscal \u201917 financial results. Net sales totaled $3.9 billion, down 7% as reported. Organic net sales declined 4%. Total segment operating profit totaled $787 million, down 4% on a constant currency basis. Recall that in last year\u2019s first quarter, our total segment operating profit increased 23% in constant currency. Net earnings decreased 4% to $409 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.67 as reported. Adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes certain items affecting comparability, was $0.78. Constant currency adjusted diluted EPS decreased 1% compared to last year\u2019s results that grew 36%.","Slide 6 shows the components of total company net sales growth. Organic net sales declined 4% in the quarter, driven by lower organic pound volume growth, partially offset by two points of positive organic sales mix and net price realization. Foreign currency translation reduced net sales growth by one point, and the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures reduced net sales growth by an additional two points in the quarter.","Turning to first quarter segment results, total U.S. retail net sales declined 8%. The snacks operating unit posted 2% net sales growth driven by excellent performance on Annie\u2019s and Larabar. This was offset by declines in the other operating units. Organic net sales were down 5% from year-ago levels that were up 1%. The difference between reported and organic net sales results in U.S. retail primarily reflects the divestiture of Green Giant in fiscal \u201916.","In our convenience stores and food service segment, net sales declined 7% in the first quarter. Net sales in our Focus 6 businesses were down 1% versus last year primarily due to slower trends in convenience store channel, timing of customer orders for back to school, and a comparison against 9% growth a year ago. Yogurt, cereal, and biscuits posted the strongest growth in the Focus 6 platforms. Net sales declined 12% on our non-Focus 6 businesses driven by market index pricing on bakery flour. ","Slide 9 summarizes our international segment net sales results in constant currency and on an organic basis. At the region level, constant currency net sales in Latin America grew 3% driven by strong snacks performance in Brazil and benefits from pricing. Net sales in the Asia Pacific region increased 1% in constant currency, reflecting low-single-digit growth in China. Canada sales were down 2% in constant currency. Excluding the Green Giant divestiture, constant currency net sales in Canada were up low-single digits. In Europe, sales were down 6% as we lapped 7% growth in last year\u2019s first quarter behind the Haagen Dazs stick bar launch and good growth from Yoplait\u2019s 50th anniversary news. On an organic basis, first quarter international segment net sales declined 1%.","First quarter adjusted gross margin decreased 30 basis points from last year\u2019s results that were up 290 basis points. For the full year, we continue to target $380 million of cost of goods sold HMM, which will more than offset our expectations of 2% input cost inflation. For the first quarter, adjusted operating profit margin expanded 80 basis points to 19.2% due in part to double-digit reductions in media spending on our foundation businesses and in U.S. yogurt, as well as incremental benefits from our cost savings initiatives, including zero-base budgeting.","Slide 11 details our segment operating profit results in the first quarter. As I mentioned, total segment operating profit was down 4% in constant currency. U.S. retail segment operating profit declined 6% from year-ago levels that were up 38%. Constant currency international profit declined 11% due to currency driven inflation on products imported to Canada and the U.K. Convenience stores and food service profit was up 16% driven by lower input costs, higher grain merchandising earnings, and a comparison against a 9% decline in last year\u2019s first quarter. ","Combined after-tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $24 million in the quarter, down 10% in constant currency primarily due to unfavorable mix and higher promotional expense as well as a comparison to a 16% growth in last year\u2019s first quarter. CPW net sales grew 1% in constant currency with good gains in the Latin America and Asia, Africa and Middle East regions. Haagen Dazs Japan constant currency sales essentially matched year-ago results - they were up 9%.","Slide 13 summarizes other noteworthy income statement items in the quarter. We incurred $86 million in restructuring and project-related charges in the quarter, including $27 million recorded in cost of sales. Corporate unallocated expenses, excluding certain items affecting comparability, decreased by $14 million in the quarter. Net interest expense decreased 2% from the prior year. We continue to expect full-year interest expense will be flat to last year. ","The effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.9% as reported. Excluding items affecting comparability, the tax rate was 31.4%, 90 basis points below last year due to discrete state tax benefits and favorable impacts of U.S. federal tax legislation passed in fiscal \u201916. We continue to expect our full-year tax rate will be 100 basis points higher than last year due to foreign tax credits and favorable settlements.","Average diluted shares outstanding declined 1% in the quarter, in line with our full-year expectation of a 1% to 2% reduction. ","Turning to the balance sheet, Slide 14 shows that our core working capital decreased 33% versus last year\u2019s first quarter, primarily due to continued operational improvements across our businesses as well as the impact of the Green Giant divestiture. First quarter operating cash flow was $299 million, down from $431 million a year ago, largely driven by timing of payables. Capital investments in the quarter totaled $154 million. We remain on track to grow full year free cash flow mid-single digits, in line with our original guidance. We returned $627 million to shareholders through dividends and net share repurchases in the first quarter.","We continue to make progress on our margin expansion goal. In July, we announced a number of new restructuring actions that will further support this effort. We plan to close our soup factory in Vineland, New Jersey in order to eliminate excess capacity in our U.S. retail supply chain. We expect this action will be completed by the end of fiscal \u201919. Additionally, we are eliminating excess capacity and exiting unprofitable businesses in our international segment. In Brazil, we\u2019ll close one of our snacks manufacturing facilities and we\u2019ll cease production operations on certain snacks and meals products at another facility. We\u2019re also restructuring our snacks business in China and have plans to stop production on certain underperforming products in that market. We expect these actions to be completed by the end of fiscal \u201917.","Our progress on margin expansion in the first quarter gives us increased confidence that we can achieve our goal of 20% adjusted operating profit margin by fiscal \u201918. As we outlined in our investor day presentation in July, we see our margin expansion coming in three primary areas. First, we expect cost of goods sold HMM to outpace input cost inflation in fiscal \u201917. Second, we now expect to deliver $620 million in savings from the administrative and supply chain restructuring initiatives we\u2019ve announced to date, as well as the implementation of zero-base budgeting. This represents an incremental $270 million of savings over the next two years. Third, we\u2019re implementing a number of additional initiatives, including trade and consumer spending efficiency, SKU optimization, and further savings from our supply chain and our ZBB efforts. We estimate the previously announced cost savings projects and the other new initiatives will combine to generate about 75% of our margin expansion in fiscal \u201917 and \u201918 in roughly equal measure, with the balance coming from our cost of goods HMM savings exceeding input cost inflation in fiscal \u201917. ","Let me close my portion of our remarks by reiterating that we are reaffirming the fiscal \u201917 guidance we outlined in June, namely we expect organic net sales growth to be between flat and down 2%; we\u2019re targeting total segment operating profit growth of 6 to 8% on a constant currency basis with adjusted operating profit margin expansion of 150 basis points, and we expect adjusted diluted EPS will be up between 6 and 8% in constant currency. We also now expect foreign currency translation will be a $0.02 headwind to full-year diluted EPS results.","With that, I\u2019ll turn you over to Ken.","Ken Powell","Okay, well thank you, Don, and good morning everyone. As Don described, we made god progress in the first quarter on our operating profit margin and adjusted diluted earnings per share goals; however, our net sales performance did not meet our expectations due to the challenging macro environment, a difficult year-over-year comparison, and a slower start to the year on certain businesses. We\u2019re taking action to improve our net sales performance going forward, leveraging our consumer first focus.","At the same time, we have a number of encouraging examples across our global portfolio where our efforts to adapt to evolving consumer interests are driving positive results. Let me share with you examples of the areas where we\u2019re focused on driving improvement and the businesses leading our first quarter performance in each of our segments, starting with U.S. retail.","There has been a good deal of discussion about retail sales trends in our industry recently. We have seen total U.S. food and beverage retail sales slow over the last few quarters. Units have held stable, but net price appreciation has decelerated from adding two points of growth a year ago to adding less than 50 basis points of growth in our first quarter. Nielsen data shows deflation in certain sections on the perimeter of the store, including dairy and meat, but we are seeing good price discipline in the vast majority of our categories where average unit prices are up a little more than 2%. ","Performance for our U.S. retail businesses in the first quarter was mixed. We had a slower start than we planned on Yoplait, Fiber One bars, and in our cereal business, and we\u2019re working to improve our performance in these categories going forward with innovation, renovation and good messaging. Retail sales for our foundation businesses were generally in line with our expectations; however, we saw double-digit net sales declines on Progresso soup driven by lower customer inventory levels, and our natural and organic businesses are driving excellent growth on core categories and with new innovation. ","Let me share some more details on each of these businesses. We continue to see challenging trends on our U.S. yogurt business driven primarily by significant declines on our Yoplait Light and Greek 100 product lines. Consumers of traditional light yogurts are pivoting away from this segment in favor of products that provide more satiety like Greek yogurts. That said, there are a number of deeply loyal consumers who are committed to this segment and to our products, so we plan to continue serving these loyal consumers and will leverage our category management efforts to ensure that Yoplait Light remains the leading option within the light segment of the shelf. ","On Greek 100, we were the first to market in the light Greek segment and built a strong early position; however, with significant competition in this segment, our products have become less differentiated, so we\u2019re looking to change that by rolling out a significant product improvement over the next few months. Our reformulated line of Yoplait Greek 100 products will contain up to 40% more protein but are still only 100 calories and contain just nine grams of sugar, and we have dramatically improved the taste of these products while adding more protein, which is not an easy thing to do. Our new Yoplait Greek 100 products will be on shelf in time for weight management season in January. ","We have yogurt renovation plans beyond Greek 100. In fact, by the end of the year, we will have renovated 60% of our yogurt portfolio. So far, we\u2019ve made changes to our entire kid portfolio, including new packaging and a whole milk formula on our Yoplait kids line, larger multipacks and kid equity cups, and new sizes and fresh packaging on GoGurt yogurt in a tube. We\u2019re also rolling out new packaging on our original style Yoplait yogurt as well. The improved visuals better communicate the great taste of our product and writing a flash on the front of the package to remind consumers that original style Yoplait contains six grams of protein. Our testing shows these changes drive increased consumer purchases, so we\u2019re looking forward to getting this news on shelf in the second half of the year.","We also have a strong slate of innovation rolling out in the first half in organic, beverages and Greek, which are the three fastest growing segments in the category. We entered the organic segment with Annie\u2019s and Liberte in the first quarter. Our Annie\u2019s product is a kid-targeted yogurt made from whole milk that comes in a range of flavors and formats, including cups, tubes, and large-sized tubs. Liberte, which is a leading brand in Canada but has a small presence in the U.S., has been re-launched as a premium organic line of yogurts targeted to adults. These launches are just rolling out to the market now, and although it\u2019s still early, we\u2019re seeing good distribution gains and strong early response from consumers. ","The yogurt beverage segment is growing double digits, and we\u2019ve introduced Yoplait Licuado and Smoothies to capitalize on this trend. These are highly successful products for our Yoplait franchisee in Mexico, so we\u2019re targeting this launch to cities with large Hispanic populations with plans to expand geographically in future quarters. ","Within Greek, we\u2019ve added to our successful Greek 100 Whips line with more indulgent, higher calorie Greek Whips varieties that rolled out in the first quarter, and we have additional yogurt launches slated for the second half targeted toward the dessert and snacking occasions, which are also seeing good growth.","We\u2019re highly focused on improving our U.S. yogurt performance, and we believe that renovation and innovation are the keys to getting this business back to growth. That\u2019s why we have such a broad set of initiatives this year, from strengthening our existing platforms with renovation on kid and original style Yoplait, new Greek Whips, and a significant product improvement on Greek 100, to building new segments in organic, beverages, desserts and snacking. About half of these initiatives are in market now and they will build over the course of the year. The remainder will come to market by January and should drive further improvement for our U.S. yogurt business in the back half of this year.","Don mentioned that our U.S. cereal net sales were down 4% in the first quarter. Part of that decline was driven by a reduction in customer inventory levels as our retail sales in Nielsen measured outlets were only down 2%. But when looking at our cereal performance on a rolling 12-month basis, we\u2019ve seen marked improvement from our trends a year ago with our latest 12-month retail sales down just under 1%. When we include non-measured channels, we\u2019d estimate that performance would be closer to flat. We think we can continue to drive improvement in our cereal business by putting the consumer first and consistently delivering on their needs with innovation and renovation, just as we\u2019ve been doing. ","We continue to be encouraged by the performance from our two largest renovation initiatives, gluten-free Cheerios and no artificial colors or flavors news. Gluten-free Cheerios posted its fourth consecutive quarter of growth with retail sales up 2% in the first quarter. Similarly, the products we featured in our no artificial colors and flavors campaign have posted consistent growth since we began airing that advertising in January. Retail sales for these cereals were up another 3% in the quarter, so we like the traction we\u2019ve gotten on our cereal renovation efforts and we\u2019re also encouraged by the early results we\u2019re seeing on cereal innovation, like Nature Valley and Annie\u2019s, that is targeted squarely towards current consumer interests. ","Annie\u2019s cereals are certified organic and come in three varieties that kids will like: Berry Bunnies, Cocoa Bunnies, and Frosted Oat Flakes. We\u2019re getting good feedback from consumers so far, and retailer acceptance has been excellent. We expect Annie\u2019s cereal sales will build throughout the year as we grow distribution and get these products in front of more consumers.","In addition to bringing meaningful renovation and innovation to our business, we\u2019re implementing an initiative we call strategic revenue management, or SRM, to help us grow our cereal top line. As we said at our investor day event, we\u2019re establishing a more rigorous formalized process to drive positive net price realization and will focus on four key levers within our SRM initiative: first, optimizing our prices to capture the full value for our brands across channels and then increasing our sophistication on price [indiscernible] architecture, managing our mix to maximize profitable growth, and driving promotional spending towards the highest returning activities. We\u2019ve assessed the opportunities for each U.S. operating unit and have prioritized the levers that will drive the most meaningful impact for fiscal \u201917 and \u201918. Altogether, the combination of consumer first renovation and innovation, meaningful levels of consumer investment, and our strategic revenue management efforts should help us deliver improved net sales performance for our U.S. cereal business over the course of fiscal \u201917.","Our renovation efforts continue to work on Nature Valley as well. Our Nature Valley Crunchy line of granola bars, renovated last year to make them easier to bite, have posted 2% retail sales growth so far this year, and year-to-date retail sales for our gluten-free Nature Valley protein bars are up 5%. We also successfully launched Nature Valley Nut Butter Biscuits in fiscal \u201916, and these products are continuing to drive growth this year. Consumers love these great tasting, more filling snacks that combine protein from nut butter with whole grain biscuits, helping drive turns in the top third of the category. ","In fiscal \u201917, we\u2019re looking to build on the initiatives that have been driving growth for Nature Valley grain snacks. We\u2019re bringing back a successful media campaign reminding consumers that our Nature Valley products contain no artificial flavors and colors, and we\u2019ll expand our Nature Valley Nut Butter Biscuit line by introducing a cocoa almond butter variety to round out our current line-up of flavors.","I mentioned earlier that Fiber One grain snacks have seen challenging trends so far this y ear. We think the key to stabilizing this business is to bring news that reminds consumers that Fiber One fulfills the need for permissible indulgence better than any other product in the bar section, so we\u2019re investing in new media this year to drive home our key message of superior taste with the added benefit of fiber. We\u2019re also launching new products to generate news. In January, we\u2019re introducing two varieties of layered chewy bars, Salted Caramel Chocolate Chunk and Double Chocolate Almond. These products truly deliver on Fiber One\u2019s promise of remarkable taste, and as we\u2019ve seen in the past with Fiber One Brownies and Fiber One Cheesecake, delivering remarkable products to consumers usually translates to excellent growth, so we\u2019re excited to get these products on shelf in the back half.","Finally, we\u2019re bringing compelling renovation news to the Fiber One franchise by removing artificial flavors, colors and sweeteners from our brownies line and from our largest chewy bar varieties. We\u2019ve also reduced sugar on our oats and chocolate bars by 25%, all while maintaining their great taste of course. So we like the news we\u2019re bringing to Fiber One snacks, and we look forward to seeing these initiatives gain traction in the coming quarters. ","Now let\u2019s turn to our natural and organic portfolio, where we\u2019ve seen our top line results accelerate recently behind excellent ideas and great execution. For the most recent three-month period, our nine natural and organic brands posted 12% retail sales growth across natural and traditional channels. Annie\u2019s and Larabar have been leading our growth so far this year. Retail sales for the Annie\u2019s categories that existed at the time of acquisition, like mac \u2018n cheese, crackers, and fruit snacks, were up 20% in the first quarter driven by continued distribution expansion and progress we\u2019ve made moving Annie\u2019s SKUs into the main aisle. Our recent category expansions, like yogurt, cereal, baked goods, snack bars, and soup are building distribution and helping grow household penetration for the Annie\u2019s brand. Retail sales for all Annie\u2019s products were up 28% in natural and traditional channels for the latest three-month period.","Larabar has consistently grown double digits since we purchased the brand in 2008, but we\u2019ve seen a step change in growth over the past six months with retail sales up more than 40% thanks to a great new advertising campaign, solid distribution expansion, and excellent in-store merchandising support. ","Now let\u2019s turn to our foundation businesses, which consist largely of refrigerated dough, soup, and baking mixes in U.S. retail. We mentioned at our investor day that we are working to drive efficiency on these businesses by reducing SKUs and optimizing spending, which we expect to result in the loss of some unprofitable volume. But at the same time, we\u2019re bringing targeted news to consumers to ensure that they remain engaged with our brands. ","On Pillsbury refrigerated dough, this summer we renovated the shelf set with shelf-ready packaging, a simplified assortment, and a new shelf layout making it easier for our customers to stock the products and for the consumer to shop the section. We\u2019re transitioning our entire line of soup to antibiotic-free chicken, a first for a mainstream soup brand. More than 50% of Progresso soups contain chicken, so this is a significant initiative for the brand. We\u2019re renovating a number of Betty Crocker dessert products, including our brownie line, giving consumers more of what they want. We\u2019re making our products more premium by offering more caramel and fudge, and we\u2019re upsizing the package, allowing consumers to make more brownies from the same box. We\u2019re now entering the key season for these businesses, where they generate a large share of their revenue and profit for the year, and we feel confident that our plans will yield good results. ","Now let\u2019s turn to the convenience stores and food service segments. Don mentioned that net sales in this segment were down 7% driven primarily by index pricing on bakery flour. This pricing tracks with our flour input cost, so it\u2019s profit neutral but it does hurt our top line. Don also mentioned that results on our Focus 6 platforms were impacted by the timing of back-to-school ordering. Despite this headwind, our cereal and yogurt businesses posted good net sales growth in the first quarter driven by continued strength on Cinnamon Toast Crunch and gluten-free Cheerios, as well as Yoplait Parfait Pro and large-sized yogurt tubs. Going forward, we expect this segment\u2019s net sales performance will improve behind stronger growth on our Focus 6 businesses and less headwind from bakery flour pricing.","Now let\u2019s turn to highlights from our international segment, starting with Canada. Though constant currency net sales in Canada were down due to the Green Giant divestiture, we delivered three months of positive retail sales growth with gains across almost all our categories. Retail sales for our cereals were up 6% driven by strong back-to-school execution and benefits from our Olympic partnership. Wholesome snack retail sales were up 5% behind innovation and sustaining demand for better-for-you Nature Valley snacks, and retail sales for Old El Paso Mexican foods were up 11% thanks to stand-and-stuff innovation and continued distribution gains. ","Wholesome snacks in Europe are off to a strong start as well with retail sales up 13% across the region in the latest three months. We\u2019ve seen gains from our Nature Valley protein bar renovation, new packaging on Nature Valley Crunchy bars, and the launch of new Fiber One 90 calorie bars in the region, which provide consumers an indulgent treat with the benefit of fiber all at only 90 calories per serving. Old El Paso posted 5% retail sales growth in Europe behind strength across the portfolio, driven by stand-and-stuff taco shell innovation and distribution gains on the existing portfolio. ","Don mentioned that in total, constant currency net sales declined in Europe this quarter due to comparisons against exceptionally strong growth for Haagen Dazs and Yoplait a year ago. As we lap those increases, we expect to see improved net sales growth in Europe in the remainder of the year.","Turning to our Asia Pacific region, we delivered good performance on a number of businesses in China which was partially offset by the impact of our snacks restructuring. Yoplait is performing well in Shanghai, and we are looking to replicate that success with our recent entry into Beijing. Constant currency net sales were up mid-single digits on Haagen Dazs driven by same store sales growth in shops. We also saw mid-single digit constant currency net sales growth on Wanchai Ferry products led by performance in Tier 1 cities. In AMEA, Haagen Dazs is off to a strong start thanks to the introduction of stick bars, and Pillsbury mixes helped drive another quarter of growth in India. ","Finally, in Latin America, our Mexico business continues to deliver strong double-digit snacks growth behind Nature Valley and Fiber One. These brands are capitalizing on Mexican consumers\u2019 desire for great tasting better-for-you snacks, and we\u2019re executing well behind good consumer marketing plans and solid in-store support. In Brazil, retail sales for Yoki snacks were up 5% in the latest three months behind Yoki popcorn and pricing across our portfolio. Our side dishes business is also performing well, positing 16% growth in the latest three-month period.","As we look ahead to the remainder of fiscal \u201917, we believe there are a number of reasons why our organic net sales performance will improve. First, our U.S. retail comparison goes from a year-ago revenue growth that was up low single digits to growth that was down low single digits in each of the next three quarters. Our comparisons ease in our other two segments as well, as we lap index price changes in convenience stores and food service and Europe\u2019s strong summer performance in fiscal \u201916. Second, we\u2019re continuing to invest behind the renovation and innovation news that\u2019s working, whether that\u2019s cereal renovation, natural and organic in the U.S., or Old El Paso and Nature Valley across international. Third, we\u2019re taking actions to improve performance on a number of businesses such as yogurt and Fiber One bars in U.S. retail. Finally, we\u2019re implementing strategic revenue management to drive improved net price realization for our U.S. retail business.","With that, let me summarize today\u2019s remarks. We made good progress in the first quarter against our adjusted operating profit margin and adjusted diluted EPS goals. We had a slower start from net sales, but we have the right plans in place to improve performance going forward. We announced additional margin expansion initiatives in July which are part of our path to achieving our 20% adjusted operating profit margin, and we remain on track to deliver our full-year fiscal \u201917 growth goals.","So that concludes our prepared remarks this morning. I\u2019ll now ask our Operator to open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions]","Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew Grainger","Hi, good morning everyone. Thanks for the question.","Ken Powell","Hi Matt.","Matthew Grainger","Hi. I wanted to ask two questions about yogurt. One, Ken or Jeff, could you address the broader category level trends you\u2019re seeing in the weight management segment of the category, I guess particularly in Greek, because it seems as if the Greek 100 re-launch is a major component of your strategy to improve sales this year, and just wondering given all of the structural headwinds we\u2019ve seen with some of the other categories with the weight management proposition around them, whether it\u2019s cereal or core cup, is that something you\u2019re seeing now bleeding into Greek as well, or is the issue really just one of competition? ","Then I guess a related question for Don, you talked about double-digit reductions in media spending on yogurt. Just curious if that\u2019s an issue of timing or whether you\u2019re seeing a lower return profile that makes you comfortable pulling back there.","Jeff Harmening","So this is Jeff, and let me take on both of those questions and Don can follow up as needed on the second one that you asked. On the first one, as we look at broader category trends in yogurt and specifically in weight management, consumers are looking for in yogurt what they\u2019re looking for across categories, which is a satiety benefit and ways to keep them fuller for longer. That\u2019s the fundamental difference we see between our Greek 100 offering and why we\u2019re renovating that and what we see in Yoplait Light, which are our two entries into this market. So that\u2019s why you see us renovating Greek 100 as we are, adding 40% more protein and making it taste better at the same time, because we know consumers are looking for satiety. Greek 100 can give them that, but they\u2019ll only do it if the product tastes really good, so the bar is pretty high. So that\u2019s why we have a high degree of confidence in the renovation efforts we\u2019re looking for on Greek 100 and why Yoplait Light--you know, we\u2019ll be the leader in the light segment, but we don\u2019t see that turning around in the same way that we see Greek 100 turning around. So that\u2019s why you see us doing that.","As it relates to spending, I\u2019d mentioned this in our Q4 update that we\u2019ll be taking our advertising down on yogurt this year and increasing our trade spending, because on our advertising, we weren\u2019t seeing the returns that we wanted to see, and we way over-index on the category on advertising spending relative to our competition. So while we are reducing our advertising spending, we will still have more than our fair share of weight in advertising in the category, so we saw an opportunity to do that, which I also mentioned, as I said, in June.","Matthew Grainger","Okay, thanks. So given the breadth of new product activity that you have coming in the back half of the year, you\u2019re comfortable that--so your ability to educate consumers on the relative benefits of all of those new offerings is going to be possible in the context of lower advertising?","Jeff Harmening","Yes, I do. We plan to advertise our new offerings, and one of the things that\u2019s very clear about most of our categories, and is especially true about yogurt, is that innovation and whether that innovation takes the form of new products or whether that innovation takes the form of improving what you currently have, innovation clearly drives the yogurt category. When we get that right, which we think we have, by the way, on Annie\u2019s and Liberte and what we see with our drinks, we know that that can move the needle and we\u2019re looking forward to doing more of that in the second half.","Matthew Grainger","Okay, great. Thank you, Jeff.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kenneth Zaslow with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Kenneth Zaslow","Hey, good morning everyone. ","Ken Powell","Morning Ken.","Kenneth Zaslow","My question kind of goes more to operating leverage, favorable operating leverage. So in the quarter, your sales were below expectations but your operating profit was where you wanted it to be. If you are able to hit your sales growth targets which you didn\u2019t hit in the first quarter, how does that affect your operating leverage, and is there more upside to the outlook given that you have 75% of your savings that are already done for 2018, versus if you get more volume, is there some more favorable operating leverage? Can you talk about how that kind of plays through in the income statement?","Don Mulligan","Yes Ken, this is Don. You know, in the quarter what we saw was a couple things that allowed us to bring in the profit. One was we had very strong plant and manufacturing performance. As we referenced, our media was down double digits for the quarter, which is ahead of what our full-year guidance had been. We had some favorable timing in below-the-line items - our corporate items, our tax lines, interest as I mentioned, and those will even out as the year unfolds. Our focus is on delivering the year.","I\u2019ll touch a little bit on media because Jeff touched on it or talked about it with Yoplait. Given that we were coming out of the quarter with media spending down double digits, we now expect media to be down double digits for the full year - that\u2019s a little bit lower than we had originally anticipated. The reductions will be in the same places - the foundation businesses and U.S. yogurt, and will continue to increase in our growth businesses. But that\u2019s the reality of coming in a little light on our top line in the first quarter.","Now that all said, we continue to look for, and as you point out, we believe our strong margin performance will help provide the fuel to reinvest in high return ideas as the year unfolds, so as Jeff alluded to, whether it\u2019s in yogurt or other businesses, as we launch new products and as we see traction on those new products, we believe some of the cost savings initiatives we have, some of the operating leverage we\u2019re going to be able to generate will help us fund those ideas as the year unfolds.","Kenneth Zaslow","So if you didn\u2019t get the volume growth, you would probably not spend as much and you\u2019d still get the savings. Is that the--? And if you get the volume growth that you expect, you\u2019ll reinvest to keep the momentum going - is that a fair assessment? ","Don Mulligan","We have very good line of sight to the cost savings that we\u2019ve talked about, we started talking about in June and July. We are certainly going to make sure that we invest behind the ideas that are gaining traction with consumers.","Kenneth Zaslow","Great, I appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","David Driscoll","Great, thank you, and good morning everyone. Just wanted to maybe simplify this slightly. So sales are down a lot, you said they were down more than what you expected in the quarter. Can you guys just categorize for me how you feel about the different factors, whether it\u2019s environment, just a tough environment, the tough comps that you faced in the year-ago period, or the specific category problems that you have in certain General Mills brands, i.e. yogurt and others? How do you grade those different factors in trying to just say big picture, what happened to sales in this quarter? ","Jeff Harmening","Well David, this is Jeff. I think as we--as Ken started out his comments, the macro environment is tough. It\u2019s tough globally, but our focus really is on what we control. One of the things that we\u2019ve seen time and again is that when we focus on the things that we can control, we can have a lot of success. Gluten-free is a great example of that in the cereal category.","So as we look at our first quarter, there are some things that we need to improve in our yogurt business really around innovation and renovation, and we feel like that\u2019s up to us regardless of the macro environment. We like some things that we\u2019re seeing in cereal despite the fact that it was down 4% in the first quarter. We think that we can probably spend more against initiatives that are working well, like gluten-free and Cheerios, and we really like our innovation coming up in snacks in the second half of this year.","So what I would tell you is that yes, the macro environment does play a piece, but we are laser-focused on the things within our control and feel good about our ability to improve our top line trends, both here in the U.S. and globally.","David Driscoll","Just to follow up here, can you give us some comments on second quarter revenue expectations? I think that--you know, your comments at back-to-school were disturbing to a lot of people, and the stock has been a significant underperformer, so I\u2019d rather not go through a repeat of this if second quarter revenues are going to be something well below where the consensus has been modeling. You normally don\u2019t give this stuff, but in light of what\u2019s happened in the quarter, would you be willing to give us some guidance right there on that one? ","Then just one final tack-on to all this top line stuff, did the SRM play any factor in the first quarter? Was any of the volume decline here, quote-unquote, the elimination of unprofitable volume? Thank you.","Don Mulligan","David, let me give you some insights into the balance of the year. We do expect Q2 to be better than Q1 from an organic sales growth standpoint, and we expect the second half to be better than Q2. A couple of factors to take into account as you think about the Q1 to Q2 movements, and we talked about these in the script but it may be good just to consolidate them all, first is the comps. ","Again, our F16 Q1 organic sales growth was the highest of the year at plus-2, and all segments showed growth and we had particular strength in Europe behind Haagen Dazs and Yoplait. In Q2, we\u2019ll begin lapping negative organic growth, which was driven to a large extent by reduced merchandising on cereal and snacks at one of our large U.S. customers, so first is the comps will ease for some very specific reasons. ","Second, we expect even better price appreciation in Q2 versus Q1. Q1, we had two points of price mix appreciation, and we expect even more. In Q2, we start seeing the benefit of SRM, the trade optimization actions that we\u2019re taking in our foundation businesses in the U.S. We expect to see continued pricing benefits in Brazil, and we expect lower drag from the bakery flour pricing in our convenience stores and food service business, so the second factor is we think pricing will improve, our price mix appreciation will improve in the second quarter.","Pipeline plays a bit of a role. We mentioned that we saw the consumer off take ahead of shipments for U.S. cereal. We also saw it for soup. We also had some inventory reductions in a large customer in our C&F business, and we don\u2019t expect any of those to recur in Q2. Lastly and the most important factor, of course, is the positive impact of all the consumer first initiatives that Ken and Jeff have talked about. ","So we expect Q2 to be better than Q1, we expect the second half to be better than the first half, and we expect the full year to come in between our flat and minus-2 guidance that we initiated back in June.","Ken Powell","The SKU impact--","Don Mulligan","Oh, I\u2019m sorry. The SKU impact, there might have been some minor impact in the first quarter, but I wouldn\u2019t attribute a lot of the reduction in the first quarter to SKU rationalization.","David Driscoll","Thank you for all the color. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Growe","Hi, good morning. Thank you. Just had a quick question for you, two questions if I could. The first one, in relation to both the convenience store and food service division and international, you did have some unique factors but that organic growth was down in the quarter. Do you expect organic growth to be up or to grow in those two divisions for the year?","Ken Powell","We certainly expect organic growth in international, and for food service, we\u2019ll see that improve. It\u2019ll really somewhat depend on bakery flour pricing. We certainly expect improved performance in that low to mid-single digit range for our Focus 6, which is very consistent with what we\u2019ve seen over the last handful of years, but it\u2019s always tough to call that segment in total because of the bakery flour pricing. [Indiscernible] is we certainly expect stronger performance and positive organic growth in the Focus 6.","Chris Growe","Okay, and then I had kind of a two-point question, if I could. First is do you expect your gross margin to be up roughly 150 basis points for the year? I do see your target of operating margin being up that much. Maybe relate to that or in addition--go ahead, sorry Don.","Don Mulligan","Yes, we do.","Chris Growe","Okay. So kind of related to that, with media spending being down more than you expected, I guess I wanted to be clear, does some of that spending shift to promotion? We heard that certainly in yogurt, for example. Is that just true savings for the company, or is it being redirected to other areas like trade promotion?","Jeff Harmening","Well, there are two answers to that. For our U.S. business, our marketing spending is going to be down for the year, and the only place we\u2019ve really shifted to more trade spending is in yogurt. Otherwise for our foundation businesses as well as for cereal and snacks, we look to price appreciation and strategic revenue management to help us out on that.","The place where there really is a timing shift is international, where our media spending was down in the first quarter, and that really is a matter of timing. We like our initiatives in our international group and we see our spending in media up in the last three quarters. ","Chris Growe","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Jason English","Hey, good morning folks. Thank you for the question. Two questions - first, a housekeeping item. Can you give us what the performance was in U.S. retail for your foundation versus growth portfolios this quarter? ","Jeff Siemon","The foundation businesses were--in U.S. retail specifically were minus-2%--sorry, this is Jeff Siemon talking, Jason. Then--yes, minus-2, and that\u2019s really fully attributable to yogurt. It was up modestly excluding yogurt--sorry, growth businesses, I apologize, Jason. Foundation businesses were down 8%, driven primarily by soup which was, as Don said, saw some deliveries trail Nielsen off take, and mid-single digit declines in baking product units, as you saw in Don\u2019s slide.","Jason English","Thank you, that\u2019s really helpful. Now thinking about the forward, it\u2019s pretty clear from the prepared remarks that you\u2019re banking on a lot of price realization to help get some of the acceleration. It stands a bit in contrast to what we\u2019re seeing from the industry at large - you know, grocers talking about deflationary pressure, promotions sort of ticking back up in the industry overall, and some conjecture that given the market share battles happen at grocers, there\u2019s going to be a fair amount of pressure put on manufacturers to help fund some of that. So I was hoping that you could just give us some context of what you\u2019re seeing in the industry overall, what gives you confidence on the ability to deploy some of these initiatives, and maybe in line with that context, how the retailers have received the direction and early indications of the path you\u2019re going down so far.","Jeff Harmening","Jason, this is Jeff, and I think that\u2019s an excellent question. I think it\u2019s also a really important one, so let me start big picture and work our way back to the category initiatives you talked about.","Big picture, we see in Nielsen data and certainly I have heard from a lot of our retailers over the last month in my direct conversation with them, is that we see prices deflationary, or the inflation reducing in the store over the course of the last quarter or so. As we look, and Ken shared with you earlier, as we look at the items in grocery that contain the UPC code, we have about half a percent growth - I think it\u2019s 0.4%. A big portion of that is really reduction in egg pricing from a year ago, so if you strip out the pricing on eggs, it\u2019s about 1% inflation, which is pretty consistent with the last couple of quarters. So we had the flu last year and the price of eggs was really high, and it\u2019s a lot lower now, so that accounts for a lot","I\u2019ve also heard from a lot of retailers about deflation in other parts non-UPC, so the perimeter of the store in things like dairy and meat, but what we\u2019re seeing in our categories really is about 2.5% price appreciation in the first quarter, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing in our Nielsen in our categories as well. So as we look--and we\u2019ve seen quite good price discipline in the vast majority of our categories, and there\u2019s no reason for us to think that that won\u2019t continue going forward. Certainly as we look to our SRM initiatives, we\u2019re gaining increased confidence that those are going to be effective.","When we talk to retailers about our pricing and what we\u2019re going to do with our foundation brands, we find a pretty receptive audience, to be honest, and the first fact is that 75% of our business is growth and 25% foundational, so we start with that. Within the foundational brands, our retailers are looking for a little bit of inflation, so to the extent that they see deflation in some areas, a little bit of inflation in other areas isn\u2019t such a bad thing. They key to that really is to bring some level of investment to the category in other forms, so I\u2019ve talked about it before but it\u2019s really important in that Progresso is going to be about antibiotic-free chicken and on Pillsbury, it\u2019s a new shelf set, as well as improving the quality of our products, so we\u2019re making investments in other ways and our retailers are really receptive to that. So we\u2019re not just milking these businesses but managing for cash, the really foundation businesses, and when we see good opportunities for investment in things other than pricing, we\u2019re doing those.","Don Mulligan","Jason, one other thing I\u2019ll add to it. You made a comment that we\u2019re banking a lot on pricing. I just don\u2019t want it to be overplayed. As we look at our Q1 to Q2 improvement in organic sales growth, it\u2019s about equal parts pricing and volume, so it\u2019s not just relying on the pricing lever. As we get to the back half, it\u2019s actually more driven by volume improvement in the back half. So pricing plays a role, but I don\u2019t want you to overestimate the role of pricing.","Jason English","Thank you, that\u2019s helpful. Appreciate the color. I\u2019ll pass it on.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Lazar","Morning everybody. With the strategic revenue management actions, which I think you said were primarily in cereal but that could be over the foundation brands as well that you talked about this morning, I guess typically that means there\u2019s a willingness to trade off a bit of less profitable volume for better profitability, which makes sense. I guess my question is whether General Mills\u2019 capacity utilization in those categories in which some of these actions are likely to be most pronounced, maybe is at a level that can handle some of the potential volume consequences of such a strategy on things like overhead absorption and such, or I guess could there be a need at some point for maybe further supply chain actions in addition to what you\u2019ve announced already and discussed earlier on the call?","Jeff Harmening","Andrew, this is Jeff. A couple of points. To address your first question about where we\u2019re going to work on strategic revenue management, it really started in cereal and we\u2019re fast following in the rest of our categories in the U.S. as well, in fact all of North America we\u2019re looking at it. So it\u2019s a capability that we\u2019re developing broadly, and yes, cereal has been the farthest ahead but it\u2019s fast following to the rest of our categories, and you\u2019ll soon see that.","As regards to capacity, we have made the moves in pricing and strategic revenue management with an eye toward capacity as we look forward, so clearly if there are additional capacity--if there\u2019s additional capacity, we\u2019ll remove that if we need to optimize our supply chain. You see that with soup, for example, in this last quarter where we saw an opportunity to improve the profitability and viability of our soup business by closing our Vineland plant. So to the extent we see opportunities like that, whether it\u2019s here or other parts of the world, we\u2019ll certainly take advantage of that; but our capacity utilization decisions that we\u2019ve announced already have been made with an eye toward the actions that we\u2019re taking now.","Andrew Lazar","Great, thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with CLSA. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Lavery","Morning. You mentioned, I think, about 10 yogurt innovations and renovations in your slides and remarks, and just was wondering if you could give us a sense of how much you\u2019ve revealed versus what you may still have yet to communicate. I know you\u2019ve talked a lot about different plans and some things are coming in the second half. If there more to come, or is this essentially what your year\u2019s plans are going to look like? I know sometimes for competitive reasons, obviously, you don\u2019t want to say those are, but just maybe kind of a sense of where we are in the pacing of what\u2019s been revealed","Jeff Harmening","I appreciate your sensitivity on that. You know, what I would tell you is that kind of the quantity of what we\u2019re going to share, I think we\u2019ve probably already revealed. But in terms of the specifics, and I think we haven\u2019t talked about snacking, what we\u2019re going to do in the second half of the year, and desserts, we haven\u2019t talked about what those are. We\u2019ve said we\u2019re going to come with something but we haven\u2019t mentioned the specifics of that, so we\u2019ll do that at a later date. But there are two more initiatives coming in the second half of the year which we\u2019ve just let you know about, which leads into the 10, I think that you articulated. ","Then we\u2019ve also got a good pipeline as we look at F18, which is why we have confidence that we can improve our business in the back half of \u201917 and also again in F18, because we have a pipeline of offerings that we really like. ","Michael Lavery","Just related to that, I guess two questions I\u2019d love to understand a little bit better. One is where do you see the biggest opportunities and how do they compare to each other, and then how do you communicate that to the trade in terms of where your focus is, or is it just several equally sized or interesting opportunities, especially with your shift from media to trade spending? How do you manage that in terms of your go-to-market with the customers?","Jeff Harmening","So in terms of our biggest opportunities, let me--I guess the question is probably U.S.-related--","Don Mulligan","And yogurt.","Michael Lavery","U.S. yogurt, yes, specifically. Right.","Jeff Harmening","U.S. yogurt related. We\u2019ve talked to our retailers about what we\u2019re brining now, and we\u2019re starting to have discussions about our pipeline of innovation. I can tell you, and I just sat down with a few last week, they\u2019re excited about what we\u2019re bringing, they really are, and they believe in the vision of the category that we have. They know that we have been a growth leader in this category for 40 years and that we intend to be for another 40, but right now we\u2019re struggling, so they know all of that.","What I would tell you is that they see a lot of innovation in the yogurt category, and the yogurt CAGR is so big and has so many different segments, it can have multiple layers of innovation, they just can\u2019t be competing with each other. So Annie\u2019s yogurt, for example, doesn\u2019t really compete with Liberte, even though they\u2019re both organic, because one is geared towards adults and one is mom with kids. Greek 100 is yet again in the weight management area, so the key to the innovation is making sure that you have innovation that\u2019s meaningful and that you\u2019re bringing in different segments so they're not overlapping. But the category is big enough now in yogurt to withstand a lot of innovation as long as it\u2019s strong.","Michael Lavery","How do you manage the sales execution risk, I guess, as part of it? You just have so much on your plate at once, typically the more focused you can give execution instructions to sales, the better they can go out and block and tackle. How do you handle it in a different situation like this?","Jeff Harmening","Well, I think the first key for us is we have the best sales force in the industry, so they\u2019re capable of handling multiple initiatives at the same time. We\u2019re very focused with them on what our priorities are, and they know that yogurt is one of our growth priorities, so I have no reason to doubt that we won\u2019t be excellent in our execution of our new products in yogurt in the second half, just as we have been with Liberte and Annie\u2019s and the reformulation of our GoGurt business here in the first quarter. ","Michael Lavery","Thank you very much.","Jeff Siemon","Okay Operator, Jennifer, I think that\u2019s all the time we have. We\u2019re at the 8:30 mark, so I think let\u2019s wrap up here. Thanks everyone. I know we didn\u2019t get to everyone who was queued up for a question, so I\u2019m available all day if you want to give me a ring and I\u2019ll be happy to follow up.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday June 29, 2016.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Jeff Siemon, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Jeff Siemon","Thanks Tina and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m here with Ken Powell, our CEO; Don Mulligan, our CFO and I\u2019ll turn the call over to them in just a minute. We also have here Chris O'Leary who runs our international business, and Jeff Harmening who today leads the US retail. They will be available during Q&A at the end of the call. A press release on fourth quarter and year-end results was issued over the wire services earlier this morning, though admittedly not as early as we wanted, we had some issues with our press release service IT and so thanks for bearing with us, this morning we apologies, obviously I will be available if we don't get to everyone's questions at the end of the call.","The release was also posted on our website and you could find slides on the website that supplements this morning's presentation. Our remarks this morning will include forward-looking statements that are based on management\u2019s current views and assumptions. The second slide in today\u2019s presentation lists factors that could cause our future results to be different than our current estimates. And one additional housekeeping item, beginning in fiscal 2017 we will report net sales growth on an organic basis which we define as net sales adjusted for the impact of foreign currency translation as well as acquisitions, divestitures and the 53rd week when applicable. We will do this at the segment and total company level in order to provide you with better visibility to the underlying performance of our businesses. The fiscal \u201817 net sales growth guidance Don will provide today will be stated on an organic basis and for reference we posted three years of organic net sales growth history on our website.","And with that let me briefly turn you over to Ken for a few words before Don reviews our 2016 financial performance.","Ken Powell","Thanks, Jeff. I just wanted to make a brief acknowledgement before we begin. Many of you saw the announcement last week that we have promoted Jeff Harmening to the role of President and Chief Operating Officer of General Mills with responsibility for global operations. Many of you know Jeff as a seasoned trusted leader with a wide range of General Mills experience in the US and internationally. He has been central to our efforts to embed consumer first across organization and have successfully led our US retail organization through important changes that we've made in recent years. I have confidence that Jeff is the right person to lead global operations and look forward to continuing to partner with him to drive growth and returns for our shareholder.","So with that, I\u2019ll let Don get back to the business at hand.","Don Mulligan","Thanks, Ken and good morning to all. Fiscal 2016 was an important step forward for General Mills. We are encouraged by the traction we saw at our consumer first initiatives on many important businesses, our operating performance strengthened as we returned to growth in organic sales and segment operating profit, made good progress on margin expansion and exceeded our adjusted diluted EPS guidance. We took important strategic actions during the year to reshape our portfolio for growth including the divestiture of the Green Giant business in North America, significant category expansion to the Annie\u2019s brand, the launch of Yoplait in China, and the acquisitions of EPIC Provisions meat snacks in the US and the Carolina yogurt business in Brazil. But we didn't hit the mark everywhere, we were disappointed in our performance in US Yogurt and our China results excluding the Yoplait launch finished below our expectations as the external environment in that market remains challenging. We also experienced merchandising headwinds in a large US customer which we should laugh after the first quarter of fiscal 2017. As noted in this morning's press release, we are building on successes in fiscal 2016 to increase our fiscal 2018 cost savings target and accelerate and increase our adjusted operating profit margin goal.","Our cost savings initiatives which include projects Century, Catalyst, and Compass and further administrative cost savings from zero-based budgeting generated $350 million in total annual savings in fiscal 2016, ahead of our original target. We have good visibility to continue strong in cost savings over the next two years and as a result we are increasing our total annual savings target to $600 million by fiscal 2018, up from the previous target of $500 million. We are also implementing further efforts to optimize our spending, reduce complexity and streamline our operations to drive profitable growth, which will result in accelerated margin expansion. We now expect to achieve an adjusted operating profit margin of 20% by fiscal 2018, up from the previous target of 18% by fiscal \u201820. This new target represents an increase of 400 basis points over fiscal 2015 levels.","Now let's review fiscal 2016 results beginning on slide 6. Remember this quarter's results were negatively impacted by foreign exchange, the Green Giant divestiture and the comparison to the 53rd week a year ago. We also align the Yoplait Europe business with our fiscal calendar which causes to report an extra month for that business in the quarter. Net sales totaled $3.9 billion, down 9% as reported and down 8% in constant currency, driven by the impact of divestitures in the 53rd week comparison. Segment operating profit totaled $654 million, down 18% on a constant currency basis reflecting our highest quarter of input cost inflation as well as the items I mentioned earlier. Net earnings more than doubled to $380 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.62 as reported. Adjusted diluted EPS which excludes certain items affecting comparability were $0.66, down 12% from last year's fourth quarter and down 11% in constant currency. Slide 7 shows the components of total company net sales growth. Organic net sales grew 1% in the quarter, driven by pound volume growth. Foreign currency translation reduced net sales growth by 1 point, the 53rd week reduced net sales growth by 6 points and the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures reduced net sales growth by 3 points in the fourth quarter.","Slide 8 summarizes our results for the full year. Net sales totaled $16.6 billion, down 6% as reported and down 2% in constant currency. Full year net sales increased modestly on an organic basis. Total segment operating profits totaled $3 billion, up 1% in constant currency. Net earnings increased 39% to $1.7 billion and diluted EPS was to $2.77 as reported. Adjusted diluted EPS was $2.92, up 2% from fiscal 2015. Constant currency adjusted diluted EPS increased 5% compared to a year ago. Turning to our segment results, slide 9 summarizes US retail performance. Full year net sales were down 5% including a 2 point decline from the net impact of the Green Giant sale and Annie\u2019s and EPIC acquisitions. The 53rd week comparison reduced annual net sales growth by an additional 1 point. Excluding the extra week last year, our cereal operating unit posted net sales growth in 2016. Segment operating profit increased 1% for the full year and operating profit margin increased 120 basis points to nearly 22%. In the convenience and foodservices segment, our as six focus platforms posted 5% net sales growth in fiscal \u201816 with the strongest performance coming from frozen meals. This is the third consecutive year our six focus platforms have grown at a mid-single digit rate or better. Full year segment net sales declined 4%, driven by market index pricing on bakery flour and the exit of low margin businesses in late fiscal \u201815. Full year segment operating profit was up 7%, driven by favorable product mix and our cost saving efforts.","Slide 11 summarizes our international segment net sales results stated in constant currency. For the full year international net sales grew 3% including increases of 12% in Latin America, 3% in Europe and 1% in Asia Pacific. Canada net sales declined 4% but were up low-single digits excluding the divestiture of Green Giant. In total, the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, and the impact of one less week reduced full-year net sales growth as reported by 2 points. Constant currency international segment operating profit declined 3% in fiscal 2016, primarily due to currency driven inflation on important products in certain markets, the impact of Green Giant divestiture and the difference in weeks. As I said earlier we made good progress on expanding margins in fiscal 2016. Full year adjusted gross margin increased 90 basis points driven by cost savings initiatives more than offsetting modest input cost inflation which totaled 2% for the full year. After-tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $88 million in fiscal 2016, up 12% in constant currency, primarily due to favorable input cost and volume growth for H\u00e4agen-Dazs Japan. Both JVs contributed to this strong profit growth. On a constant currency basis, net sales for Cereal Partners Worldwide were flat to last year with first half declines offset by growth in the second half. H\u00e4agen-Dazs Japan constant currency net sales increased 5% for the full year driven by excellent results on new products.","Slide 14 shows that our core working capital declined 41% versus last year's fourth quarter, primarily due to continued operational improvement across our businesses, plus the one-time benefit of the Green Giant divestiture. This is the 13th consecutive quarter we reduced our core working capital versus the prior year. Full-year operating cash flow was $2.6 billion, up 3% versus last year. Capital expenditures totaled $729 million. Full-year free cash flow was $1.9 billion, up 4% versus last year as we converted 104% of our adjusted after-tax earnings to free cash, ahead of our long-term goal of 95%. We paid $1.1 billion in dividends in 2016 and dividends per share were $1.78, up 7% from last year. Net share repurchases totaled $435 million and we reduced average net shares outstanding by 1% in line with our guidance.","Slide 16 highlights our key assumptions for fiscal 2017. We expect to drive organic net sales growth of low-single digits for our growth businesses which represent three-four of our portfolio. Net growth will be offset by mid-single digit organic declines on the remainder of portfolio where we are prioritizing profitable volume. The Green Giant divestiture will reduce net sales by about 1 point and EPS by approximately $0.03. We expect to deliver $380 million of cost of goods HMM which will more than offset cost inflation of 2%. And we will deliver an incremental $150 million of cost savings in fiscal 2017 from previously announced projects which will bring the total annual savings figure to $500 million. Finally, on slide 17 we see a summary of our fiscal 2017 guidance. We expect organic net sales growth to be in the range between down 2% and flat reflecting the actions we\u2019re taking to reduce unprofitable volume on certain businesses. Adjusted gross margin is targeted to be up 150 basis points driven by our margin expansion initiatives. Media investment is expected to down high-single digits. We project total segment operating profit will increase 6% to 8% on a constant currency basis and we expect our adjusted operating margin - operating profit margin will be 150 basis points above the 16.8% we delivered in fiscal \u201816.","Interest expense is expected to be flat to last year reflecting relatively stable rate environment, higher debt levels and changes in mix of debt. We expect our adjusted tax rate to be up 100 basis points due to the phasing of foreign tax credits and favorable F16 settlements. We plan to continue returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases. For fiscal 2017 we are targeting a net reduction of 1% to 2% in average diluted shares outstanding. And we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be up between 6% and 8% in constant currency. We estimate foreign currency will be a $0.01 to $0.02 headwind to full-year adjusted diluted EPS growth in 2017. But I will note that this figure does not include the recent fluctuations in the British pound. Finally, we expect 2017 first quarter adjusted diluted EPS will be below last year's first quarter that grew 36% in constant currency. We expect to post adjusted diluted EPS growth in each of the remaining three quarters of 2017.","And with that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Ken.","Ken Powell","Okay, well thanks Don and once again good morning to all of you. Fiscal 2016 was an important step forward for our business. Our consumer first renovation and innovation news gained traction on a number of businesses that we have work to do in certain areas to improve our trends. We reshaped our portfolio with strategic acquisitions and divestitures and we strengthened our business model and drove a significant increase in our profit margin. Let me share some 2016 highlights across our businesses starting with US cereal. The US cereal category has improved considerably since last year, returning to growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Importantly this improvement is being driven by stronger renovation and innovation aligned with current consumer interests supported by effective marketing investment. And General Mills has been a key contributor to the category turnaround. Our cereal business has consistently strengthened throughout the year with retail sales up 3% in the fourth quarter and as Don mentioned, full-year net sales for our cereal business grew in fiscal 2016 on an organic basis. Consumer first renovation has been critical to our renewed growth. We launched gluten-free Cheerios last summer to address the needs of the many consumers who are reducing or eliminating their gluten intake. After declining 8% in fiscal 2015, retail sales on our renovated Cheerios variety, which make up roughly 90% of the Cheerios franchise, increased 5% in the second half of 2016. We also announce that we\u2019re removing artificial colors and flavors from our cereal line, 75% of our cereals met this claim by January and at that time we began advertising behind seven newly renovated cereals including Trix, Golden Grams and Reese's Puffs.","And I'm very happy to say consumers are responding, these seven varieties posted 8% retail sales growth in the back half of the year compared to 6% decline in 2015. And much of that growth has come from full priced baseline sales. Sales of our Nature Valley bars strengthened throughout the year as our product renovation news gained traction. We made our crunchy bars easier to bite addressing our top consumer complaint. We also told consumers about our gluten-free options and reminded them that Nature Valley bars are free from artificial colors and flavors. Retail sales grew 4% in the second half of fiscal 2016, including 5% growth in the fourth quarter. L\u00e4rabar has posted consistent double-digit growth since we acquired the business eight years ago. We continue to look for ways to expand penetration beyond its current consumer base and accelerate the brand's growth. And to that end L\u00e4rabar launched its first-ever TV campaign in January and together with strong in-store merchandising and distribution support the business has grown 40% in Nielsen measured channels. We will continue this support in fiscal 2017.","Net sales for our natural and organic portfolio which includes L\u00e4rabar were up double-digit in 2016. In January, we expanded our portfolio with the addition of EPIC Provisions meat snacks. We now have a portfolio of nine brands that generates $750 million in pro forma net sales in 2016 and we are well on our way to achieving our goal of $1 billion in net sales by 2019. Now fiscal 2016 was a disappointing year for our US Yogurt topline and share. Dairy deflation sparked increased competition and we were not as aggressive in reinvesting this favorability. In addition, our marketing and innovation efforts underperformed our expectations. However, we were able to improve our profitability through record level HMM and spending discipline. We remain very committed to winning in the US Yogurt category and we recognize that we have work to do to improve our performance and I\u2019ll share more detail on these plans in just a moment. We posted good performance in 2016 during the soup and baking seasons. We grew ready to serve soup market share by 2 points during the soup season thanks to successful merchandising, product renovation news and good advertising. Our Pillsbury refrigerated dough business had a good baking season with growth in retail sales and market share up 1.8 points. These results were driven by distribution gains on our top selling products. And we grew market share for our dessert mixes during the key baking season by aligning our prices more closely with our competition.","Turning to convenience stores and foodservice segment we saw another year of good growth in 2016 for our focused six platforms with net sales up 5%. Frozen meals lead our performance posting strong double-digit net sales growth behind our K-12 meals lead by Mini Bagels one of our biggest product launches in recent history. We continue to see strong performance on our cereal bowl packs and these help drive mid-single digit net sales growth for our cereal business in 2016. And net sales for our yogurt business were up on the strength of Yoplait, ParfaitPro, and our kid yogurts.","Now let's turn to our international segment and our developed market businesses. We posted low-single digit retail sales growth in Canada in fiscal 2016. Growth on our snacks and Old El Paso businesses there was fuelled by consumer first innovation including Nature Valley Nut & Seed Crisps and Old El Paso Stand 'N Stuff Tacos. Retail sales in our Europe region were also up low-single digits, behind the success of our H\u00e4agen-Dazs Stick Bars launched in France and innovation driven growth on Old El Paso. In emerging markets, constant currency Latin American net sales were up 12% in 2016, driven by good performance on seasonings, inflation driven pricing and our acquisition of Carolina yogurt. Yoplait in Shanghai achieved 10% share in the latest quarter and has helped offset a slowdown H\u00e4agen-Dazs shop performance in China, driven by challenging economic conditions. Finally, net sales in India were up double-digit behind innovation and geographic expansion. CPW, our 50-50 joint venture with Nestl\u00e9 exited fiscal 2016 with momentum posting 3% net sales growth in the fourth quarter. This performance was driven by product innovation and renovation including good growth on its line of gluten-free cereal. For the year, CPW constant currency net sales matched year ago results while profits grew double-digit.","So, overall in fiscal 2016 we made important progress to strengthen our business model and improve momentum on a number of business lines. In fiscal 2017, our plan is to build on last year's successes while maintaining our strategic focus on consumer first. We're sharpening the way we think about our portfolio by being more choice full about our level of investments and expectations for growth across our businesses resulting in focused growth and strong margin expansion in 2017. We're taking a strategic approach to define growth and foundation portfolio roles for our business in 2017 taking into consideration category and brand strength, competitive dynamics and relative return on investment. Our growth businesses include cereal, snack bars, our national and organic brands, yogurt, [indiscernible] and Old El Paso in all of these within US retail. Then the focus six platforms in our convenience stores and foodservice segment, and finally all of our international markets are included in the growth classification. Now for most of these growth businesses we are building of positive net sales momentum in 2016, in some cases for example US Yogurt in China, we see strong long-term growth potential but we need to improve our current trajectory. In total these growth businesses make up approximately 75% of our net sales in a similar proportion of operating profit and we expect them to grow at a low-single digit rate in fiscal 2017.","Our second group of businesses is no less critical to the success of our company but play a different role, they\u2019re part of the foundation of our business and deliver strong consistent profit that helps fund topline growth initiatives and return cash to shareholders. In aggregate, their topline growth prospects are not as robust as the first group so we will be very selective in our growth investments focusing where we have strong ROI. These foundation businesses make up the remaining 25% of our net sales and consist primarily of refrigerated dough, desserts and soup in US retail as well as bakery flour and frozen dough products in our convenience stores and foodservice segments. We expect 2017 net sales on these businesses to decline mid-single digits as we reduce unprofitable volume and drive improved margin.","Now let me share an overview of our fiscal 2017 plans across our portfolio beginning with our US business. We exited 2016 with good momentum on both US cereal and snack bars. And we plan to drive growth on these businesses again in 2017. We will continue our renovation efforts by converting two more Cheerios varieties to gluten-free and by removing artificial colors and flavors from five additional cereals. We\u2019re also launching a number of exciting new cereals including three varieties of Annie\u2019s cereals and two varieties of Tiny Toast which are hitting shelves now. To support these efforts we have a strong media plan in place with cereal investment up mid-single digits. And we are focused on optimizing merchandising and driving positive net price realization for our cereal business. We have a good line-up of news on our snack bars businesses as well. We are renovating the packaging on Nature Valley bars, launching new flavors of our popular Nature Valley Nut Butter biscuits and introducing Nature Valley backpacker oatmeal snacks geared towards school-aged kids. On L\u00e4rabar, we plan to extend our strong performance into fiscal 2017 with continued media and in-store support. We also have a full slate of plan for Annie\u2019s, our largest natural and organic business. We posted double-digit growth on distribution of our core products last year and we plan to continue to leverage the strength of our US retail sales force to drive double-digit distribution growth in 2017.","We will also benefit from a full-year of category expansion in soup, yogurt, and cereal. And we have even more Annie\u2019s news that Jeff Harmening will tell you about at our Investor Day event in two weeks. We believe in the long-term growth opportunity in US Yogurt. However it will take us some time to restore topline growth as we shift our portfolio towards faster growing segments like [indiscernible] organic and kids. This month we're rolling out new Greek Whips, a full calorie version of our successful Greek 100 Whips product, we\u2019ll expand our presence in the fast-growing organic segment by launching Annie\u2019s Tubes and large sized yogurts, and by converting Libert\u00e9 to premium organic line and we have a strong line-up of kid yogurt news which we will share at Investor Day. We will also improve the effectiveness of our consumer messaging by refocusing on all-family snacking and we\u2019ll increase our merchandising competitiveness in 2017 securing more display at competitive price points. Some of this will be funded by shifting dollars out of consumer investment where we have by far the highest share of voice in the category.","Given our current rate of decline, we expect full-year fiscal 2017 net sales to be down but we expect our losses to moderate as we move through the year. Let me also touch on a few of our foundation businesses in US retail including soup, refrigerated dough and dessert mix. Here we are reducing low ROI trade and consumer investment and reducing complexity by optimizing our SKU assortment. Even so, we will continue to bring important news to consumers in 2017 for example, on progressive soup we\u2019re moving our entire line to antibiotic free chicken, a first for a mainstream soup brand. On Pillsbury refrigerated dough we are launching new shelf-ready packaging that will increase the productivity of the aisle for our retail customers and the shopability of the aisle for our consumers. And on Betty Crocker, we're re-launching our Brownies to give consumers more premium ingredients and flavor variety.","Turning to convenience stores and foodservice, we\u2019ll continue growth for our focus six platform in 2017 with frozen meals and snacks leading the way. We are expanding distribution of Pillsbury pancakes and bagels in schools leveraging our no artificial colors and flavors renovation. And we\u2019ll continue to grow distribution for our snacks in convenience stores leveraging the Nature Valley news from US retail but also bringing channel specific news like Chex Mix hot and spicy renovation. In Canada, we\u2019re changing our Yoplait source messaging, repositioning it from a diet product to great tasting yogurt made with real fruit and no added sugar. We will also bring gluten-free Cheerios news to Canada in 2017 and scaling up the rollout of Annie\u2019s to capitalize on the sizeable natural and organic segment in this market. In Europe, we introduced new flavors of H\u00e4agen-Dazs Stick Bars and extend the line to markets beyond France. We are also introducing Old El Paso Stand 'N Stuff minis targeting younger consumers as well as the appetizer [indiscernible] fruit in the bottom Greek style yogurt.","We have exciting news planned for emerging markets in 2017 as well. In Brazil, we are launching new Yoki popcorn products supporting our new Carolina yogurt business and executing pricing and managing mix to maintain our margins. In China, we plan to build on our successful Yoplait launch in Shanghai and just this month we introduced Yoplait in Beijing. We also plan to innovate on our H\u00e4agen-Dazs mooncake line launching rose shaped varieties. In India, we\u2019ll drive strong growth for our Pillsbury business to increase distribution and new product launches in sweet snacks and meals, including new cakes and pizza mixes. And finally in Mexico, we\u2019ll leverage digital support in-store, marketing and event sampling to expand our successful Nature Valley franchise. Now as Don mentioned earlier we see a number of opportunities to accelerate our margin expansion efforts over the next two years. We\u2019ll continue to benefit from HMM and our previously announced cost saving projects. And we\u2019re taking additional actions to further expand our margins. These include sharpening the focus of our trade and consumer investments between our growth and foundation businesses, reducing complexity by streamlining our SKUs in generating more profitable mix, and delivering additional savings from our supply chain and our zero-based budgeting practices. And in total, these efforts will help us drive our adjusted operating profit margin to 20% by fiscal 2018. We expect our efforts to drive focused growth in margin expansion will result in fiscal 2017 organic net sales growth to range between flat and down 2% with 150 basis points improvement in adjusted operating profit margin and 6% to 8% growth in constant currency adjusted diluted EPS.","Now looking ahead to fiscal 2018, we expect modest growth in organic net sales as we maintain positive momentum on many growth businesses and see improvements in others such as US Yogurt in China. The full benefit of our margin expansion efforts will help drive adjusted operating profit margin to 20% and will generate a low double digit increase in constant currency adjusted diluted EPS in 2018.","So, let me close today by summarizing our key messages. We made important progress to return our business to growth in organic sales and operating profit in 2016. We strengthened our portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures as well as category and market expansions. We\u2019re taking clear action across the portfolio to drive focused growth, margin expansion and strong returns in fiscal 2017 and 2018. And these efforts will set the stage for sustainable long-term growth and value creation for General Mills\u2019 shareholders.","So that concludes our prepared remarks this morning. So operator, you can open the call up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Lazar, Barclays. Please go ahead.","Andrew Lazar","Good morning, everybody. If we think about the, I think in fiscal \u201816, you talked about 350 million in savings, and I think it led to a little less than 100 basis points of operating margin expansion. I think over the next two years, you've got incremental savings of about 250 million, but obviously you\u2019re looking for a very significant step up, 300 basis points or so in operating margin expansion. And so, I guess, and that's despite obviously some organic sales decline perhaps in aggregate over the next two years. So I guess the question is really where does that incremental margin expansion come from that you\u2019re projecting. I'm assuming it's the work that's being done around this portfolio segmentation, but I'm trying to get -- you get the sense of what I'm looking for?","Don Mulligan","Yes. Andrew, this is Don. You\u2019re right. As we look forward, we\u2019ll get additional benefit from the projects we have in place and obviously underlying HMM will continue as we go ahead both \u201817 and \u201818. What you\u2019ll see in \u201818 is, it's really going to be the full-year benefit of the initiatives that we\u2019re going to get started in place, we started at \u201916, we\u2019re going to get partial benefit in \u201817 and even greater benefit in \u201918. And so whether that is sharpening our practices on trade efficiencies, but more importantly as we look at SKU rationalization, as we look at the portfolio as you mentioned, more rigorously, there is a mix benefit to us as well. And so you\u2019ll see that come through in \u201817 and even more so as we go into \u201818.","Andrew Lazar","Got it. And then just, I know this past year, you shifted the strategy a little bit on some of the brands that were going to take on a little bit more of a value orientation and I guess, did you learn some things from that effort that presumably made you a lot more comfortable with going kind of much more all-in on this sort of portfolio segmentation strategy?","Jeff Harmening","Andrew, this is Jeff Harmening. And the answer is, yes, we did and we turned around our baking business and we stabilized our share in Betty Crocker. We also grew share in our Pillsbury refrigerated business despite the fact that our merchandising was down mid-single digits. So we get the value right on desserts, and we found that by optimizing some trade in Pillsbury, we could actually still grow share and the profitability of that business. And at the same time, we also found that when we focused our consumer spending on the areas that had the highest returns, things like cereal and snacking, we also found that we like the returns we got there. So we learned a lot in F16 that has informed how we look at F17 and beyond.","Andrew Lazar","Great. Thank you, everybody.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Bryan Spillane","Hey, good morning, everyone. I guess one of the questions that we've kind of seen this morning I think is just around the plans for consumer spend and trade spend going forward, and it seems like -- it sounds like your ad spend or consumer spend will be down in \u201817, not sure where it will be for \u201818, but just I guess how we should think about kind of getting to sustainable sales growth, while it sounds like maybe some of the consumer spend may be coming down even from where it was in \u201816?","Jeff Harmening","Well, as we look at our US portfolio, what I would tell you is that, our advertising spend in aggregate will be down a little bit, but I will also say that we\u2019ve focused our advertising spending and it will obviously grow on the areas that we think have the highest returns and the highest possibilities for growth. So if you think about cereal for example or bars or natural and organic and so we really replaced our best on the area where we think we have the best opportunities for growth. So even if advertising is down a little bit, we believe that we've refocused the spending that we do have in areas that are going to work harder for us. ","The other thing that I will tell you is that we feel great about our renovation efforts and we saw the benefits of those starting in the back half of this year. So whatever is gluten free on Cheerios or the taste improvement on Nature Valley or No, No, No in cereal, those things really only started in the back half of this year, and so those will carry forward to next year, as well as some more renovation, which I\u2019ll talk in more detail about in a couple of weeks. So our renovation efforts will carry over and we feel very positive about those. We also think we have a better new product line-up next year. So despite the fact that our consumer spending is going to be down a little bit as well as our trade, we feel like we\u2019re putting the spending in the right places. Our renovation is working and we have increased levels of new product innovation.","Don Mulligan","And Bryan, this is Don. Just to add some other context to that, to quantify to Jeff's point, when we look at where we\u2019re investing this year, cereal, bars, our media spending behind those businesses will be up mid-single digits. Natural and Organic will be up strong double digits. Our international business will be up low-single digits in its media spend. So, where we're talking about our growth opportunities, we are seeing increased investments. The other thing not to lose sight of is that we also have investments going back into the products, so it's not always just in the media line, Ken mentioned about our renovation in soup for example, obviously the full-year benefit of gluten and No, No, No on cereal have a topline benefit, but as we talked about in F16, there were some product costs related to that as well. So we invest back, it\u2019s sharpening where we\u2019re investing back on the media and it\u2019s also continuing to invest back in our products.","Bryan Spillane","Thank you. That's very helpful.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Growe of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Chris Growe","Hi, good morning. I just wanted to ask you had some very compelling margin targets now for fiscal \u201818, but certainly over that time, revenue growth is going to be relatively soft and I guess I want to understand as you come out of this and the growth brands grow at a faster rate and foundation grants go down, is the intention then to get back on, we\u2019ll call it, algorithm for top line growth that there is some sort of one-time reset if you will cause for the top line that occur over the next couple of years, just a question for you if you could please.","Ken Powell","Well, the answer to that question is yes, there is an element of kind of one-time adjustment in that promotion spending and that will happen over 12 to 18 months, but once we have removed that volume from the business, the intention is to very much looking for stability. As we said, we\u2019re going to continue to invest in those businesses, continue to bring innovation, but there is this one-time adjustment as we go through a very thoughtful analysis of all of the promotional spending and remove the parts that really aren\u2019t delivering a return. I don\u2019t know Don, if you want to add anything.","Don Mulligan","Yeah. I think the way to think about it Chris is, Ken hit on the right themes, but our growth businesses that 75% of our portfolio that we expect to grow low single digits in \u201817, we expect that rate to accelerate slightly because we expect our US Yogurt business to be improving as we get out of \u201818 into \u201819. China and emerging markets, more broadly, China and Brazil, we expect to strengthen as well. So those businesses, we both have a strong base today, but we have very strong plans in place and reasons to believe that we\u2019ll see some slight acceleration in growth and then to Ken\u2019s point, the foundation business is really the stable corn. If you think about those brands, they\u2019re large, high share scaled businesses, primarily here in the US or entirely here in the US, but they are also, they are receptive and reactive to targeted investments and as Ken said, we\u2019ll continue to do that. And so while there may be a one-time step down over the next year to 18 months, we do expect those brands to stabilize our time and as a result, as we get through \u201818 into \u201819, we fully expect to be back on what I\u2019d call a more normal operating model, which would be driven by low single digit sales growth as a start point.","Chris Growe","Okay. And just as a quick follow-up to that Don, in terms of the foundation brands, they are important to your portfolio from a cash flow standpoint certainly and the margin profile, are they candidates for divestiture, is that the way we should think about those or is it more about better managing those brands, just trying to get a sense of kind of where you spend on that?","Don Mulligan","The fact that we've been more intentional about our portfolio doesn't change our position on potential divestitures. We needed to review our portfolio and assess whether if you do this, you drive more value to shareholders via divestiture, but it's a high bar. As we said today, those foundation brands are very profitable, cash generative and quite honestly, generally have low tax bases. So they are very much core. As Ken said, they are no less important to our future financial returns and shareholder returns in our growth brands. They just have a different role.","Chris Growe","Okay. Thank you for the color there. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Goldman, JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Ken Goldman","Hi, good morning, everyone. International volume is quite high this period. I think you benefited, if you\u2019ve said this, forgive me, but from an accounting shift in Europe, just curious if you can size that benefit for the quarter for us. Is it reasonable for us to model an equal headwind this upcoming quarter, just wondering if we can get a little color on that?","Ken Powell","Sure. Ken, Jeff Siemon noted [Technical Difficulty] businesses this past year and what you\u2019ll see is in the quarter, Q4, International had 10%, organic sales growth. About six points of that was because of the shifts from yield play [ph] in Europe. So think about underlying at 4%, which is very much in line with what the full-year was for International. So think of that mid-single digit organic sales growth is where International performed both for the full year and in the quarter.","Ken Goldman","Okay. And then switching subjects on Yogurt, in the US, I get the challenges that a traditional yogurt might have sort of as a category versus Greek in a deflationary dairy environment, but I'm less sure what's been driving some of Mills\u2019 yogurt share losses within traditional. At least that's what Nielsen data would suggest, and maybe mills traditionally is losing some share to known traditional, and I'm just curious what the, if you could talk a little bit about the plan to turn that around?","Jeff Harmening","So this is Jeff Harmening. So what I would say is that in general, the yogurt category is growing and we think it's growing to grow and despite recent challenges, we think we can grow in it as well. Specifically, our plans in the upcoming year, I think the recipe for yogurt is very similar to what the recipe for -- as it\u2019s been for cereal to get it back to growth, which has improved renovation and innovation, specifically on the brands that you talked about, our yield play and light [ph] business has really been challenged. Our original yogurt business hasn't been too bad, but our Yield Play and Light business has been challenged, as has been our merchandising. And importantly, as we look at this coming year, what we need to do is we need to get back to the right merchandising plan which we will do. We\u2019ll shift some spending out of consumer spending and to merchandising to make sure we get the right merchandising plan on traditional and we also need to make sure that we're renovating our core traditional businesses just the same way as we have in Big G and you\u2019ll see a lot more of that this coming year, as well as growing up the innovation on things like organic.","Ken Goldman","Great. Thanks so much.","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexia Howard of Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Alexia Howard","Good morning, everyone. One of the things that's coming through really strongly is the ever escalating pace of change here and the amount of disruptions that's going on in the industry. I'm thinking about the softer and participated cost-cutting, lots of renovation, lots of innovation, competitive dynamics changing in yogurt, retail is doing different things, how do you avoid or minimize execution risk here and how are you changing your incentive structure maybe to reflect some of that. Thank you and I have a follow-up.","Ken Powell","Okay. Well, thanks, Alexia for the question and the observation, which I think is spot-on as we would say, and we've said many times that the pace of change in our industry now is as fast as we've seen in many, many years and that's really the reason why we really have changed so many things about our approach within our businesses around the world, our super high focus on consumer-first just to acknowledge how rapidly consumers are changing their values around food. We have to make sure that we stay even with that, and we appreciate your observation that our pace of bringing innovation and renovation to the market is accelerating because that's been our goal. We really feel that that's the right thing to do in this environment. So I agree with your observation, we\u2019re very focused on keeping our organization here, we\u2019re on our toes, we are very focused on the consumer, we want to bring the right kind of innovation at a higher pace because that's appropriate, and we are very, very focused as you said on execution in that environment, and we feel good about the way, particularly the way we executed our renovation last year. ","Our incentive, let me just make this comment on incentive for our operating units who are kind of the tip of the speed for all this innovation. Their incentive reflects very much sort of the dual mandate that we\u2019ve talked about at CAGNY and we\u2019ve talked about here today. We are focused on both growth and return and our operating units are incented on growth and return and both the growth businesses and the foundation businesses are incented that way. So while our growth targets may be more modest on the foundation businesses, it's just as important to the company that they get their targets as the growth guys do. So everyone is aligned with this dual approach that we\u2019ve talked about and we think that we\u2019re going to benefit from that. I don't know if anyone else would want to jump in on that. Okay. Everyone is happy with my answer, Alexia. I guess we\u2019ll go and take the follow-up.","Alexia Howard","A quick follow-up on the GMO labeling, I know we've now got the new federal proposals that came in last week, I think Campbell\u2019s has said that they are planning to do on back labeling, because there is obviously the option to do everything via QR codes, just wondering what your plans are for that. Or maybe it's too early to tell? Thank you.","Ken Powell","Well, I think it's probably a bit early to tell, but as you\u2019ve noted, I mean, it's really out of our hands and it\u2019s in Congress right now and it\u2019s in the hands of the Senate, and I think as you may have heard us say in the past Alexia, there has been a lot of debate and at this point, General Mills is for whatever bill can get 60 votes in the Senate, and we think that that bill will certainly have the pre-emption that we need so that we get out of this state-by-state thing and it's going to allow a variety of options for how to label as you noted, but we just have to see how that's going to play out over the next period of time. Yes. Obviously if it happens, I mean we\u2019ll be very relieved because the prospect of multi-state regulation is going to be very costly for the industry and very confusing for consumers.","Alexia Howard","Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow","Hi, there. Thank you. I guess two quicker questions. Can you help us quantify the mix benefit of this growth in foundation strategy like or the growth brands, maybe 100, 200 basis points higher in terms of gross margin or price mix or something like that? And then Jeff Harmening, a question about Annie\u2019s, you mentioned that you\u2019re leveraging the US retail sales force more aggressively. I think there were some execution issues last year or last fall as you try to leverage that more aggressively. What have you learned since then and are you happy with how the US retail sales force is pushing Annie\u2019s and how is it working differently? Thanks.","Don Mulligan","I\u2019ll take the mix question. As soon as you said, can you quantify, everyone looked at me. So I'll take the mix question and then I will pass it to Jeff. So Rob, the way to think about it is, there is not necessarily so much between the growth and the foundation, because actually they are about the same margins as you're seeing here today and yes, that just speaks to the underlying strength of the foundation businesses as well. So, there\u2019s not so much of mix between the two groups of brands. It's really within businesses, our SKU rationalization is driving variable mix. The trade strategy as we see more baseline sales versus promoted sales and Ken alluded to how that is one of the key sources of turning around our cereal business this year. That's just really providing the mix benefit for us both in \u201816 and as we go into \u201817.","Jeff Harmening","And on Annie\u2019s, we\u2019re thrilled with the performance of that business and we\u2019re going to accelerate that growth in F17 and we see accelerated growth from Annie\u2019s in this fiscal year and on the backs of distribution, which has been consistent throughout the year, distribution growth as well as improved merchandising and as the year has gone on and we will keep doing those things with the Annie\u2019s business. There is lots of distribution we can get. We can keep doing better merchandising, and we will add on top of that, this expansion into categories that we think are really viable for Annie\u2019s, namely yoghurt and cereal.","In terms of what we learned earlier in the year, what I would tell you is that with any integration, there are things that don't go perfectly, but there is nothing that hasn't been rectified, and at the beginning of our year, really, it was our merchandising plans that didn't come together the way we wanted them to. We were gaining good distribution, but we have seen that change in the back half of the year and our sales force is executing really well, both in the natural and organic channel and in traditional retail against our organic brands right now.","Robert Moskow","Okay. So is it Don, just to make sure I understand, so there is no real difference between the mix profile or gross margin profile of the two parts of the business?","Don Mulligan","No, the operating margin on both our growth and foundation businesses are very similar.","Robert Moskow","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Kenneth Zaslow of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Kenneth Zaslow","Hey, good morning, everyone. Can you just talk about the growth that you\u2019ve had in the reformulation, the success that you\u2019ve had is, my understanding is, is it because of the first mover advantage, because you\u2019re kind of ahead of your other peers and is there a potential that if other competitors actually couple along with the reformulation, will that go away or will that actually be better as the consumer becomes more aware of it and how do you think of that sustainability of the opportunity from the reformulation of your products?","Jeff Harmening","Well, I think two separate questions. I think they have been successful because we follow what the consumers wanted, and whether that was, whether that is more taste on Cinnamon Toast Crunch or gluten-free on Cheerios or more icing on Toaster Strudel, I think the success we\u2019ve had is from [Technical Difficulty] whether it\u2019s execution on the product front we feel good about or improved marketing we feel good about and doing that with brands that people trust and you can generate important news that consumers care about on brands they trust and the results have been pretty good. In terms of how long this can last, I guess I will go back to the best example we have is Chex and cereal where we grew that business on the back of gluten-free for double digits for like five years in a row, and so we believe that the long-lasting impacts of getting the products right for renovation, we believe they\u2019re long lasting and it\u2019s tied back to the combination of what consumers want, really good marketing and brands that people really care about.","Ken Powell","And I would just may be add a detail or two. First of all, Ken, oats are kind of a core ingredient for many of our products, not only cereal, but also bars and oats are naturally gluten-free as an example, and so now that we've figured out the technology for how to purify our oats stream, there is quite a bit of intellectual property in that process, and so we think we probably do have some insulation there, and that's good. And then to your point on first mover advantage, I think that's probably true as well, but we\u2019re pleased that the organization now is both, as Jeff said, understanding these consumer wants and then responding at an ever faster pace, so that we\u2019re out there quickly and we can get to very healthy sign for our organization.","Kenneth Zaslow","And just a quick follow-up is, what is the key market or the key driver behind the creation of Tiny Toast, it\u2019s like I'm trying to figure out how that fits within the portfolio and why there is a need for a new brand, what is it suiting and then I\u2019ll leave it at that?","Ken Powell","Well, Tiny Toast fits the consumer need of having cereals that people love. It tastes great and it\u2019s a very whimsical product, very whimsical name, whimsical marketing and it fits the niche for teens and we think it's a good cereal for teens and it just tastes really, really good. And we've seen success with cinnamon toast crunch and sometimes people want gluten-free and no artificial colors and flavors and sometimes they just want stuff that tastes good and that's where Tiny Toast fits in.","Kenneth Zaslow","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from John Baumgartner of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","John Baumgartner","Good morning. Thanks for the question. Don, I\u2019d like to ask in terms of your updated margin targets for fiscal \u201818, if you can speak to how profitability has progressed for your international operations as you kind of build scale and how much of that factors into the guidance increase? Is there any explicit updated margin target for the international segment as well? Thanks.","Don Mulligan","Let me speak for international today, but what I would tell you is international will participate in the margin expansion as well. Much of what you see the change in the focus on the portfolio really relates more to our USRO business, which started the journey this year and it is doing it in a sharp profession as we go into \u201917. So that's where you\u2019ll see the most direct change I think versus prior expectations, but you don't actually look to see same margin expansion for the reasons we've talked about before, whether it\u2019s productivity outstripping inflation, the mix management and the underlying growth of the businesses, particularly in emerging markets, strengthened return to their more historical growth rates.","John Baumgartner","Okay. Thanks, Don.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from...","Jeff Siemon","Sorry, Tina. I think we probably have time for one more. So maybe if we can get one additional in before we close down here.","Operator","Perfect. We have a question from David Driscoll of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","David Driscoll","Great. Thank you and thanks for squeezing me in guys. So two questions. The first one is on the cost savings. Can you talk a little bit more about how you get to the $600 million and then what learning has allowed you to upgrade the savings target and then kind of the big one here is, is it substantially likely that we should expect you to be able to upgrade this target even further in light of trends within the sector?","Don Mulligan","Well, as far as our cost savings, from the 500, 600, this is not the first time we've increased those as we\u2019ve seen further opportunity and what I would say is, as we work through Century and Compass and Catalyst and implementing ZBB across the business, we've seen slightly better savings in virtually every one of those initiatives, but I particularly point to Century and ZBB as we streamline our manufacturing footprint, our ability to find HMM and find savings has increased even beyond what we thought it would. And then, ZBB, we have been learning as we've gone and as we both expand it within the US and then as we go forward, expand it more formally through our international business, we see further upside there as well. So it's really been a matter of each project we've tackled has generated a bit more savings and given us clear visibility in terms of what the final price will be. And as far as future margin targets, we just have refreshed that today, so we\u2019re focused on delivering those, we think they\u2019re the right targets for us. We think they will set us apart from a competitive standpoint, and that's what we're focused on right now.","Ken Powell","And again, I think it goes back to the earlier question, we have been very, very focused on execution of these projects and executing them well and we feel that we've done that and across the enterprise and these initiatives, I would say, we\u2019re gaining increasing confidence in our ability to do them well.","David Driscoll","One final question for me, Ken, on the portfolio segmentation, I've always viewed the company as one that was discerning between low growth and higher growth businesses and where you should put investments or not. So I think you responded, I mean, when you put out something like segmentation, I kind of think you always did this. I don't think this is brand-new inside at General Mills. I think it might be new in terms of how you\u2019re presenting it to us today and maybe there is an intensity that\u2019s higher, but I just want to get your response to that kind of a statement because it's not been my judgment over years that you just weren't segmenting your portfolio. So how would you grade the difference with this kind of discussion today and slides and the deck and comments in the press release about segmentation?","Ken Powell","So I think it's a good observation. And I mean, this is not something that we've discovered a couple of weeks ago and I think as you've heard from some of the other comments, much of the work in how we\u2019re approaching this is building on initiatives and things that we\u2019ve been trying and developing over the last year or two and we just concluded after seeing the results and seeing the effectiveness of this work that it would be helpful. Frankly, it helps us a lot internally to be much more declarative and intentional about the role that we want our different businesses to play. So we just decided I can\u2019t remember what your word, what your term was, but just to be more declarative and much more intentional about how we were going to pursue these initiatives and I think you used the word intensity, so even higher focus. We think that\u2019s very good for us inside the business and it\u2019s also very helpful I think for investors to understand how we\u2019re looking at it. So it is, as you said, a build with more specifics. I don't know if anyone -- we\u2019re good.","David Driscoll","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Jeff Siemon","Yeah. Great. I think that's all the time we have this morning. So, before we close everyone, I will just remind you, our investor Day event coming up two weeks from today and we welcome you to listen to the webcast starting at 10 AM Eastern or if you can join us in New York, please send us an RSVP so we can make sure to include you. Again, I'll be available all day if we didn't get your questions and please give me a call. And with that, I think we\u2019ll wrap up. Thanks very much. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect all lines. Thank you and have a good day."],"9821":["General Mills (NYSE:GIS) Q1 2013 Earnings Call September 19, 2012  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Kristen Smith Wenker - Vice President of Investor Relations","Donal Leo Mulligan - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President","Jonathon J.

Welcome to the General Mills Fiscal 2013 Results First Quarter Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Wednesday, September 19, 2012. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kris Wenker, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Madam.","Kristen Smith Wenker","Thanks, operator. Good morning, everybody. I'm here with Ken Powell, our CEO; Don Mulligan, our CFO; and Jon Nudi, who is President of our U.S. Snacks division. I'll turn the call over to them in just a minute.","First, I've got to cover my usual housekeeping items. Our press release on first quarter results was issued over the wire services earlier this morning and is also posted on our website if you need a copy. We've posted slides on our website, too, that supplements today's prepared remarks. These remarks will include forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions. The second slide in today's presentation lists factors that could cause our future results to be different than our current estimates.","And one last note for me, we provided a data page with historical sales and growth rates for our newly organized U.S. Retail division and International region. You can find that data page under the Investors section of our website.","And so with that, I'll turn you over to my colleagues, starting with Don.","Donal Leo Mulligan","Thanks, Kris, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us this morning.","Slide 4 summarizes our results for the quarter. Sales totaled $4.1 billion, up 5%, and segment operating profit increased 6% to $769 million. These results were led by our International segment, including contributions from acquired businesses. Net earnings totaled $549 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.82 as reported. These results include a net increase in the mark-to-market valuation of certain commodity positions in grain inventories, along with the one-time tax benefit and restructuring charges. Excluding these items affecting comparability, our adjusted diluted EPS would be $0.66. This was a bit better than we planned, thanks to strong international performance that benefited operating profit and contributed to a lower underlying tax rate.","Slide 5 shows the components of our net sales growth. On an as-reported basis, net sales increased 5%, with growth driven by acquisitions. Pound volume contributed 9 points of growth in the quarter, sales mix and net price realization subtracted 2 points of sales growth, and foreign exchange also reduced net sales by 2 points. Excluding acquisitions, net sales were 1% below year-ago levels as reported and up 1% in constant currency.","Slide 6 details net sales performance for our newly organized U.S. retail divisions. In total, net sales declined 1%, including the impact of merchandising spending to support new item launches and sharper price points on certain established products. Pound volume was 2% lower in the quarter. This was a sequential improvement from the previous quarter, and it included steady improvement through the last 3 months.","Sales for our Bakeries and Foodservice segment declined 2% in the first quarter. Pound volume was up 2%, but that growth was offset by negative price realization mix. Hot breakfast items, snacks and baking mixes led our sales performance in the quarter.","As shown on Slide 8, our first quarter international net sales grew 36% on a constant currency basis, with growth across all 4 regions. In Canada, sales increased 28%, including the acquired Libert\u00e9 yogurt business. Sales for the region combining Europe, Australia and New Zealand increased 51%. This top line performance reflects the addition of Yoplait International and good gains by Nature Valley in the U.K., H\u00e4agen-Dazs in France and Old El Paso in Australia. Sales in the Asia-Pacific region increased 20%, led by China. In the Latin America, constant currency sales increased 20%. This was before Yoki, which will begin contributing to General Mills' sales and operating profits in our second quarter. Excluding acquisitions, international constant currency sales increased at an 8% rate in Q1.","In the first quarter, our underlying gross margin declined 40 basis points to 38.2%. This excludes the impact of mark-to-market valuation for certain grain inventories and commodity hedges we'll use in future periods. The addition of Yoplait International accounts for the majority of the underlying gross margin decline. The remainder reflects higher input cost. And while grain costs have gone up this summer, we're still estimating 2% to 3% inflation for General Mills in fiscal 2013, well below last year's 10% inflation rate, and we're now roughly 75% covered on our commodity needs for the fiscal year.","Slide 10 shows our first quarter operating profit growth split up by segment. U.S. Retail profit was 2% below year-ago levels, nearing the volume trend. Advertising expense was down 13% in the quarter as our marketing spending was weighted towards promotional activity this period. International profit increased 56%. That includes incremental contributions from Yoplait and a 17% increase in advertising spending. Excluding acquisitions, profit still increased at a double-digit rate. Bakeries & Foodservice profit grew 10% in the quarter, reflecting pound volume growth and higher grain merchandising earnings.","After tax earnings from joint ventures were lower in the quarter, primarily reflecting input cost inflation and unfavorable foreign exchange for CPW. On a constant currency basis, CPW sales increased 1% with double-digit sales growth in emerging markets, largely offset by category weakness in Western Europe. Constant currency sales for H\u00e4agen-Dazs Japan grew 4%, led by new products and distribution gains.","Completing our review of the income statement, corporate unallocated expenses, excluding mark-to-market effects, were up $11 million in the quarter, primarily due to higher pension expense. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.7% as reported, well below last year, due to a one-time non-cash tax benefit from the restructuring of a subsidiary, which resulted in a reduction of deferred tax liabilities. Excluding items affecting comparability, our tax rate was 31.4% this year compared to 32.4% a year ago. We still see our full year underlying tax rate running at about 33%, and average diluted shares outstanding were essentially flat in the quarter. For the full year, we continue to target a net reduction in average diluted shares outstanding.","Turning to the balance sheet. Let me first answer a likely question. The large increase in cash on our balance sheet is the funding for Yoki. We funded $851 million of the $940 million purchase price with cash. And since we report our Brazil business on a 1-month lag, this cash was still reflected on our balance sheet at the end of the quarter. With the Yoki acquisition closed and the maturity of a long term debt note earlier this month, our cash balance today has returned to a more normalized level. Now in a quarter where net sales increased 5%, our core working capital declined 4%. Our working capital efficiency continues to translate into improved operating cash flow. Over the last 5 years, our operating cash flow has increased at a 7% compound rate, and growth in operating cash flow accelerated to 11% this quarter.","So with the first quarter completed, we're on track to achieve our 2013 targets. We expect to deliver mid-single-digit growth in net sales and segment operating profit on the base business, with Yoki Brazil and Yoplait Canada contributing 9 months of incremental sales and profit this year. We expect to generate adjusted diluted earnings per share of approximately $2.65. As a reminder, our EPS guidance excludes mark-to-market effects, restructuring expense, acquisition integration cost and this quarter's one-time tax benefit.","With that, I'll turn the microphone over to Jon for an update on our U.S. Snacks business. Jon?","Jonathon J. Nudi","Thanks, Don. Hello, everybody. It's a pleasure to be on the call this morning. It seems that there's been a lot of investor interest in snack businesses lately. So I'd like to give you an update on our U.S. Snacks portfolio and the growth that we're seeing on our brands.","U.S. consumers are snacking more than ever, and consumers have changed what to grab for a quick refuel. Instead of mindless munching, consumers are increasingly looking for options to provide real nutritional benefits. So it's no wonder that Better-for-you snacks is the fast-growing segment in the Snacks category. We define this segment using a variety of Nielsen-measured categories. And retail sales increased 6% fiscal 2012 to reach nearly $30 billion. We see plenty of room for continued growth in this segment.","Reported net sales for our Snacks division have grown at an 8% compound rate over the past 3 years and we're up 15% in fiscal 2012, so we're gaining share in this Better-for-you segment. Our Snacks portfolio is split into 3 distinct categories: Grain, Fruit and Savory snacks, as shown on Slide 18. In fiscal 2012, these 3 segments generated $1.6 billion of reported net sales. We have a strong presence in traditional grocery stores, where our pound volume grew 3% last year, with the majority of our Snacks volume that's sold in the faster-growing nontraditional food outlets, such as mass merchandisers, club and dollar stores. For example, club stores represent our largest nontraditional channel. Our pound volume grew 8% there last year as our larger mega-packs represent value to clubs through our consumers. We continue to bring product news [ph] and strong innovation to this channel.","Small-store formats like dollar stores are a growth channel too. Here we offer smaller packages and attractive dollar price point that introduces new consumers to our brands. Our regular sized packages also sell well in these outlets, making this our fastest-growing channel, with pound volume up 9% last year.","General Mills is the market leader in the $900 million Fruit snacks category. Category sales are growing at a 3% pace in the latest 12 months, driven by increasing popularity of fruit snacks with all family appeal. Last year, we saw heightened competition from value players in this segment, resulting in a share decline for us. We expect to post renewed sales and share growth this year with a solid line of new products, including Mott's fruit snacks that appeal to kids and adults alike. Our Mott's Medleys are made with real fruit and vegetable juice and provide 100% of the daily value of vitamin C, with just 80 calories per serving. We just launched this line and it's off to a great start.","The Savory snacks category generates more than $2 billion in annual retail sales and has grown at a 9% rate over the past year. We've just launched several new flavors of our very popular Chex Mix and we introduced a new product line, Pillsbury Baguette Chips. These are made from baked bread. They're great by themselves or with your favorite dip.","And of course, Grain snack bars is our largest and fastest growing business. We created this category back in 1975 with the launch of Nature Valley Granola Bars. Today, the category generates $3 billion in retail sales and it's growing at a 5% annual rate. Our sales are well outpacing the category, driving solid market share gains for us. As you can see on Slide 21, our dollar share of the category has increased 10 points over the past 5 years. And through the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we've gained another full point of share. We're growing our sales and the category by innovating. We've kept the original Nature Valley Crunchy bars growing and we've added new flavors and formats. Then at 2006, we launched a very successful Fiber One snack bar line and that unlocked a whole new level of market growth.","In fiscal 2012, we've further expanded the Fiber One line with the introduction of 90-calorie brownies. In one year, just 2 brownie flavors generated more than $100 million in retail sales. To put that into context, one industry benchmark set the standard of $50 million for a successful new product introduction. We're currently launching a 90-calorie chocolate chip cookie that's off to a terrific start. We're also just launching new Fiber One Chewy Bars, available in kid-friendly flavors like chocolate and peanut butter and jelly. At just 100 calories per bar, they have the nutrition that moms love, including 20% of the daily value of fiber and 10% of the daily value of calcium.","When it comes to Grain snacks, Nature Valley continues to be our flagship brand. Our newest variety is Nature Valley Protein Bars, which contain 10 grams of protein in each bar. They contributed double-digit retail sales growth for the brand in fiscal 2012, and they're on track to be as big as Fiber One Brownies in year one retail sales. We have new flavors and formats in Nature Valley bars coming throughout the year, and we expect the brand to continue to lead our Snacks portfolio.","Now I've been talking specifically about our U.S. Snacks division, but of course General Mills' Snacks business is much broader than this. In small plant and fields [ph], we market Cascadian Farm organic granola bars, along with Larabars and \u00dcber bars, which are great-tasting natural nutrition bar options. The retail sales have been growing at a double-digit rate, and Food Should Taste Good chips have been a great addition to our natural foods offerings. Our snacks are growing nicely in food service outlets too. Net sales were up 11% in the first quarter, driven by new product introductions and distribution gains in convenience stores. And we're just beginning to tap into the possibilities for our snacks internationally. Our U.S. portfolio is an innovation pipeline for our international markets. For example, Nature Valley brand is available in nearly 80 markets around the world, and we see many opportunities to expand our other snacks brands into more international markets as the global middle class continues to expand and we gain scale in more emerging markets worldwide.","So to summarize my comments this morning, the future is bright for General Mills' U.S. Snacks division, as consumers are snacking more and increasingly seek out Better-for-you options. We're building on our history of innovation, solid new product introductions across our 3 product platforms. We're also leveraging our strong brands at fast-growing non-traditional food outlets, which should drive sales and profit growth in the U.S. and around the world in fiscal 2013 and beyond.","Thank you for your time this morning. I'll now turn the call over to Ken Powell.","Kendall J. Powell","Okay. Thanks, Jon, and good morning, everybody. You just heard about the terrific innovation that John and his team have going in our U.S. Snacks business. So I want to going to give you a quick summary of the business trends and the innovation that we're seeing elsewhere at General Mills.","Across our U.S. Retail categories, we are seeing pricing moderate and volume improve as we begin to lap last year's significant price increases. As Don mentioned earlier, we still expect inflation in 2013, but at a rate well below the 10% we experienced in 2012. So we do anticipate a more stable food price environment for consumers as we go forward.","We're seeing improving trends for our business as well. In the first quarter, General Mills U.S. Retail pound volume declined 2% and demonstrated sequential improvement over last year. Underlying gross margin for General Mills showed sequential improvement as well, and we expect both our volume and gross margin trends to continue to improve in the remaining 9 months of the year. Our confidence reflects the fact that our categories are on trend with consumer demand for great-tasting, healthy and convenient foods, all at a good value. Because they're on trend, our categories are growing. Each of our 10 largest categories generates at least $2 billion in annual retail sales. And with combined sales of over $40 billion, even low single-digit growth on this sales base is significant.","We're innovating to drive growth for our brands and our categories. Let me give you a few examples. The gluten-free benefit of our Chex cereals continues to resonate with consumers. Sales of new Apple Cinammon Chex are off to a strong start, and we're reaching consumers with both traditional and digital advertising. In combination, these activities drove a 23% retail sales gain for Chex in the first quarter.","Multigrain Cheerios continues to post strong gains, including the new Peanut Butter variety. First quarter retail sales increased 19%. And Cascadian Farm is the #1 granola brand in America, organic or otherwise. We've just added an Ancient Grains variety and increased marketing support, helping to drive an 11% increase in retail sales this quarter.","For our cereal business in total, we experienced a rare decline in sales this quarter as merchandising levels were below the year-ago period. But we expect our growth momentum to resume in the second quarter, and we continue to expect sales and earnings growth for Big G in 2013 in total.","The first quarter sales decline for our U.S. yogurt business overall masks some good progress made in this period. Our Greek yogurt business turned in a good performance, led by our multipack items. Our Greek retail sales increased 85%, and we picked up nearly a full point in the market share in the Greek segment this quarter. As you know, our 2013 plans for Greek yogurt are just getting started. New Yoplait Greek 100-calorie yogurt is just starting to hit store shelves across the country. And while it's early days, we're very pleased with the initial reaction to this product. We're just now activating our fully integrated marketing campaign and dedicated advertising behind this new line.","We've sharpened our merchandise price points on our core cup products. Customer feedback has been very positive, and broad-based execution is planned throughout the coming months. While it's still early, volume trends on this key business are improving.","Across our U.S. yogurt business in total, we launched 35 new items in the first quarter. These new items have been well accepted by our customers and shipments are building. In addition to Yoplait Greek 100, this includes expanded distribution of our Mountain High brand and the beginning of a phased U.S. rollout of Libert\u00e9. So as we move into the second quarter, we're excited about our innovation and marketing plans in U.S. yogurt.","Other first quarter highlights included good growth from Progresso. We've launched new flavors of Progresso Light and continue to focus our advertising on the great taste of our ready-to-serve soups, and our new Recipe Starters sauces have enjoyed good customer orders to date. In total, first quarter retail sales for Progresso increased 14%, and we added 3 points of market share in the ready-to-serve segment.","On our Totino's hot snacks business, a significant increase in media investment and distribution gains drove growth across our product line. A combination of strong in-store merchandising support, digital media and contributions from new products drove market share gains on our Pillsbury refrigerated dough items. And Green Giant Seasoned Steamers are the latest addition to our frozen vegetable portfolio. We'll begin to activate the support for this seasonal business in the second quarter of the year.","In total, we launched over 70 U.S. Retail new products in the first quarter alone. Account acceptance of these new items is, in total, above our expectations, and we've got more innovation to come later in the year. As we told you in July, our plans call for points of distribution to decline through the first quarter of 2013, largely reflecting the timing of our new product launches. We expect improved distribution trends over the remaining 9 months of the year and look to achieve distribution growth for the year in total.","As our new items reach good store-level distribution, we'll be activating our media and marketing campaigns against these businesses. We're ramping up activity behind our seasonal items such as soup, baking products and frozen vegetables, and we continue to improve the efficiency and impact of our advertising dollars with targeted investments in digital and multicultural media.","We also have a variety of second quarter merchandising events planned to drive customer and consumer excitement. We're expanding our Save Lids to Save Lives program, which benefits breast cancer research. Starting this month, more than 20 General Mills brands will carry pink lids on over 400 million packages. This program extends to our Bakeries & Foodservice businesses too. We're partnering with sororities across the country to increase breast cancer awareness on-campus. In total, General Mills will donate $0.10 for every lid redeemed up to a maximum total donation of $2.5 million. We also continued to expand our successful Box Tops for Education program. Since the inception of this program, we've raised over $475 million for schools across the country.","These are just a few of the merchandising programs we have planned in the months ahead, and with continued strong levels of marketing support and product innovation, we're excited about our prospects for growth in U.S. Retail over the balance of 2013.","Let me turn to our International segment. In the first quarter, we delivered good performance in Europe. Yogurt is our largest business there. Fueled by sales of new varieties of Calin, a functional yogurt high in calcium, and higher levels of advertising across our yogurt portfolio, retail sales increased at a mid-single-digit rate in the quarter, and we added roughly 0.5 point of market share. Our Europe yogurt results now include Ireland, where we reacquired the Yoplait license in May.","H\u00e4agen-Dazs had a good quarter in Europe too. Retail sales increased at a double-digit rate. Our Secret Sensations product was a huge hit in 2012, so we've introduced it into new markets with a new flavor and a new package size in 2013. We've also launched new varieties of pints in mini cups and integrated our marketing efforts across H\u00e4agen-Dazs shops and retail outlets.","For our Europe business in total, we're pleased with our performance. Our growth in this region continues to outpace results for many of our multinational food peers. We now have a great branded position in the important European yogurt market and our other key categories of superpremium ice cream, Mexican meals and grain snacks are all in relatively early stages of development in Europe. So we have great opportunities ahead to increase household penetration of our brands to drive future top line growth.","In Canada, yogurt is a $1.4 billion category. And over the last 5 years, sales have been growing at a 7% rate. In our Canadian yogurt business, we're increasing household penetration on our Libert\u00e9 brand, with distribution gains, new products and television advertising for the first time in Libert\u00e9's history. And earlier this month, General Mills assumed the Canada Yoplait business from the previous licensee. We're planning significant levels of investment behind the Yoplait brand in Canada, including new product innovation, improvements on established products and increased advertising. Together, our Libert\u00e9 and Yoplait brands hold a 35% share of category sales in Canada. With Yoplait added to our business, we're projecting well over $1 billion of retail sales in Canada this fiscal year, making us the fourth largest food manufacturer in the country.","As you know, we're also working to expand our business in emerging markets. We have a large business today in Greater China, and we continue to see robust growth there. First quarter sales in constant currency grew at a strong double-digit rate. This performance is being led by H\u00e4agen-Dazs and our line of Wanchai Ferry frozen dim sum items. And while the overall Chinese economy may be slowing a bit, the demand for branded consumer food products continues to expand. Increasing numbers of Chinese consumers want foods that offer quality, convenience, nutrition and taste, all at a good value. And for our business in China, we're seeing robust growth in both existing and new cities. So we expect demand for our products to remain strong in this important market.","Our growth in India is being driven by our new whole wheat and premium varieties of Pillsbury Atta flour, H\u00e4agen-Dazs Secret Sensations and contributions from our recent acquisition of Parampara foods branded meal starters.","In Brazil, the acquisition of Yoki makes us very excited about our growth prospects. Yoki products are quite popular with Brazilian consumers and hold leading market share positions in growing categories. And our integration efforts are off to a great start. Given Yoki's terrific breadth and scale, we're integrating General Mills' Brazilian employees, products and systems into the Yoki business. We're just one month in and we're already invoicing our customers as a combined company. And the combination of Yoki and General Mills makes us the 15th largest food company in Brazil, significantly expanding our scale in this important market. We'll look forward to reporting back to you on the growth of this business starting in the second quarter.","So with that, let me summarize today's General Mills update. Our first quarter performance was broadly in line with our expectations. Volume and gross margin trends are improving, and we launched over 100 new products. In the second quarter, we'll support both our established and new items with strong levels of media and merchandising. In both Yoplait Canada and Yoki, we'll begin to contribute to our net sales and operating profit. For the full year, we're on track to deliver our sales and profit targets. And more broadly, we see our business portfolio better positioned than ever to deliver balanced global growth for shareholders in the years ahead.","So thank you for your time this morning and for your interest in General Mills. With this, I'm going to open the call for questions. Operator, would you please get us started?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Our first question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Bryan D. Spillane - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Ken, just a question. You had a lot of new product innovation come through in the first quarter, so I guess just 2 questions related to that. First, was there any impact in terms of sales shift meeting? Was there any inventory build or anything that would have sort of inflated sales a little bit more in the first quarter? And then second, just early -- in terms of consumer uptake, consumer receptivity to the new product innovation?","Kendall J. Powell","We started to ship most of those products in August. And so you would've seen some build during August, but I would say kind of progressively over that month. But I would say some build, but not a lot in occurring late in the quarter. In terms of the consumer uptake, it's very early days. But it looks like, for instance, Progresso Recipe Starters, looks like that's going to be good. It's off to a good start, obviously. But soup season is in front of us, but our customers certainly like that product, so we feel good about that one. The cereals, I think, went in very well. It got high levels of distribution, and we think that those will do well. And as we've said to you before, we'll have a number of other and additional new cereals coming in January. So we feel pretty good about our new cereal lineup for the year. All the yogurt items went in, and it's early days for those, but they're gaining distribution well. Early returns on Yoplait Greek 100 is that, that is developing very nicely. We're quite pleased with how that one is going. And that's really before the marketing impact really starts to hit on that new item, so we like what we're seeing on that one as well. And then Libert\u00e9 is just starting a regional role and so it's very early days on that, and we'll report -- we'll give you a more -- in Q2 on Libert\u00e9. But generally, we feel quite good about how our new products are going in.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ed Aaron with RBC Capital Markets.","Edward Aaron - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just trying to get a better sense of kind of when and to what extent we should really start to see the traction build from the innovation and marketing initiatives that you've talked about. Is it realistic to expect positive growth in your yogurt sales this quarter on both a reported and retail basis?","Kendall J. Powell","Well, our goal for the year is sales growth in Yoplait. We'll see accelerating performance, improving performance as we go into the second quarter. We have all these new items on shelf. We turn on the advertising and the consumer activity. So that will really begin to hit in the second quarter and we'll continue that in the third quarter, and so our goal would be to see sales growth there.","Edward Aaron - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then just one other one, if I could. You said a couple of weeks ago that you still expected Q1 to be down in terms of EPS, and it came in a bit better on international. Did you not have maybe the visibility on that international performance at that point in time? Or am I just maybe being too literal about your comments at back-to-school?","Donal Leo Mulligan","Yes. A couple of things broke favorably -- 2 or 3 things broke favorably in the quarter that we only get visibility until -- to the end. International had a strong quarter across a number of markets. China was a significant contributor, for example. But as you can imagine, you're closing the books across 25 different markets, and if they all break a little favorable, it adds up, and that's really what happened in international. So the broad strengths of that business played through. And then the other piece you saw on the tax rate. Some of that was favorably impacted by international or from an earnings mix standpoint. But as you also understand, tax rate can be a little bit volatile just in terms of how you close out open audits, and we have audits across states in different countries. We closed those out during the course of the year. We had some favorable audit closures in the first quarter that benefited the rate as well that again had visibility too, until those are settled. So those are really the 2 big factors as you look at the first quarter. And those 2 together contributed $0.03 or $0.04 to the bottom line.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Can I just make sure that I understand the mid-single-digit sales and operating profit growth guidance from the base business for the full year? I'm assuming that, that excludes acquisitions. So what I'm trying to understand is what the numbers were on an excluding acquisitions basis this quarter. It looks as though organic sales growth was down a little bit this quarter, and excluding the acquisitions, it looks as though operating profit may have been fairly flat, although that's less clear, even with the decline in the advertising spending and the shipments of new products. If that's right and maybe you can confirm that, then where does the acceleration in the top and the bottom line come from for the rest of the year? Are there particular levers, commodity cost inflation that's going to become more favorable going forward?","Donal Leo Mulligan","Alexia, just to clarify, the mid-single-digit sales operating profit is for our business as we entered the year, so it excludes Yoki, it excludes Yoplait Canada, but it does include Yoplait International in total. The reason that we see it accelerating during the year is a couple of things. As Ken -- as we've said before and as Ken pointed to some data this morning, in the U.S., as we see prices lap our increases and the industry's increases from the last year, we expect volume to stabilize and to solidify, and we're starting to see that in the categories, and so that will benefit us as the year unfolds. Second is, as you point to -- we do expect some deceleration of inflation, although I would caution that with the current drought and movement, there is some more pressure than we had originally anticipated coming into the year, and that will play through in the latter part of the year. We still are in that 2% to 3% range of inflation, but obviously, a bit more pressure given where the markets have moved over the last couple of months. And then we expect to see continued strength in International, as we alluded to the -- not only did it grow quite nicely in the first quarter on an as-reported basis, but if you strip out acquisitions, top line grew 8% on a constant currency basis, and so that provides continued momentum as the year unfolds. And our Bakeries & Foodservice business started the year well, 2% volume growth, 10% profit growth, and that business has -- again, has some really solid momentum in some key customer and product line segments that we'll benefit from as the year unfolds as well.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Great. And then maybe the quick follow-up. Could I ask about how you're seeing the category promotional dynamics in cereals changing? It looks as though Post's price per pound has come down quite a bit in the last couple of months. And how are you responding to that?","Kendall J. Powell","Yes. I mean, there are always movements quarter-to-quarter, Alexia. I mean, I think the point that we want to make is, for a variety of reasons, our pressure was quite a bit below what it was a year ago, and this is all about timing, really, and promotional timing. And we knew it was going to be low in June and July, and it was. And so that will restore itself and rebalance as we move into the second, third and fourth quarters of the year. So ours was low. And our merch volume, as a result, was low year-over-year due to timing issues, and that will be -- that will work itself back to a normal promotional profile here as we go into the next 3 quarters.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","It's good to see volumes for your categories and for General Mills starting to, as you pointed out, sequentially improve as pricing has kind of moderated. I know there's a lot of discussion over the last couple of quarters about sort of the mystery around why volumes in general had been as weak as they were for the industry. And there were probably a lot of different reasons that were discussed. But the biggest one that most food companies talked about was just the pricing, right, and that combined with the difficult consumer backdrop. Based on what you're starting to see, at least in some of your key categories, I mean, it sounds like you're basically getting at that latter point, which is, it seems like it was primarily the pricing and as that moderates, the volume sort of starts to come back. Does that seem now with what you now see like the most realistic and sensible explanation for what we've seen these last couple of quarters for the industry?","Kendall J. Powell","So Andrew, I mean, I think as you know, that is our premise. And we talked about that quite a bit at our year-end meeting in July. And our view is that, okay, we're only a quarter in, but sort of based on the data we're seeing, our view is that's -- that is the data is confirming our premise on what happened and what the outlook is going forward. I mean, clearly, last year, with a very high inflation in the industry, over 10% for us and all the pricing, there's no doubt that, that was the biggest single factor and consumers responded as we predicted they would with lower unit volume sales. So I think we had a chart in our presentation this morning that demonstrated very clearly that as we begin to sequentially lap that period of time, we're seeing the price comparisons moderate and the unit volumes improve for our category. And we are seeing that as well in our business. Now it's not -- this is not a perfect science, and I think it will -- but our belief, our strong belief is that we're going to continue to see that sort of stabilization in consumer prices and recovery of demand as we progress throughout the year.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I appreciate that color. And then just a quick follow-up. Don, I apologize if I didn't get this right. Did you mention at the outset that for overall corporate General Mills, that organic sales were up 1% in the quarter? And if I got that wrong, I apologize.","Donal Leo Mulligan","Yes. For overall, 1% on a constant currency basis, minus 1% as reported. So we had a larger than usual drag from ForEx this quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I want to go back to the full year guidance of mid-single-digit sales growth. Thanks for the color on kind of what that encompasses. I was thinking about that your base biz comment is suggesting purely organic and it's -- correct me if I'm wrong, but that does include the M&A contribution in the first quarter from Yoplait International?","Donal Leo Mulligan","Correct.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So if I were to strip that out and just think about sort of organic for the full year, can you give us any color on what you expect organic to be for the full year?","Donal Leo Mulligan","Well, I don't have a size [ph] for you that Yoplait International is about $1.2 billion in sales. And we had another couple of months of it this year versus last year.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And if I calculate it right, kind of based on International, it looks like it's going to add around 1.5 points to the full year. So kind of thinking organically, if I can think about mid-single digits is 4 to 6, take out 1.5, I'm kind of now that 2.5 to 4.5 type range. Am I way off base with that line of thinking?","Donal Leo Mulligan","Well, I don't have my calculator for me to check your math. But it is obviously going to be a contributor. I couldn't confirm the 1.5 points, though, for it.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So on drivers of that, kind of getting back to Alexia's question and building on Andrew's there, you had about 1 point in the first quarter. I think Ken mentioned that he's expecting the pricing to be, I think, a lot more stable, which I'm interpreting to be kind of flattish as we progress through the year. That's quite a bit of volume acceleration. Where are you expecting to get that volume acceleration? And what gives you the confidence that it's going to come through?","Kendall J. Powell","Well, I think, Jason, as we continue to see these consumer prices moderate, we do expect our volume to improve continuously over the course of the year. So we are expecting that broadly across the portfolio. We have a number of new products that we're going to be launching, as you know, and the early returns on those is that they're going to be good contributors. So we are expecting our volume in sales trends to improve somewhat in U.S. Retail over the course of the year, and we're very much expecting that to happen.","Donal Leo Mulligan","The other thing I would add, Jason, is that as we talked in the first quarter, we saw a 2% volume growth in Brands on the Go -- or Bakeries & Foodservice, excuse me, offset by some index pricing that will unfold differently. As the year unfolds, that will be additive to sales, but the volume, we feel good about. International has consistently driven low single digit volume growth, did it again in the first quarter, as we said, 8% constant currency growth. And while we focus on pricing in the U.S., I thought we've said back [ph], we still get pricing in international markets, again, more in developed markets than -- in the developing than the developed markets, but we're getting pricing in, so there will be some huge [ph] benefit in international from pricing that we'll see as the year unfolds. So really, what we're talking about is turning our U.S., our old business, from what was negative 4% and 5% growth last year for volume up to flat and slightly positive as the year unfolds.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","One last just housekeeping question. The interest expense was a little bit lighter than I thought this quarter and that's just probably a mathematical error on my part. But it sounds like the balance sheet moved around a little bit post the end of this quarter. Can you update us on your expectation for interest expense for the full year?","Donal Leo Mulligan","Yes. We expect interest expense to be up low single digits, inclusive of, obviously, the acquisition of Yoki. Obviously, we're getting a little benefit from the lower short term rates. And I think that probably everybody is, because we're going to stay low for a while. And you might have seen a touch to that come through in the first quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman of Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. A couple of questions, I guess following up on the Alexia, Andrew, Jason theme. Isn't the fact that the promotion was more aggressive in the first quarter one of the reasons why the core sales were a bit lower and you kind of expect that to moderate and that's what's also going to be a contributor to sales?","Kendall J. Powell","Eric, maybe you clarify a little bit. When you say promotion was more aggressive, I mean, are you talking about category promotion or competitive or how -- what -- I'm not...","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","No, I thought you said, Ken, that you had -- you'd cut back on advertising, which is an SG&A item, but you promoted more aggressively, which limited your net pricing contribution in the fiscal first quarter, right?","Kendall J. Powell","Yes.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, so...","Kendall J. Powell","Well, I mean, what I would say is -- actually, in Yogurt, for instance, we promoted more aggressively in the first quarter. We saw that -- we saw sequential improvement in core movement over the course of the quarter, and we think that those core brands will continue to improve as we get uptake on that activity, and then we'll add new products to that. And we think that, that combination will lead to continued improvement in our yogurt business. In our cereal business, for instance, our merch -- as I said, our merchandising activity was light compared to year ago, and that led to merch volume declines. And so we'll see a more normal level of merchandising in cereal as we go over the -- into the second and third quarters, and that will, we believe, result in strengthening volume in that business. So it's really, Eric, in the first quarter, there were a number of moving parts on that -- on the merchandising front. As we move into the second quarter, we expect solid levels of merchandising, good levels of new products, and that, in combination, is going to lead to stronger unit volume.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Second question. Now that we have all outlet data, theoretically, that's supposed to be a bit better kind of indication on consumption, and yet the -- for, like, U.S. Retail, the IRI Nielsen data actually showed some pretty significant weakness in your business. I got a bunch of calls from investors worried about your results for the quarter based on that. And yet your volume was only down a little bit, a couple of points, much better than I think the IRI Nielsen data showed. What is the difference? Maybe this gets back to Bryan's question initially.","Kendall J. Powell","Yes. Well, I think some of it is just the timing of shipments of new products, and so some pipeline building in the latter few weeks of the quarter. And some of it, I think, Eric, is merchandising pressure across some of our categories in the first quarter, which was not where we wanted it to be. And so we saw a weaker incremental volume for merchandising in those categories. And we expect that to -- we expect that balance to be restored as we move into the second and third quarter.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then last question, Don. On Yoki, you had -- so now you've acquired the business, can you give us maybe a little bit more color on the kind of the mix impact from that? When Yoplait was brought in, the mix shift in International segment was a massive negative. How does Yoki impact the segment's mix? And also, is there any adjustment to assumed goodwill and the P&L effect of that with it coming through?","Donal Leo Mulligan","Yes. We'll obviously give more color when we close Q2, when we have a quarter results in our books. But let me give you a little bit of flavor now. As we talked before, Yoki is about $0.5 billion business. It will be in our results for 3 quarters of the year. It does drive a low double-digit operating margin. Now that is on a, if you will, on an operating basis, we will have some depreciation, a step-up -- inventory step-up, some transaction costs this year, some intangible -- a small bit of intangible amortization as well that will be a drag on the results, non-cash drag, but a drag on the reported results. So -- and that, combined with, obviously, the acquisition costs, is what leads to the EPS dilution expectation of $0.02 to $0.03. But from an operating standpoint, you can think about it as a $500 million business that drives low double-digit cash margins for us. As far as kind of within the P&L, as you can imagine, it's the emerging market business, it's delivered margin -- gross margin, excuse me, is lower than our company average, and so you will see some dilution again. We'll give more quantification to that when we release Q2.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And is it -- it's products, I assume. Are they a negative mix driver again in the segment just like Yoplait was?","Donal Leo Mulligan","Negative mix in what respect?","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","In that, I guess, like if you've had, I don't know, a 20% negative mix swing as you've reported international, including Yoplait International?","Donal Leo Mulligan","Of price...","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Price mix.","Donal Leo Mulligan","It's a good question. I don't have an answer off the top on that one. Maybe we'll just follow-up on that one.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","We're seeing, at least anecdotally on shelf, some of your larger competitors in Greek discounting somewhat heavily right now. First of all, is that putting some more pressure on you if you're seeing the same thing? And second, are you doing anything maybe to counter that? I realize you're putting in a lot of new products and so forth. But doesn't that put a little bit more pressure on yours, maybe not -- that not right the really way to look at it, given that you have so many new products on the shelf, and maybe it's -- that'll -- you'll disrupt the category a little bit. I'm just curious how you think about pricing in Greek right now and what's happening?","Kendall J. Powell","So Ken, I think that our expectation for the Greek segment as it really becomes mainstream and there's capacity and scale -- and everybody, we're all kind of focusing on productivity and all the stuff that we do really well. I mean, our expectation is that those prices will come down over time. And I think that we're seeing that. I think that's sort of natural, in a way, almost inevitable. Having said that, we love those typically over $1.00 price points on average for Greek. They look really good to us, especially compared to many other yogurt prices, which are kind of $0.50, $0.60, $0.70. So we like the price point. And we think that now being deeply into it, with multiple product offerings and more to come, we think that's going to be a good business model for us. And whether it's $0.99 or $1.09 or whatever it is, we think we can do just fine with that.","Kenneth Goldman - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then one more. You dropped advertising and media spending by 7% this year and that was on top of, I think, a 7% increase a year ago. So just using some simple math for a second, your dollar ad spending is essentially flat over the last 2 years, but your sales dollars are up 15% over that same time. I realize it's just one quarter, and you're taking ad spending up again shortly. But still, that's a quarter of the year where you deemphasized ad spending pretty heavily. So is that something maybe we should expect more of going forward? Were you a little more strategic from quarter to quarter in whether you're putting money into deals versus consumer marketing? Or is this sort of a one-off or maybe it just happened to be with the timing of where the new products were?","Kendall J. Powell","Well, there are a lot of moving parts in that question. But look, so let me -- let -- well, but let me -- it's a good question, and I understand the intent behind it. But let me sort of -- let me make a first comment. The sales increases over the last couple of years are largely driven by that kind of inflation-driven pricing. So I just think that it's important to keep that in mind. But stepping back a bit, I think the larger context for us on advertising is that we've increased our levels very, very significantly over the last several years. I think we're up close to 50%. I think some of the tracking services have us now as the largest advertiser in the industry. And we have very, very solid shares of voice in the vast majority of our categories. In many cases, they're increasing. So we're very committed to advertising. It drives our business. But I think, as we've said several times over the last year, I mean, we're -- our goal at these levels is to kind of in line with sales or to be roughly at this level. And you're right. As we enter a period where there's -- the merchandising environment is very dynamic, as we saw in the first quarter this year, we do want to make sure that we're paying very close attention to what we need to do to be in the right value zone in terms of price points and merchandising. I think it's really important for us to do that given the mindset of the consumer these days. So we are going to be making tactical trade-offs there. But I will tell you, having said that, our advertising is and will be at very, very high levels and at very competitive, very strong share of voice. But we want to keep that value component. We want to be focused on that as well and make sure that our products are in the right zone.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Wanted to see if your thought process was still consistent around that increase in the quarter and whether you're planning to term a portion of that out to -- by coming to the markets? And sort of what that percentage of the 1-1 increase could be.","Donal Leo Mulligan","We did see, obviously, a market increase in our commercial paper balance over the term, given that we were prepping for the Yoki acquisition. We do expect to determine out, whether it will be later this calendar year, early next calendar, it's still to be determined. But either way, we are -- we will be in the market sometime during this fiscal year to a fairly sizable amount.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Should we assume that the bulk of that gets termed out? Or should we still anticipate some of it gets paid down over the course of this year?","Donal Leo Mulligan","It'll get paid down. It's not only going to be termed down. We will absolutely pay down the debt, a portion of the debt. Again, as we said when we announced Yoki, our plan as we did with Yoplait as we will with Yoki is that we're going to finance this at our normal capital structure mix, which is a combination of cash and debt. And so you'll see the debt being paid down over the course of the year.","Priya Ohri-Gupta - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just lastly, as you think about the M&A environment just broadly, can you speak to what sorts of assets are available at this point in time, and sort of has that number decreased and how are valuations looking?","Donal Leo Mulligan","We considered to be very active in looking. We've obviously done some pretty sizable, and even one not sizable, strategic deals, in terms of our businesses that are at Yoplait, Yoki, which got us a good position in the category and in a certain critical geography. And then with Food Should Taste Good in the U.S., which put us in a very different position in a category and particularly around a channel and a consumer need. So we like what we've done to date. They all helped grow our business in key platforms and certainly help accelerate our business, our growth as well. So we'll continue to look, as we've talked before. Emerging markets is a focus for us. We have a great organically growing business in China. We now have an equally sizable business in Brazil with a similar growth profile. But there are other emerging markets where we have small footprints, India for example, that we'd look to -- will be looking to increase our size. And then in the U.S. and more broadly developed markets, Jon outlined a compelling case for Better-for-you snacking and that's an area that's of intense interest to us and is where we've added some businesses over the last couple of years, and we'll continue to look in that area.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Don, I think you mentioned more pressure coming from the drought on your cost side in the back half of the year. Can I understand, like -- your talk about the cost, I guess, of the 2012 calendar year crop. Does that cost of the crop being higher flow through into your fiscal '14 as well, because you kind of have to wait for next year's crop before you can get kind of a lower cost of grain? And maybe I'm overstating the impact because I know your Grain is only 5% to 10% of your cost. I'm just trying to figure out if the drought will flow through into fiscal '14.","Kendall J. Powell","It's a good question, Robert, and I'll give you some thoughts, and I think Don wants to jump in as well. And I think the short answer now is, it's something that we have to be thinking about, because we will -- with the drought, in grains like, clearly, corn, we'll exit the year with very low stocks, and so very low stocks which signal that even more volatility than usual in the corn crop depending on how it starts to develop. But it's too early to say. I mean, we kind of have to see how things go around the world and just how the harvest begins to build develop as we go into F '14. But we will be -- we'll have to watch that very, very closely. Don, I don't know if you would add anything to that.","Donal Leo Mulligan","I would just -- as I mentioned, we had 75% coverage this year, so to the extent we have an impact, as I mentioned, it will be as the year unfolds in the back part of the year, which is putting a little bit of pressure on that part of the year but within the range that we anticipated. And obviously, we're not going to give F '14 guidance, but I think that Ken touched on a couple of the dynamics that we contemplate. The only thing I want to jump in is Rob, thank you for remembering it's 5% to 10% of our inputs. That's usually something I have to remind the market of.","Robert Moskow - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Let me ask a quick follow-up, if I could. Meals are up, I think, only 2%, but Progresso was up much more than that. Can you talk about what's down in meals and when do you think you'll lap those comparisons?","Kendall J. Powell","So soup, as you said, we had a very strong start to the year in soup. I mean, we've got a good proposition there with very good innovation and very good marketing, and so we have good momentum there. Mexican food is progressing, is doing okay. Our issue is skillet meals, helpers, which are down right now. And we think we know what we have to do to correct what's happening in that business. And that's an issue of the right value for the consumer and the right marketing message. And we don't think we're all the way too bright, frankly, on either one of those things right now. But we think we know what we have to do to stabilize and restore momentum on that business and, obviously, that's something that we're going to be focusing on here as we move into the balance of the year.","Kristen Smith Wenker","We are up to time at this point, so I think I'll just say, those of you who are in queue, I'm sorry we didn't get to you. If I can be of help, please give me a call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call for today.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded, Wednesday, December 19, 2018.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Jeff Siemon, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Jeff Siemon","Thanks, Jenifer, and good morning to everybody. I am joined here this morning by Jeff Harmening, our Chairman and CEO; and Don Mulligan, our CFO. In addition, Jon Nudi, who leads North America Retail segment, is joining us for the Q&A portion of the call. And I'll turn the call over to them in a moment, but before I do, I'll cover a few housekeeping items.","Our press release on second quarter results was issued over the wire services earlier this morning, and you can find the release and a copy of our slides that supplement our remarks this morning on the Investor Relations website.","Please note that our remarks this morning will include forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions and the second slide in today's presentation was factors that could cause our future results to be different than our current estimates.","And with that, I'll turn you over to my colleagues, beginning with Jeff.","Jeff Harmening","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning to everyone. I'll start this morning by offering some quick thoughts on our year-to-date performance. I'm pleased to say that our results through six months keep us on track to deliver our full year targets. Our cost and capital discipline drove profit growth ahead of our expectations in the first half of our fiscal year.","Our job to do for the second half is very clear, and that is to accelerate our sales growth in our North America Retail and Pet segments, while we maintain our cost discipline, and we're confident in the plans we have to do just that.","Now I'll turn it over to Don Mulligan to walk through our financial performance in the quarter. Then I'll come back to provide an update on our fiscal 2019 priorities and share a few highlights on our second half plans.","Don Mulligan ","Thanks, Jeff and good morning, everyone. Let's jump right into our second quarter financial results on slide five. Net sales of $4.4 billion increased 7% in constant currency, including contributions from the Blue Buffalo acquisition. Organic net sales declined 1%.","Strong cost discipline and positive net price realization and mix helped drive margin expansion, resulting in adjusted operating profit of $765 million, up 8% in constant currency. And adjusted diluted EPS of $0.85 increased 2% in constant currency, driven by higher adjusted operating profit and a lower effective tax rate, partially offset by higher net interest expense and higher average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter.","Slide six shows the components of net sales growth in the quarter. Organic net sales were down 1%, driven by lower contributions from pound volume, partially offset by positive net price realization and mix across all segments. Foreign currency translation resulted in a 2 point headwind to net sales and Blue Buffalo added 8 points to net sales.","Turning to our segment results on slide seven, North America Retail net sales were down 3% as reported and on an organic basis. Consumer takeaway was stronger with U.S. Nielsen-measured retail sales down 1% and share gains in the majority of our top U.S. categories. Through six months, our shipments have lagged consumer takeaway by about 1 point, with organic net sales down 2% and U.S. retail sales down 1%. The main drivers of that difference with a comparison against last year's results that included co-packing sales related to the Green Giant divestiture, changes in customer inventory levels and minor differences in the phasing of trade between the first and second half.","Looking ahead to the rest of the year, we expect our shipments to track more closely to consumer takeaway. Looking at operating profit performance reported net sales in U.S. meals and baking were down 2% due to declines on Progresso soup and Betty Crocker desserts and the elimination of Green Giant co-packing sales. These declines were partially offset by strong performance on Totino's hot snacks, Old El Paso and renovation news on Annie's Mac and Cheese. ","Canada net sales were down 7% as reported and 3% in constant currency. U.S. yogurt net sales decreased 4% as declines on Greek and Light segments were partially offset by growth on WeBuy Yoplait and YQ as well as improved performance on Go-Gurt and original style Yoplait. ","U.S. snacks net sales were down 4%, driven primarily by lower than expected merchandising levels on grain bars, partially offset by good performance on Annie\u2019s fruit snacks, Larabar and EPIC.","Net sales for U.S. Cereal were down 5% due to lower merchandising levels and the comparison against 7% growth in the same period last year, partially offset by growth on tricks and Lucky Charms. Constant currency segment operating profit matched a year-ago levels, as cost of goods HMM savings, positive net price realization and mix and lower SG&A expenses, offset lower volume and input cost inflation.","In Convenience Stores and Foodservice, second quarter organic net sales were flat versus prior year. Our Focus 6 platforms generated 2% net sales growth led by strong performance on cinnamon rolls in restaurants, couch breakfasts and bull pack cereals in K-12 schools and Chex mix salty snacks in Convenience Stores, offset by declines on bakery flour at other non-Focus 6 platforms. Segment operating profit increased 3% in the quarter, driven by positive price mix and COGS HMM savings, partially offset by higher input costs. ","Second quarter organic net sales for Europe and Australia segment matched a year ago levels, driven by growth on snack bars, ice cream and Mexican, three of our accelerate platforms, offset by declines in yogurt. Second quarter net sales were also impacted by the challenging retail environment in France. We drove double-digit retail sales growth on Nature Valley and Fiber One snack bars by continuing to secure distribution gains, invest in effective marketing and bring successful innovation to market.","At Haagen-Dazs retail sales also grew double-digits, as we continue to expand distribution with stick bar, mini cup and pint innovations, and as we execute local brand activations to drive trial. And we're encouraged by our improved performance at Old El Paso, driven by new products such as our gluten free tortilla kits as well as effective omni-channel consumer support. ","Segment operating profit in Europe and Australia was $22 million compared to $27 million a year ago. Driven by higher input costs, specifically significant dairy inflation and currency driven inflation on products imported to the UK, partially offset by positive sales mix and lower SG&A. ","In our Asia and Latin America segment, organic net sales increased 5% in the second quarter, with strong growth on our global accelerate platforms and on Wanchai Ferry in China. We drove strong double-digit growth on snacks in India and the Middle East as we continue to expand distribution on Pillsbury cookie cakes and Betty Crocker [indiscernible]. And our Nature Valley and Yoki brands performed well in Latin America behind effective consumer news and successful in-store executions.","Haagen-Dazs continues to grow across Asia behind consumer activations and new channel development including significant growth in e-commerce and distribution expansion in new Haagen-Dazs shops. In China our Wanchai Ferry business delivered another quarter of growth, driven by dumpling innovation and strong in-store executions. Segment operating profit of $18 million was down 6% in constant currency, driven primarily by higher input costs and higher SG&A expenses, partially offset by positive price mix.","For our Pet segment, second quarter net sales were down 7% on a pro forma basis, reflecting the comparison to 25% pro forma growth in last year's second quarter, when Blue first expanded into the Food, Drug and Mass or FDM channels. Blue\u2019s consumer pull remains strong with year-to-date retail sales up 9% in line with Blue\u2019s two year compound growth rate for pro forma net sales. Segment operating profit of $71 million was $18 million below the prior year on a pro forma basis, driven by lower volume, significant input cost inflation, plant startup costs and intangible amortization, partially offset by cost savings and benefits from positive price mix.","In a moment, Jeff will outline our second half expansion plans for Blue Buffalo, which will drive Blue to our full year target of double-digit top and bottom line growth.","Slide 12 covers our margin results in the second quarter. Adjusted gross margin increased 10 basis points and adjusted operating profit margin was up 40 basis points over the prior year. Margin expansion was driven by increased HMM savings, benefits from positive net price realization and mix, the addition of Blue Buffalo and tight control of our cost, partially offset by higher input costs.","Slide 13 summarizes our joint venture results in the quarter. Cereal partners\u2019 worldwide net sales increased 2% in constant currency due to strong performance in our Asia, Middle East and Africa as well as Europe regions, partially offset by declines in Latin America. Haagen-Dazs Japan sales were up 1% in constant currency, driven primarily by growth on core mini cups and multi-pack offerings. Combined after tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $22 million in the quarter compared to $24 million a year ago, driven by higher input costs.","Slide 14 summarizes our other noteworthy income statement items. Restructuring, impairment and other exit costs totaled $209 million, including $193 million of impairment charges related to the Progresso, Food-to-Taste Good and Mountain High brand intangible assets. Corporate unallocated expenses excluding certain items affecting comparability increased by $13 million in the quarter. Net interest expense increased to $58 million, driven primarily by financing related to the Blue Buffalo acquisition. We continue to expect net interest expense to total approximately $550 million for the full year.","Adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.8% compared to 29.3% a year ago, driven by net benefits related to U.S. Tax Reform. We continue to expect our full year adjusted ETR will be in the range between 23% and 24% and average diluted shares outstanding were up 4% in the quarter.","Slide 15 provides our first half balance sheet and cash flow highlights. As of the second quarter our core working capital stands at $532 million, down 5% compared to the same period last year as benefits from our terms extension program were partially offset by the addition of Blue Buffalo to our balance sheet operating.","First half operating cash flow totaled $1.4 billion compared to $1.6 billion in the prior year, primarily reflecting less benefit from changes in accounts payable. Year-to-date capital investments totaled $254 million. For the full year, we now expect capital investments to be approximately 3.5% of net sales. We converted 120% of adjusted after-tax earnings into free cash flow through six months and we returned $589 million to shareholders through dividends in the first half of fiscal 2019.","I'll close my portion of our remarks by summarizing our year-to-date financial results and reaffirming our full year targets on sales, profit, EPS and cash flow as shown on slide 16. First half net sales increased 8% in constant currency. We expect net sales to accelerate to 9% to 10% constant currency growth for the full year, driven primarily by acceleration of Blue Buffalo. Organic net sales essentially matched a year ago levels through six months.","Our full year expectations of organic growth remain between flat and up 1%. Year-to-date adjusted operating profit increased 5% in constant currency. These results include a 4 point headwind from the onetime purchase accounting adjustment related to the Blue Buffalo acquisition. We continue to estimate cost of currency adjusted operating profit will increased 6% to 9% percent in fiscal 2019, including a 2 point full year headwind from the purchase accounting adjustment.","First half diluted EPS was up 1% on a constant currency basis, despite a 5 point headwind from the onetime purchase accounting adjustment. These results were ahead of our full year guidance for constant currency adjusted diluted EPS, which is to range between flat and down 3%, including a 2 point full year headwind from the purchase accounting adjustment. We now expect currency translation will be a 1 to 2 point headwind to full year net sales, but won't have a material impact on operating profit or EPS. And as I mentioned, our first half free cash flow conversion was 120% ahead of our full year target of 95% or better.","With that, let me turn it back over to Jeff to provide an update on our fiscal 2019 priorities and outline our key deliverables for the back half of the year. Jeff?","Jeff Harmening ","Thanks, Don. And on slide 18, you can see the three key priorities we laid out at the beginning of our fiscal year, grow the core, successfully transition Blue Buffalo, and deliver our financial commitments. Let me share our progress on each of these priorities through the first half of our year. At our Investor Day in July, we outlined five keys to growing the core. And I'm pleased to say that through six months we've improved in each of these five areas relative to fiscal 2018.","We returned to market share growth and U.S. Yogurt, year-to-date organic net sales in our emerging markets were up high single-digits. We were seeing good results from our first half innovation and our U.S. distribution trends have improved and we grew our share of distribution in the second quarter. And we're seeing a step up and contributions from organic price and mix, from 1 point in fiscal to 2 points through the first half of 2019. Through the first half of this year price mix has contributed to net sales growth across each of our reporting segments.","In North America Retail, price mix contributed 2 points of sales growth, which is in line with the results we're seeing in the broader industry. In fact, 8 of the top 10 U.S. Food and Beverage manufacturers have generated positive price mix so far this year, including General Mills.","We anticipate the strategic revenue measurement actions we implemented in the first half will continue to benefit our results as we move to the second half. We're competing well across most categories this year as measured by our market share performance. ","On slide 20, you can see that we grew share in six of our nine largest U.S. categories in the first half. However, we know there's still work to do, including in cereal and snack bars our top two categories. We have plans in place to improve our performance on these businesses in the back half of the year. With this as a backdrop, let me share some specific examples of our year-to-date performance against our grow the core priority for our key platforms around the world.","Our first half results in cereal were mixed across channels and geographies. In U.S. Retail positive contributions from strong innovation, including Cheerios Oat Crunch, Maple Cheerios and Lucky Charms Frosted Flakes were outweighed by reduced merchandising activities.","Second quarter cereal merchandise volume was down 7% as we focused on implementing pricing and pack changes at the shelf early in the quarter. With those changes behind us, we were able to get back to more typical merchandising levels by the end of the quarter, helping drive November cereal retail sales in line with last year. And we're confident we can improve on our first half cereal performance as we rebalance our merchandising levels in the second half.","In Convenience Stores and Food Service, we continue to drive low single-digit cereal net sales growth led by good performance on our K-12 schools and colleges and universities. I'm happy to report that our U.S. Yogurt business is growing share for the second consecutive quarter, driven by excellent performance on WeBuy Yoplait and on Go-Gurt. We continue to impress with retail sales up double-digits through the first half led by core SKUs and innovation such as Oui Petite. In fact, WeBuy Yoplait has grown to a two share making it our third largest business within the yogurt category behind Original Style Yogurt and Go-Gurt and helping us to build a leadership position in the fast growing simply better yogurt segment.","On Go-Gurt great equity flavor additions like Sour Patch Kids drove 3% retail sales growth so far this year. It's also worth noting that our Original Style Yogurt business stabilized in the first half of the year behind more real fruit product news and solid in-store execution.","Outside of our core global platforms, we like the way we are competing a number of regional businesses this year. In the U.S., our Pillsbury refrigerated baked goods are off to a strong start as we enter key baking season, with retail sales up 2% year-to-date, and 3% in the latest quarter fueled by our made at home media campaign, strong innovation and in-store display. ","Totino's hot snacks grew retail sales 6% driven by solid marketing and our expansion of value size offerings. And we continue to generate excellent growth on Wanchai Ferry in China, with retail sales up high-single-digit through the first half of the year. New flavors in the dumpling line, such as cucumber have created excitement on the core business. And our superior taste campaign continues to resonate with consumers. ","The second component of growing the core in fiscal 2019 is increasing growth on our 4 global accelerated platforms. Global retail sales for Old El Paso were up 2% in the first half led by the U.S. where retail sales were up 6% today and 7% in the most recent quarter, driven by distribution gains and consumer investment. Our innovation hint-of-lime stand and stub Taco Shells continues to drive variety for taco night for consumers. And we're bringing back our highly successful in-store Old El Paso taco stand displays in the second half of the fiscal year.","Our natural and organic brands are incredibly relevant with consumers today, while our aggregate retail sales are being slowed by the exit of some unsuccessful category expansion volume. We're seeing excellent results as we increase our focus and support behind our core products. We love the results on Annie\u2019s Mac and Cheese, we renovated our classic SKUs and increased our support behind the business, resulting in double-digit gains in distribution and in retail sales. Annie's is now the number one box Mac and Cheese in a number of accounts including Whole Foods and Target.","We're driving solid performance on Annie\u2019s fruit snacks and pancake mixes as well. And we see more opportunities to grow our core natural and organic products. For example, we recently updated our packaging on Muir Glen product line, which celebrates the brand's star ingredient the tomato and gives a nod to Muir Glen\u2019s California heritage.","Global snack bar growth took a step back in the second quarter, with year-to-date retail sales down 1%. We're seeing two different stories between our international and North American bars businesses. International bars growth continues at strong double-digit sales rates. Europe and Australia is driving retail sales growth with strong in-store execution and distribution gains on Nature Valley protein and Fiber One Brownie. Contributions from innovation remain strong behind nut butter biscuit line extensions and Fiber One popcorn.","In our Asia and Latin America segment, the investments we have made in India in distribution expansion, innovation and consumer engagement are paying off for us. We're building on the success of Pillsbury branded cookies and pastry cakes by expanding into new flavors and formats.","In the U.S. our bars results have underperformed our expectations through the first half of the year. Nature Valley performance weakened in the second quarter, driven by lower merchandising support and customer inventory reductions. We have plans in place to increase merchandising frequency in the second half. Our Fiber One bar performance in the U.S. has remain challenged. We expect continued declines in the near-term as we cycle through distribution losses. Looking further ahead, we see an opportunity to renovate the Fiber One product line and make it more relevant and we'll share more as those plants get closer to completion.","On the positive side in bars Larabar retail sales continue to grow double-digits in the first half, behind expanded distribution, innovation and brand support. Protein One, while small is showing early signs of success and you'll see a new Protein One social media campaign launch in January featuring celebrity Mindy Kaling. And retail sales of Epic for Epic are growing double-digits driven by the core meat bar skews and snacks as well as the new Epic Performance bar we launched this summer.","On Haagen-Dazs, our final accelerated platform first half retail sales were up 13%, led by double-digit growth in Europe, behind mini cup expansion in the UK and peanut butter innovation in both pines and sticks. Retail sales in Asia grew low-single-digits due to continued success on innovation and strong consumer activations. We delivered broad based market share growth across our Asia Haagen-Dazs countries.","As we shift our focus to the second half, we're looking to improve our top-line trends in a few different and specific areas most notably in U.S. Cereal and Snacks. Our second half plans call for stronger merchandising support on these businesses with a focus on greater frequency as opposed to depth of promotion. We have a really good slate of second half consumer news, events and partnerships with equities like Pok\u00e9mon and Adventures and we like our back half innovation lineup including Cinnamon Toast Crunch churros, Fruity Lucky Charms and Nature Valley snacks mix.","And we've addressed some capacity issues, which constrain growth on both cereal and snacks in the first half. In total, these initiatives will set us up to deliver improved growth on our U.S. Cereal and Snacks businesses in the second half.","Now let's move to our second priority this year, successfully transitioning Blue Buffalo into the General Mills family. We feel good about the progress we're making here and we continue to see tremendous long-term growth for the Blue brand. Still I'm sure many of you have questions about Blue\u2019s sales performance this quarter. As we said in the first quarter call, we expect the timing of channel expansion will continue to drive significant variability in our quarterly net sales results.","In the first half, our net sales results lagged consumer takeaway. We'll see this reverse in the second half, specifically in the fourth quarter when we take another big step in our food, drug and mass expansion. Amid this variability we think the right measure to track is Blue's in-market performance. And I can confidently say that on this measure Blue continues to succeed. First half retail sales were up 9% and market share was up 40 basis points across all channels.","Blue's expanded availability is helping reach more pet parents with household penetration up 26% this calendar year-to-date. Blue is the fastest growing pet brand in Food, Drug and Mass and has become the number one branded dog food in a few leading Food, Drug and Mass retailers. And Blue remains the number one brand in Pet Specialty and the number one pet food brand online.","On slide 28 you can see how Blue\u2019s 9% retail sales growth breaks down by channel. While we haven't added any new significant Food, Drug and Mass accounts in recent months, we're still seeing strong performance in the accounts that have carried Blue for more than a year, with progressive share gains each quarter. ","Blue retail sales across all Food, Drug and Mass channels increased by triple digits versus last year's first half. Blue continues to see double-digit retail sales declines in the Pet Specialty channel in line with our expectations. We will keep engaging with this important channel and bringing product variety, unique innovation and consumer education that helps ensure Pet Specialty remains special.","And Blue continues to grow and gain share in the important e-commerce channel which makes up roughly 25% of Blue's net sales. First half retail sales in e-commerce grew 30% and we expect continued strong growth as we move into the second half of the year. Our second half plan for Blue Buffalo will strengthen both top and bottom-line growth for the business. On the top-line, we will launch Blue into new Food, Drug and Mass customers in the back half that will double our ACV distribution by the end of the fiscal year. ","In addition, we'll expand the variety of Blue product offerings available in the Food, Drug and Mass channels, which will accelerate growth even further. These actions will begin in February which falls in Blue's fourth quarter. We expect Blue Buffalo\u2019s third quarter net sales results will improve over Q2 though they will likely continue to lag our retail sales trends. ","In addition to top line acceleration we also have significant actions underway that will improve our profit margins in the back half. For example, we expect to deliver increased HMM savings including benefits from a new distribution center that opened last month. We'll see our synergy savings ramp up, we\u2019ll benefit from strategic revenue management actions we've implemented recently and we'll see a more profitable mix of business with a greater proportion of Food, Drug and Mass sales in the higher margin wet and treats segments. ","These second half plans keep us on track to deliver double-digit top and bottom-line growth for Blue Buffalo, as we outlined at the beginning of the year. ","Shifting gears to our third priority delivering on our financial commitments. You've heard a number of these themes throughout today's presentation. We're generating increased COGS HMM savings this year, including benefits from our global sourcing efforts. Our efforts on strategic revenue management are paying off driving price mix contributions ahead of last year and we're exhibiting strong discipline on our cost and capital resulting in second quarter margin expansion, lower capital spending and reductions in our core working capital balances. While we feel good about the progress we've made against our fiscal 2019 priorities, we know that there is still work to do to ensure that we deliver a successful year. ","Slide 31 summarizes the three most critical jobs to be done in the second half. First, we will improve our top-line performance in North America retail. I already mentioned the plans we have to strengthen U.S. Cereal and Snacks results, we will also see benefits from areas that I've been working so far this year, including strong innovation, increased price mix from strategic revenue management actions we implemented in the first half and continued improvement on U.S. distribution trends.","Second, we\u2019ll execute our Food, Drug and Mass expansion for Blue Buffalo, which will keep us on track to deliver double-digit net sales and operating profit growth for the business, excluding acquisition related charges ","And third, we will continue to maintain our strong cost and cash discipline driving increased benefits from HMM, continuing our spending discipline in SG&A and capital expenditures and realizing further improvements in core working capital.","I close by summarizing today's key messages. Our first half results keep us on track to deliver all of our full year targets. Good cost control drove first half profit results ahead of our expectations. We have clear plans for the second half to improve top line trends in North America Retail and to significantly expand Blue Buffalo availability, while maintaining our cost and capital discipline.","With that, let's open the lineup for questions. Operator, can you please give us the first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. ","Ken Goldman","Hi, good morning everyone. Thank you. ","Jeff Harmening ","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Goldman","If I could ask one on Blue Buffalo and then one on costs, when Buff first went into the FDM channel, it was obviously some blowback from legacy customers as expected. Now you're adding some more varieties into FDM, could you talk a little bit about what that means? Are you adding wilderness? Can you talk about what you're modeling in terms of additional maybe negative reactions from legacy customers as you do add these varieties? I want to get a little more sense of what actually the products are going and where those products are going?","Jeff Harmening ","Okay. And thanks for the question, Ken. I'll give you some level of specificity, but maybe not all the way to what you see. What I would say is that in terms of varieties, we do plan a significant expansion of varieties. And one of the things I'm most pleased with is that given the success we've had in Food, Drug and Mass so far, we'll see a lot of variety expansion and it will be highly incremental to what we currently have. And I think that strength -- that speaks to the strength of the Blue Buffalo brand in FDM and the success we've had in rolling it out, not only in terms of distribution growth, but actually maintaining and even growing the sales in places where we have it. I think that's probably the most important takeaway.","In terms of Pet Specialty, I mean, we've declined double-digits, and look, where we're not happy with that long term trajectory. On the other hand it's what we modeled it would happen. And so it's kind of in line with our expectations. We're dedicated to the Pet Specialty channel for the long term. And what's interesting is that in some Pet Specialty customers that have continued to feature Blue and have distribution and go with our innovation and promotion plans their categories are actually doing better than those that haven't.","And so we think -- and which just not a surprise given that Blue Buffalo is two times the next largest brand in that channel. And so we think we haven't modeled our Pet Specialty business to increase for the rest of the year, but we're certainly hopeful over time that it can and we know what it will take, it will take really good innovation, it will take partnering with our accounts to keep the in-store experience what it always has been, which is one of the point I think of competitive advantage and good promotion plan.","And so, we haven't counted on our performance improving in Pet Specialty, but we're certainly dedicated to the channel and we're optimistic that we can actually turn that performance around over time.","Ken Goldman","Okay. Thank you for that. And then my follow-up is a few quarters ago, I think it's fair to say Mills ran into some bumps regarding cost visibility or especially on the transportation and logistics side. Can you walk us through a little bit which improvements you\u2019ve made toward improving this visibility? One of the things I hear from some people is that they sort of got burned that quarter a little bit in there they are just a little bit nervous about being confident in your cost visibility there.","And then along those lines, are you seeing any easing in your freight expenses ahead? Yeah we've seen spot transport rates peak and at least temporarily and oil prices are certainly down. So any color there would be helpful?","Don Mulligan","Sure Ken, this is Don. We did -- you're exactly right. We ran into above but we didn't have the visibility we needed. We made some changes from a systems and a process and a information flow standpoint internally to make sure that we are getting the sufficiently granular look at what the costs are. It also made sure that we are talking about what were the drivers not just what were the numbers what were the driver so we had a better sense of how they could evolve overtime what the range of potential outcomes were.","And that is -- the combination of those things has given us much greater visibility into our cost structure. And it's one of the reasons that it's allowed us to over perform on the bottom line. We came ahead of our plan in the first quarter, we essentially matched our plan in the second quarter. So exiting the first half slightly ahead of the bottom line. And I think all that -- all the work that we did on the systems and the process and the information flow has paid dividends to help support that.","As far as inflation, we're still expecting 5% across the company for the full year same as we guided. There obviously has been some movements up and down over the course of the year with tariffs and just harvest and so forth, but in total, we're still at 5%. And as far as logistics and are our freight costs in particular, we still see those being up double-digits, as we talked in some detail last year. We do annual contracts that are tied to our fiscal year and that contract this year reflected the higher in-market costs, which again we expect to see it throughout the balance of our fiscal.","Ken Goldman","Great. Thanks, Don.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. ","Jeff Harmening ","Hey, Chris. ","Chris Growe ","Hi good morning. I just had a couple questions for you, if I could. I did want to ask you had a number of factors that aided your gross margin performance in the quarter was better than I expected as well. I just was curious did pricing and I guess your overall SRM initiatives did those get to a point where they overcame cost inflation in the quarter that is your pricing mix and promo. And then I'm just curious what's the promotional spending kind of variation in the business, I'm thinking like the U.S. Cereal. How does that -- does that flatter the gross margin, but obviously it could hurt sales and will that kind of reverse in the second half of the year?","Don Mulligan","Well, yes. So year-to-date -- in the second quarter, we had operating margins of about 40 basis points ahead of last year gross margins were about 10 points ahead of last year. And there was really three key contributors, one obviously was the addition of Blue Buffalo which is the higher margin business both in the gross margin and the operating margin level. We talked about tight cost controls that was in the plans, it was in our administrative functions and that was a benefit to the operating profit, benefit to the gross margin.","And then HMM and price mix together more than offset our input cost inflation. And those three Blue Buffalo, the ongoing cost controls and HMM price versus inflation that contributed in equal measure to our over performance and our growth in operating margin in the second quarter. Obviously was offset -- there was some offset from lower volume and the deleverage that we saw there, but those were the three primary drivers of the improved performance, they were about in equal measure. And so we are seeing the benefits of our SRM activities come through.","Jeff Harmening ","And the second part of your question, Chris, I think is also important as we think about the second half of the year and price and mix and look we realized about 2% price mix in the first half and we'll think -- and importantly we realized it across all segments. So I think that's important. And we see continued benefits from price and mix in the second half of the year and I mean I suppose if you're listening and you hear us talking about needing to make sure our merchandising on cereals and snacks a little more competitive you might wonder, okay, does that mean we're going take a margin hit in the second half or can we generate pricing.","And the answer is look we're talking about two specific categories, the rest of our top [8] [ph] our pricing is in good shape. And for the rest of the company we feel like we've got good pricing plans in place. On top of that something you might not think about, but certainly we do is that on an enterprise level to the extent that we grow Blue Buffalo double-digits in the back half with we have a great line of sight to doing and we pick up our growth on cereal and snacks, there is a net price mix at the enterprise level even without taking pricing because the price per pound that we get from pet and from cereal and from snacks and as well as actually some of the other accelerate categories like Haagen-Dazs and Old El Paso they're better than the company average. And so as we look at the back half of the year we see an ability to continue to generate price and mix in the marketplace.","Chris Growe","Okay, thank you. That\u2019s helpful. And I just had one quick follow-up for you on cereal, you gave the consumption data by month and negative 3, negative 2 [in cereal] [ph] better throughout the quarter. Your cereal sales are down 5% obviously there was a bit of a gap there and I'm sure it's driven by the promotional cadence. Are inventories do they had to rebuild or they at the right level here from this point going forward?","Jon Nudi","Hey, Chris, its Jon. One of the things to keep in mind last year in Q2 cereal RNS was up 7%. So again we've got a tough comp there. Overall, we bought some inventory through the first half across U.S. Retail and cereal is a part of that and we expect as we move through the back half of the year that won't be as big of a headwind. So again we think the comps get better for us. Our merchandising will come back and we believe that we'll have a much stronger back half from a cereal standpoint.","Chris Growe","Okay, thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. ","Robert Moskow","Hi, thanks. I guess, I have two questions. One is on Blue Buffalo, sales in second quarter were lower sequentially than first and I guess that's the result of things getting a little weaker in the specialty channel. Is that a fair assessment? And then secondly, when you launch it in this big retailer and double the ACV, how comfortable are you that these are completely incremental sales like there must be Pet consumers who are going to shift their channel of shopping from one channel to the other. What's the algorithm on that in terms of incrementality that you've seen historically?","And then the last part about that incremental question I guess is you talked about wet and treats, is Blue really good at wet dog food, is it really good at pet treats? And, what's the durability of these types of extensions because those areas, I guess, aren't exactly what consumers are familiar with from the core Blue? Thanks.","Jeff Harmening","Hey Rob, this is Jeff and you asked a number of questions and let me make sure I hit, if I don't hit all of them, it\u2019s not because I have tried avoid I just forgot one. So let me try to hit them kind of sequentially. In terms of the second quarter the slowdown in reporting net sales, it actually isn\u2019t fair to say that it was a slowdown in Pet Specialty or Pet Specialty declines were pretty much the same year-over-year. It really is a matter of our comparison to a year ago and inventory builds.","And so the way I like to think of it in the second quarter of this year, we're comparing to 25% growth last year, we declined 7% this year. So over a couple year period that's about 9% compound annual growth. If you look at our takeaway in retail sales, it's about 9% compound annual growth. So it really the deceleration in RNS has nothing to do with takeaway and nothing to do with a decline -- further decline in Pet Specialty. It has everything to do with lumpiness of RNS as it relates to inventory build.","We will see that reverse completely, in fact we will see it reverse completely and then some, in the back half of the year specifically in the fourth quarter starting in February as we build inventory in ahead of our new distribution gains. In terms of incrementality, one of the reasons why I mentioned household penetration is because there are a lot of numbers I can throw out about incrementality and we've done a lot of studies. But -- and what we found is that our launch into Food, Drug and Mass has been highly incremental, for the Blue Buffalo brand.","But one of the measures is household penetration and one of the things that I'm most pleased with is our household penetration is up 26% as opposed to our retail sales being up 9%. And as we've launched into these other channels, it's really good to see our household penetration expand because that says that all of the gains are not coming out of our current business and not just trading out what we've done in the Pet Specialty or online, but the brand continue to grow continue to gain new consumers. We saw the same kind of phenomenon with Annie\u2019s, we've seen it with L\u00e4rabar, we've seen it with EPIC and when you can get household penetration increasing ahead of your consumption it actually pretends really good things.","Your last question is about wet and treats and right now Blue Buffalo under indexes on the wet and treats, I think is a huge opportunity for us. And for treats, I mean that's just pet food speak for snacking and we see snacking trends in human food and we see it in pet the same way and one of the things when we bought Blue Buffalo we were excited about was that the humanization of pet food. We see the same kind of trends that we do in human food and so we can -- we feel like we've got good visibility to where the consumer's minds are in.","And then we think that the treats business are going to continue to grow and we under index and we think it's a huge opportunity, we're pleased to see that it's growing. And the nice thing is as we grow that differentially, we'll see improve margins, because the margins on those businesses tend to be better.","Robert Moskow","Got it. All right. But, I guess, the question that I had about sequential is, is because I don't see a lot of seasonality in the business in pet food. Pet owners just keep feeding their dogs the same amount every time. So that's why I was looking at the sequential growth coming down. So is there any reason to believe that that's not the right way to look at it? Why would it seasonality matter?","Jeff Harmening ","Seasonality really doesn't matter much, you're right. Pets tend to eat about the same amount every day. And it really has to do -- I think the most important point Rob is to take away is this building of inventory and how it looks quarter-to-quarter. And that's why I get back to the retail consumption is being the main driver. Because I'm going to tell you, our fourth quarter is going to be really high and it's going to look really good for Blue Buffalo and it will be good. But we have to keep -- but the key is really making sure, we have the underlying consumption in mind.","Jeff Siemon","Rob, this is Jeff Siemon. I\u2019ve mentioned Q1 of a year ago for Blue Buffalo net sales grew in the low-teens, maybe close to 15%, Q2, it moved up to 25%. So that's why you see this year deceleration is really the acceleration you saw last year in the comp, driven by the Food, Drug and Mass launch. Q3 last year was about 15% growth in net sales and Q4 was only up low-single-digits. So again, you saw a lot of variability last year. As we comp that this year that will have variability and then as Jeff said, our Q4 as we expand Food, Drug and Mass, you'll see a big acceleration.","Robert Moskow","Okay, thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. ","Jason English","Good morning folks. Thank you for letting me ask the question. I want to come back to margins and latter into the U.S. Retail segment. First going back to gross margins, just to make sure I kind of have the numbers right. We've got Buff adding maybe 80 bps or so. So underlying we're looking at down 70 bps, which looks like the math would suggest just the volume leverage is that roughly right?","Don Mulligan","Buffalo was probably little less than that in the quarter. It will be in that neighborhood for the full year even a little higher for the full year as we alluded to, when we announced the deal. But in the second quarter it was a little less than that just given the fact that we had some the volume deleverage and the inflation and plant startup cost in the number. ","Jason English","Got it. ","Don Mulligan","But you\u2019re directionally correct, pet added in the base business was slightly down on a gross margin basis year-over-year.","Jason English","So it's not surprising to see the base business down a bit clearly it sequentially getting better, which is the right trajectory. I was surprised that you still had with base business gross margins down you still had as much margin leverage in North America Retail. Can you help me understand some of the drivers? And I guess where I'm also going to is this another quarter where you pulled back a lot on A&P. And if so, is there -- do you see any parallels with this sequentially eroding volume trend for now sort of the fourth quarter row with sort of consistent pullback on A&P?","Don Mulligan","No. What we saw in U.S. retailer NAR, was the same trends we saw from a total company standpoint. We have strong HMM, we have price mix benefit coming through. We had really strong cost control in our plants, so our manufacturing costs came in very tight and those combined to deliver better profitability of the bottom line than sales.","Jason English","So it's not just marketing related then this sort of core underline is that the message?","Jeff Harmening ","I think it is. It really is a matter of Jason price mix and HMM exceeding inflation. And I think you see that because our second quarter it was our merchandising results that really lagged our expectations. What we sell at an everyday price was actually at or above our expectations and that's the best margin. And so from a margin standpoint we are really pleased with what we're selling at an everyday price. And what we merchandise was really what drove -- what was really the cause for our sales being a little below what we had anticipated, which has pretty good margin impact.","Don Mulligan","Just to build on what Jeff laid out, our baseline through the first half were flat in North America Retail which we feel really good about. It was really merchandising which was all of our declines and primarily in cereal and snacks. So we feel like our total commercial investments are in a really good place. We feel like our innovation is really working, our marketing is strong and the base business is performing. We clearly had some execution issues particularly on cereal and snacks merchandising and we've got plans in place to fix that.","And you saw in November, cereal getting better as we got to merchandising more in line. So we have good confidence so we can accelerate the top line and at the same time continue to drive good margins in the back half.","Jason English","Good stuff. Thanks guys. I'll pass it on. ","Jeff Harmening ","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our question comes from the line of Pablo Zuanic with FIG. Please proceed with your question. Mr. Zuanic, your line is open, please go ahead.","Pablo Zuanic ","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Two questions on pet food, the first one is more just a bigger picture. On the one hand as we see more premium pet food brands in Mass. We hear about consumer pushback about Walmart consumer $40,000 a year, now the interest on this type of products, but on the other hand clearly, more retailers are adding more space to premium pet food. So try to resolve that conflict for as a contradiction. And my visits to stores for example I would say Target these days seems to have eliminate a lot of the Mass brands and you are seeing allow more premium. So when you launch at these new retailers let's say including Walmart are other brands on the premium side also entering that aisle?","So again the big picture question is trying to reconcile this idea of pushback on the consumer on this more expensive pet food, but on the other hand apparently a number of retailers continuing to add a greater percentage of space to premium pet food. Thanks.","Jeff Harmening ","Well, Pablo, I appreciate the question. I think, what we see is that first is as Blue has entered it has been really successful and in fact year-to-date it's driven something on the order of 40% of the growth in Food, Drug and Mass. And so this premium part of the Pet Food segment especially kind of the wholesome natural area Blue Buffalo is driving that growth. And interestingly, as Blue has come in to the Food, Drug and Mass segment it's actually grown the whole segment, so the whole segment is growing. And the customers that have taken Blue Buffalo are growing faster than the ones that haven\u2019t.","And so, what that says to me there is a premiumization going on in pet food similar to what we see in human food and what you see in -- what we've seen in natural and organic, so again the trends there are very similar. And we've had -- I think it also -- what it also speak to the success we've had with Blue Buffalo in Food, Drug and Mass as well as e-commerce by the way, is number one on online and it's number one in Pet Specialty. So it's doing well across channels and great brands do well across channels, and we see that with Cheerios and we see that with Annie's.","And so what we're seeing in Blue is kind of what we expected and it's drive -- importantly it's driving success in the whole segment of wholesome natural and Food, Drug and Mass and it's really some of the mainstream brands that have seen declines.","Pablo Zuanic ","Right. And just a follow-up, so pet coke [ph] has made some news in the trade press in terms of making significant assortment changes to a portfolio there taking out brands focusing on natural ingredients. Any impact on Blue Buffalo can you try to quantify the exposure for your business there.","Jeff Harmening ","We don't comment on any specific retailers, but I will say that all our brands are natural. And so we feel good about the ingredients in Blue Buffalo and certainly wouldn't anticipate any negative consequences from that activity.","Pablo Zuanic ","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question. ","John Baumgartner ","Good morning, thanks for the question.","Jeff Harmening ","Hey, John.","John Baumgartner ","Jon, I just wanted to come back to the softer merchandising in Q2. I mean there has been a lot of talk about shifting your approach to I guess more non-priced promo. And I'm curious as to how this influence performance. There was the softness kind of a function of competitors stepping with sharper elbows for per price promo or -- and you have to I guess increase your price promo going forward more than you thought or did the non-priced promo just see weaker lifts. Just curious on more the background there and the transition moving forward?","Jon Nudi","Sure John, great question. What I would say was there is really two specific categories and some specific issues within each, which drove to our merchandising softness. So for cereal, we executed a pack price architecture project through the first half that touched nearly 70% of our line. So was our major project on top of that we had capacity constraints in our flake cereals and combined the two cause some disruption in our execution particularly in the months of September and October. And we didn't get the merchandising that we had expected. We got back into business from a merchandising standpoint in November and we saw our business bounce back.","For snacks, we've had capacity constraints on two of our major platforms there as well and also some timing shifts from major retailers from Q2 to Q3. So we feel really good about our ability to get merchandising and actually get back to plan from a merchandising standpoint that will shift out again from Q2 to Q3. You're starting to see it already again November was a much better month through two weeks of December the Nielsen that's out you can see that our momentum continues and we were actually up 1 overall in dollars. So it was really cereal and snacks that are specific drivers that again around the past we feel good about our ability to execute moving forward.","John Baumgartner ","Great. And then just a follow-up for Don, in terms of some of the businesses that you're thinking about maybe selling some of the slower growth assets any update there in terms of timing or maybe what you're -- how the volatility of the market impact some of those plans going forward?","Don Mulligan","Yes, there's no update. We spoke in the past about looking at roughly 5% of our portfolio that still in line, but we don't have any update until we are ready to pull the trigger on something.","John Baumgartner","Great, thanks for your time. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies and Co. Please proceed with your question.","Akshay Jagdale","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So my first question is on Blue Buffalo. As far as the Mass or the FDM expansion goes I think it's well publicized now that there is a delay in the resets at one major retailer by about seven weeks or so. And so in light of that you've still maintained your guidance. So that leaves me to believe that you weren't really taking a lot of that in your guidance to begin with, but can you just help us understand some of the delays in shelf resets how that has impacted your numbers?","And then related to that I think Jeff you made a comment about how the mix of that business is actually margin positive. I think there is a big disconnect in expectations on this -- on our side as to the FDM channel being sort of margin mix neutral to positive going forward.","Jeff Harmening ","Yes, so in terms of the second half distribution build, when we came into the year, it's fair to say that we assumed that we would have a big push in our distribution plans kind of at the end of January and for a variety of reasons that's going to be delayed by a few weeks to be honest in the life of a brand, it's not a big deal. What it means is that because it really starts in February now instead of January it pushes it into our fourth quarter instead of our third.","But in terms of what it means for the brand to be honest it's not a huge deal. And what I would also say is that we have been -- while that delay may have impacted the year a little bit to the negative, our product expansion or variety expansion to other customers is going to be frankly the uptake on that is going to be better than we anticipated because Blue has been so strong and those initial customers we launched into a year ago. So when you get those things together, we'll have strong growth in Food, Drug and Mass for the year. So we feel really good about that.","In terms of wet pet food and treats, if I understand your question correctly, the -- what we see is that there'll be a product mix in Food, Drug and Mass so it'll be a little bit different skew a little bit more toward the wet and treat segments where the profit margins are better. I mean, first of all, they're all good, all the profit margin in pet are good, certainly relative to General Mills average, those tend to be particularly good.","And as we push into that that's one of the reasons our household penetration is up higher than our sales because as we expand into Food, Drug and Mass and also why it's incremental because we see a different product mix.","Akshay Jagdale","Perfect. And one follow-up maybe for Jon, it relates to North America and the recovery in the context of your guidance again, right. So you\u2019ve maintain your sales growth guidance implies as pretty significant turnaround in the businesses in the back half. And you've pointed to some what I would call tactical changes or improvements, right? So can you help us understand how like better merchandising let's say on snacks could have a material impact like because it seems like that's what needs to happen to get to the top line numbers. Thanks.","Jon Nudi","Yes. So I'd say two things. One, again, as we look at the underlying health of our business through the first half, we feel good about it, as our bass lines were flat, distribution points are heading in the right direction, feel good about innovation and marketing. So the base business feel strong, it was really merchandising that we saw the midst of plan. And as I mentioned before, we have a good line of sight to getting that merchandising back into the back half. ","The other thing that I believe Don touched on in the prepared remarks is through the first half, there was a difference between what we reported in RNS and what Nielsen movement was. Some of the drivers there were the Green Giant comp that we had through the first half that goes away as we go into Q3 and into the back half. We did see some significant inventory reductions at some major customers in the first half. As we've had collaborative discussions with those customers, we don't believe that we\u2019ll see another downshift in the back half of this year.","And then finally, as Don mentioned, there were some trade phasing that some minor differences that were a bit of a headwind in the first half and become a more of a tailwind in the back half. So really, I think from an execution standpoint, if we get our merchandising where we expected to be continue the baseline strength we believe that we can be where we need to be to deliver for the company.","Jeff Harmening ","And I am going to build on that, I agree with everything that Jon said and I would build on it by saying. I mean, if you look at what we had done had in one of our slides. If you look at the first half of the year, our organic sales were flat. And our guidance for year was flat to up 1%. And so on our organic business, we don't need to jump out of our shoes in order to hit our guidance for the year. We need -- do we need to improve a little bit? Yes. But we don't need to improve so significantly that we feel like, we have to go out buy volume at any cost in the back half of the year to hit our sales guidance, that's not the case at all. We just need to improve a little bit in a couple of specific areas. ","The biggest improvement you're going to see in our back half of the year is going to be on Blue Buffalo. And you'll see that, because of the comps and in fact we are lapping the inventory from Q2 and we're not doing that again back half and we're doubling our distribution. That will be the biggest increase and we have very tangible plans in place in order to recognize that.","Akshay Jagdale","Thank you. ","Jeff Harmening ","I think maybe we'll try to get one more on please. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line with -- from David Driscoll with Citi. Please proceed with your question. ","David Driscoll","All right. Well, I appreciate making it in under the wire. Good morning.","Jeff Harmening "," Good morning, David. ","Don Mulligan","Good morning, David. ","David Driscoll","I wanted to ask a few questions on Blue Buffalo. Can you guys quantify the growth in the wet treats and other and in dry food?","Don Mulligan","From a retail sales standpoint, if you look across channels we're seeing wet and treats growth in the 20% range. So well ahead of the total. So we feel really good about where we're seeing that and as Jeff said Food, Drug and Mass is where we're seeing particularly outperformance for wet and treats. ","David Driscoll","Okay. And then on dry, do you have any number that you can give us, of course that's the biggest piece of it. So I would assume that it was down related to the FDM launch from year ago. But any quantification you can give on that. Buff used to give that disclosures and I think it's pretty helpful.","Jon Nudi","Yes, David what I was just referencing were our retail sales not the net sales, right. Net sales were down and I actually don't have the split on net sales between dry wet and treats, but from a retail standpoint, again wet and treats were driving some nice growth. But in total with dry being the bulk of the business you still saw positive trends there.","Jeff Harmening ","But I think your instincts Dave are right about the business. I think your instincts are right in that. Because it was the inventory build in the Food, Drug and mass last year on the Life Protection Formula, big piece of which was dry. It's fair to assume that that business on a reported net sales basis didn't perform as well, because that's where we had the inventory builds. So I think your instincts are right even if we don't have the exact numbers in front of us right now I think your instincts are correct?","David Driscoll","And then on the Wilderness brand. That's the second largest brand at the company. Can you make any comments about how that brand is growing?","Jeff Harmening ","Well, it's a first of all Wilderness is a great brand. And I think some of the best packaging we have at General Mills and some of the best equity. And I can tell you it's kind of a tail of two things, we don't have it in FDM at the moment, but in specialty it's doing okay, but it's declining a little bit because our business in Pet Specialty declining and e-commerce it\u2019s on fire. So the fair amount of our growth in e-commerce is Wilderness as well as the Life Protection Formula, and what I can tell you that's a great sub line. And we think it has a lot of potential just like we think Life Protection Formula has still a lot of potential.","David Driscoll","Okay. Two more Buff questions and then one question for, Don. The two final ones on Buff were just, I think you mentioned on your new product plans that you'd be launching new varieties. But just for clarity, are these new varieties in the marketplace in any marketplace or are these varieties that were in some channels previously and you\u2019re moving those kind of existing varieties into FDM. I just want to be clear if it's really a new product or if it's existing product channel expansion?","Jeff Harmening ","It's fair to assume that it's existing products that we're expanding channels. So products with a proven track record of success that we are expanding.","David Driscoll","Okay. And then for Don, two questions for you, one on the startup of the new plants for Blue Buffalo. Can you give us any quantification as to either the dollar expenses of these new startups, -- the plant startup costs on your P&L and or the gross margin impact, because in the past for Blue these were significant expenses. And then I have a debt question for you, just would like you to talk about your debt pay down plans, your debt to EBITDA target. And I believe you have $1 billion maturity in February. And I ask all this in light of what's happened to your dividend yield and get your thoughts there. Thank you.","Don Mulligan","Sure. Yes, in terms of Blue, plant startup if you see what the profit decline in the quarter, it was about a third from lower sales, a third from plant startup costs and a third from the impact of inflation. And so to your point, it was a significant factor and that\u2019s something that we will roll through as the year unfolds. So that's I think your recollection of the impact is correct.","As far as debt, year-to-date from end of the year till now our debt is down about $500 million. We do have that maturity coming up. So we\u2019ll have the opportunity to bring that down further in the back half of the year, not by the full billion, but by some additional amount. And we still target to exit F2020 with our leverage ratio at 3.5 which is what we announced at the time of the deal. ","David Driscoll","Thanks. I appreciate the comments. Thank you and happy holidays. ","Jeff Harmening ","Happy holidays.","Don Mulligan","Thank you, David.","Jeff Harmening ","And that's all the time we have. Thanks everyone for hanging with us. Appreciate all the good questions and please reach out with further questions, we're around all day. Thanks so much.

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded today, Wednesday, March 21, 2018.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Jeff Siemon, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Jeff Siemon","Thanks, Nelson, and good morning to everybody. I'm here with Jeff Harmening, our Chariman and CEO; and Don Mulligan, our CFO. I'll hand the call over to them in a moment, but before I do, let me cover a few items.","Our press release on third quarter results was issued this morning over the wire services and you can find the release and the copy of the slides that supplement our remarks this morning on our Investor Relations website. I will remind you that our remarks will include forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions and that the second slide in today's presentation list factors that could cause our future results to be different than our current estimates.","And with that, I'll turn you over to my colleagues, beginning with Jeff.","Jeffrey Harmening","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning to everyone. Let's jump right in and cover the key messages for today.","Our primary goal during fiscal 2018 has been to strengthen our top line performance while maintaining our efficiency; we're delivering on the first part of that goal with stronger innovation, more impactful consumer news and better in-store execution leading to a second consecutive quarter of organic net sales growth. We're also generating significant growth and free cash flow through strong capital discipline. As a result, we're reaffirming our full year organic net sales and free cash flow targets.","While I feel good about our results on net sales and cash, I'm disappointed in our profit performance this quarter. Our third quarter operating profit fell well short of our expectations and our full year outlook has been impacted by an increase in supply chain costs in a dynamic cost environment. We're moving urgently to address these rising cost pressures, we've taken actions to improve profitability in the near-term and we've launched initiatives that will reduce our long-term cost structure. While these actions will only partially offset the cost headwinds in fiscal 2018, we still expect to deliver profit growth in the fourth quarter; and we're confident these actions will strengthen our bottom line results beginning in fiscal 2019. Beyond our current results and outlook, we remain confident in our ability to drive long-term value with our consumer for strategy which will be further strengthened with the addition of Blue Buffalo to our family of brands.","Before turning it over to Don to cover our financial results, let me share some details on the cost increases driving our revised profit outlook, and the steps we're taking to mitigate these increased costs going forward.","Between incremental costs we identified as we closed the books in the third quarter and a more unfavorable cost outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, we now expect our full year fiscal '18 total segment operating profit will be 5% to 6% below year ago levels in constant currency. The key driver of this change is a significant increase in supply chain costs which falls into two main areas; first, their input costs are rising faster than we had anticipated, in fact, we now estimate our full year fiscal '18 input cost inflation will be 4%, 1 point higher than our previous estimate.","We called out an increased freight costs that are upto CAGNY but the cost pressure we're seeing is even higher than we thought at that time. We're now having to go out to the spot market for close to 20% of our shipments versus the historic average of about 5%, and those spot market prices can be 30% to 60% higher than our contracted rates. In fact North American freight spot prices were near 20-year highs in February. Higher freight costs are impacting our raw material prices as well as the cost to ship materials from our suppliers to our factories has risen significantly. And we've seen higher prices in some key commodities including grains, fruits and nuts, further heightening the inflationary dynamic.","The second main area of supply chain cost pressure is increased operational costs driven by higher volumes running through our network. We've seen increased volume on some capacity constrained platforms and stronger results for our new products. And while I'm pleased with our increased volume performance, those factors are mainly utilizing more external manufacturing where conversion cost can be significantly higher than our internal platforms. Additionally, we've seen increased expenses from intra-network shipments between our distribution centers as we move more products to the right locations to satisfy the strong demand.","We're moving urgently to address this increasingly dynamic cost inflation environment and ensure that negative profit impact is limited to fiscal 2018. Some of the actions we're taking will have an impact already this fiscal year. We're addressing higher freight costs in the near-term by qualifying more carriers and utilizing different modes of transportation. We're placing increasingly tight control over all expenses in the balance of this year. We're also taking smart actions to drive positive net price realization in a higher cost environment by pulling various levers within our strategic revenue management tool box. The specific SRM actions will vary across categories and vary across geographies but will impact all four operating segments with benefits starting to hit this fiscal year, and more fully impacting fiscal 2019.","We're also moving forward on initiatives to address our structural cost for fiscal 2019 and beyond. We're optimizing our distribution network between the factory and the customer to better align with the manufacturing footprint reorganization we completed over the past 3 years. We've improved additional cost savings initiatives design to further optimize our global administrative structure, and will continue to drive other savings efforts that will improve our efficiency including our ongoing holistic margin management program, our global sourcing initiative, and other enterprise process transformation projects. In addition to these profit actions, we will maintain our focus on driving -- on improving our net sales through our compete, accelerate and reshape priorities because we know our job is to deliver both the top and the bottom line.","Before I turn it over to Don, let me assure you that we understand the ramifications of changing current year outlook in such a short period of time, and we are taking steps to ensure this doesn't happen again. Our forecasting process has historically relied on a periodic in-depth analysis, a key juncture during the fiscal year; and at more stable times that cadence served us well in forecasting our cost and margins. In an increasingly dynamic environment we need to go deeper more frequently, while that would not have reduced the cost, it would have accelerated our mitigation efforts by a quarter or so. So while we're moving with urgency to address these higher costs, we're moving with equal urgency to adjust our forecasting process at all levels of the organization.","Now let me turn it over to Don to provide more details in the quarter and our updated outlook.","Donal Mulligan","Thanks, Jeff and good morning, everyone. Slide 8 summarizes third quarter fiscal '18 financial results.","Net sales totaled $3.9 billion in the quarter, up 2% as reported, organic net sales increased 1%. Total segment operating profit totaled $628 million, down 6% in constant currency. Net earnings increased a 163% to $941 million and diluted earnings per share increased 166% to $1.62 as reported. These results include a onetime and ongoing benefits related to U.S. Tax Reform. Adjusted diluted EPS, which excludes the onetime impacts related to tax reform and other items affecting comparability was $0.79, up 8% on a constant currency basis reflecting a lower ongoing tax rate in fewer average diluted shares outstanding.","Slide 9 shows the components of total company net sales growth. Organic net sales increased 1% in the third quarter driven by organic sales mix and net price realization. Foreign currency translation yielded a 2 point to net sales. Divestitures reduced net sales growth by 1 point reflecting co-packing sales made in last year's third quarter related to our Green Giant divestiture.","Turning to Slide 10; third quarter adjusted gross margin decreased 250 basis points and adjusted operating profit margin was down 120 basis points. As Jeff mentioned, we experienced a significant increase in supply chain costs including higher freight, commodities and operational costs, and we now expect our fiscal input cost inflation will be 4%, 1 point higher than our previous guidance. We also had higher merchandising activity in the quarter including greater than expected seasonal performance on soup and refrigerated dough and stronger merger results in cereal snack bars which more than offset the benefit of trade expense phasing from the prior year.","These margin headwinds were partly offset by lower SG&A expenses, including a 22% reduction in advertising and media expense in the quarter. Year-to-date, media expense is down 5% as we have shifted some dollars to vehicles closer to the point of sale including customer events, in-store theater, loyalty programs, sponsorships and sampling. Our million acts of good activation with Ellen is a great example of this type of standing. These initiatives get our brands in front of the consumer usually in the store that are captured in the media line in the P&L.","We expect our total consumer facing spending this year including media, as well as non-media vehicles like the ones I just mentioned to be roughly in line with prior year levels.","Slide 11 summarizes our joint venture results in the quarter. CPW net sales increased 2% in constant currency with growth across all 4 CPW regions, and strong performance on our granola and muesli product lines. H\u00e4agen-Dazs Japan, constant currency net sales were down 3% due to unfavorable net price realization and mix. On a year-to-date basis, constant currency net sales were up 1% for CPW and up 2% for H\u00e4agen-Dazs Japan. Combined after-tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $17 million, up 30% in constant currency, primarily driven by volume growth at CPW.","Slide 12 summarizes other noteworthy income statement items in the quarter. We incurred $11 million in restructuring and project-related charges in the quarter including $3 million recorded in cost of sales. Corporate and allocated expenses excluding certain items affecting comparability decreased $4 million from a year ago. Net interest expense was up $13 million, primarily driven by the early repayment of certain medium term notes which resulted from the Blue Buffalo acquisition. This onetime item is excluded from adjusted earnings. The effective tax rate for the quarter was impacted by a onetime provisional net benefit of $504 million related to tax reform.","Excluding items affecting comparability, the tax rate was 15.2% compared to 24.7% a year ago during by the lower corporate income tax rate resulting from tax reform, partially offset by non-recurring favorable discrete items in the prior year period. And average diluted shares outstanding declined 1% in the quarter. We continue to expect average diluted shares will be down approximately 2% for the full year.","Turning to our nine month financial performance; net sales of $11.85 billion were down 1% on an organic basis. Segment operating profit declined 10% in constant currency, and adjusted diluted EPS were down 2% in constant currency, including the impact of the lower corporate tax rate and lower average diluted shares outstanding.","Turning to the balance sheet; Slide 14 shows that our core working capital decreased 57% versus the prior year driven by continued benefits from our terms extension program. For the full year, we continue to expect our core working capital balance will finish well below fiscal '17 levels driven by significant improvement in accounts payable. Nine month operating cash flow was $2.1 billion, up 29% over the prior year driven by our working capital improvements. Year-to-date capital investments totaled $398 million and due to the first nine months of the fiscal year we returned nearly $1.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and net share repurchases.","Slide 16 summarizes our fourth quarter outlook excluding the impact of the proposed Blue Buffalo acquisition. We expect to deliver another quarter of organic net sales growth driven by positive price mix across all four segments. Remember that our results in Asia and Latin America segment will be negatively impacted by the comparison to last year's fourth quarter that included an extra month of results in Brazil, as we'll aligned net markets reporting calendar to our corporate calendar. We continue to expect accelerated cost savings in the fourth quarter driven by benefits from our new global sourcing initiative. That increased cost savings plus positive price mix and the initial benefit of the actions Jeff highlighted will help drive constant currency growth in total segment operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS.","I'll close my portion of our remarks by summarizing our updated fiscal '18 guidance. As I just noted, this outlook does not include any impact from the Blue Buffalo acquisition. We continue to expect organic net sales growth to be flat to last year. As Jeff mentioned upfront, we now expect total segment operating profit growth will be down 5% to 6% on a constant currency basis. Our full year adjusted effective tax rate is now expected to be approximately 26% or 1% below our most recent guidance. We continue to estimate the tax reform will have a 2 point favorable impact to our fiscal '18 adjusted effective tax rate.","Our updated full year adjusted diluted EPS outlook is in the range of between flat and up 1% in constant currency. We expect currency translation will add 1 point of growth to net sales totaled segment operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS in fiscal '18. Finally, we continue to expect full year free cash flow growth of at least 15% this year.","With that, I'll hand it back to Jeff to cover our segment results.","Jeffrey Harmening","Thanks, Don. Now let's look at each of our segment results and talk a little bit about our upcoming news and initiatives.","In North America retail, organic net sales were up 1% in the third quarter. U.S. Snacks posted 3% net sales growth driven by Nature Valley, L\u00e4rabar and fruit snacks. The U.S. meals and baking operating unit generated 2% net sales growth behind the strong baking and soup season. Canada net sales were up 1% in constant currency led by our natural and organic platform. U.S. net cereal sales were down 1% reflecting reduction in customer inventory levels while cereal retail sales and Nielsen measured outlets were up 2% behind innovation and effective messaging across our core brands.","U.S. yogurt net sales were down 8% which represents the third consecutive quarter of improvement as our portfolio benefits from successful innovation and faster growing year-over-year segments. Constant currency segment operating profit was flat compared to the year ago period driven by higher sales, offset by higher input costs. As I outlined at CAGNY, our top priority for returning to consistent top line growth is to compete effectively on every brand across every geography. Growing with our categories is the first measure of success and I'm pleased to say that we have accomplished that in the U.S. in the third quarter with retail sales up 1%, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of sales improvement; and we grew market share in 7 of our top 9 U.S. categories.","Our improvement is driven by solid fundamentals. Our baseline sales trends are 500 basis points better than last year and are driving 75% of our retail sales improvement. This is a result of good consumer news and strong messaging through traditional media like T.V. and digital advertising and Nature Valley, Pillsbury and Totino's, as well as the activations that go beyond traditional media like our Ellen partnership on Cheerios. We're also delivering better innovation this year with our average new product turning nearly 50% better on-shelf compared to last year. This includes chocolate peanut butter Cheerios which is the biggest launch in the cereal category this year, and WeBuy [ph] Yoplait which is the largest launch in the yogurt category this year.","The third leg of our improvement is our in-store execution. We were back in the zone on seasonal merchandising this year which grows significant improvement in soup and refrigerated dough. And we're winning a higher share of display, the best type of merchandising vehicle on some of our most productive categories including cereal and snack bars. These efforts are translating into broad-based improvement in our U.S. retail sales trends with absolute retail sales growth in 7 of our top 9 categories in the third quarter.","In addition to our strong fundamentals, we're maintaining a disciplined approach to our pricing. As you can see in the chart, our baseline and merchandise price points have been higher than last year throughout fiscal '18 including the third quarter. Our average unit price was slightly down in the quarter as our proportion of merchandising was higher this year. This was really driven by prior year comparison when our merchandising levels were abnormally low. When you look over a two-year period, our average prices across our portfolio were up 4% and are outpacing our aggregate categories. With that at the backdrop, let me share some third quarter highlights from North America Retail and talk a little bit about what's to come for the remainder of the year.","Our U.S. cereal retail sales were up more than 2% in the third quarter driven by the same things I mentioned the for the segment, better news and messaging innovation and execution in-store. There is no shortage of examples of good news and messaging on our cereal business this year. One of the most fun is our Marshmallow news on Lucky Charms which has helped drive double-digit retail sales growth so far this year. And we just announced our most recent initiative, Magical Unicorn Marshmallows which are in store now. On Cheerios, our partnership with Ellen and activation across TV, digital and social media on PAC and in-store and helped to improve our baseline sales growth nearly 400 basis points since the campaign first launched.","On Reese's Puffs we're launching a fourth quarter seasonal Bunnies version to help continue to double-digit retail sales growth that brand has enjoyed so far this year. And on the innovation front we've had a stellar year; we've launched chocolate peanut butter cheerios last October and it was the best-selling new product in the category last quarter. And we'll continue to look to bring fun limited edition seasonal flavors to Cheerios to the shelf with the launch of a new peach flavor that's rolling out now.","On U.S. yogurt, we've improved our retail sales trends by 16 points this year by innovating into faster growing spaces. Our retail sales were down just 3% in February and we actually grew a market share in the grocery channel last month. We're pleased with our U.S. yogurt improvement but we're not yet fully satisfied. We continue to improve by building on recent successes and by launching new category expanding innovation. For instance, we recently launched two new flavors of -- launched new flavors of WE by Yoplait and Yoplait mixins; the top two yogurt launches this fiscal year. And we have another important launch planned for this summer that addresses some of the biggest health and wellness fares in the yogurt category, you'll hear more about this news in the coming months.","Shifting to snack bars; Nature Valley has posted double digit retail sales growth this year and is generating more retail sales dollar growth than any other brand in the category. These results have been driven by innovation, nut butter biscuits and granola cups are the Top 2 new products in the category for the last two years. And we're seeing solid results from this year's launches, including new layered bars and filled soft bars. U.S. retail sales for L\u00e4rabar are up 30% this year behind our real food advertising campaign, and they're up almost 70% in Canada. We're also driving improvement on Fiber One by communicating what consumers value most about the brand, permissable indulgence. Retail sales trends for Fiber One last month were 900 basis points better than our fiscal '17 growth rate, thanks in part to our Brownie & Cookie Bites innovation.","Our soup and baking businesses rebounded from a challenging fiscal 2017 to good retail sales and market share during the key season this year. We have great news planned in the fourth quarter on other meals and baking businesses. We just launched Totino's many snack bites adding more fun variety to this business that grew retail sales 9% in the third quarter; and we'll look to drive more visibility of for Old El Paso by securing 4,000 taco truck displays which will be parked in the front of the store where Mexican food merchandising performs best.","Finally, our North American national organic portfolio continues to lead our growth with third quarter net sales up high single digits including good performance on Annie's, L\u00e4rabar and EPIC.","In our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment, third quarter net sales were up 3% driven by a low single digit growth for the focused six platforms and benefits from index pricing on bakery flour. The frozen meals platform continues to perform well, including the new Pillsbury stuffed waffle which is the top turning breakfast item in C-stores where we have distribution. And our cereal platform delivered mid-single digit growth this quarter driven by continued distribution gains. Segment operating profit was down 10% in the quarter driven by higher transportation and logistics costs, as well as commodity inflation.","Turning to Europe and Australia, third quarter organic net sales were down 1% with strong growth in snack bars offset by declines in other platforms. Constant currency segment operating profit was down 46% versus last year driven by significant raw material inflation and a comparison against 39% constant currency growth in last year's third quarter. Through the third quarter, our Europe and Australia segment is growing with it's categories. Our Snack Bars and H\u00e4agen-Dazs platforms are performing exceptionally well with double digit retail sales growth driving strong market share gains. And on yogurt, although our retail sales in total are down, we're driving growth in many of our core brands including Panier, Perle de Lait, Liberte and YOP.","The fourth quarter is a key innovation window across all of our primary platforms in Europe and Australia. In yogurt, we will be the first major brand launching into the kids organic segment with our leading Petits Filous brand. On Old El Paso, we're responding to the increasing number of gluten avoiding consumers by introducing new gluten-free tortillas and Mexican kits. We're launching new flavors to bring excitement to the freezed around H\u00e4agen-Dazs ice cream, and we'll continue to invest in T.V., media and Nature Valley snack bars to drive increased household penetration. In Australia in January we began advertising Fiber One for the first time which has helped drive 20% retail sales growth for the brand.","In our Asia and Latin America segment, third quarter organic net sales were in line with last year with good growth in our Asian markets offset by continued top line challenges in Brazil. While our improvement in Brazil has taken longer than we expected, we're making progress and delivered net sales growth in the quarter on some key businesses including Yoki popcorn and Kitano seasonings. The third quarter is typically this segments lowest operating profit quarter of the year which means even smaller or absolute dollar changes drive big percentage changes and results. Last year we earned a $10 million profit in the quarter and this year's result with a loss of $2 million. The $12 million change was primarily driven by lower volume and higher manufacturing and logistics cost in Brazil. We expect this segment will return to profit growth in the fourth quarter behind strengthening top line performance.","Our snack bars and ice cream platforms led Asia and Latin America net sales performance in the quarter. Net sales for our snack bar business in India more than doubled in the third quarter driven by continued distribution expansion of our Pillsbury Cookie Cake and the launch of a new Pillsbury Pastry Cake. We're also launching a similar pastry cake to our Middle East markets under the Betty Crocker brand. H\u00e4agen-Dazs retail sales increased high single digits to last 3 months in Asia driven by our mochi innovation and activation during the holiday season.","Looking ahead, our refreshed H\u00e4agen-Dazs packaging is rolling out across Asia and we're supporting this with a campaign to celebrate the extraordinary creations of artisans around the world. We're also launching spring limited edition of flower flavors, cherry blossom, and lavender blueberry; and will support them with an omni-channel activation including in our shops. At CAGNY, I outlined our compete, accelerate, and reshape framework for restoring consistent top line growth; and I just shared how we're competing more effectively in fiscal '18 across many of our brands and geographies. We've also taken a significant step this year to reshape our portfolio with the acquisition of Blue Buffalo pet products.","Before I close, let me refresh you on the details of the transaction and share why we're so excited about adding Blue to our family of brands. Last month, we announced our intent to acquire Blue Buffalo for $40 per share representing an enterprise value of roughly $8 billion. Blue Buffalo is a highly attractive asset playing in the fast growing wholesome natural pet food category with $1.3 billion in revenues, 25% EBITDA margins, and a consistent history of double digit growth on the top and bottom lines. After the deal closes which we expect will occur before the end of May, Billy Bishop, the current CEO of Blue Buffalo will lead a new pet operating segment for General Mills.","Blue Buffalo is a truly unique asset in an attractive category that is still in the early stages of transformation. At $30 billion in sales in the U.S. pet food market is one of the largest in the center store. It has generated consistent growth and strong profitability over many years with low private label exposure. These days more and more pet owners, especially millennials see their pets as another member of the family; this humanization of pets combined with a growing consumer interest in more natural products has driven a dramatic increase in what we call the wholesome natural pet foods category. And this transformation is still in the early innings with wholesome natural products still making up only 10% of total category volume, up from 5% five years ago.","What's most exciting to us is that Blue Buffalo is leading the category transformation. The Blue brand has the strongest brand equity in the category with a clear number one position in the wholesome natural pet food, as well as the number one overall pet brand in the e-commerce and pet mass channels. And Blue is still on the early stages of expanding into the broader Food, Drug and Mass or FDM channels which represent fully half of pet food retail sales in the U.S. Since the announcement that has some analysts and investors asked me isn't this a new category and how will General Mills create value in this transaction? I think they've been pleasantly surprised when I explained that in many ways pet food is not a new category as some people think, their value creation playbook will look similar to the one we've used very successfully for the Annie's acquisition over the last three years.","Our industry leading retail sales force, retail partnerships and sales capabilities will help increase the likelihood of success of Blue's FDM expansion. We will also leverage our technical capabilities and extrusion and thermal processing to drive innovation across dry and wet pet food. We'll utilize our sourcing expertise and distribution network to enhance Blue's supply chain efficiency. We look for ways to help the Blue Buffalo team nurture and grow this modern authentic 21st century brand and will stay out of their way where they don't need us.","Finally, we'll be selective in where we can drive admin synergies with a focus on back office and public company costs. We took a very similar approach to Annie's and it resulted in net sales doubling and a little over three years since the acquisition. And I can tell you, for even have a successful at Blue Buffalo, our shareholder will be very happy with this acquisition.","Over the past month key leaders from my team and I have spent time in Connecticut with the herd, as they call themselves, and Billy and his leadership team have visited our marketing, sales and R&D teams in Minneapolis. The more we get to know each other, the more we see how compatible our cultures are and how synergistic our capabilities are in a variety of functional areas, and we cannot wait to get moving on continuing to grow this terrific brand as part of General Mills portfolio.","Let me wrap up by summarizing today's comments. We're competing more effectively in this translating into good momentum on the top line of fiscal 2018. At the same time, we've been challenged by sharp increases in supply chain costs that have negatively impacted our bottom line outlook. We're moving with urgency to address these rising costs with some actions taking effect now and more significant impact expected in fiscal '19. And finally, we're excited as ever about Blue Buffalo are we're confident that this transaction will deliver long-term value for our shareholders.","Now let's open the call for questions. Operator, will you please get us started.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi. Please proceed.","David Driscoll","Given the given retail environment, I get just a lot of questions about pricing and the ability for manufacturers to realize pricing at retail. So you have profit challenges that you're talking about because of inflation; Jeff, I think a lot of people are really going to wonder is this because of the inflation side or is it because you just can't get pricing at retail? And then I think what you were saying on the call is, maybe there was a bit of an internal failure to recognize the higher inflation as quickly as you would probably expect your organization to do so but I would really emphasize the fact that investors just worry so much that the retail environment is so difficult that companies like NUF [ph], can't get pricing.","So I'd really appreciate your thoughts on that question and just a little bit more explanation on what happened here? And then how it really goes forward if you do in fact have the ability to recognize some price increases?","Jeffrey Harmening","Let me start out by the addressing the pricing environment and kind of what we're doing to offset our cost just in general, then I'll turn it over to Don if he has any more specifics. In terms of the pricing environment, first of all, I would say is that we will address our increased cost by a combination of factors which starts with addressing our cost structure itself and there are some near-term things we can do with supply chain, there are some longer things we can do in terms of our logistics network. And we have our ongoing HMM program in addition to what we're doing with ramping up global sourcing; so that's -- kind of the first-line of defense against rising costs is to make sure we're managing our cost effectively, and rest assured that we're doing that and moving with an increased sense of urgency since discovering that we'll have higher input cost than we had thought.","On the net pricing realization; I can imagine people listening could be nervous because we took pricing a couple of years ago and that didn't exactly go out as planned. You know, what I would tell you on that is a couple of things; first is that the environment now is very different than two years ago, and the environment two years ago when we took pricing there was really a deflationary pressure on input costs and now we see an inflationary pressure and as I said we're looking at our input cost going up by 4% and then a lot of the spot market for commodities are that high or even higher. So we see a very different environment from that sense. What I will also tell you is that what we see on the logistics side is very real, and our customers face it all the time and we get a lot of questions from our customers because -- about what we're doing to offset logistics costs because they see the same kind of pressures in their business, so the environment is different.","The second thing is that I would say is, a couple of years ago we took more pricing than clearly we should have and we took about 5% pricing in fiscal '17 and you don't need that -- we don't need that kind of pricing to offset that kind of environment we have right now, just a little bit of pricing and our categories are already seeing 1% to 2% pricing consistently quarter-to-quarter; just a little bit of pricing combined with these cost measures will really help alleviate the pressure on our input cost.","And then finally, I would say that our capability is a lot greater than strategic revenue management now than it was two years ago, we've hired some people from the outside combining some internal experts; and -- so we can realize prices in a variety of ways and that includes trade optimization and price pack architecture and vision to some more of the traditional pricing; so we feel as if our capability is a lot greater than it was a year ago. In terms of costs and seeing the cost, Don, do you have anything that you want to add to that?","Donal Mulligan","I guess I'll just finish the point that Jeff started about on pricing. If you look at our results year-to-date, we are seeing better competitives in the store but it's also being supported by pricing. Our Q3 organic positive price mix is higher than in the first half and for three of our segments it was up low single digits, and in our where it was flat as Jeff showed it was both our base and our merchandise prices were up; so the flat was more of a product of the mix of those. So we do believe it's environment's issue with the inflation where you can get price in Jet Blue [ph] to many of the instruments that we will use.","The other aspect to your question David was with visibility to our cost and again Jeff touched it upfront but I think it's worth going into again. Historically and this year, we've done deep estimates at our costs at regular intervals during the course of the year and that cadence has typically served us well in managing our costs and our margins. Frankly, if you look back over the years there has -- we seldom had a profit miss in year such as this one where our sales are tracking at\/or better than planned. But clearly in hindsight, this year was a very dynamic cost environment, the combination of our higher volumes, some constrained platforms increasing inflationary environment, we should've gone deeper more frequently; it might not have reduced the cost but it would have gotten us out ahead of it faster.","As I look at it, we need to be just as agile in how we manage our cost structure as we've been this year in meeting consumer demands. And that's what we're focused on doing, the actions that we're taking now are to make sure that we get -- we address the cost structure in the marketplace but we're moving just as urgently to look at our estimating and forecasting process to make sure this doesn't happen again.","David Driscoll","Don, one follow up; the first half of the year had a very sizable trade accrual phasing expense comparison issues; they were negative and it was supposed to get significantly better here in the back half. Given all that's happened on the cost side, I can't really tell what's occurred on trade phasing. Did the trade accruals perform as you expected? Can you give some color on that.","Donal Mulligan","Yes, they did David. We had a headwind in the first half, we'll have a tailwind in the second half; it will actually -- that -- part of the reason that we're confident -- more confident in profit growth in the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, because we had very strong merchandising take at our seasonal businesses and in some of our other lines here in the U.S. because we had very strong offerings in the store; again, not lower price but better offtake from a consumer standpoint. And as I referenced, we are also moving more of our consumer funds to in-store activity which -- much of that is recorded as deduction to sales as opposed to in the advertising or the admin or SG&A line and the combination of those things offset the benefit from the tax accrual reversal -- the trade accrual reversal in the quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Robert Roscoe [ph] with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.","Unidentified Analyst","Don, I have to ask again about the presentation at Cagney and what kind of data you had at hand at that time because you did lower guidance for higher freight costs at that time, so you must have had some kind of a rollup of how much spot activity was going on during the quarter. So what was wrong with the data? I guess, that's the first question.","And then second, I guess broader on pricing; you do have on Slide 22 a chart that shows that your baseline pricing is still positive but it keeps decelerating, and it's now at 0.8%. You know, it needs to go the other way to offset all this inflation that you're talking about and I think you've kind of stopped short today of saying that you're looking at taking list price increases again; it seems like you're talking about revenue management and some other things but can we see some list price increases coming maybe in the back half? Thanks.","Donal Mulligan","I'll hit Cagney one first. Obviously, when we gave our guidance in -- at Cagney, that was based on the best information we had at that time. I mention the fact that we do periodic costs deep dive, we did one in February, at the end of February, and we did it as we closed the books on the quarter in early March, and that is when these cost really came to the fore more clearly, and that's what's prompting the guidance change today. So as I referenced in the answer to David; we've done these at regular intervals, clearly in today's environment we have to do them more regularly and be more agile in terms of identifying the cost trends and make sure they are surface and acted upon, and we will do that.","In terms of pricing, we are going to use a number of leverage in some markets and some businesses; it's going to be list price increases. We talked at Cagney about our Convenience & Foodservice business, we're seeing the same in our European business, particularly in response to Brexit that can just have a ripple effect in the U.K. and certainly in some of our emerging market businesses. So that is part of the toolkit but again, the toolkit for our SRM is broader than that and we're going to use all the levers as we attack what is clearly a higher inflationary environment.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed.","Andrew Lazar","I know it's obviously too early to talk about specific sort of guidance and such for fiscal '19 but I guess I was hoping, maybe Don you could go through just a couple of puts and takes that we should be cognizant off, even directionally as we think towards -- I guess, more specifically how operating profit sort of shapes up for next year? Obviously, you've already talked about at Cagney, looking to reinvest; I think it was the majority of the benefit from tax reform, so that obviously has an impact around EBIT growth next year. But I was hoping you could -- because there is just so many factors that are playing into this today; anything you can get into around the puts and takes would be helpful.","Donal Mulligan","Andrew, obviously I couldn't say FY19 guidance today, what I will say is that the actions that Jeff walked us through as part of the prepared remarks will have some benefit in FY18 and have more full benefit in FY19 and beyond frankly. And that will come into play as we think about '19. He did mention that the tax reform, that will give us some potential flexibility to reinvest back in the business and we still have -- we have the three planks that we are working to ensure that we drive a more competitive top line that compete, accelerate and reshape. I think you see in this year how we're competing better, we've begun to put some money behind our accelerator platforms, we see a little bit of benefit there this year and we'll see more of that benefit as we move into '19.","Andrew Lazar","And then on the reshape part; obviously you talked about looking to divest a certain portion of the portfolio as well. Is that something that we think plays out over the course of the next -- call it year or so? I'm trying to get a better sense of a timeframe on that and obviously on some of these businesses I would anticipate you probably have a fairly low tax basis as well which I guess could potentially have an impact on EPS as well. I'm trying to get a sense of how to better think about that.","Donal Mulligan","Our focus right now obviously is closing and transitioning blew into the family but we will quickly pivot following that to look at divestitures. Obviously, the timing of any divestiture would have to have a willing buyer to go with a willing seller, and we have to make sure the economics work to your point about tax rate. So we will work at that diligently and I believe just as we've been successful on the acquisition side with identifying and bringing Blue in, we will do the same on the divestiture side.","Jeffrey Harmening","And when it comes to divestitures, I would also add to that is that -- I mean, we don't have to do all of the divestitures at the same time, I mean we can do those at different times. And the second is that we're only going to do that -- we're only going to do them when they make sense for shareholders and so when they are accretive to shareholder value. So we'll act with a sense of urgency but we will also act with a sense of our shareholders in mind to make sure that as we go to divest some businesses and that we're doing so at the night of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael [ph] with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.","Unidentified Analyst","Just looking at the fourth quarter, you've had an operating income decline year-to-date around 9% or 10%, even with a little bit of currency; can you just help us understand how do you really get to -- looks like you need maybe another 10% in the fourth quarter; you've touched on some accelerating savings but can you just really give us a roadmap for how U.S. execute that sharp in improvement?","Donal Mulligan","Sure, there is a few components to it Michel; it starts with another quarter of solid organic sales growth. As we look forward we expect mix to strengthen in each of the segments; cereal and snacks will be the driver in our and it also actually benefit from a little less from our meals and baking, our seasonal businesses. The focused six businesses in C&F will accelerate in the fourth quarter. Old El Paso, H\u00e4agen-Dazs buying the initiatives that Jeff talked about at EU, AU and H\u00e4agen-Dazs and snacks in Asia-LATAM. So we have good programs behind each of those areas that will continue to drive our top line growth. We'll add some net price realization, pricing in Brazil -- I mentioned C&F in the U.K. and then the various SRM initiatives we're executing in the U.S. and elsewhere. And again, we'll have to trade accrual reversal that will benefit the top line and our profit in Q4.","So that's really the main driver and when you translate that into profit you're going to have the benefit of that mix, the benefit of the trade realization; as well actually we also get the benefit of some volume leverage in Brazil as we improve our volume performance in that important market behind a couple of strong promotions, one around the World Cup. We'll get increased benefit from our global sourcing initiative that will increase our HMM in the quarter. And then, again, the other items that Jeff talked about particularly around our freight spending will begin to have some impacts, some favorable impact in the fourth quarter and the combination of those things in relatively equal measure, a little bit more from price mix but relatively equal measure across will benefit Q4 and help drive a profit growth figure for the quarter.","Unidentified Analyst","And is it fair to assume that would -- had initially at the beginning of the year been a headwind from higher incentive comp, maybe isn't anymore and could you quantify what that maybe doing to health?","Donal Mulligan","Yes, that will be less of a headwind for the year. That is true and that will benefit the fourth quarter.","Unidentified Analyst","And then just lastly, on the portfolio when you think about some divestitures you've got at the moment this logistics and freight pressure, you also have dry, refrigerated and frozen supply chains; does reducing that complexity come into your thinking at all and how you evaluate what you may think about divesting?","Donal Mulligan","It doesn't come into play into what we think about divesting but when -- as we're thinking about our supply network, we need to think about what we're divesting as we think about retooling that. And so it's a really good question, and it doesn't think -- it doesn't impact what we would intend to divest but it would have an impact on how we think our logistics network ought to be set up going forward; and so we think about those two things going together.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kenneth Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed.","Kenneth Goldman","I just wanted to follow-up a little bit on Dave Driscoll's question earlier because I think the answer focused on now versus two years ago but if you go back a little longer in time, go back to fiscal 2008, Mills had 7% inflation, yet it still beat it's earnings target; fiscal 2009, 9% inflation, gross margin barely changed. I know you guys were in different seats at that time but something has changed; and I -- again, to Dave Driscoll's question, is it just this much harder to take less pricing no matter what or is it more a case of -- maybe items like freight, items on that sort of perimeter like -- that are not exactly foodstuff oriented are harder to pass?","I'm just trying to get a sense of really -- I know you've addressed it to some extent but Dave is right, this is really the question we're getting a lot, really, what the problem is this time because the inflation is not nearly as bad as what you experienced 10 years ago and yet the results are much worse.","Donal Mulligan","A couple of things; you referenced 2008 and [indiscernible] was sitting in the cereal chair in 2008 which is when we did right size, right price; which is kind of a fancy term for price pack architecture. So when you think about strategic revenue management that was kind of the mother of all strategic revenue management initiatives, and so when I talked about price pack architecture and trade optimization and those kind of things; 2008 was a year that we certainly did that in the cereal business and saw great results from that; so a lot of positive lessons to be learned from that. I would tell you what's different about now is that the inflation as you mentioned; 4% is certainly a point higher and significant inflation above 3% but it's not something that can't be managed, we just had to make sure we see it coming, and now that we know that it's coming now we feel like we can manage it effectively because as the input costs rather 4% or 5% is not unprecedented, it's just higher than we had expected and we hadn't taken the actions to offset it.","Now that we see it, we have a pretty good degree of confident that with combining our -- but we can save on logistics costs in a way that we can reframe our logistics network combined with a little bit of net price realization, we can actually combat this because as you've said, we've done it before, we just didn't had the line of sight to it until room until recently that we needed to have to combat it.","Kenneth Goldman","And a quick follow up for me; you're using more co-packers I think than you expected but you're also hopeful that your volumes continue to rise. If this is the case, if your volumes do improve then you'll need to rely even more on co-packers which I'm sure you don't want. So as we think about 2019 and beyond, again, you're not giving guidance but is it reasonable for us to expect you want to invest in CapEx a bit otherwise I guess co-packing issue will just accelerate further?","Donal Mulligan","We've always used co-packs specifically for a lot of our new product volume because there's a lot of times ready capacity and capability, and obviously there's a bit risk mitigation from our standpoint as well. And then what we've seen is that as the new products become stable in the marketplace, then we bring them internally and we see savings, and that's the way we put capital against and we'll take the same approach here. It doesn't necessarily mean that CapEx will be higher than normal, we just maybe skewing more towards bringing this new product volume in-house.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed.","Alexia Howard","So I guess, to begin with it actually looks that though the profit pressure is greater in the international market at the moment and yet a lot of the conversation has been about perhaps not realizing the kind of profit, one's that you might have expected in North America resale. I'm just wondering if you can just go region-by-region and talk about what's happening to the profit declined in the international market?","And then secondly, on the Blue Buffalo acquisition; do you have a new updated guide on where the leverage might go to in light of the EBIT shortfall that's here? Thank you.","Donal Mulligan","It tends to hit both regions. In the EU\/AU the year-to-date margins are being impacted primarily by raw material inflation, especially dairy and vanilla which have spiked significantly this year. And we have some currency driven inflation on products imported in the UK, so some transaction effects. And both of those are particularly pointed in our UK; in our EU\/AU business this year. As we look at Q4, we expect to see some improvement, we're going to get some price mix improvement, I mentioned that Old El Paso and H\u00e4agen-Dazs will lead the growth and those are both higher margin lines. We do see moderating input cost in EU\/AU, a little bit different than here in the U.S. as they lap some of the initial spikes in the dairy and vanilla costs from a year ago.","We're going to see increased cost savings, I mean one of the manufacturing consolidation projects that we've had underway was in EU\/AU and we're still in the first year seeing those saving, so those will increase. It will be partially offset with some higher media and advertising expense to support that top line but we expect to see improvement in the fourth quarter. And as I mentioned that actually, frankly, a lot of the same factors in terms of transaction FX -- maybe more unique factor [ph] because Brazil is lower volumes as well. And so as we look at Q4, we're going to see improvement because we're going to get better price mix, we'll need better volume performance in Brazil as we come out of any ERP installation and the COGS headwinds will lessen a bit.","So that's in the quarter but I think your question's a broader one as well; and I think it is a good one. As we look at those two segments; we're very pleased over the long run with our top line, we've been very competitive and actually market leading in both of those areas over the longer term at our topline growth, and we have been investing in those businesses to maintain that growth or drive that growth. And I think we have the opportunities we go forward to better balance the top line growth in the margin performance, and so as we build our FY19 plan and beyond, that's soon to be something that we have in mind in both of those regions.","Alexia Howard","And then on the leverage?","Donal Mulligan","On the leverage, it may go up a tick because of the lower profit. I think we've got at 4.2%, 4.3% it moves, it'll be by 0.1%.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Akshay Jagdale with Jefferies. Please proceed.","Akshay Jagdale","I wanted to sort of unpack the profit equation a little bit and I need your help in understanding what you think is transitory versus structural, right? So you've got an issue with the commodity cost spiking and I think what I see is different from years past is; these costs that have gone up aren't hedgeable; so the visibility on them is inherently lower, so the reaction time I guess has to be faster. So in the months to come and the quarters to come, you'll have to show that your brand is strong enough to pass that on, so that will have to play itself out but what I'm more concerned about and the questions we get is, you're having this really nice performance and improvement on the sales side, how much visibility do you have on the incremental profitability from these new products and the sales growth that you're seeing?","Is this -- are these inherently lower profitable products or how are you thinking about that because you've had some issues with the visibility, I wonder if this sales growth is coming at any cost -- is it a competitive issue? I'm just trying to better understand that because it has major implications going forward. Thank you.","Donal Mulligan","We obviously look at all of our new products in terms of their incrementality both from the top and the bottom line. We as a great example where we're generating more out of per cup basis on our base product even though the margin percentage themselves are not materially different but you have a higher price point. So what we're seeing this year is our new product volume is performing very well, as Jeff showed almost 50% better than a year ago. And because we do those externally and because we're seeing also the need to from a co-packer standpoint and within our logistics network, more miles as we reposition product to meet consumer demands, we're having additional cost accrued to those businesses. It's not naturally because of the new product economics, i.e. as we bring those in-house, as we structurally change our logistics network, the margins on those products are going to be very competitive with our current business but it's a matter of getting the structure right and as Jeff alluded to, that's one of the projects that we have underway to enhance our entire cost structure and that will accrue to the benefit of many of these new products that are driving the higher volume.","Jeffrey Harmening","I will put a final point on that, I think it's a good question actually but you know, I want to reiterate; one of our top line performers, particularly North America retail and C&F in Europe Australia and even Asia, I couldn't be more pleased with the way that we have been able to pivot and grow our top line and the economics behind that and there have been a lot of questions about that and the environment and did we buy a volume; I just want to unquivaocably say, I love the way they were executing, our sales and our marketing teams are executing well together, our marketing campaigns are better, our new products are together; so I'm displeased with our profit performance in the third quarter and the fact that we didn't see some of this coming as much as we should have but I am really pleased with what the organization has done about returning to growth.","You asked about the cost, I would say that I think from a logistics standpoint, I mean I think it is more structural. We have a tight [ph] labor supply, we have new regulations that started in December which will fully become operational in April, and we are hitting a moving target but I think our logistics costs are structural, I don't think that they are going to go down. And what we're seeing on the commodity side is certainly going up and that abs and flows overtime; I'm not sure that is structural as much as in this point in time but I think the logistics costs are which is one of the reasons why we need to have some net price realization, why we feel like we can because everyone is feeling it in the industry, our competitors are feeling it, we're feeling it, our customers are feeling it; and so as we look for net price realization, I think that part is structural.","Akshay Jagdale","And any implications from everything you are facing in your base business on how you think about integrating Blue Buffalo?","Jeffrey Harmening","No, I'm glad you asked about that. First of all, I think about -- Blue Buffalo, I think of a transition rather than integration. I mean it's going to be -- Blue Buffalo is going to be a separate operating segment, and so they'll be some integration and the synergies we have accounted for actually quite low relative to other deals that we have done and so it will operate relatively independently and we'll help them on the sales side where we can, we will help them on the supply chain cost but I can tell you even over the last month since we've announced the deal and gotten their leadership team, they've got a very strong leadership team. And I think their strong leadership team not only has a vision but the rest of the team combined with our capabilities; I will tell you that even in the month since we announced the acquisition we feel more confident than we have even before about our ability to execute against Blue Buffalo well.","Jeffrey Harmening","Unfortunately, I think we're past time, I know there's still a lot of questions out there; so please don't hesitate to give me a call later today. Thanks for everyone for joining us this morning and have a good rest of your day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today.

During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday, December 18, 2013.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Kris Wenker, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Kris Wenker","Thanks, operator. Good morning, everybody. I am here with Ken Powell, our CEO; Don Mulligan, our CFO; and Ian Friendly, Chief Operating Officer for our U.S. Retail segment, and I will turn the call over to them in just a minute. First, I am going to cover my usual housekeeping items.","Our press release on second quarter results was issued over the wire services earlier this morning. It's also posted on the web if you need a copy and you can find slides on our website that supplement this morning's presentation.","Our remarks will include forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions and the second slide lists factors that could cause our future results to be different than our current estimates.","With that, I will turn you over to my colleagues, starting with Don.","Don Mulligan","Thanks, Kris. Good morning and happy holidays to everyone. Thank you for joining us today. This year's second quarter did not include the weaker thanksgiving, while last year's results included the holiday. You will see some impact that timing shift in our reported results which are summarized on Slide 4.","Net sales totaled $4.9 billion, essentially flat to last year. We have now anniversaried the additions of Yoki and Yoplait Canada last year, so these results largely reflect base business performance.","Segment operating profit totaled $920 million. This is 4% below year ago results. They grew 10%. In addition to this tough comparison higher input costs were headwind in the quarter.","Net earnings totaled $550 million and diluted earnings per share were $0.84 as reported, up 2% from last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, which excludes certain items affecting comparability declined 3% to $0.83 per share. Last year's adjusted diluted EPS grew a robust 13%.","Slide 5 shows the components of our second quarter net sales growth. Pound volume essentially matched year ago levels despite the Thanksgiving shift and has slowed down seen across the food and beverage industry in developed markets during the second quarter. Sales mix and net price realization added one point of sales growth and foreign exchange reduced net sales by one percentage point.","Slide 6 shows second quarter net sales results by segment. The U.S. retail net sales declined 1% overall with gains in our Snacks, Small Planet Foods and Big G divisions offset by declines in our remaining divisions. Excluding the impact of the Thanksgiving holiday shift, we estimate U.S. retail net sales would have been roughly flat.","International segment sales grew 2% as reported and 5% on a constant currency basis. Results for the quarter were particularly strong in Latin America and Canada fueled by year-over-year growth for our Yoki and Yoplait businesses. Net sales for our Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment were down 2% in the quarter reflecting price declines on index priced items.","Slide seven shows the second quarter gross margin excluding mark-to-market effects, declined 100 basis points. This is primarily due to higher input costs and unfavorable mix. We are continuing to estimate a 3% supply chain inflation for the full year. Second half inflation is expected to be lower than the first half. At the end of the second quarter we were roughly 70% covered on our commodity needs for the full fiscal year.","Slide eight shows our second quarter profit growth by operating segment. U.S. retail profit declined 6% driven by higher inflation and in comparison to strong year-ago profit that grew 9%. International profit increased 10% despite unfavorable foreign exchange rates and a fraud-related asset loss of approximately $12 million in the quarter. Convenience Stores and Foodservice profit was down 12% from year ago profits that grew 24%. Second quarter after-tax earnings from joint ventures totaled $26 million on a reported basis.","On a constant currency basis, after tax JV earnings were down $4 million driven by increased consumer marketing investments by CPW. Constant currency net sales for CPW increased 2% with growth in Asia and Latin America partially offset by category weakness in Europe. Constant currency net sales for H\u00e4agen-Dazs Japan grew 11% led by Core mini-cup growth and strong new product performance including the launch of our new Crunchy Crunch stick bars.","Slide ten summarizes other key income statement items for the second quarter. Corporate unallocated expenses excluding mark-to-market effects declined $9 million in the quarter. Second quarter interest expense decreased $7 million driven by a shift in mix of debt that lowered our average interest rate. During the quarter, we issued a \u20ac500 million bond, our first non-U.S. dollar-denominated bond in over 25 years. As we analyze our current debt mix and future requirements, we now expect full year interest expense to be slightly lower than 2013 levels.","The effective tax rate for the quarter was 33.3% as reported. Excluding items affecting comparability, the tax rate was 33.2% compared to 32.8% a year ago. We are still estimating our full-year underlying tax rate will be comparable to last year's rate of 32.4%.","Turning to the balance sheet. Slide 11 shows the components of core working capital. In the second quarter, our core working capital declined 7% versus a year ago driven by an increase in our accounts payable balance, and we continue to see positive results from our inventory reduction efforts.","Slide 12 summarizes our financial performance through the first half of the fiscal year. Net sales grew 4% to more than $9 billion. Pound volume contributed 4 points of growth. Net price realization and mix added 1 point, and foreign exchange reduced sales growth by 1 point in the first half. Segment operating profit was essentially flat to last year at over $1.7 billion, reflecting input cost inflation, foreign exchange headwinds, and a difficult comparison to last year's 8% growth. Additionally, media spending for the first half increased 2%.","Net earnings attributable to General Mills totaled just over $1 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.54. Excluding items affecting comparability, our adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $1.53, up 1% from a year ago.","The next three slides provide more detail on our first half net sales by segment. Starting with our U.S. retail segment on slide 13. In total, net sales for U.S. retail increased 1% in the first half led by our Snacks, Small Planet Foods, Big G cereals, and baking divisions. Sales for Convenience Stores and Foodservice segment declined 1% in the first six months of the year. Remember, that's consistent with our expectations for this segment in 2014. We continue to focus on product mix in this business with good results. Net sales of our priorities platforms including snacks, cereal, yogurt, and frozen breakfast are up 6% in the first half.","Slide 15 summarizes our international net sales results on a constant currency basis through the first half. Sales grew 13% overall led by Canada, where constant currency sales increased 11%, including incremental contributions from Yoplait during the first quarter.","In Latin America, sales grew nearly 75%, including three incremental months from Yoki in the first quarter, but we also saw excellent growth from Yoki in the second quarter and double-digit growth from our other businesses in the region.","Sales for the Europe region declined 2%, reflecting the tough operating environment there. In constant currency, sales in Asia-Pacific region increased 8% led by double-digit growth in China.","Let's now turn to cash flow results. On slide 16, you can see that cash flow from operations exceeded $1 billion through the first half. This was down from last year largely due to change in trade promotion accruals and the timing of payments to vendors. Even so, we anticipate operating cash flow will grow at a low-single digit rate for the full year.","Capital expenditures totaled $269 million through six months, roughly comparable to last year and we are leveraging our robust cash flow to increase our cash returns to shareholders this year. Through the first half, we paid $490 million in dividends, reflecting a 15% increase per share that went into effect in August. This was our 115th consecutive year of dividend payment without reduction or interruption.","We also repurchased approximately 18 million shares of common stock this year for a total of $864 million. Average diluted earnings per share outstanding for the first half were 2% from the prior year.","Our outlook for the second half of fiscal 2014 is summarized on slide 17. We expect low-single digit net sales growth driven in part by an excellent slate of new products that Ian and Ken will discuss shortly.","We are not expecting the softness across the food and bev industry and Q2 will improve in the second half of the year, and we expect foreign exchange will continue to dampen net sales growth in the second half, but we are seeing good growth in our December shipments due in part to the Thanksgiving holiday shift.","We anticipate mid-to-high single-digit growth in segment operating profit in the second half helped by lower levels of input cost inflation and easier comparison than we had in the first half. Our second half forecast includes an assumption of continued foreign exchange headwinds.","We have also considered possible currency devaluation in Venezuela, when modeling second half. We are forecasting double-digit growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second half with the strongest growth coming in the fourth quarter.","For the full year, we still expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.87 to $2.90, although devaluation of the Venezuela bolivar could likely put us at the low end of that range.","With that, I will turn the microphone over to Ian.","Ian Friendly","Thanks, Don, and good morning everyone. I appreciate the opportunity to give you an update on our U.S. Retail segment. As we look across the 25 categories where we compete, trends mirror the broader U.S. food and beverage industry, growth has slowed a bit.","Slide 19 shows you that for these categories, unit volume is essentially comparable to last year and pricing is up modestly. This is a challenging environment, but it is an improvement from 2012 when sharp commodity inflation resulted in above-average food price increases across the grocery store. We believe today\u2019s more stable in-store environment allows product news and consumer marketing to be effective.","In U.S. Cereal, category sales remained soft. Although we did see some improvement in the latest month, we have led growth in this category for several years and we have gained shares through the first half of fiscal 2014. We plan to drive growth in the second half with continuing product news and innovation.","We brought protein to the cereal aisle in June with Nature Valley Protein Granola. It had 10 grams of protein per serving. That's more than twice the cereal category average. Performance on these cereals is exceeding expectations, and we will add a cranberry almond flavor next month. In total, this line is expected to generate more than $30 million in year one sales.","We have more innovation coming in January. We are launching two varieties of Fiber One protein cereal. They provide the unique combination of 10 grams of protein and 20% of the daily value of fiber per serving and they taste great.","New chocolate toast crunch extends our Cinnamon Toast Crunch franchise, which posted 4% retail sales growth through the first half. We are introducing a dark chocolate version of multigrain Cheerios with 14 grams of wholegrain per serving and our newest Cascadian Farm organic cereals as Graham Crunch. We expect our cereal business to show continued sales growth in the second half of this year. We are supporting our cereals with strong levels of consumer directed marketing and advertising including traditional TV, digital media, and Hispanic focused advertising, and for the first time in 18 years, General Mills will be on the air during the Super Bowl with a spot for Cheerios.","In Yogurt, our retail sales in Neilson measured outlets has been improving. Through the first half, retail sales are within 2% of last year's and we expect our sales momentum to improve in the second half of the fiscal year as distribution on Yoplait Greek products continues to build and we launch a variety of new items. Greek yogurt is still leading category growth. We launched Yoplait Greek blended yogurt last quarter and they are off to a good start. We will add several new flavors to this line next month.","Yoplait Greek 100 reduced calorie yogurt launched roughly 18 months ago, gained nearly 4 points of share in the Greek segment through the first half. We are extending this line with new apple pie and strawberry cheesecake flavors. Retail sales growth for our Yoplait Greek products in total continues to outpace the Greek segment. We are also expanding distribution on these lines and increasing our unit churns as you can see on slide 25.","Our Core cup business trends are improving. Base unit sales on Yoplait original turned positive in the second quarter, driven in part by increased levels of advertising. This includes our Swap a Snack campaign, reminding consumers that yogurt can be a great tasting and better for you snack option.","We have been posting good distribution growth on Libert\u00e9 yogurt and we have plenty of headspace to grow this brand across the U.S. Next month we will add new flavors to our Greek and Mediterranean offerings and we are updating our packaging getting the brand fresh contemporary look. Fueled by our innovation and marketing plans, we continue to expect renewed sales growth for our U.S. yogurt business in fiscal 2014.","In snacks, we continue to lead growth in the $3 billion grain snacks category. Over the past five years we have added almost 10 points of market share and we are up nearly four more share point through the first half of this fiscal year with retail sales up 11%. With retail sales up 11%. The driver of this strong performance is terrific product innovation, with items like Fiber One lemon bars and Nature Valley soft baked oatmeal squares and Greek yogurt protein bars, all launched in the first half of the year.","We plan to keep this momentum going with more innovation in the second half. Fiber One grain snacks are growing at a 14% pace so far this year, building on double-digit growth over the past couple of years. Next month, we will introduce Fiber One meal bars. These great tasting bars contain 10 grams of protein and 9 grams of fiber. We think they will appeal to weight conscious consumers looking for a quick and nutritious meal replacement.","Nature Valley grain snacks also are growing at a double-digit pace. Next month, we are launching breakfast biscuits shown on slide 30. With at least 26 grams of wholegrain per serving, they offer long-lasting energy to get through that midmorning slump. If your taste runs for savory snacks, you will like our new Green Giant sweet potato fries and cheddar veggie puffs, extending this line of better for you snacks. We are adding popcorn for Chex Mix giving consumers a lighter snacking alternative, and we will introduce Fiber One all family fruit snacks with just 70 calories per serving.","We have been adding some great natural and organic items to our snacking portfolio too, driving double-digit retail sales growth across traditional and natural and organic channels combined. In January, we will introduce new flavors of our successful Uber fruit and nut bars. We are bringing some zesty flavors to food should taste good chips with guacamole and falafel varieties and Cascadian Farms is launching protein granola bars. We expect these new items will contribute to continued good growth for our Small Planet Foods division.","Growth of the $2 billion dinner mix category has paused in recent months and we have given up share through the first half. Our Helper mixes compete in the add to meat segment of this big category. And in this segment, Helper is gaining dollar share driven by new Chicken Helper and Ultimate Helper varieties launched this past summer. In the second half, we will introduce new flavors of Ultimate Chicken Helper and we are kicking it up a notch with a line of new bold helpers in firehouse chili crispy buffalo chicken and chipotle chicken and enchilada flavors.","Ready-to-serve soup is another convenient meal option in our Progresso brand continues to lead growth to this category. Our dollar share is up more than half a point year-to-date, our new varieties of performing well including a line of Tetra Pak, Artisan Soups currently available on the East Coast. We are building our leading position in the Mexican food aisle. Sales and market share Old El Paso are up, led by new stand n' stuff soft tortillas.","In the second quarter, we launched Old El Paso in the freezer case and early results for these multi-serve frozen entr\u00e9es are positive. Finally, baking season is in full swing and we have got a solid marketing initiatives going on our Pillsbury dough and Betty Crocker dessert mixes.","Year-to-date, through the first week of December, we posted share gains on our refrigerated dough business and we had strong levels of advertising and in-store merchandising lined up the rest of the holiday season, so we like the outlook for this business.","Across all of U.S. retail, we will launch more than 50 new products in the back half of the year. That's on top of the more than 100 items launched in the first half, but it's not just quantity it's quality that matters and we think we have a strong lineup of product innovation that will contribute good growth for U.S. retail in 2014.","We are supporting our new and established products with strong levels of consumer marketing. Through the first half, our advertising spending is up 1%, in line with sales growth. Across our key categories, our share of voice continues to exceed our share of category sales.","We are also leveraging the strong capabilities of our dedicated U.S. sales force. We believe this team gives us a competitive advantage in the marketplace and our retail partners seem to agree. In the latest Kantar PoweRanking survey, we were recognized by retailers as one of the top suppliers in CPG industry overall and we received the top ranking for Best sales force and best supply chain management.","We also continue to benefit from holistic margin management initiatives. For example, through our practice of conducting in-depth reviews after major product launch, we identified ways to optimize production of Nature Valley Protein bars that reduced ingredient waste and still delivered the 10 grams of protein per bar. It's disciplines like this that will that will help our segment operating profit grow faster than sales.","In summary, our U.S. retail businesses continue to face the challenging operating environment, but we believe our categories and our leading brands are well positioned for growth. We have some great product innovation in the marketplace now with more coming in the second half. We are supporting our brands with strong levels of advertising and consumer-directed marketing.","With the year half complete, we remain on track to achieve our goals of low single-digit sales growth in fiscal 2014, with segment operating profit growing faster than sales.","Thank you for your time this morning. I will now pass it over to Ken.","Ken Powell","Okay. Well, Thanks, Ian, and good morning to all of you. Ian just described the product innovation and marketing efforts we have underway in U.S. retail. Let me give you an update on our other two segments, starting with the Convenience Stores and Foodservice.","Through the first half, pound volume and net sales for our C Stores and Foodservice segment declined 1%. Segment operating profit declined 3%, reflecting a difficult comparison against last year's first half, when operating profit increased 18%.","As you can see on Slide 43, our Foodservice business has been posting good operating profit growth over the past several years. We expect to generate operating profit growth and margin again in 2014 as we continue to focus on our higher margin priority business platforms. This includes Snacks, where net sales are growing at a 3% pace through the first half driven by strong performance in convenient stores.","We have been expanding distribution of our salty snacks in this channel, and next month we will introduce new Chex chips into the flavors like wasabi and cheddar jalapeno. Our good performance in this channel was recognized in the advantage groups most recent annual ranking of consumer products sales teams in convenient stores, we moved up to the number four position overall.","Net sales for yogurt are up 13% in Foodservice outlets on good performance from Yoplait Greek products and Parfait Pro yogurt. We will be introducing ParfaitPro Max, a larger sized version of this convenient way for Foodservice operators to make yogurt parfaits. Our frozen breakfast products are performing well in Foodservice channels with net sales growing by double digits through the first half. We have some great new innovation coming with Old El Paso Fold 'N Go breakfast tortillas. These individually wrapped heat and serve filled tortillas will be available in K-12 schools.","We continue to focus on the fastest growing channels in the Foodservice industry. On slide 45, you see that for calendar 2014 industry sources project food and beverage sales in convenience stores will grow at a mid single-digit pace. In education channels, school breakfast and lunch programs are projected to drive 2% growth next year, while colleges and universities are expected to grow even faster. In the healthcare industry, including hospitals and senior living facilities should post around 5% nominal growth next year. So we believe we are well positioned with the right products in the right channels to continue good growth for our Foodservice business.","Turning to our international segment. First half net sales were up 10% as reported and segment operating profit grew 5%. The slower rate of profit growth reflects our change of business mix along with inflation and foreign exchange headwinds. On a constant currency basis, first half operating profit would be up by double-digits. Let me give you a few regional highlights.","As Don showed you earlier, first half constant currency net sales grew 11% in Canada driven by good performance on the Yoplait and Libert\u00e9 yogurt. We lapped our acquisition of Yoplait in the first quarter and since then retail sales for Yoplait and Libert\u00e9 combined increased 8%, while the category grew 2%. In the second half, we will bring news to the category as we expand our recent launch of Yopa! Greek yogurt with several new flavors. We will have new flavors of reduced calorie source Greek yogurt too and Yoplait will be joining in on our partnership with the Canadian Olympic team in February with on-package, in-store and digital promotions.","Food and beverage trends in Western Europe are soft right now. Our first half constant currency sales decline reflects that environment but we have bright spots, including growth on Yoplait yogurt and H\u00e4agen-Dazs shops in France and Old El Paso Mexican products in the UK. We are bringing some good innovation to our categories across Europe. In France we recently launched a beverage version of Calin yogurt which promotes bone strength. In the UK, Libert\u00e9 Greek yogurt recently hit the dairy case. We will introduce new flavors of H\u00e4agen-Dazs ice cream including champagne truffle pints and chocolate caramel cones in shops.","First half net sales in China grew by double digits on a constant currency basis led by H\u00e4agen-Dazs ice cream with sales up 12%. Changing regulations on public sector gifting did have an impact on our H\u00e4agen-Dazs Mooncake business during the mid-autumn festival season, but we were able to offset that with good growth on our retail products and in our shops, where sales grew at a high single-digit rate through the first half. We remain on track to open 70 new shops in China in 2014.","Net sales for Wanchai Ferry grew 13% through the first half. We had some good product innovation particularly a line of mushroom dumplings from the Yunnan plateau and we recently launched a Tanyuan variety with a colorful filling and a translucent wrapper, just in time for Chinese New Year. In total we remain on track to deliver double-digit sales growth in China in 2014.","In Brazil we celebrated the one-year anniversary of our Yoki acquisition. We like the growth we are seeing in our categories and our Yoki brands are outpacing category growth. We are launching new flavors of many Core products including popcorn, soups and regional variations of our market-leading Farofa side dishes. We see great prospects for future growth in the Latin America region.","So for our international segment in total, we expect to post high single digit constant currency sales growth for fiscal 2014 with operating profit growing faster than sales. Let me also say a word about cereal partners worldwide. Through the first half of the year, constant currency net sales grew 1%. As you can see on Slide 51, global cereal category sales are still growing overall with strong increases in Latin America and Asia, softness in Central Europe and U.K. and the declines in Southwest Europe.","CPW is seeing softness in Southwest Europe too, but we posted good net sales growth through the first half of the year in U.K. and we have strong growth in many emerging markets, including Russia, Brazil and Indonesia. Our performance is driven by good growth on many of our established brands and we are bringing news to the category with product innovation, including new fitness fiber, a food-filled cereal we recently launched in select markets.","To summarize our comments today, the second quarter was a difficult comparison to strong prior year results for our businesses. In addition, the period included the highest quarterly input cost inflation we expect to see this fiscal year and food and beverage industry sales in U.S. and other developed markets slowed a bit during the quarter. Even so, our bottom-line results through the first half of the year are broadly consistent with our plans.","As we enter the second half of fiscal 2014, we expect our earnings growth to accelerate from first half levels. We like our 2014 innovation and marketing plans, which include a strong slate of new items being introduced in the second half of the year. We expect our rate of the input cost inflation to ease in the second half and last year's gross was weighted towards the first half making our second half comparisons easier.","For fiscal 2014 in total, our plans call for another year of healthy growth with increased cash returns to our shareholders.","That concludes our prepared remarks. I will now ask the operator to open the line and the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets","Good morning, guys. Can you hear me okay.","Don Mulligan","Yeah, you are loud and clear David, good morning.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets","Good morning. Just a quick question first on the different segments. Snacking and baking seems to have to been a good area of growth for the company. We wonder if that momentum can continue into the second half of the fiscal year. It sounds like you had some more innovation on the Snacking side, but baking in particular, do you see that momentum continuing?","Then secondly on the breakfast-oriented category, that is an area that one would hope for improvement. It sounds like you have some innovation there, but we didn\u2019t get a lot of specifics on cereal. Are you prepared to talk a little bit about what exactly is going on there on the breakfast side in terms of innovation into the second half? Thanks.","Ian Friendly","Good. David, this is Ian. I think we see and continue to see extremely strong momentum on all our snacking businesses, and I don't see anything that is going to change that, and when I look at our innovation lineup for the back half, and that division has our highest percent of volume coming from innovation, it is a very innovation-driven category. I am really quite excited about the prospects for that business, I think it's strong.","Our baking businesses are not quite as vibrant and high growth as Snacking, but they are well positioned and again we have a very good momentum. There was a little bit of a seasonal shift this year in terms of when Thanksgiving fell, so that will show up more for those businesses in our Q3, but we really like -- the millennial seem to be back into being bakers, and so we think that's good for our future on that business as well.","As it relates to your question about the breakfast-oriented categories or specifically cereal, I shared with you some of the innovation that we have coming, we think we have a very strong back half. We are gaining share in cereal, but we\u2019ve got to also stimulate some category growth in cereal and that's going to come from what Jim Murphy said to all of you on the last call.","It's going to come from brand news on the core renovation on the base business, and I am really excited about what we will be having in the future on that, and I mentioned the Super Bowl event, which we \u2013 it is not just an advertising idea, it's surrounded by as all of you know a lot of social media. It is surrounded by a lot of promotions and work with our customers. It is going to be a big event for us. Then we have to bring good innovation to the marketplace, and I think these, particularly what we are seeing great success on, is these ones that bring protein as people are looking for a lot of competitive set outside the breakfast cereal categories bringing this fullness benefit or protein benefit to consumers.","People like it in cereals too, and so as we added that to Nature Valley and we will be adding that to Fiber One and that \u2013 that while it is not selling, it sung into our customers in a very strong way. We think those are the kinds of things that are going to get people back to the category and consuming cereals just a bit more often. As we talk to consumers, they love the cereal category. No one is rejecting cereal. It's just we are losing maybe that one extra morning a week where they are consumer something else, and so if we can give them that alternative, we can get them back.","David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks Ian.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Hi. Thank you. I think this question is going to be for Ian, but when I look at Yoplait sales, your shipments for the first half imply that second-quarter shipments were actually down versus year ago, and I think they were flat in the first quarter. So can you help me understand why would shipments be down in second quarter when it looks like your retail sales are getting less bad? Then also could you delve a little bit into why the pace of distribution on blended yogurt has been a little slow? Thanks.","Ian Friendly","Yes. Thanks, Rob. Sometimes, in any given category in a given quarter, the specifics of shipment and movement can move around. In our yogurt category, they tend to over time move very much in sequence. So I think what you will see in movement and shipments will be pretty similar. As it relates to the question on distribution on the new Yoplait Greek blended, what we saw in our second quarter, which is when we launched it, is different reset times by different customers, and some of them really aren't until January. So as we bring some of our new items, we will also be seeing our Yoplait blended come out in formats. So I think you will see that even through the data that will come out in December and into January continue to grow as we catch up with different customers\u2019 timing on shelf resets.","Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse","Okay. I will pass it on. Thanks.","Kris Wenker","Yes, and just to clarify, reported net sales for Yoplait would be down 1% for both the second quarter and the first six months.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein","Good morning, everyone.","Ken Powell","Hi, Alexia.","Ian Friendly","Hi, Alexia.","Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein","Can I ask about the pace of innovation between the first half and the second half? I seem to remember last quarter you talked about benefits from new product launches in many of the U.S. retail segments. So are we expecting to see an acceleration in the pace of innovation in the back half and which segments will that be focused in? Thank you.","Ian Friendly","Hi, Alexia. This is Ian. I will comment on U.S retail and then perhaps Ken or Don want to comment on the other segments, but for us in our first half, the amount of volume that we were getting from innovation was quite a bit higher than the prior year, and the prior year was quite strong too, and I will tell you that those products that were launched will carryover. They were of a stronger character than the prior year, and the amount that I spoke about in my remarks that we are launching here in the second half is also quite a bit stronger than the prior year, so this should be a very good year for us in innovation overall in U.S. retail. I really like our new product lineup.","Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein","Okay.","Ken Powell","So the only thing I would add to that, Alexia, are maybe underscores. We have a very high focus on innovation, quality, and percent of volume from innovation across the company. As Ian said, that's increased sequentially over the last three or four years, and typically the first quarter for us is the bigger period where we launch typically 100 plus. We have been strengthening the third quarter. We have got some very good launches coming here in January. Outside the U.S., I would say expansion of Greek is an important opportunity for us, so we continue to perform very well in the Greek segment in Canada with both, Libert\u00e9 brand and Yoplait varieties of Greek yogurt and those are performing well, and we have recently launched a Libert\u00e9 Greek, and as you know we like that Libert\u00e9 brand. We have launched that into the U.K. where we think there is going to be a significant Greek yogurt opportunity just as there has been in the U.S., and so we are well-positioned there with European capacity and lots of capability, so that Greek opportunity we believe is going to exist in many markets around the world and we are positioned to capitalize on it.","Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein","Great. One quick follow-up. Are you seeing any impact of the reduction in the snack food spending program?","Ian Friendly","We haven't yet, Alexia, but I think you have heard from many of our competitors in the food space, and we would echo what they say. It's, there's going to be something there. It will be a headwind when it happens, and so it will be a one-time headwind and then we will move past it and as we like to remind all of you this is food and people are going to keep eating and so we will find a way through those reductions.","Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein","Great. Thank you very much. I will pass it on.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley","Hi. Good morning.","Don Mulligan","Hi, Matthew.","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley","Don, just two financial modeling questions. One, can you talk a bit more about the discrete drivers of the decline in adjusted gross margin year-on-year and whether there was any impact from inventory timing or other factors besides just pure inflation in mix, and given the first half pressure, is it still realistic to think about seeing flattish or slight gross margin expansion for the full year?","Don Mulligan","Sure. In the second quarter, as I mentioned in remarks, we saw our highest - what we expect to be highest inflation of the year and that was the major driver. We also did see some segment mix negative in the quarter, so those were the two primary factors and the segment mix essentially has affected international, which had slightly lower gross margin than our U.S. business, grew faster.","In terms of the full year, we expect inflation to decelerate as the year goes on, and if you recall last year fourth quarter in F'13 was actually our highest inflation quarter of that year, so we expect that to help our gross margin in the second half, particularly in the fourth quarter. The mix issue will continue to be a bit of a headwind, so as we look at the year now, we are seeing our gross margins for the full year being more flattish to last year and I think that's a safe modeling assumption.","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thanks, Don. Just with respect to interest expense, obviously, some favorability on a sequential basis there as a result of the refinancing. Is it fair to assume that sort of $69 million, $70 million level as a good run rate to think about going forward?","Don Mulligan","We expect to see interest expense tick up versus last year in the back half, because we are going to term out some additional commercial paper. We have some maturities later in calendar 2014, so our plan to be term out of our CP. We do still expect it. I mentioned in my comments for interest expense now to be below last year, only slightly, so as you think about the back half it's probably going to be a tick up actually on a year-over-year basis.","Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Great. All right. Thank you, everyone.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Diane Geissler with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Diane Geissler - CLSA","Good morning.","Don Mulligan","Good morning, Diane.","Diane Geissler - CLSA","I wanted to ask about your comments regarding gift [team] in China and its impact on your H\u00e4agen-Dazs business. Is there any way to quantify that? Then how many stores you have opened? I think you said you were opening 70 this year, but could you just give me a ballpark on how many you have in China right now?","Don Mulligan","I am looking wildly at my peers to have someone remind me of how many stores we have. It's around 300 right now across China. Mostly concentrated, Diane, on the East Coast in the Tier-1 cities although we are expanding our store count pretty rapidly as I said we will open 70 this year, primarily more in Tier-2 cities.","The same-store sales growth for H\u00e4agen-Dazs shops in China continues to the robust. We got a quite strong high single-digit, so we are very encouraged by that performance and we have a growing retail sales through traditional grocers for H\u00e4agen-Dazs and we also have a nice Foodservice business for H\u00e4agen-Dazs across China. So the fundamentals of that business are quite good. The Mooncake festival sales, these are online or phone-in orders or people asking us to prepare gifts that they could give family and friends. It is something that this is an area that is just coming under more scrutiny from a government policy standpoint in China.","So there has been stronger guidelines on officials buying and distributing those gifts and that's had an impact on our sales. I think we are going to be down mid-single digits of this year. So it's a headwind but not something that we think we will be able to overcome as the full year unfolds.","Diane Geissler - CLSA","Okay. Great, and then just a follow-up on the international piece. I think, Don, you mention that you had a fraud related asset loss. Could you provide a little bit of color on that?","Don Mulligan","Yes. But only just a little. We had a $12 million fraud related asset loss in our international supply chain. It involved an outside party. Because the investigation is ongoing, we don't really have a lot of additional information to add at this time.","Diane Geissler - CLSA","Do you feel like you have reserved, obviously probably, adequately for that but is the investigation at, is there potential for further loss? If you move any further, you get any investigation or do you think you captured it all?","Don Mulligan","We believe that we have adequate reserve for our exposure.","Diane Geissler - CLSA","Okay. All right. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets","Hi, good morning to everyone.","Ken Powell","Good morning, Ken.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets","For the last four years, General Mills has generated EPS growth a little bit below your long term growth algorithm. Look, I understand the challenges across the industry but I guess what I am trying to figure out is what steps can you take to actually reinvigorate it and do you feel like there is a confidence level that you can actually reestablish it?","And just as a side part to this, have you been more challenged to deploy capital in marketing or acquisitions or CapEx to get to that higher historical rate of return?","Don Mulligan","Ken, let me start and then if Ken and Ian want to add. Let me just be clear on our projections for the year. We gave a pretty specific guidance of what we expect for the second half. We are not waiting on industry trends to improve but given the very compelling new product lineup that Ian overviewed and similar one in international and continued strong brand support, we expect to see sales growth tick up a bit in the second half and that combined with the easing inflation that I mentioned, continued cost controls, share repurchase, a little favorable tax phasing for the year, we expect second half to see mid to high single-digit operating profit growth and high double-digit EPS growth.","But for the full year, what I want to make clear is on a constant currency basis, we still expect to be very much on model. Sales will grow low single-digit, operating profit mid single-digit and EPS high single-digits. Now where we land specifically will depend on ForEx and based on today's trends and if there is a devaluation there as well, it will take up the two points off that off where our planned growth was going into the year. So I just want to make sure that the underlying business is performing generally in line with what we expected in a more difficult environment.","The other thing I want to be clear on is that we don't intend to cut good marketing and merchandising programs or any business building activities because of this ForEx trade. So we are going to continue to deliver against those. And as far as cash flow, as I mentioned, we expect operating cash flow and free cash flow to grow over last year because working capital will reverse and be a cash contributor for the full year. So our plans to increase our cash return to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase remain fully on track.","So I just don't want people to get diverted by the ForEx that we are seeing and focus that the underlying business is performing generally in line with what we expected for the year in a tougher environment.","Ken Powell","So what I would add to that, Ken, is our approach remains very much the same. We are very focused on developing solid topline growth, on model performance and we do that with new product innovation and as we have already talked earlier in the call, we have a very high focus on that and we like our trends there. We like the quality of new items and the quantity that we have introduced over the last several years. We have an increasing focus and emphasis in that area inside the company. Core brand renovation continues to be, and brand building continues to be very critical to us. As Don said, we are committed to high levels of the consumer brand building to drive those core brands.","International expansion, of course, continues to be an opportunity for us, so the whole top-line focused innovation brand building nexus is crucial for us, but I would also want to just remind you that margin expansion continues to be a very, very high focus for us. We didn't talked about HMM a whole lot on this call, but that continues to be a very important focus for us across the company. We have more opportunities to engage there internationally at Yoki which we just acquired and that focus on HMM frees up resources for us to invest in points that you made in your question in the innovation and renovation, it leads to grow, so we are very focused on the fundamentals that will drive our brands and our categories.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets","So, it's fair to say that 2015 should be, again, at least in line with your long-term growth target?","Ken Powell","Absolutely. That's our focus, that is our model and we will be very, very intently focused on delivering another on-model performance in F'15. Now, obviously, we will have a lot more to say about the characteristics of that year when we see you in June, inflation, all the outlook, those kinds of things, but we think that the developed markets are going to continue to improve here. It's challenging right now, but they will get better and we are sure, we will see more opportunities as we get closer to the next year.","Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets","Great. I appreciate it. Thank you.","Ken Powell","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Ken Goldman - JPMorgan","Hi. Good morning, everyone. 20 years ago, like many packaged food companies, you were diversified into retail. Now this has changed. Most food companies don't have anything meaningful in retail. The one notable exception is General Mills with the H\u00e4agen-Dazs stores. It's obviously a great business, but I am just curious if it wouldn't be even more valuable under the umbrella of a company that maybe focuses more retail as a core competence, so I do appreciate the synergy there that you get. I am hoping you can talk a bit about whether you considered divesting the business just to retail side that I am sure there is high demand for given that it's not necessarily your core competent any more.","Ken Powell","Well, Ken, let me just maybe make a few comments. It is that retail is an important part of the H\u00e4agen-Dazs marketing model. We do have shops in a number of countries around the world in Western Europe that we have of course as you have seen are now well developed shop network in China.","I will tell you that we have developed the high, but very focused capability in that area. We really know how those shops work. We know a lot about what real estate works for them, we know very well how to train and operate those shops and that's a centralized capability for us that we apply around the world, so we have gotten very good at that.","As you highlighted that sharp visibility in shop network and the innovation that we offer to those shops are a key part of the brand development model for H\u00e4agen-Dazs, so we look at it very much as an asset, very much as a kind of a capability that enhances the image of the brand and there is no question that the shops have helped us build out the equity in multiple markets around the world, where we just open over the last year-and-a-half as an example, about a dozen shops in India, and that is providing the basis for brand visibility, brand recognition for future retail sales, so I understand your point, but I guess what I would say is, this is a very focused initiative for us. We have been doing it for many years, we are very good at it and it is a critical part and as you know it's kind of an outstanding part of the marketing mix for that whole of H\u00e4agen-Dazs brand experience.","Ian Friendly","I just had a couple point just emphasize Ken's point is that, when we own the shops and run them are largely in the markets where we are still building the brand and we don't want to outsource that to anybody. That said, if you look across our entire network, more shops are franchised than owned, so we do see an opportunity from a capital allocation standpoint to have partners help build the brand. Typically once we get to a point, where retail sales are larger than the shop sales, it opens up the avenue for franchising.","Ken Goldman - JPMorgan","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Hi, good morning, everybody.","Ken Powell","Hi there, Eric.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","So I guess, Ken, my question is really more from a industry statesman perspective, as I have really been surprised, and I guess a bit disappointed, in the senior management's inability to really quantify why volumes across the industry are so weak. Restaurant sales are weak. Private label has been losing share. So it's not like the consumer has been rolling over. So what do you think is going on out there? Are the retailers capturing more consumers with their prepared fresh items because it's a bit disconcerting when so many categories across the store are down?","Ken Powell","So, Eric, thanks for the question. I will give you my thoughts. I think part of it is just income stagnation in developed markets around the world. I mean you basically have flat or even slightly down incomes in a number of countries in Western Europe. In the U.S., we have had the payroll tax hit. We have had very visible political debates around budgets. I think that worry consumers. We talked a little bit about SNAP. So I think that you have a reality of slow or no income growth in developed markets but I think as you see the economy shows some signs of growth in the U.S. anyway, what's benefiting right now at this stage in the cycle is other things.","So consumers are buying cars and they are improving their houses and maybe they are buying a few more homes. So, there are certain sectors that are developing at this early stage but for personal or for consumer products, as you have noted, the categories are slower growth right now. We are going to move past that stage. We are going to have population growth. It will continue to have population growth in the U.S. There are many good opportunities for us to find growth out there.","We talked a little bit about snacks or Ian commented on snacking behaviors. Yogurt continues to be a great opportunity. So we are going to find those opportunities. We think income is going to continue to develop for consumers in western markets and as that happens we will see a little more growth and we are going to be ready to capitalize on that with good categories and brands and with the right kind of innovation but right now I just think that income growth or income is a factor for consumers and what disposable income they have, they are spending in other areas.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Okay, and then, if I could also just follow-up, I think last quarter I asked you about pricing coming down at Walmart and you were very clear that you had just been there and said, no, we are not seeing that at all but when I look at some of the comments of your peers, many of them have talked about more aggressive promotion, price discounts in the market. How do you see that trend developing? Did your promotion pick up in the quarter and maybe wasn't offset to the fact that advertising was down? Maybe you could expand on that?","Ken Powell","Yes. Well so Eric, I will let Ian jump in here as well. Look I would just say that generally we are seeing price stability across our categories and where there are differences, I think we were down in some, our promotion was up a little bit in some categories. First that is solely because our promotion was lighter in the first half of last year. So you get into year-over-year comp issues but over the course of the year, for us we expect our promotion to be very balanced and very consistent and we are not really seeing any promotional trends out there that worry us.","Okay, you see quarter-to-quarter variability, but I would not overly focus on that. So we are seeing stability there and frankly our focus really, as I have said is, we are looking for baseline and quality top line opportunities for growth which is always going to be about renovation, innovation. That's really our focus here. We don't see worrying things in the merchandizing environment in general.","As for private label, hard to comment. They are down. They are down a little bit. They are down more in some areas. I think one aspect of private label is even that we have had more moderate inflation this past year, you have look back over the last five years, we have had quite significant inflation and may have less room to work with, and I think if you study the gap, the price gap between private label and brands over the last five years, you will see that that has gradually closed some and I think that that is kind of a reality for the private label business right now.","Ian Friendly","Eric, this is Ian. I would just say that promotional environment, again, in any given category can heat up or slow down, but overall we are not seeing any major changes in trend in the promotional environment.","Our consumer support levels are roughly in the U.S. segment in line with the sales in year ago, so we are not using funds there to fund promotional environment and roughly I don't see competitors doing much of that either, so there was no doubt in industry-wide slowdown in our Q2 across the food category, but I wouldn't say that that is promotionally led.","Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank","Okay. All right. Best to you and your families for the holidays. Thanks.","Ian Friendly","Yes. You too, Eric. Thanks a lot.","Kris Wenker","Operator, can we sneak one last one in here?","Operator","Certainly. Our last question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please go ahead.","Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus","Thank you for making [time] there.","Ian Friendly","Hi, Chris.","Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus","I guess, I had two questions for you and I think both are kind of directed towards Ian. The first was to understand in the U.S. retail division, I think you just spoke about promotional spending overall that price mix line has been positive and you had a very strong performance in Q1. I want to understand, I assume, I believe that's a mix improvement that is occurring within the business. Is that new product driven? Is that a sustainable level of mix improvement occurring that we saw here in Q2 for the remainder of the year?","Ian Friendly","Our new products often times are positive in that regard, but there is also some fundamental shift, a very big part of our portfolio on both, the unit and dollar basis is the yogurt category and if you look at what a cup of Greek yogurt costs relative to a cup of $0.60 Yoplait on average yogurt, it's a huge mix change within the category, so for every cup of Greek we sell it's not quite twice the price of a regular cup but getting there, so that I don't see changing actually a whole lot going forward in our business.","In some of the other categories that really it can get down to the ebbs and flows of which products are selling at the time. For example, fairly instrumental in some of our businesses this year was canned vegetables and sometimes we sell them harder in the first half; sometimes we sell them harder in the second half and so that will weigh into mix as well.","Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay. Then second question was in relation to Yoplait, and just to understand the dynamic that's been going on in the category and where General Mills stands today, particularly, where Yoplait stands around shelf space for the base the non-Greek business? Then, we have seen some collapsing of the price gap between Greek and conventional, if you will, I am just curious if that has any effect as well on sort of the non-Greek business?","Ian Friendly","Yes. We are seeing improvement, but not all the way to bright yet on, obviously, on the core businesses. As I mentioned in my remarks, we are starting to see growth again in Yoplait Original, the stuff that's in the red cup, the business that's still being impacted by the Greek trend, significantly as our Yoplait Light and we have some news planned on that, but a lot of people are switching to Greek are diet managers and they are in a good way I suppose, they are buying our Yoplait Greek 100, but it's affected our original, so we still see some impact on that business but we are starting to see distribution get the rate of reduction, let's say, not as significant and so we think that that business will stabilize.","Your comment on the pricing on Greek, it has come down a little bit, it's maybe 5% in across the category over the year. I would say that was somewhat expected, we had talked about it in the past, we knew by virtually everyone in the industry that there was a fair amount of capacity coming on stream and that's about what we would have thought. I think Greek had coming to on average somewhere between $1 and $1.10 is probably where it will rest.","I will remind everyone that while we talk about deflation overall, the dairy markets have been highly inflationary, up significant double-digits and that Greek yogurt uses three times the amount of dairy or milk than a regular yogurt. So there's a bit of a governor in there in terms of a very high cost of goods impact from dairy markets. So I don't think we are going to see too much more as it relates to Greek pricing coming down but we like where it's at.","I think it does help us, as you have asked, a little bit to make sure that the value of our Core business looks good and continuously the slab that you will see, the yogurt market is up 9%. That's for a category of the size of yogurt to get 9% is truly significant and that's being driven by Greek trends and that consumers are finding benefits in the category and there will be a lot of innovation coming out of the category in this next year and I think it's going to continue to be a very, very strong category.","Chris Growe - Stifel Nicolaus","Okay, well, thank you, and thanks for the perspective on that and Happy Holidays.","Kris Wenker","Thanks, everybody. I know there are still people in queue. Give me a call and we will try and help you out.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines. Have a good day, everyone."],"9822":["General Mills (NYSE:GIS) Q2 2013 Earnings Call December 19, 2012  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Kristen Smith Wenker - Vice President of Investor Relations","Donal Leo Mulligan - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President","Ian R.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded Wednesday, December 19, 2012.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Kris Wenker, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Kristen Smith Wenker","Thanks, operator. Good morning, everybody. So it's a week before Christmas, and our numbers are good. More on that in a moment. But first, if I could, I want to make sure you've gone to our website. We put slides there that shed some additional light on the progress we've made through the 6 months to date. Our release is there, too. If you found them, that's great.","We do plan to make comments on the future today. Slide 2 lists risk factors that could get in our way. Let me now turn you over to Don, Ian and Ken. I wish the happiest of holidays to you, your family and friends.","Donal Leo Mulligan","Thanks, Kris. Good morning, everybody. I'll second those holiday greetings, but I will keep my remarks to prose today. Thank you for joining us.","As you see on Slide 4, our second quarter results are summarized there. Net sales grew 6% to nearly $4.9 billion. New businesses, particularly Yoki in Brazil and Yoplait Canada, contributed 4 points of net sales growth in the quarter. Segment operating profit grew faster than sales, up 10%, reflecting a higher gross margin and a 3% decrease in advertising and media expense in the period.","All 3 of our business segments posted operating profit gains. Net earnings totaled $542 million, and diluted earnings per share were $0.82 as reported. Excluding certain items affecting comparability, our adjusted diluted EPS would be $0.86, up 13% from last year's second quarter.","Slide 5 shows the components of our net sales growth. Pound volume contributed 7 percentage points of growth in the quarter. That's primarily the addition of Yoki and Yoplait Canada. Sales mix and net price realizations subtracted 1 point of sales growth. Foreign exchange had no impact on sales growth for the company in total.","Slide 6 shows net sales growth by segment. For U.S. retail, pound volume and net sales grew 2% in the quarter. This performance was led by our Snacks, Small Planet Foods and Meals divisions. Net sales of our Bakeries and Foodservice business declined 1% with pound volume down 2% due to lower bakery flour sales. These sales declines on index-priced items offset gains on cereal, snacks and frozen breakfast items.","International segment net sales rose 19% as reported and 22% on a constant currency basis with good growth across all 4 geographic regions. While these results do include contributions from Yoki and Yoplait Canada, our established businesses also performed well. Excluding new businesses and foreign exchange, international sales increased 4% in the quarter.","Our gross margin improved 120 basis points in the second quarter as reported. This includes the impact of mark-to-market valuation for certain grain inventories and commodity hedges we'll use in future periods. Slide 7 also shows that excluding these effects, underlying gross margin improved 20 basis points, primarily due to lower levels of input cost inflation, HMM and good plant operating performance.","We expect our input cost inflation rate to tick up in the second half, reflecting the impact of this summer's drought. So we expect to be at the high end of our 2% to 3% inflation estimate for the full year, and we're now roughly 90% covered on our commodity needs for fiscal 2013.","Slide 8 shows second quarter profit growth by operating segment. U.S. retail posted a 9% increase, driven primarily by lower input cost inflation and consumer marketing expenses below year-ago levels. International profit increased 4% in the quarter. This includes an expense of $17 million associated with the transition of the Yoplait yogurt license in Canada. Remember that this investment was built into our fiscal 2013 guidance. Excluding this expense, international operating profit would have increased 17% in the quarter. And Bakeries and Foodservice profit grew 24%, reflecting lower wheat costs year-over-year, favorable mix and increased grain merchandising earnings.","Earnings from joint ventures increased 14% in the second quarter to $33 million after tax. On a constant-currency basis, CPW sales increased 3%, with strong performance in the emerging markets partially offset by category softness in southwestern Europe. Constant currency sales for H\u00e4agen-Dazs Japan grew 5%, led by new products.","Completing our review of the income statement, corporate unallocated expenses excluding mark-to-market effects were $79 million. That's above last year's second quarter, primarily due to increased pension expense. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 32.6% as reported. Excluding items affecting comparability, the effective tax rate was 32.8% compared to 33.7% a year ago. This primarily reflects the timing of expense -- of tax expense for the year. We're still estimating our full year underlying tax rate at about 33%.","Turning to the balance sheet. Slide 11 shows that core working capital increased 8% in the quarter. The majority of the increase is the addition of Yoki. Excluding the impact of Yoki, core working capital grew modestly in the quarter at a rate less than sales growth. Through first half, cash flow from operations exceeded $1.3 billion, a 14% increase over last year. Capital expenditures totaled $264 million through the first half, generally matching year-ago levels. We expect full year capital spending to be comparable to last year as well.","We're returning more cash to shareholders this year. Through the first half, we\u2019ve paid $434 million in dividends. That's up 9% over last year, reflecting our dividend increase. We also repurchased approximately 12 million shares of common stock for a total of $479 million. That's more than twice the value of share repurchases in last year's first half. In the second quarter, average diluted shares outstanding decreased by approximately 1 million shares. And for the full year, we continue to target a net reduction in average diluted shares outstanding.","Slide 13 summarizes our financial performance through the first half of the fiscal year. Net sales grew 5%. Segment operating profit grew faster than sales, up 8%. Net earnings attributable to General Mills totaled more than $1 billion, and diluted earnings per share were $1.64. Excluding items affecting comparability, our adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.52, up 8% from a year ago. These first half results are ahead of consensus expectations and a bit ahead of our plans, too. This good start puts us firmly on track to achieve our key financial targets for fiscal 2013.","For the full year, we expect to deliver mid-single digit growth in net sales, including growth for our established businesses and contributions from new businesses. We expect operating profit to grow at a mid-single digit rate, too. We now expect input cost inflation of 3% for the year, including some impact from this summer's drought in the second half. We're also anticipating possible currency devaluation in Venezuela. Including these factors, we're raising our EPS guidance a bit to a range of $2.65 to $2.67 per share. That's on an adjusted basis, excluding certain items affecting comparability.","With that, I'll turn the microphone over to Ian Friendly. Ian?","Ian R. Friendly","Thanks, Don, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate the chance to give you an update on our U.S. Retail segment. Our top line trends improved in the second quarter. Pound volume stabilized in September and October and increased at a mid-single digit rate in November.","Net sales for the quarter increased 2%. The acquisition of Food Should Taste Good, combined with solid established business performance, drove double-digit growth in our Small Planet Foods division. Sales for our Snacks division also increased at a double-digit rate, led by strong product innovation. Progresso soup and sauces paced growth in our Meals division. Sales for our Frozen Foods division matched year-ago levels, while Baking and Big G divisions sales declined modestly. And while U.S. yogurt sales declined, clearly the rate of decline is moderating. I'll provide you with more details on that in a few minutes.","As shown on Slide 17, our second quarter U.S. retail performance reflected good sequential improvement. Volume, net sales and segment operating profit performance all improved versus the first quarter. We've got a number of great initiatives in the market right now, with more planned for the back half of the year. I'll highlight a few examples, starting with some of our seasonal favorites. The holidays are in full swing, and we're helping consumers bake up some favorite treats.","On our refrigerated dough business, our Let The Making Begin campaign is designed to inspire consumers. Response has been terrific. Baseline sales have increased for both Pillsbury crescent rolls and biscuits since we launched this campaign in October, and we added over 0.5 points of market share in November.  And Betty Crocker is back with her red hot holiday trends. Tips for making a perfect 18-layer velvet cake, hidden-surprise cookies and many other recipes are available online at bettycrocker.com. This campaign helped drive over 1 full point of desserts market share growth in November.","Soup season is underway, too, and Progresso sales are growing. Our new line of recipe-starter sauces is off to a good start. However, the primary driver of our year-to-date performance is our core ready-to-serve soup business. We've added points of distribution, and we've increased investment behind our taste-focused advertising. In total, first half Progresso retail sales increased 7%, and we added 1.5 points of market share in the ready-to-serve segment, including 0.5 share points in the second quarter.","Progresso has some great marketing and merchandising events planned for the second half of the year. We're partnering with both Weight Watchers and The Biggest Loser TV show to help consumers shed those extra holiday pounds. Our plans include strong advertising and in-store merchandising, as well as product placement in an upcoming Biggest Loser episode.","With the holidays here, consumers are making party mix snacks with our Chex cereals. This year, we're sharing recipes for the microwave, so these snacks are ready in just minutes. We're supporting this annual campaign with a strong combination of digital media and in-store merchandising. And on top of this party mix activity, Chex gluten-free positioning continues to drive growth. In total, first half retail sales for the Chex franchise rose 14%.","We've got a strong second half innovation lineup for our cereal business. I'll start with Cheerios, the largest franchise in the U.S. cereal category with a 13% share of total category sales. Honey Nut Cheerios is the single largest brand in the cereal aisle. We're expanding it in January with the launch of a Medley Crunch variety. This new cereal has the heart health benefits and great taste consumers expect from Honey Nut Cheerios. It also has that great texture with O\u2019s, clusters and flakes. We think this is a terrific addition to the Cheerios franchise.","Slide 22 highlights our Cascadian Farm organic cereals. First half retail sales for this line increased 13%. Cascadian Farm is the #1 granola brand in America, organic or otherwise. The ancient grains variety we launched in June is off to a good start. And next month, we're adding a berry cobbler variety. We're adding new variety in some of our other popular cereal brands, too. Fiber One 80 Calorie chocolate cereal offers consumers 35% of the adult daily value of fiber and great chocolate taste at just 80 calories per serving. And new Peanut Butter Toast Crunch builds on the success of our Cinnamon Toast Crunch franchise.","Now I'm sure you noticed that our first half cereal net sales and market share were below year-ago levels. Other players in the category had more merchandising activity in the first half of the year. We've got more merchandising planned for the second half, including introductory support for our new items. With a great lineup of new products and strong levels of marketing support behind new and established brands, we remain very excited about our U.S. cereal business, and we expect sales growth for Big G in the second half of this year.","Turning to the yogurt aisle. We are encouraged by recent trends on our Greek business. Yoplait Greek 100-calorie yogurt was launched in August. Distribution is ramping up nicely, and all 6 SKUs are turning in the top third of the total yogurt category. Our marketing campaign and dedicated advertising are now in market and on air, and we are pleased with the initial results. In fact, Yoplait's share in each of the most recent 2 months was 9% of Greek segment sales. It is still early days for U.S. Greek yogurt, and we expect to earn our fair share of this market segment over time.","At the same time we're gaining share in Greek, we continue to see signs of stabilization for Yoplait Original and Yoplait Light yogurt, what we call our core cup business. Remember that we improved these products, and our merchandise price points are now better aligned with competitive levels. As shown on Slide 26, we're seeing a nice improvement in core cup unit volume turns as a result.","We've also launched innovative new items. Fruplait has 2 times the fruit of original Yoplait, while Simplait is made of just 6 all-natural ingredients. We have more new products coming in the second half to keep this momentum going. We're launching new flavors of Yoplait Greek 100. New Yoplait Pro-Force brings a combination of higher protein and great taste to the kids segment, and we're bringing new level of fun to the leading brand in the kids segment with Go-GURT's Twisted.","Our second half plans also include regional expansion of Libert\u00e9 Mediterranean, an indulging yogurt with higher fat content, and the addition of Libert\u00e9 Greek. We'll support both product lines with a combination of digital and billboard advertising along with product sampling efforts. So we expect to see increasing momentum across our U.S. yogurt business in the second half of this year.","In grain snacks, we continue to lead category growth with great product innovation, and we plan to build on that record in the second half. Slide 28 highlights several examples. We'll be expanding our Fiber One franchise with the launch of Fiber One protein bars. They have at least 6 grams of protein per serving and 20% of the adult daily value for fiber at 140 calories or less per bar. We're adding new varieties to our Nature Valley and Cascadian Farm product lines. We're also launching Green Giant vegetable chips. These chips contain at least 16 grams of whole grain per serving. And with flavors like multigrain sweet potato and roasted vegetable zesty cheddar, they really taste terrific.","We continue to see strong performance by our natural and organic snacks. First half retail sales for L\u00c4RABAR, all-natural fruit and nut bars, increased at a double-digit pace. And we gained market share in the health and nutrition bars category.  In January, we're adding a cappuccino flavor to the L\u00c4RABAR lineup.","Our new Food Should Taste Good business is also doing great. We\u2019ve focused on expanding distributions for these great-tasting snacks. Fiscal year-to-date shipments are up double digits. By leveraging General Mills sales and supply chain, we expect continuing distribution gains for this business over the balance of the year.","Across our U.S. retail business, we have strong levels of marketing and in-store merchandising supporting our brands. As we have discussed with you before, our spending this year is weighted toward in-store merchandising. This promotional support is designed to drive awareness and trial for all of our new products, and we've sharpened our merchandise price points for certain product lines based on competitive merchandising levels in those categories. These actions are working for us.","Our U.S. advertising expense is below strong year-ago levels through the first half, and we now expect our media expense to be down for the year in total. This is due in part to this year's tactical shift on merchandising. It also reflects ongoing cost discipline, which helps us lower media expense while maintaining very competitive media pressure against the consumer. In fact, as we look at Cantor-measured media spending across our U.S. categories over the latest 12 months available, our tracked advertising dollars are up and at a rate well above the 1% growth in ad spending across our categories overall.","So our share of voice with the consumer has been growing. Across all of U.S. retail, we're launching over 100 new products in 2013, but it's not just quantity that matters. We're excited about the quality of our new product lineup. So we like our prospects for growth in U.S. retail over the balance of 2013.","With that, let me wrap up my overview of General Mills' U.S. retail business. We're encouraged by the recent trends we see in the operating environment. Across the U.S. food and beverage industry, volumes have improved as pricing has moderated. We have terrific product innovation in market, and we're supporting our brands with strong levels of in-store merchandising, advertising and other consumer-directed marketing. We're on track to meet our low-single digit sales growth target in 2013 and are continuing HMM initiatives and cost management discipline of protecting our margins. So we expect our operating profit to grow faster than sales for the year.","Thank you for your time this morning. I will now pass the microphone over to Ken.","Kendall J. Powell","Thanks, Ian, and good morning, everyone. You just heard Ian describe some of the product innovation and marketing efforts we have underway in U.S. retail. And I want to give you now an update on the other 2 segments, starting with Bakeries and Foodservice.","As you can see on Slide 34, net sales for this segment are down 2% through the first half. That's primarily due to negative price realization. We had lower bakery flour prices in the first half. However, first half operating profit is up 18%, driven by lower wheat costs in our cost of goods, favorable mix and grain merchandising earnings. This 18% profit growth builds on a strong track record of earnings growth for this segment.","Over the past 5 years, segment operating profit has grown at a 14% compound rate. Grain merchandising activities have played a part, but primarily, this growth reflects our strategy of focusing on the most profitable products in the fastest-growing foodservice channels, and we continue to follow this winning strategy in fiscal 2013.","For example, our sales to U.S. convenience stores are captured in this business segment. We have a great lineup of new snack products hitting C-store shelves, including Nature Valley protein bars, Gardetto's snack crackers and Betty Crocker dessert bites. We're launching Yoplait Greek 100 yogurt in a variety of foodservice outlets, and we recently introduced a Greek version of Yoplait ParfaitPro.","As you can see on Slide 36, this product gives foodservice operators an easy way to prepare layered yogurt parfaits. Sales for Yoplait ParfaitPro have been growing nicely, and the addition of a Greek variety will keep the momentum going. Sales for our frozen breakfast products are increasing at a double-digit pace, led by our line of Pillsbury breakfast items in school cafeterias. And we recently introduced a mini cinnamon roll in Burger King restaurants nationwide.","Turning to our international segment. First half net sales are up 22% as reported, including new businesses. Segment operating profit is up 24%, including a 3% increase in media spending. On a constant-currency basis, first half international sales are up 28%. We're posting good growth across all of our geographic regions.","Sales in Canada are up 21%, reflecting the addition of the Libert\u00e9 and Yoplait yogurt businesses. In Europe, sales grew 23% with good performance on the Yoplait, H\u00e4agen-Dazs and Nature Valley brands. In the Asia Pacific region, our business in China is showing 13% constant-currency sales growth. And in Latin America, sales have doubled year-to-date, reflecting the addition of Yoki.","So let me say a bit more about each of these regions. In Canada, we're excited about the growth opportunities for yogurt. Category sales are up 9% so far this fiscal year. Our Libert\u00e9 and Yoplait brands combined represent 1\/3 of this $1.4 billion market. We assumed the license for Yoplait in Canada in September. In the short term, we did experience some disruption in the business as the previous licensee transitioned to co-pack Yoplait while also launching their own yogurt product. Now that much of that disruption is behind us, we're launching our first innovation in the market with a 50-calorie Greek yogurt offering, the first of its kind in the Canadian market.","Libert\u00e9 yogurt continues to perform well. The brand now holds a 10% dollar share of the yogurt category, gaining nearly 2 points of share year-to-date, with retail sales up 35%. We'll invest behind both the Yoplait and Libert\u00e9 brands with increased advertising and new product introductions in the second half.","Our yogurt business in Europe is also performing well. In France, we have launched new varieties of Calin. This is a yogurt high in calcium, and we've introduced a Greek-style line extension. We've expanded these products to the U.K. market, too, and we're supporting both new and established yogurt products with higher levels of advertising. In total, our year-to-date retail sales in both markets have increased at a mid-single digit rate.","Also in Europe, we're seeing good growth on H\u00e4agen-Dazs. Year-to-date retail sales are up 15% on this business. Nature Valley snack bars are growing nicely, too. Retail sales are up 33% so far this year, and this includes the recent launch of Sweet & Nutty bars in the U.K. We see great opportunities to increase household penetration for our brands in Europe, and we continue to like our growth prospects in this region.","In China, we're on track to deliver another year of double-digit sales growth. Our H\u00e4agen-Dazs team just completed a terrific mooncake event. In total, net sales for H\u00e4agen-Dazs are up 20% through the first half of the year. Sales for Wanchai Ferry frozen foods are up 6% year-to-date. We\u2019re increasing distribution on existing products and expanding into high-growth segments like wonton, mantou and frozen noodles. While the overall Chinese economy may be slowing a bit, the demand for branded consumer food products continues to expand. For our business, we're seeing good growth in both existing and new cities.","In Latin America, the highlight is certainly our Yoki acquisition. Our new brands have strong positions in Brazil with the Kitano and Yoki brands in more than 70% of Brazilian households. We're posting double-digit sales growth in some of our largest categories, including popcorn, seasonings and side dishes.","Let me also say a quick word about our Cereal Partners Worldwide joint venture. Through the first half, constant currency net sales were up 2%. We're leveraging our large core brands like Chocapic and Cheerios, and we recently launched Chocolate Cheerios in the U.K. The cereal category is posting growth in markets around the world. While there is some category softness in southwestern Europe, sales in other established markets like the U.K. and Mexico are up. And the category is growing even faster in emerging markets in Latin America and Asia. CPW holds a 23% value share of the cereal category outside of North America, and we continue to like the growth prospects we see for this venture.","So with that, let me summarize today's update on fiscal 2013. We had a good second quarter and first half, fueled by strong operating profit gains across all 3 segments of our business. As we look ahead to the second half of the year, we've incorporated a bit more input cost inflation and an expectation of currency devaluation in Venezuela, and that's built into our outlook.","Our second half plans also include a very good slate of new product introductions and robust marketing and in-store merchandising plans designed to support both new and established products. And our full year EPS guidance is up a bit to a range of $2.65 to $2.67 for fiscal 2013.","Let me briefly shift from talking about the fiscal year to the calendar year. As we get ready to ring in calendar 2013, the operating environment and, more broadly, the global economic environment, present a great deal of uncertainty. But to be frank, 2012, the calendar year just ending, was no walk in the park either, and yet our brands and our business continued to grow.","As shown on Slide 46, over the last 4 quarters, our sales grew with contributions from established product lines and new businesses. Our sales outside the U.S. grew even faster, consistent with our strategy of expanding our business in developed and emerging international markets. Our operating profit increased 7% to exceed $3 billion, and our earnings per share grew, despite headwinds ranging from sharply higher input costs to low interest rates and the resulting impact on calculated pension expense.","Our operations generated more than $2.5 billion of cash over the past 4 quarters and a 23% increase from the prior year. Cash return to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases grew 21% to exceed $1.4 billion. And we generated an 11% total return to shareholders over this same time period. So as I've said before, in challenging times, it's good to be in the food business, and we're committed to generating another good year of growth for our business and to create value for our shareholders again in calendar 2013.","So that concludes our prepared remarks this morning. So operator, I will ask you to open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I'm sorry upfront I can't pose my question in a more creative poetic form, but I'll give this a shot. Just wanted to touch briefly on sort of the price mix outlook for U.S. retail as we go into the second half. Pricing was flat...","Kendall J. Powell","Could you repeat that, Andrew?","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Sure. I wanted to touch on price mix for U.S. retail in the second half. Pricing was flat in the second quarter, down sequentially from up 1 in the first quarter, I believe. And obviously, you're lapping some pricing, and you've got your increased focus on some key price points in certain categories that you've discussed. Would you anticipate price remaining flattish in this segment in the fiscal second half as you still have inflation to deal with? Or is there a concern or plan that price mix could turn even modestly deflationary, given the positive volume response you're seeing in response to your strategy?","Ian R. Friendly","Andrew, it's Ian. I think, over the entire portfolio, we'd expect it more to be relatively stable over the second half. There may be some select categories where it will be modestly down, primarily in categories where our merchandising efforts are more back-half loaded. But I think the general trend for us would be relatively flat.","Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. Okay. And your -- I mean it's hard to say, but your anticipation of kind of what you're seeing more broadly in the space around -- as the industry starts to lap some of the pricing, we're seeing volumes come back a bit, which is probably nice to see on a bunch of different fronts. But so far, would your anticipation be that the industry is still likely going to have some inflation, that there's a general sort of rational behavior, as best you can tell? I know it changes a lot by category.","Ian R. Friendly","Yes. What we're seeing still is, I think, over the entire category through December and what I expect in the second half as well is very modest but inflationary trends, both on the consumer prices as we see it so far. And also as you look at input prices, I think some of the impact of the drought will obviously weigh on all competitors' minds as we look at what can be done in the market. So I think stability to very, very modest inflation is probably a decent outlook.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Couple of questions. I guess, first one, lob this one in to Don. A number of your competitors have changed their pension accounting to mark-to-market, and that's been pretty materially beneficial to their reported earnings. I recognize it's not necessarily a cash item near term. But do you have any estimate on what if General Mills were to go to a mark-to-market approach, what that would do to your -- roughly, what that would do to your reported EPS?","Donal Leo Mulligan","Eric, I appreciate the questions. I don't have any figure for you on that regard. We are very satisfied with our pension accounting. We try to be very clear externally in terms of what is moving that expense number. And obviously, we make clear, as you alluded to, that it's a noncash number. And so we'll continue to provide that clarity, but we have no plans at this time to change our reporting practices.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then with the -- I guess, then to switch over to just Yoki for a second. With the devalue -- or with the Brazilian real depreciation and I guess maybe the expectation of Venezuela now devaluing that you've put in, are you -- I guess, how much of a drag -- between the Yoki dilution and then the deval, how much of a drag is that on earnings this fiscal year?","Donal Leo Mulligan","Well, let's separate the 2 because with Yoki, it would strictly be translation. And our total expectations for foreign exchange is, year-to-date, it\u2019s been relatively neutral on EPS, and we don't see that necessarily changing as the year unfolds for our total portfolio. Venezuela is a different issue. Because of the accounting treatment for a hyperinflationary country like Venezuela, there's a balance sheet implication as well. And so as we've seen consensus analyst estimates of what that devaluation will be --it's estimated in the range of 45 to 50 from the studies that -- 45% to 50% from the studies we've seen and that it\u2019s again expected to happen sometime in early calendar 2013, we've estimated the impact to us and factored that into our outlook, and it will be a couple of cents drag on our EPS this fiscal year.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And so no -- I don't know, maybe I missed this, but no change to what Yoki's dilution was initially expected?","Donal Leo Mulligan","No.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then last question, I'll pass it on. I guess, to Ian. You noted that the yogurt, I guess, retail sales were down 5, and yet you had a fair amount of positive commentary and slides that showed improvement. Is the difference between what I assume is better volume -- you took a price cut on core Yoplait. Is that why the dollar sales are down?","Ian R. Friendly","Indirectly, Eric. The thing that we restored was merchandising at our traditional price points on Yoplait. So it wasn't a price list reduction. But effectively, on our core cup business, it is getting our prices back in line with the competitive set. And so as you noted, that has an impact on the dollar side and a very positive impact on the unit side.","Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So a couple of points. Basically subtracting from promotion from the sales, but volume was -- was volume flat or up in yogurt? Could you say?","Ian R. Friendly","I could tell you it got progressively better in yogurt. And as I showed on the chart, our turns, which is net of distribution, our turns became nicely positive on our core cup business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi Research.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Wanted to ask a little bit more about U.S. volume trends. You guys have a lot of categories and a lot of insight into the U.S. grocery market. When you think about the year-ago period where we had such a warm winter on your -- and maybe the effect on the soup operation, are you seeing evidence that would suggest that we will continue to see a real positive trend line in terms of the progression of volumes maybe for the next couple of quarters, part of it being related to the year-ago winter, maybe another part of it simply related to how weak volumes were across U.S. grocery over the past maybe 5 or 6 quarters? So any thoughts there would be helpful.","Kendall J. Powell","David, it's Ken. So Ian says I get to start this one. But -- so it wasn't -- I mean, the weather last year was certainly or likely a factor for soup sales because we know that, that's a little bit weather-related. But by far, the dominant factor over last year was the pricing that we began to take early in the calendar year, which had all the effects that you're very well aware of. We had high inflation, we took very significant price increases, and that resulted in a volume impact across many of our categories. And so that was, I think, the big event of our last fiscal year. And as we adjust those prices tactically, as we said in the presentation, really to restore the gap where it needed to be restored, we're seeing those businesses respond as we thought that they would. We're seeing baselines strengthen, and we're getting the merchandising lift as well. So it's really more about the pricing and inflation dynamic of the last 2 years that is driving the fundamental trends in our categories.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Then just one follow-up on cereal. Can you comment on your strategies in terms of -- historically, I think General Mills has been very, very good at introducing cereals that really had high value to them. They really -- you\u2019re really not focused on competing at the low end of the market. And just given where some of your competitors have gone, is there any need for you to rethink that strategy, given the consumer environment, what your competitors are doing? Or do you still want to really put the new products out there that are margin-positive to the cereal franchise? Is that still the core of how we should think of General Mills?","Ian R. Friendly","I think our strategy hasn't been so much a high-priced one. It's been in the value-added area. But cereal overall represents such a good value to the consumer. I think it really gets down to, \"Are the benefits relevant?\" But again, if you look at the price point of our various Cheerios extensions, I think you'd see that they're very competitive within the category. So we don't look at that lens. I don't view that we need to be in ultra-discounted cereal products. But at all times, we're very cognizant of making sure our new cereals represent a good value and in line with the rest of the category. We're not really trying to stretch it up either.","David Driscoll - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I suppose, Ian, the only thing I know is that the average price of the General Mills cereal portfolio is the highest of the major cereal producers. So I always think of you as much more of a value-added cereal maker, and I\u2019m just trying to assess if there was any change in the strategy given the trends\u2026","Ian R. Friendly","Not really. I mean, that's always been true, and some of that has to do with -- historically, with portfolio makeup because we were in a bit light -- because a lot of our portfolio is Cheerios, which is based in puffed products, which those analyses tend to be done on a weight basis. And so in general, it's always shown us to be a bit more higher priced per ounce. But I would say that's a historical legacy, not anything we're trying to push one way or the other.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","So for Don, I guess, just a few questions or clarifications on the full year outlook. You mentioned mid-single digit sales growth for the full year, and when you've talked about that in the past, you've characterized it as being excluding Yoki and Yoplait Canada. Is that still intended to be a base business sales growth number or overall? And I guess, the second question would just be when we think about the favorability to numbers in the second quarter, can you give us any more granularity on perhaps what's the prize to the upside versus your original expectations? And given that you're not raising or expanding the range that much for the full year, what are some of the headwinds beyond Venezuela and inflation that we should take into account? Is it lower gross margin than perhaps we may be thinking of or just the phasing of marketing spend?","Donal Leo Mulligan","Sure. I'll touch on both of those, sales first. The sales guidance is all in. If you look at our trends year-to-date and then look at the balance of the year, we see our full year expectation at mid-single digits for total company sales. As far as our performance in the first half, as we mentioned, we did slightly outperform our plan. A few factors drove that.  Clearly, the international momentum that we've seen has been -- continues to be very robust. Our Bakeries and Foodservice business, particularly the mix of products and channels that we're selling, was favorable to our expectations. Across the company, we knew it was going to be a challenging year, and I think everybody has just kind of made sure, from an expense standpoint, we've managed that appropriately. That\u2019s had some benefit. And then interest rates and tax rates have played in our favor. Interest rates because of the market, tax rates because of some timing of discrete items that we have every year that we had baked into our full year forecast with some other favorable items hit earlier in the year that we had anticipated. So those are a number of factors that ended up accumulating to a favorable result in the first half. In the second half, we've noted a couple of things. One, inflation will be higher than our original expectations. That's backloaded because we had some hedge positions that covered us in the front half, but the drought costs from last summer we'll start seeing come through in the second half. So you'll see gross margin -- we'll see some gross margin pressure. Tax rates, again, we're -- we had -- from a phasing standpoint, we had some favorability in the first half that will normalize in the second half, and still, we\u2019ll get to our 33% tax rate for the full year. And then, as I mentioned, the devaluation of the bolivar, which is -- will be a couple of cent drag in the back half as well. So kind of take that all into consideration, that gives us confidence to increase our guidance by the -- increase the range up to plus $0.02 from our original guidance.","Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And just 2 really quick follow-ups. If the sales number is all in, does that imply that international is lower than your original expectations or that the acquisitions are less incremental? And then on the interest expense, is this quarter's number sort of a run rate going forward?","Donal Leo Mulligan","I wouldn't point to any one area. Certainly, our -- the new businesses that we're bringing in are coming in just as we planned, so I certainly wouldn't highlight those. It's a tough environment, and we\u2019ve set some -- we thought were reasonable sales plans. We're delivering largely against those. But we're -- it's a little bit short on the top line, but we're ensuring that the bottom line comes in. That's what I'd say about there. In terms of interest rates, we came to the year assuming that all in, they'd be up a bit. It is likely that it is -- on a full year basis, our interest expense will be down a little bit year-over-year. And again, that's attributable to both the timing of any long-term issue we do, as well as the marketplace rates.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Innovation. I wanted to talk quickly on innovation. You've brought a very large slate to the market recently, and you're highlighting some new items that are going to come in January, many of which look fairly compelling. I think in the past you've talk about innovation as a percentage of your sales on a rolling 3-year basis. Can you update us on where you stand for that metric now and how it's been trending recently?","Ian R. Friendly","Yes. This is Ian, Jason. As it relates to at least the U.S. portfolio, and I don't think it's too different for the company, but I'll let Ken comment on that, we target somewhere between, on an annual basis, 4.5% to 5%, so that's what we typically talk on an annual. But if you want to do 3 year, you could multiply that out. And we're right on track with that. In fact, our -- I would say our percent of business coming from new products has been pretty strong and robust for us, and so that is generally where we want to be. And Ken, I don't know if there's a statistic you want to quote for that.","Kendall J. Powell","No, no. 4% to 5% is what we target, and we think we'll be very much in that range, Jason. I mean, we're also very focused on -- another metric for us is incrementality. So we want to make sure that we're launching products that are bringing new consumers into their franchise, and we're -- we've steadily improved that number. Margin is another key metric for us, and we want to make sure that the business model is sound for all the new products that we're launching. And so we have very good metrics and discipline about the quality of the new products that we launched, and we're very much in the range. And as you said, we're pleased with what we launched in the first half. We like what we've got in the second half. We think the new cereals, Honey Nut Medley Crunch, we think, will be very good. The new Fiber One product we think is good. We're very happy that we're going to be bringing 2 more new flavors to Yoplait Greek 100. As you heard Ian mention, that is off to quite a nice start, and consumers love variety in the yogurt category. So we're getting back to them as quickly as we can, and so it offers them variety. It will also give us increased visibility and holding power at the shelf. So that becomes a virtuous cycle for us. So we're generally pleased with our new product performance so far this year and have -- we'll be continuing the momentum here as we go into the second half.","Jason English - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just to make sure I understand that metric, does that only account for the contribution from the current year initiatives? Or does it also account for the leakage from any erosion on last year's launches as you lap them?","Donal Leo Mulligan","It's really the launch -- it accounts for the launch within that year.","Kendall J. Powell","It also does account, Jason, for erosion, so it's a net impact, not the total impact.","Donal Leo Mulligan","Yes. It's an incremental number. And with erosion, if you wanted to accumulate it over a 3-year period, it would be in the low-double digits. It's going to be 4% to 5% a year, and if you do it over 3 years, it's going to be in that kind of 11%, 12% range.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I just had 2 questions for you. The first one, if I could ask maybe, of Ian, on the Yoplait business. I wanted to ask about -- you've really stabilized the market share, that's as we track it from IRI or Nielsen, and you certainly have some developments on core cup and good developments on Greek. So I wanted to ask if you expect your sequential market share to continue to grow, especially as more of these products go into the market. And then related to that, do you foresee Yoplait sales growing for the year in 2000 -- fiscal '13?","Ian R. Friendly","Yes. Well, thank you for that, and I suppose I should switch my data to IRI data because, at least from my standpoint, we haven't quite stabilized our share yet. But thank you for that. But it is getting -- what you said is quite true. It is getting sequentially better, and I expect it in the back half to continue to get sequentially better. It's a very volatile category. I think the jury is out. We'll have to look in May to see if -- for the year, how it all nets out. I would expect that every period in the back half gets better. As I shared in my remarks, our Greek business seems to be really gaining nice traction, and our core business is stabilizing well. So I'm guardedly optimistic around our share in the back half. But I think we're still kind of progressing from what had been a more challenging place. And the good...","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","If I could follow on -- I'm sorry.","Ian R. Friendly","Sorry, Chris. The other good thing that's important and hard to predict in some ways is all of this activity by us and competitors is a great stimulant for a very vibrant category growth. And so that will be the other variable in all of this is how quick the yogurt category grows, which I would expect should be pretty good.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just a quick follow-up for that, Ian, would be that would you expect the progress you're making in Greek with a lot of new products, as well as the progress in core cup, any one of those to be the bigger driver of your sequential share progress? Is one opportunity bigger than the other?","Ian R. Friendly","Well, in the case of core cup, I think it's more about stabilizing because that has been losing share as Greek came to the market. It had to come from something, and it came from the largest player, which was our core cup business. So stabilizing that, I think, prevents the minus, and I think the plus comes from the innovation, which is largely in the Greek category, although not entirely.","Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","All right, okay. And then quick follow-up, Don, for you. Can you say what inflation was year-to-date? Just to give a little perspective on the degree of inflation for the second half, we can kind of back into that then roughly. Is it possible to talk about that?","Donal Leo Mulligan","It would be a little bit below our full year projections in the first half, not tremendously below, but slightly below.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Rachel Nabatian","It's actually Rachel in for Rob. So my question is on the soup and cereal categories, which seem to have been more rational in recent months with innovation and less promotion. So what's your visibility on that into 2013? And do you think we've found new equilibrium here where there could be more category and volume growth?","Ian R. Friendly","Well, this is Ian. On -- let me separate those 2. We're delighted with the soup category. Our business is strong. We focused fairly hard on part of the category -- the growing part of the category, the ready-to-serve part of the category. And we do think it's pretty rational, and it's about providing consumers great-tasting products and benefits. And we do think it's fairly rational in how it's playing out, and we're seeing a lot of strength in our business. So very pleased with that part of the soup category. Cereal is also, I would say, largely rational. It was a bit more promotional in the first half in terms of frequency of promotion, but I wouldn't characterize it as irrational. And as I said earlier, I think given the cost structure of the grain complex from the drought last year, I think it will remain highly rational in the back half. And it is good to see, I think, the major competitors bringing good innovation to market and competing largely on that basis.","Rachel Nabatian","That's good to hear. And then just I have a follow-up. I was curious to hear your strategy on the Frozen Food category. It seems to have been challenging for competitors and then for frozen pizza in particular. So with that category, on one hand, there's frozen vegetables, which have more of a health and wellness aspect, and then there's frozen pizza, which has the benefit of targeting value seekers. So on which end of the spectrum would you say that you guys are planning to focus?","Ian R. Friendly","Well, I think in frozen, it's such a big area of activity. It's been a part that has been slower at retail this past year, to be fair, across frozen. But you really have to almost look at it segment by segment to talk about what's going on. And then I think you've characterized it reasonably well. For us, the vegetable part, it's a very big category, a bit lower growth, but the innovation, when it comes through, helps a lot, and it\u2019s very much on trend, which is a good thing. Other parts, pizza, we're the leading seller of -- in terms of volume of pizza in the category. We compete in just one part of it. And it's on the value side, which is kind of in sync with the times. And then we have other kind of very targeted things like frozen hot snacks, which we had a terrific first half on. And so that just got down to good items, good marketing that resonate with the consumer. I don't know if there's a category trend on it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with BMO.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Ian, I had a question just on the cereal category. When you look at like a Lucky Charms, not getting too particular, you put some advertising spending behind it. It looked like it moved very substantially on that. So I guess my question is how do you decide on which cereal brands to support? Because it seems like when you do support them, you actually get movement. And maybe if you supported it or got more advertising dollars behind it, there would be more brands that moved because Lucky Charms seem to be moving nicely with a little brand support.","Ian R. Friendly","Well, that is -- the cereal category has always been highly responsive to consumer marketing support and good ideas, as trite as that might sound. And that's kind of what we look at. We do a lot of upfront research. We do a lot of in-market experimentation and analysis, and we try and put our money behind our best ideas. And it's a brand-by-brand kind of activity. And you're quite right. I mean, we're seeing some very nice progress on a variety of our brands around great consumer ideas. And when we have them, we do put the pedal to the metal without a doubt.","Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","But is there room for you to put more advertising dollars behind more brands like almost -- not reactivate certain brands, but really -- because Lucky Charms is not a brand that had innovation as much but more -- it seems like it was more advertising behind it, and it seems like there might be opportunity to do with more brands. It's kind of...","Ian R. Friendly","We, in the past -- we, a few years ago, put advertising behind Multi Grain Cheerios after many years and saw that thing take off like a rocket. The Lucky Charms story has also got something to do with finding additional targets. So advertising a lot of these previously kid-targeted brands also to the adult consumption, which they have very high levels of adult consumption, is true on Lucky Charms, true on Cinnamon Toast. And so yes, I think there are certainly many opportunities to add consumer support in the cereal category on different brands behind good ideas.","Kendall J. Powell","So Ken, I'll just -- since several people have -- a few people have asked about strategy in the cereal category and differentiation. I mean, they're very good questions and we like them, and they go to the heart of what we're all about. We have a highly differentiated line of great brands, and they are -- we know that they're responsive to advertising and to good ideas, and that's why our strategy really is so focused on capitalizing on that innovation, strengthening it, figuring out fresh new ways to talk about it because, as you point out, there are many examples in the category, all the time, of brands that have had fresh messages, and they really respond. So you're on the right point, and that's what we're very focused on doing.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So just a couple of small follow-ups. On baking mixes, it's not a segment that we focus on very much, but this is obviously an important quarter for baking mixes with the holiday season. Could you maybe talk a little bit about what's going on in terms of price, volume and share dynamics there and what the outlook might be?","Ian R. Friendly","Yes. We -- our baking mix business is, so far, off to a really good start to the season. It is still, for parts of the portfolio, kind of midway in the season. And we had a really good November. I think you can see that in the data. And as I said in my prepared remarks around both our refrigerated dough business, it's been very responsive to the Let the Making Begin campaign, and our dry mix has also had a very good response to the marketing. So, so far, so good. We like what we're seeing, and it seems to be going well.","Alexia Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","And then as a quick follow-up on cereals. I've noticed a few articles about consumer concern about GMOs in, I guess, some of your larger brands. Is that having any major impact on cereal sales at the moment in your view?","Ian R. Friendly","We haven't seen anything really on the consumer side related to that.","Operator","And the last question will be taken from the line of Ed Aaron with RBC Capital Markets.","Edward Aaron - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","I wanted to ask on cereal, so I can understand why the year would be kind of more back-half weighted just given the cadence of your merchandising programs. But I think you said on the last quarter that Big G, you thought, would be up in Q2. Was there a surprise this quarter relative to your expectations? And if so, would you attribute that more to category weakness or to competitive activity?","Ian R. Friendly","Yes, I'd say there was a little bit of a surprise in our Q2, not a lot. We expected Q1 to be down, which we, I think, talked about at the beginning of the year. We thought more of our promotional plan would start showing up throughout Q2. It started showing up largely towards the end of Q2 and going here into December. And so we're seeing cereal, as I commented, sequentially pick up. But we didn't quite get all that we expected. And again, it had a lot to do with just higher levels of competitive -- certain competitive frequencies in that particular quarter. It will all, I think, come out in the year. Primarily some of that stuff was pushed into December and into the back half for us. So it will be a different flow than we anticipated, but I would anticipate that by year-end it will pretty much be where we thought.","Edward Aaron - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then my follow-up question on international. I think you mentioned that organic growth internationally was up 4%, which I think is maybe a little bit lower than where you'd been running. Do I have that right? And then if so, which businesses or markets might have contributed to some sequential slowing there?","Kendall J. Powell","I think it's a little bit behind.","Donal Leo Mulligan","Yes. The 4% that we reported in the quarter is not materially off where we were last year in the same mid-single digit range. But to the extent that there's any slowing, it's just on the margin.","Kristen Smith Wenker","Thanks, everybody. If there are still questions out there, please give me a call, and I'll try to get them answered for you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your line."]}}
