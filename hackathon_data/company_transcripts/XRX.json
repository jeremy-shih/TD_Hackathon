He is joined by Bill Osbourn, Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com\/investor. At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and\/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without the expressed permission of Xerox. After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.","During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which, by their nature, address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein.","At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Jacobson. Mr. Jacobson, you may begin.","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","Good morning, and welcome to Xerox's second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. During today's call, we will provide an update on the quarter as well as our expectations for full-year 2017. In the second quarter, we delivered earnings, operating margin and cash flow that were all in line with our expectations. Additionally, with the progress we are making on the roll out of our ConnectKey products, we are better positioned to capitalize on the strategic growth areas in the market. With two quarters behind us, we continue to be on track to deliver on our full-year commitments.","Let me walk you through an overview of our second quarter financial results. Second quarter GAAP EPS was $0.63 and adjusted EPS was $0.87, which reflects our one-for-four reverse stock split effective June 14, 2017. Revenue of $2.57 billion was down 8.1% year-over-year or 6.4% on a constant-currency basis, driven by equipment revenue. We had anticipated lighter second quarter equipment revenue given the timing of the new product launch, but it was softer-than-expected as we saw some delays transitioning to the new products.","This also affected our Managed Document Services business, where sales cycles are longer and all the Q2 declines were driven by the equipment shortfall. The transition to the new products impacted our overall revenue by about 1 point. We expect to see new equipment flowing through as we move through quarter three and building more strongly in the fourth quarter and into 2018.","Post sale revenue was 79% of total revenue and declined 5.7% with 3.9% at constant currency, consistent with the first quarter and in line with our expectations. We expect continued stable post sale revenue with improvements coming over time as equipment revenue improves and placements grow. Adjusted operating margin was 13.3%, an improvement of 40 basis points year-over-year. We continue to realize productivity benefits from our strategic transformation initiatives, which are helping maintain our strong margins, while offsetting 100 basis points of currency as well as our revenue decline.","Operating cash flow remained strong and was a solid $343 million in the quarter, driven by working capital initiatives as well as the fact that pension contributions are expected to be heaviest in the latter half of the year. We ended the quarter with a healthy cash balance of $1.25 billion. The second quarter was highlighted by the introduction of our new ConnectKey enabled portfolio, 29 AltaLink and VersaLink printers and multifunction devices. The launch of the new products has been a huge effort that has spanned the entire Xerox team, and I am extremely proud of what has been accomplished and what is yet to come. Most of these products are available now and the balance will be available in the third quarter.","On March 29, we kicked off a series of 16 launch events from New York City to London, Toronto to Milan. We were pleased to have host over 100 prospective channel partners along with 1,500 customers and prospects. We also use these events as an opportunity to demonstrate the extensive capabilities of the new portfolio to our direct and indirect sales resources and educate them on the new offerings.","Customer and partner feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. The capabilities of our new smart workplace assistance resonates, addressing the need for security, reliability, solutions, mobility and a simple user experience. The ability to use apps to simplify common processes and even build unique apps tailored to an individual customer's needs has extended the role of our technology in the workplace. The positive feedback is starting to translate into orders, from single devices going into an SMB to large contracts with enterprise customers.","Here are a few examples. A large U.S. energy company ordered more than 150 ConnectKey devices. A channel partner at Turkey signed a deal with a retail chain for 160 ConnectKey devices. A partner in the U.S. was selected to provide Managed Print Services to a school district with more than 1,800 devices, including 330 ConnectKey MFPs. And the last example, our government administrative department signed a three-year contract renewal and expansion worth over $15 million for Managed Print Service for over 9,000 devices, the majority of which are the recently launched ConnectKey devices. The increased functionality, the apps and the competitive cost has opened up new opportunities for us. We are capitalizing on the ConnectKey launch to amplify our channel expansion efforts.","In the second quarter, we increased our distribution capacity through acquisitions and channel partner signings. In May, Global Imaging acquired multi-brand office equipment dealer MT Business Technologies of Ohio. MT was the largest independent reseller of Ricoh products as well as a partner of HP. And as I mentioned, we hosted over 100 channel partner prospects at our launch events. We're over halfway to our full-year goal and have added over 30 independent multi-brand office equipment dealers on a global basis. We are equipping our channel partners with tools and training they need to create new and accelerated revenue streams and closer, more lasting relationships with their customers.","For example, we introduced two new marketing kits to help our partners generate awareness in local markets and drive demand for Xerox's broad technology portfolio, as well as their own complementary services, custom apps and deep expertise. Another way we are positioning partners for success is with the introduction of productivity packs for our ConnectKey multifunction printers. The productivity packs are prepackaged, high-value turnkey apps, designed to help channel partners capture revenue beyond hardware and supplies. Targeted industries such as education, health care and finance, the apps eliminate manual time-consuming and error prone tasks by converting paper-based processes into automated digital workflows.","In addition, we have just announced the Xerox MPS accreditation program in the U.S. This is a recognition program for a select group of our most strategic Xerox channel partners who have demonstrated the desire and capacity to substantially grow their MPS business. The program represents a significant investment by Xerox in the tools and training to help these high profile partners find new revenue streams, which is core to our SMB market strategy.","The press and industry analysts have taken notice and their feedback has been very positive; 400 articles have been written about the launch. There have been 20-plus product reviews, most focused on our entry-level A4 products. The reviews, including PC Magazine, ChannelPro Network, Buyers Lab and Better Buys have been overwhelmingly positive and will help drive awareness of our entry-level products.","We have also collected a series of industry awards for our new products. Our VersaLink B7000 series and AltaLink C8000 series were named by Better Buys as its Editor's Choice Award in the A3 black and white MFP and high-volume machines categories, respectively. In its annual Summer Pick Awards, Keypoint Intelligence, Buyers Lab recognized four Xerox printer and multifunction printer lines, including three from the ConnectKey portfolio based on their productivity-boosting capabilities.","We followed that up by winning their Buyers Lab PaceSetter Award in all three categories, MFP platform and apps ecosystem, document imaging security, and mobile print. While other vendors won some awards, we are the only vendor to sweep the awards and win in all three categories. And Quocirca again positioned Xerox as leader in worldwide Managed Print Services for the eighth consecutive year. As you heard in the customer wins I mentioned, the ConnectKey products are an integral part of our MPS solutions.","So all in all, we're pleased with the reaction to our new portfolio and the early successes we've had. Our sales teams and channel partners are now equipped with an outstanding set of products and solutions, and we expect to see a favorable impact on our revenue later this year and into next.","I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Bill Osbourn, to cover our financial results in more detail. Bill?","William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning everyone. I will start on slide 6 with an overview of our financial performance. Overall, I would characterize Q2 as demonstrating operational progress, realized expanding margins and cash flow with a mix story on sales, where we had a significant amount of foundation building revenue generation activities, but we have not yet seen the benefits come through in the top line.","Revenue in the quarter was down $226 million or 8.1% in actual currency, 6.4% at constant currency. We had anticipated, as stated during Q1 earnings, that Q2 revenues would be the weakest of the year, given product launch timing coupled with Q2 having the most challenging compare. That played out, driven by equipment revenue declines that were weak, given the significant product transition. Post sale revenue decline of 3.9% in constant currency was in line with the first quarter rates and our expectations.","Turning to the cost ratios, we continued to see good progress. Savings from our strategic transformation program during the quarter more than offset the impact of revenue declines and a negative transaction currency impact of 100 basis points or $27 million, resulting in adjusted operating margin expansion of 40 basis points. Within that, gross margin expanded 50 basis points. R&D as a percentage of revenue was flat and SG&A as a percentage of revenue was up 10 basis points as a result of the higher revenue declines.","As stated last quarter, within our definition of operating income is equity income, almost entirely related to Fuji Xerox, which was down year-over-year. I should note that equity income in Q2 did not include any out-of-period impact from the resolution of the Fuji Xerox accounting practices review. It was determined that our share of the final Fuji Xerox adjustment of approximately \u00a540 billion was approximately US$90 million, which was higher than the original estimate of $30 million and deemed to be material to our current year financial results. Accordingly, we will be revising prior period results, including Q1 when we booked the estimated $30 million charge for that matter. We have provided in our materials the revisions for the past three years.","Turning to the below the line items. Other expenses net of $34 million was $14 million better year-over-year, driven by lower interest expense. Tax rate of 27% was within our full-year range of 25% to 28% and was higher by 8.5% year-over-year, an approximate negative $0.09 impact year-over-year in the quarter to adjusted EPS. Overall, adjusted EPS of $0.87, which reflects the one-for-four reverse stock split was down $0.11 from the second quarter of 2016, driven by the higher tax rate and lower equity income as cost and expense declines including lower interest expense roughly offset the impact of lower revenues.","GAAP EPS was $0.63 in the quarter. The difference between GAAP and adjusted EPS includes our normal adjustments around restructuring and related costs, non-service retirement related costs and amortization of intangible assets.","Turning to the next slide, I will drill down more on revenue. Starting with total revenue. From a geographic sales channel perspective, North America was down 7.3% or 6.9% in constant currency and represents 60% of our revenues. International represented 35% of total revenues and was down 8.9% or 4.6% in constant currency, reflecting higher declines in Europe that were partially offset by growth in developing markets as we continue to see overall improvement in developing markets. The remaining 5% of our revenues are in other, with the largest piece over 50% being our OEM business.","As I highlighted earlier, the driver of the higher declines in the U.S. and Europe was equipment revenue as post sale revenue trends were stable. Within total revenue, equipment sales were down 16% or 14.6% in constant currency with the highest declines coming in Managed Document Services and in the public sector, where sales cycles and product transitions and certifications are longer.","From a product offering perspective, entry equipment sales were down 9.8% or 8.6% in constant currency, reflecting a higher mix of lower-value products as the strongest activity was in the developing markets and in the lower A4 product classes, as well as continued high OEM equipment declines. Mid-range was down 17.6% or 16. 3% in constant currency and this is where we saw the impact of not having the new A3 ConnectKey products available for the entire quarter. Lastly, high-end equipment sales were down 15.9% or 13.9% in constant currency as the growth with the high end in color Aqueous Inkjet was not enough to offset mono declines.","Moving on, post sale revenue was down 5.7% or 3.9% in constant currency, which was consistent with Q1. We continue to see softer Managed Document Services revenues following weaker signings in 2016 and the first half of 2017. In Q2, Managed Document Services was 32% of our revenues and was down 6% in actual currency and 3.9% in constant currency, with $32 million of the $34 million decline driven by lower equipment sales reflecting the timing of the new product launch, which gets amplified in MDS, given the longer sales cycles and the natural lag for realizing signings and subsequent installation of the equipment.","Declines are driven by the more mature large enterprise segment of the market as our SMB-focused channels, Xerox Partner Print Services and GIS, which comprise almost 25% of our MDS revenues, were growing mid-single digits. I'll now shift to discuss our key performance metrics, a few of which I've already touched on.","Strategic growth areas to-date are down 0.7% in constant currency and comprise 39% of our total revenues year-to-date, a 2 point mix shift from the year-ago period. Growth areas were impacted in the quarter by lower equipment sales and MDS revenue. Jeff highlighted earlier, the headway we're making in advancing our strategic growth areas, and we continue to target our revenue mix to these areas by approximately three points this year.","Turning to installs. Installs grew in entry, although at a weaker mix, given the better developing market performance, where units tend to weigh towards the lower end of the portfolio and given the new ConnectKey A4 products that currently are available are at the lower end of the portfolio. Mid-range installs declined given the new product transition timing and more challenging prior-year compare.","At the high end, installs were down in mono and within color results were mixed, with growth in Aqueous Inkjet offset by softer iGen activity, driven by last year's drupe-related partner and sales and a mix down within entry production color, where we didn't get a full quarter's benefits of the new Versant product.","Signings in the quarter of $643 million were down 6.5% year-over-year and down 5% on a trailing 12 months basis at constant currency. We had strong contributions from renewals this quarter at a renewal rate of 86%. This was more than offset by lower new business signings. So we have work to do to improve the growth rates at MDS, especially in large enterprise. We have recently changed the leadership in MDS, and we expect investments, which include our new products and SMB expansion actions will drive improvement in revenues over time.","The last key measurement area is strategic transformation. We're very pleased with our results to-date, and we are on track to deliver our target $600 million of gross savings in 2017. This is an important element of our strategy to drive both expanding margins and to support investments to improve our revenue trajectory.","I get a number of requests from investors to expand on some of the actions we're taking under the program, and would like to take a minute to describe a few of the initiatives. Within facilities, we are consolidating locations, 79 thus far, with more planned at the balance of the year.","As an example, we moved our headquarters to a smaller location at favorable terms, resulting in a couple million in annual savings. Within service delivery spend, about 30% of our savings program, we are consolidating our service delivery for MDS and break\/fix taxable service under one management umbrella and optimizing our resources. We are leveraging more remote cell and cell phone technologies, which are further enabled by new generation of product. This will result in, among other things, greater dispatch efficiency and also enable greater machine uptime leading to better customer satisfaction and more pages printed and more revenue.","In supply chain, we're negotiating with vendors for better terms and have outsourced activities. We've closed five major warehouses and a number of district part centers, which combined will drive around $24 million in annual savings once fully implemented.","Within IT, we are consolidating vendors in areas like mainframe support, moving to shared environments and leveraging more cloud tools to enable greater customer self-service in areas like billing and collection. And within SG&A, we are advancing our resources to the smaller size of our business following the separation in driving to get some functional spend areas closer to benchmark. We've reduced spend that layers in a number of areas and we're leveraging more technology to become more efficient in how we get work done. We're also tackling legacy infrastructure areas like Europe, where historically, it's been more difficult to make changes, to streamline our operations and create more shared services in areas like selling support.","Lastly, our transformation program is not limited to costs. We're applying the same program diligence to drive better revenue performance. Examples of some of these initiatives include using inside sales personnel to call an underpenetrated account and improving pricing tools and resources to give selling hours back to reps and minimize revenue lost on the table.","So all in all, a very broad company-wide program with a rigorous process that we work at every day with the goal of not only driving margin expansion, but also in making us more efficient and competitive.","Before covering cash flow, I'll cover the trends we're seeing in how we anticipate they will play out in the back half of the year. The total revenue decline of 6.4% in constant currency in Q2 was below trend as discussed, driven predominantly by equipment sales. We continue to expect full-year constant-currency revenue to be in the mid-single digits with about one point of negative translation currency, a modest improvement to our previous assumptions.","Looking at the second half, consistent with our previous commentary, we expect improving equipment revenue trends. Q3 should improve over Q2, although we won't get the full quarter's benefit from all the new products or realize larger deal, mostly MDS benefits, given the inherently longer sales cycle on these deals. Thus, Q4 will represent peak revenue performance for the year, with further benefits extending into 2018 with post sale, which lags, should also begin to reflect benefits from our initiatives.","Operating margins show good sequential and year-over-year improvement in Q2. Transaction currency again dampened margins in Q2 by about negative 100 basis points year-over-year. At current rates, we expect more moderate impact in the second half, especially in Q4. Overall, we anticipate continued strong margins in Q3, although seasonally, Q3 is not as strong as what we'll see in Q4, where typically margins peak for us. For the year, we continue to expect adjusted operating margin between 12.5% and 13.5%.","Lastly, in looking at the trends for adjusted EPS with two quarters left, we are narrowing our full-year adjusted EPS to be between $3.20 and $3.44, essentially chopping out the top end of the range as that relied on a more rapid rollout of the new products. We expect EPS to follow the trend in revenue with peak performance in Q4. Q3 is seasonally the second weakest quarter of the year after Q1 and historically has made up about 24% of full-year EPS.","I'll now shift to discuss cash flow. Operating cash flow generation coming in from continuing operations in the quarter was strong again at $343 million, up $84 million year-over-year. And free cash flow was $322 million, up $101 million year-over-year. Cash flow was driven by working capital timing and improvements, including in accounts payable related to the timing of supplier and vendor payments, the impact of lower equipment sales, a benefit to both accounts receivable and finance receivables, as well as the weighting of pension contributions to the second half of this year. Through the first half, we have contributed $46 million of a planned approximately $350 million for the full year.","Investing cash flows were a use of $77 million and included $65 million related to a GIS acquisition and CapEx spend of $21 million. Cash used in financing was $80 million and reflected $68 million in dividends, both common and preferred. So overall, we continue to feel good about cash flow and are maintaining our full-year guidance of $700 million to $900 million in operating cash flow from continuing services.","Turning now to capital structure slide, I will spend a few minutes on debt. We ended Q2 with $5 billion in debt, which is consistent with Q1 ending debt balance and lower than 2016 ending debt balance of $6.3 billion, reflecting the $1.3 billion of senior note debt repayments we did in the first quarter.","As we highlighted previously, a focus area for us in 2017 is getting our capital structure aligned to the new Xerox. We have made good progress and we continue to look to ways to optimize our balance sheet. Of our $5 billion in debt, $3.6 billion is allocated to financing debt, calculated by applying a 7:1 leverage ratio to our customer financing asset of $4.2 billion, which are comprised of $3.7 billion of finance receivables and $464 million of equipment on operating leases. And I will remind everyone that this financing debt is adjusted out in one form or another by rating agencies when calculating our core leverage.","So to summarize, we continued to make operational strides in Q2 with strong margins and cash flow and a good setup of revenue for the balance of the year.","With that, I will hand it back to Jeff.","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","Thank you, Bill. Let me wrap up the presentation with a few closing remarks. We are pleased with our earnings, margin, cash performance and the continued progress on our cost and productivity initiatives during the second quarter. Equipment revenue was softer as we work our way through the expansive product transition. We are laying the foundation in our strategic growth areas and we expect to see overall revenue improvement build toward the end of quarter three and then more strongly in quarter four and into 2018.","Our new products have been well received and will support our pursuit of the growing A4 and Managed Print Services markets, while positioning us to enhance our share position in A3. The ConnectKey portfolio appeal to the SMBs who are supported by our growing ranks of channel partners and it favorably faces off against our competitors, enabling us to maintain our leadership across the board.","And we're not taking our eye off the high end, where we're seeing good demand for our Aqueous Inkjet devices and new Versant products, while gearing up for PRINT 17 in the fall. Our strategic transformation program remains a critical focus to and continues to yield supporting strong margins and cash flow, while also enabling investment in the business.","Additionally, as Bill mentioned, we're applying our proven process discipline to drive revenue improvements. Our progress through the first half, along with the work underway for the second half, gives me confidence in our ability to meet our 2017 commitments.","We will now open up the line for questions. Jennifer?","Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.","Thanks, Jeff. Before we get to your questions for Jeff and Bill, let me point out that we have a number of supplemental slides at the end of our deck which provide more financial details to support today's presentation and complement our prepared remarks. For the Q&A, I would ask participants to limit follow-on and multi-part questions so we can get to everyone. At the end of our Q&A session, I will turn it back to Jeff for closing comments. Operator, please open the line for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I appreciate why you narrowed the top end of the range, just given you would need to see well above normal seasonality in the back half to hit the prior top end of the range. But curious why you didn't also narrow the bottom end of the range, which would require weaker seasonality despite the product cycles. And maybe just speak to the factors in the back half that would put you closer to $3.20 versus the upper end. Thanks.","William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.","Yeah hey, Katy, it's Bill Osbourn here. Thanks for the question. So let me just give some thoughts to you on all the four measures that we give a little guidance on, on the adjusted EPS. But first of all, adjusted operating margin, we gave guidance at 12.5% to 13.5%, reaffirming that. We're very comfortable with where we're at year-to-date, 13.3% in Q2, first half at 12.2%. And just to remind everyone, the third quarter is typically our seasonally our second weakest quarter of the year, but Q4 is our strongest from an operating margin and from a revenues perspective. But we're still very comfortable with the 12.5% to 13. 5% range and believe we're set up pretty well for that.","Revenues mid-single-digit down in constant currency for the full year; first half, we are 5.4% down. We believe the second half will be better than the 5.4% down at constant currency with once again Q4 being the strongest quarter of the year and Q4 being better than Q3.","From an operating cash flow perspective, once again, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're very pleased with where we ended for Q2 at $343 million, $533 million for the first half of this year. And I think most everybody knows and I'll just remind everyone the timing of our pension payments we gave guidance towards $350 million in pension payments for the full year, which is still on track, but only $46 million were made in the first half. So a lot of the pension payments are back loaded. There's also some timing of payables, with payables management that was a help in the first half that won't necessarily repeat in the second half.","So then after all that getting to your question regarding the adjusted EPS and really, there a lot of factors as you can imagine that go into it. There are some favorable things in particular. Currency, we think based on current spot rates, will be a little bit better than we had expected as far as the headwind at the beginning of the year, in particular in Q4. And Q3 will probably be similar as far as the negative impact to the first half of the year, but Q4 we expect to have a more modest negative impact from a currency perspective.","The Fuji Xerox provision is clearly a favorable item. And in the first quarter, we took that $30 million hit on that and that was revised $24 million or most of it was revised out. So, some favorable items there, but to get to the higher end of the range, a few things. We had \u2013 everything had to go right regarding the product transition, and Jeff, in a lot of his comments talked about that. A lot of things have got right, but not everything as far as the timing. There have been some delays. Also, we still plan. We've done a lot of investment year-to-date in the A4 area, which everyone knows has a negative margin upon the initial sale in most cases, but is profitable over the life of the equipment. We plan to have \u2013 we want to have flexibility, continue to do as much of that as we can. We've done a fair amount in first half. We want to continue doing that in the second half of the year. And this, leaving \u2013 to answer your question specifically, leaving the lower end of the range opened or not adjusting that leaves you opportunity to be flexible, where opportunities arise in the A4 area.","And then, one of the bigger things is that, from a tax perspective, we gave guidance range of 25% to 28% for the full year for effective tax rate. And year-to-date, we've been in the 27% range. We think that might be lower a little bit with some things you see and maybe in the second half. But still, it is higher than the midpoint of the range so far this year. All those things factor in. We thought it was prudent to narrow the range, given half the year is up and we basically removed the top 25% or $0.08 from it.","Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.","Great. Thanks, Katy. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross of Cross Research. Your line is now open.","Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC","Thank you very much for taking my question. Can you talk a bit more about the pipeline that you have? I understand things have been pushed back and MDS is taking a while to train in a longer sales cycle. But I'm trying to figure out if this is a change to, sort of, the typical sales cycles? Or is that this is just more with regard to your product launch? And so I'm just trying to figure out how this delay that we've seen is either going to sort of just continue on and impact next year? Or if you think the weakness now is probably going to lead to some upside in 2018? Thank you.","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","Hey, Shannon, how are you? This is Jeff. Yeah. So, let me take that one. So, as Bill indicated, we thought that Q2 for us was a bit softer by about 1 point. So if you were to take our total revenue and say 1 point, it's about $25 million. So finishing the first half on a total revenue decline basis at constant currency of negative 5.4%, if you were to ask Bill and I at the beginning of the year, that's kind of about where we thought we would be.","As we look back, we said Q1 probably ended up a little stronger than we thought it would be, Q2 a little weaker. If you'd put the two together, it will be right where we thought we would be. Getting to the backlog, the reasons we feel more confident, especially in Q4, because \u2013 as we all know, Q3 is seasonally weaker. July and August is more difficult.","From a direct backlog standpoint, we actually, from end of March to end of June, we see that up around 17%. We also look at the new business pipeline in Managed Document Services, which also gives us confidence of why that will turn probably more starting in the fourth quarter.","The Managed Document Services, 180-day new business pipeline is up about 35% sequentially from Q2 to Q3. And again, that's a 180 day pipeline, which I say will \u2013 why it will benefit us more in Q4. If I look at the renewal of pipeline for Managed Document Services, that's also up about 13%.","So when I look at those things and when I say the equipment this quarter for us down negative 14.6% constant currency, which is something we had not seen. And I get even more confidence in addition to the backlogs when I look at Managed Document Services alone because if I go to the last four quarters, equipment would've been in the range of, let's call it, flat to up 1%. This quarter, it was down 24%. It was a real anomaly.","And when I look at the pipelines, it gives me good confidence again for Q4 and then into 2018. It might also help, although I know this really wasn't the question, but probably if I lay out the product introductions for everybody, I think that'd probably be a little helpful. So in February, we introduced the four lower-end A4 products, okay? That would be two color, two black and white. And that's why you saw the installs in entry, multi-function devices up 24% in color and 10% in black and white. And that's really where our developing markets benefited the most because it was really the entry level of A4, and we got a nice bump from that.","In Q2, really end of May and throughout June, we launched all 17 A3 products, but they came in so late that really didn't benefit Q2 at all, obviously, because those are products that typically would go with Managed Document Services or have longer sales cycles. And we think as the third quarter progresses, we'll get some benefit. But again, really more of a benefit \u2013 more fulsome benefit across Q4 and into 2018.","In July, we will introduce the four A4 color products, okay. And then in September, we'll introduce the last four A4 products, which will be the four black and white. And by the end of third quarter, all 29 products will be launched, which is why we believe Q4 will be our most fulsome for this year and then in 2018 will get the benefits of that.","And certainly from a rollout standpoint, you get the fastest rollout through your indirect channels and your rollout through Managed Document Services and some of the enterprise customers due to testing, certifications and the government take a little longer.","Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.","Thank you. Great. Thanks, Shannon. Operator, next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha. Your line is now open.","Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you. Just a couple of questions. The first one is given all the initiatives that you have with respect to on the revenue side whether it's the product portfolio upgrade, the backlog that you mentioned, the initiatives of the channel, it sounds like \u2013 correct me if I'm wrong \u2013 year-on-year growth should start to improve from Q3, get better in Q4, and does this product cycle of new initiatives drive fairly equally through 2018 as well, or are there other factors we should think about from just the secular challenges?","And the second question is, I think we're halfway through this cost reduction program. And there's been talk of having greater than $1.5 billion of cost savings as you go through that, your margin performance is obviously quite good in this quarter just gone. When will you revise \u2013 if you will at all \u2013 and when we'll be told about that? Can you give us any insights the timing as to when you will assess whether you should be doing $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion or whether this is enough, and to what degree that depends on revenues? Thank you.","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","Yeah, hey, Kulbinder, how are you? This is Jeff. I think I got most of it. We had a little bit of difficult time hearing you. So if we don't get all of your questions, just let me know and we'll be happy to do so. So, from an overall rollout from a revenue standpoint, we would expect in Q3 \u2013 certainly for the half year, as Bill said before, we expect to see improvements second half versus first half.","In terms of Q3 versus Q2 sequentially, we would expect to see an improvement in revenue declines on a constant-currency basis, Q3 versus Q2 with the bigger impact being in Q4, which would be the seasonality but also having the benefit of all the new products for just about a quarter then. Some of the last A4 products will be coming out in September, so that might lag a little bit. But we do believe that will also help us, then, into the first half of 2018.","With regard to the strategic transformation, I'll let Bill get into that in a little more detail, but we'll certainly update that as we get into the 2018 Investment Day. But as we've been saying all along and as evidenced by the 13.3% operating margin, even despite the 100 basis point currency headwinds, that's something we work hard at every single day and we'll update where we are at the Investor Conference.","I should also mention and Bill did mention that in his remarks, we do are starting similar types of, what I'll call, operating initiatives on the revenue side to make sure we have the same diligence in introducing all these new products and rolling them out to the field. Bill?","William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.","Yeah. Just a little bit on a strategic cost transformation. As everyone knows, last year we overachieved with respect to the $500 million target and achieved by $550 million. In 2016, we stated a goal for $600 million, this year we are very pleased with where we're at year-to-date, and believe we are firmly on track to meeting that target and hopefully exceeding it.","Which would lead to, obviously, your $1.15 billion, if I'm doing my math right, that we're likely very much on the plus side of the $1.5 billion for the three years when you factor in 2018. But as far as formally giving an updated number, it'll probably be later this year. But we are very confident in being \u2013 hitting the $600 million this year and overachieving on the $1.5 billion. But to give updated three-year number later this year, we'll give that.","Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.","Great. Thanks, Kulbinder. Operator, next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital. Your line is now open.","Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Hey. Thanks guys for taking the questions. A couple for me as well. Just sticking with that cost saves topic, guys, I believe of the $1.5 billion cumulative 2018 target, $500 million was incremental and $1 billion was sort of your business as usual saves. So my question is, of that $500 million in the context of the sort of the net new investments you've been making, how should we think or how would you like us to think about a potential for drop-through to the bottom line over the next couple of years? And I have a follow-up as well. Thanks.","William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.","Yeah. A couple of thoughts. So yeah, I'd agree, this incremental about $500 million over three years versus what was more BAU already on the cost reductions. But one of the main reasons why was to allow for investment and investment includes things like the A4s, being able to sell A4s up front, which are at a negative margin or a loss initially but profitable over the life.","But it also offsets other headwinds, such as currency. We've had significant currency headwinds, both last year and this year, and the incremental amounts over the BAU allowed us to still increase margins despite those currency headwinds, and like I said, it allows us to do investments, so the investment in selling initial A4s or investments in the way we are doing things internally.","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","Yeah. And I think, Ananda, and good to hear your voice again on these calls. I should mention that, when Bill talks about investments, it's not just the new products, but it's what we're doing with the SMB expansion. We brought on more than 30 new partners and it's almost evenly split between the financial operations in North America, but it requires investment there. It's demand generation.","We've hired dozens of new logo hunters. And as the year goes on, we hope to even do more A4 investment, because as we see the success of this, and as you know that's an investment putting those devices in, but we'll get the benefit on the post sale. So we could see ourselves doing more and more of that once we get even more comfortable than we are with where we are for the full year.","Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And just a quick follow-up on that. That's really helpful, guys. So, as we move through the next kind of two-and-a-half years here, well let's call it one-and-a-half into 2019, is the success \u2013 the return success, I'll call it, kind of the op income dollar growth impact from the incremental cost saves, the EPS growth impact from the incremental cost saves, will that be generated by the success of these new initiatives? Or will there be some portion of incremental cost saves that will not be reinvested back into new initiatives and it could be just it's a drop through to the bottom line?","William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.","Yeah, I would say clearly, it would be a mix that there would be a mix of investments. But some would continue to drop to the bottom line and we're not giving guidance in out years, but I would expect cost transformation, although maybe not at the same levels that you see in these three years, will continue as a significant part of this company's future.","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","Yeah. And another way, Ananda, I'd look at this, and this is I think where we laid it out at the investor conference. Just to make the math easier, let's just say on an $11 billion business or a $10 billion business, mid single digit declines would be 5%. So let's take $500 million, until you turn the revenue trajectory and we should not lose sight of the fact that when we started this 18 months ago and announced this program, it was not just to drive cost out, but it was to be able to reinvest back in so that we can change the revenue trajectory so that we're not declining at that mid single-digit level in the outer years.","So right now, the cost transformation program is being used to offset the revenue decline and it's not just putting the margin, the 40% gross margin on the revenue declines. You have some price erosion in the industry, et cetera, which drops 100% to the bottom line. As we're able to take those declines from mid-single digits to something better, we'll have more opportunity to drop more to the bottom line as we also continue to reinvest.","Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.","Great. Thanks, Ananda. Operator, next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Cabral of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah. Thank you. Jeff, just in terms of the competitive landscape, just wondering how you'd characterize the current pricing environment and if you've seen any response from any of your competitors just as your product launch continues to roll out?","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","Yeah. Hey, Matt thanks for the question. Yes, no, competitive reactions have been very stable. Pricing has been for us at about the same levels that it's been really for the last couple of years. If anything, where we're feeling really good is although the products are just coming out now, and again, we'll be coming out in Q3, but more fulsome in Q4, as we're speaking to the channel partners to bring on the SMB expansion, the reaction we're getting not just from the industry analysts or the awards we're getting, but from the resellers, the multi-branded resellers who are looking at these products and saying, we now understand that Xerox is very serious about going into the multi-brand channel.","They've seen the hires we've made, that we've hired a gentlemen named Pete Peterson, Jim Morrissey, two people who are pretty well known in these channels, that they are going out and speaking to people. And where have seen some competitive reaction is saying, we now see the multi-brand channel speaking to Xerox now. We actually like it to be a little more low-key because we'd like to stay below the radar as we bring and these new multi-brand channel partners.","So and again, we're not getting out ahead of our headlights. We're also making investments in our mono brand channel. These are the resellers who have been extremely loyal to us. We're continuing to invest with them. And we're also streamlining what we do in the enterprise. We're getting much more focused by saying, for years, there have been a number of customers that we've had \u2013 that we've called on directly that quite candidly, we shouldn't. We're going to work with our mono-branded resellers, our multi-brand resellers to have them call on them, do it more through telesales as we change our model, so that the new logo hunters can focus on the largest enterprise customers in the industry.","Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.","Thanks for the question, Matt. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva of Citi. Your line is now open.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you very much. I have two questions; I'll ask them both at the same time. First, you mentioned Q4 will be stronger than Q3. I wanted to get a little clarity about why are you calling that out when isn't that normally always the case? Or is there something special, because with the product ramps, I would think that Q4 would always be the strongest regardless of product ramps or not. And are you actually implying that maybe year-over-year sales could be flat to up in Q4? Or you just kind of reminding people of what's normal?","And then my second question is, you narrowed your EPS guide by taking the high end down, but the operating cash flow and free cash flow didn't change at all. So what causes the bridge to where there was no impact to operating cash flow and free cash flow? Thank you.","William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.","Hey, Jim, it's Bill. Thanks for the questions. So, yeah, regarding the Q4 versus Q3 from a revenues perspective, a couple of things. You're right that Q4 seasonally our strongest quarter from a revenues perspective each year and that normally occurs. This year, we expect there to be even more of a ramp, the degree of it, we're not giving that specificity, but more ramp than normal because of the new product launch.","Not giving specific guidance as to flat or positive for Q4, but as far as Q4, it's owned. But we do expect there's a normal ramp from Q3 to Q4 that occurs. We expect there to be more of a ramp this year than in prior years just because of the full availability of our products at that point in time.","As far as EPS and operating cash flow, once again, there are a lot of variabilities, as you know, that go into operating cash flow. And one of them in particular is the pension contributions, and we've said $350 million. It's an area that we look at closely as far as our funded pension status. And just want to leave things open from the perspective of whether we want to have flexibility for maybe additional funding there. But yes, normally, all else being equal, you would \u2013 you could have a slightly less, actually operating cash flow because taking off the top, but it's not that significant compared to all the variables that go into determining it.","Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.","Thanks, Jim. Operator, I think we have time for one last question.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Paul Coster of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Thank you. It's a two-part question. First of all, you mentioned some successful contracts at the beginning of the prepared remarks, Jeff. Were any of them competitive wins? And unrelated question, but as you move through the remainder of this year, is there anything you can share regarding channel and your own inventory mix? And to what extent you have some visibility into the 4Q ramp owing to a sell into the distributors and resellers? Thank you.","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","Yeah. So \u2013 hi, Paul. Yeah. So certainly, some of those wins were competitive wins, no question about it. And we're putting even more and more of a focus on it, part of the reason in on Managed Document Services that our Q2 to Q3 sequential 180-day new business pipeline, which would all be new, is up 35%. It's these new logo hunters that we're hiring, many from the outside, some just targeting them on the inside. So they're building a competitive pipeline again and because it's a 180-day pipeline, we'll get some benefit from that in Q4 and then certainly some in the first half of next year as well.","From an industry standpoint, we've been very \u2013 from an inventory standpoint, we've been very stable. That's something we watch very tightly. When Bill talked about working capital improvements and our cash flow, it's part of the rigor with the way we manage our business. And that's even with having \u2013 we just made the Global Imaging acquisition, where we actually buildup some inventory for that. When Bill talked about some of our closures of facilities or whatever, some of those could even be manufacturing facilities where we'll actually have a little \u2013 we built some inventory for that to manage through that. So even despite all that, we manage it very well and still with pretty significant cash flow improvements.","Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.","Great. Thanks, Paul. That's all the time we have for questions today. Thanks for your interest. Jeff, anything to wrap up?","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","Yes. Thanks very much for all your questions. And as I mentioned last quarter, we are keenly focused on the work ahead of us. We are positioning ourselves to reverse our revenue trajectory trends. We understand the market and our success will come by methodically laying the building blocks to capture growing share of the workplace market and increase our participation in the expanding high-end color market. We continue to make headway on our strategy and we're confident in our ability to meet our full year commitments. We look forward to continuing to update you on our progress, and I thank you all for joining our call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for participating in today's conference.

She is joined by Kathy Mikells, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com\/investor. At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and\/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without the expressed permission of Xerox. After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] ","During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which, by their nature, address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein.","At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to, Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns, you may begin.","Ursula Burns","Good morning and thanks for joining our call. Today, we reported the second quarter results that are largely in line with our guidance. During the call, we will update you on our strategy, provide detail on the second quarter, and share the areas where we are intensifying our focus throughout the balance of the year. Let\u2019s start with our strategy.","Our direction has been consistent. We are making progress in some areas, but we know we can and should do better in other areas. Our direction is unchanged. We are making several shifts in the way that we execute against it. ","First, we have taken steps to create much greater focus in our Services business. We completed the divestiture of our ITO business enabling a clear focus on the BPO and document outsourcing businesses. Last Friday, we announced a major change in our government healthcare strategy. We are focused on ensuring the success of the existing health enterprise implementations by limiting new pursuits with this platform. ","Second, we are modifying our acquisition expectations for the year setting an achievable spend level given our progress to date. Third, the Services leadership team is in place with our last industry leader appointed in April. Our capabilities are fully staffed and sales resources are in place to market our full portfolio of services. Collectively, these actions result in a sharpened focus on achieving organic improvements in our Services business. We have also announced changes to our 2015 capital allocation plan. For the full year, we will increase our share repurchase by $300 million to $1.3 billion and we will return $300 million to shareholders in dividends unchanged.","In summary, we have the right business strategy, we are reprioritizing investments, and accelerating our restructuring actions and services to improve revenue and margin. While we have more work to do, we are making decisions and changes that will deliver attractive return to our investors.","Now, let\u2019s look at quarter two. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.22, that\u2019s in line with our guidance, which excludes the previously announced healthcare software impairment charges of $0.08. Total revenue was $4.6 billion, which is down 3% in constant currency. We grew Services revenue modestly in constant currency. It was driven by strong performance in document outsourcing and we delivered on our Services margin guidance. There are a few highlights in Services that I\u2019d like to share.","We are seeing indications that our new Services go-to-market model is taking root. Our opportunity pipeline is up sequentially, and we are seeing more cross selling and better customer engagement. We made some important strides in innovation, introducing new levels of robotic automation to support our BPO offerings. For example, we recently announced ClearSight Automated Intelligence and ClearSight Case Management. We also introduced Managed Print Services innovation with the next generation offerings and workflow automation solutions to reinforce our leadership in the industry. And for internal productivity, we are driving transformational change in our own capability operations with the call center of the future program.","Now moving on to Document Technology, revenue was down 7% in constant currency which is modestly lower than what we had expected. Including DO though, total document related revenues were down 4% in constant currency. That\u2019s consistent with the trend that we\u2019ve seen over the last several quarters. Document Technology margins were in line with expectations.","Here is some highlights on Doc Tech. We retained our number one position in the equipment sales revenue market share for the twenty second straight quarter. We were pleased with in store performance in the quarter as most product segments improved, especially in the high end of our business. The new product introductions during the quarter and the launch of the iGen 5 earlier this month will enable us to continue in our leader position.","Finally, we used our strong free cash flow $349 million in the quarter to acquire Health Communities Institute and Conestoga Business Solutions, and we repurchased shares in support of our dividend program.","Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kathy to go over some details on the quarter. I\u2019ll be back later to wrap things up. Kathy?","Kathy Mikells","Thanks, Ursula, and good morning everyone. Our bottom line results were within our guidance for the quarter with Services profit in line, Tech profits a little light on modestly softer revenue which was offset by a bit better non-operating expenses. I will cover the segments in more detail in a minute, but first I will run through total company results for the second quarter.","Total revenue in the quarter was down 7% at actual currency and 3% at constant currency. Growth in services was more than offset by declines in Document Technology which accelerated modestly driven by continued weakness in developing market and higher declines in supply revenue. The negative currency impact of 4 points on our top line was consistent with our expectations and with first quarter results.","Gross margin of 31.1% was down 100 basis points year-over-year, driven by lower technology gross margin as well as a greater mix of services which carries a lower margin. RD&E was slightly lower year-over-year, and SAG in absolute dollar terms was down 6% helped by currency. However, as a percent of revenue, SAG was up 30 basis points year-over-year to 19.7% as productivity benefits were more than offset by investments and services. As a result, our second quarter operating margin decreased 160 basis points year-over-year and operating profit declined 22%. About a quarter of the operating profit decline was driven by currency and developing markets with the remainder of the decline coming from the cross sells that I just discussed.","Moving down the income statement, adjusted other net expense was $26 million lower year-over-year driven by lower restructuring cost. Equity income was $29 million in the quarter, down $4 million year-over-year driven by the continued impact of negative translation currency. Our second quarter adjusted tax rate of 25.8% was in the middle of our guidance and about a point lower year-over-year. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share was in the middle of our guidance range at $0.22. GAAP EPS from continuing operations in the quarter was $0.09 and includes the $0.08 impact from the government healthcare software impairment we announced last week, which was driven by the strategy change that Ursula already discussed. As this was a very large non-cash charge, we excluded it from our adjusted results to better reflect underlying operating performance.","I will now move on to discuss our operating performance and services. Services revenue declined 3% and was up 1% in constant currency, which was consistent with the first quarter and a bit better than our guidance of roughly flat, driven by 4% growth in document outsourcing. Growth in document outsourcing reflects continued strong Xerox Partner print services growth, as well as good equipment revenue growth in enterprise accounts from recent strong signings.","BPO revenue was down 1%, reflecting the continued headwind from last year's larger contract losses, more than offsetting lower new ramp from softer signings in previous quarters. We continue to expect EPO growth to improve in the second half as we lap the larger contract losses. We completed two small acquisitions in the first half, and M&A remains a variable factor. I\u2019ll talk about this more when I cover cash flow and capital allocation.","Total signings in the quarter were up 20%, and new business signings were up 9%, driven by strong signings and document outsourcing, as well as the recently signed New York Medicaid processing contract in BPO. We expect our go to market investments and move to industry alignment will yield improved new business signings growth as we progress through the year.","Our pipeline continues to build and is up sequentially. Our renewal rate in the quarter was 82%, which was below our target range of 85% to 90% and reflected in part lower renewal opportunities in the quarter. Year-to-date renewal rate is 87%.","Turning to margin, segment margin was 7.5% in the quarter, which was down 100 basis points year-over-year and in line with our expectations. As expected, margin was pressured by higher cost related to our health enterprise platform implementation. As we acknowledge last quarter, costs are continuing to run high and we have more work to do to turnaround financial performance in these accounts.","Additionally, investments in our new services operating model are not yet being fully offset by enhanced productivity from our operational initiatives, which are still ramping up. Partially offsetting these impacts was continued good margin in document outsourcing albeit lower year-over-year as expected and a year-over-year compare benefit related to the charge last year from the lost Nevada HIX business.","So in summary the quarter was in line for services. We have made significant changes over the past year to move our services business forward and will be taking additional restructuring actions to ensure our productivity ramps up faster throughout the second half. I\u2019ll discuss this more when we get to guidance.","I\u2019ll now turn to Document Technology. Document Technology revenue in the quarter was 7% at constant currency. As expected currency had a five point negative in point impact with revenue at actual currency down 12%. As we highlighted last quarter, we don't include developing markets in our constant currency calculation, but if we had revenue would have been down 6% at constant currency. So overall, revenue trends remained fairly stable.","Looking at the details, equipment revenue declines moderated, down 6% to constant currency in the second quarter versus down 8% in the first quarter and 10% in the fourth quarter. The improving trend reflects benefits for recent new product launches, especially within high-end where equipment revenue grew in the quarter.","Offsetting the positive equipment trend, were higher declines in supplies revenues driven in part by developing market, which were pressured by softening economies and currency. From an activity perspective, we saw improvements in growth in mid-range high-end and higher volume entry products. So overall, positive growth in installs across our product segments.","Document Technology margin of 12.1% was down year-over-year, but up sequentially and in the middle of our 11% to 13% range for 2015. Year-over-year drivers included the anticipated higher pension expense and negative mix associated with improved equipment sales at lower margin. These were partially offset by a retiree health curtailment gain.","So in closing, revenues were a little lighter than expected, but overall a reasonable quarter for technology with equipment trends and high end performance being positive takeaways. ","Turning to cash flow, cash flow from operations was $349 million in the quarter, above last year's cash flow of $325 million. This reflects good overall performance despite weaker process as working capital was a lower net use versus last year, driven by the following factors. Accounts receivable was a source of $56 million in the quarter versus the use last year, reflecting lower revenues and flat year-over-year DSO. Accounts payable on accrued compensation was $75 million lower yield this year, reflecting timing of supplier payments. This was partially offset by a little higher inventory due to timing of shipments. ","Moving down the cash flow statement, investing cash flows were an $831 million source driven by proceeds of $930 million from the sale of ITO business. This was partially offset by $102 million spent on Capex and $20 million on acquisitions. Cash flow from financing was a $422 million yield, which included $395 million spent on share repurchases and $83 million used for preferred and common stock dividend. As well it reflects an increase in commercial paper, offset by payments of $250 million on senior notes.","Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $1.6 billion, an increase of $769 million, since the end of first quarter, driven by the proceeds received on June 30 from the ITO divestiture. So, cash flow is strong and continues to attract our expectations.","Now, I\u2019ll quickly go over capital structure. We ended the second quarter with $7.6 billion in debt, applying 7 to 1 leverage on customer financing assets. Our allocated financing debt at the end of the second quarter was $3.9 billion, leaving core debt of $3.7 billion. We managed our core debt to maintain credit metrics consistent with our investment grade rating.","Our capital structure remained fairly stable, if we move to the next slide, I\u2019ll review where we are in terms of capital allocation. Through the first half, we have repurchased $611 million in shares, spent $147 million on common stock dividend and $48 million on acquisitions. Considering our first-half performance and the opportunities we see for the balance of the year, we\u2019re adjusting our capital allocation plan.","On acquisitions, we have spent about $50 million year-to-date. We now expect to spend between $100 million and $400 million for the full year. The bar is higher as we focus on organic improvements and services for the next few quarters. We are working to enhance our proactive business development capabilities and recently hired a new leader for business development and M&A. On share repurchase, we are increasing our full-year plan by $300 million to $1.3 billion. This reflects our view that our shares are attractively priced and a good investment, as well as our reduced near-term plans for acquisition. This leaves approximately $200 million unallocated that we will deploy opportunistically.","On debt, we retired our last tranche of debt coming due this year $250 million in June and we continue to expect to end the year at a debt balance of roughly $7.7 billion. And finally on dividends, we continue to expect to spend just over $300 million. I\u2019ll now turn to a discussion of guidance.","First, starting with revenue, Document Technology trends are stable as expected improvements in high-end and financing have been offset by ongoing weakness in developing markets from softening economies as well as from currency. As a result, we are planning for Document Technology revenue to be down roughly 6% at constant currency in the second half and for the full year. Additionally, we are spending less on acquisitions than originally planned dampening back Services revenue acceleration. At the total company level, we now anticipate full year revenue at constant currency will be down approximately 2%, consistent with prior year and down 1 point from what we last communicated.","Turning to margin, we expect services margin will be at the low end of 8.5% to 9% for the year. With our margin at 7.5% for the first half, we need to average about 9.5% in the second half of the year to hit that level. This requires a step function change given the continued higher health enterprise implementation cost and margins not yet improving in the business as a whole outside of health enterprise.","While our productivity initiatives are beginning to ramp, we need to further accelerate that to drive the second half improvement. In addition to capturing attrition benefit, we are planning a restructuring initiative which combined will reduce headcount by approximately 3,000 people. We expect modest sequential Services margin improvement in the third quarter with the fourth quarter clearly showing greater benefit given the timing of additional workforce actions and accelerating yield from our operating model changes. Seasonality in document outsourcing also aid sequential improvement in the fourth quarter.","For Document Technology, we continue to expect margins between 11% to 13% for the full year in part supported by pension expense coming in lower than originally anticipated. In the first half, restructuring actions were focused on technology. In contrast, our second-half actions will be focused on Services. As a result, we expect relatively low restructuring cost due to natural attrition and relatively low average severance cost in Services.","So in summary, we now expect to be at the lower end of $0.95 to $1.01 adjusted earnings per share range. For the third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $0.22 and $0.24 reflecting normal seasonality and approximately $0.01 of restructuring. As I indicated earlier, operating cash flow was strong in the first half and we still expect to be within $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion range despite the lower earnings, reflecting both good working capital performance and lower restructuring cost.","We are committed to getting the needed actions to improve profitability and meet our 2015 earnings and cash flow guidance, and we are confident that we have the right plan in place to deliver that and create value for our shareholders.","With that, I\u2019ll hand it back to you, Ursula.","Ursula Burns","Thanks, Kathy. And for the second quarter, as Kathy said, we largely met expectations. We are committed to delivering our guidance and we are doing everything that we can to overachieve. In Services, we are accelerating cost reduction actions and re-prioritizing investments in the second half to position the business for stronger financial performance while investing in the parts of the business that are critical to drive productivity and future growth.","In Document Technology, we are focused on leading in the most attractive segments of the market and on delivering strong financial performance. So in short, it\u2019s all about focus at Xerox. In addition to leading in the attractive document market, we are focused on making portfolio moves that strengthen our business financially and strategically. We are focused on optimizing our new Services operating model [indiscernible] productivity improvements across the business, and we are focused on driving revenue and profit growth in every line of business. And most importantly, we are focused on our people and on our clients. We remain committed to our business strategy and we are bullish about the markets that we serve and opportunities that lie ahead.","Thank you, and now let me turn it over to Leslie.","Leslie Varon","Thanks, Ursula. Joining Ursula and Kathy today is Bob Zapfel, Head of our Services business. Let me point out that we have several supplemental slides at the end of our deck. They provide more financial detail to support today\u2019s presentation and complement our prepared remarks. For the Q&A, I would ask participants to limit follow-on and multipart questions so we can get to everyone. At the end of our Q&A session, I\u2019ll turn it back to Ursula for closing comments.","Karen, you can please now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray.","George Tong","Hi, thanks. Good morning. First question for Kathy, in your margin performance guidance for Services that\u2019s been updated, can you detail what you are assuming for margin performance outside of government healthcare and what investments into government healthcare you are assuming in the second half?","Kathy Mikells","Sure. If you look at what I discussed in terms of the overall progression in Services margin in the second half, it\u2019s very clear that outside of the health enterprise accounts what we are expecting is ramping productivity between the third and the fourth quarter to basically accelerate our margin improvement over the second half. The other thing that\u2019s really important to recall is that document outsourcing is a meaningful part of our Services business and as a percent of our Services business got larger when we divested the ITO business, and that has a natural seasonal pattern in the second half of the year where margins decline in the third quarter and then accelerate sequentially in the fourth quarter. So those are some of the important puts and takes in terms of the acceleration in the back half of the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross from Cross Research.","Shannon Cross","Thank you very much. I had a couple of Services questions as well. First, can you talk a bit more about details on the restructuring program, and specifically what I\u2019m wondering is, what has changed in how you\u2019re looking at the restructuring from last quarter to this quarter?","Robert Zapfel","Shannon, it\u2019s Bob, so a couple of things. First is, as it was mentioned, heavily focused on Services rather than Doc Tech where we get kind of visibly more yield for restructuring dollars spent. And then inside our Services restructuring, a combination of what I would call G&A part of \u2013 now that we\u2019ve got our arms around managing the set of people and our capabilities organization, but a combination of that and then not needing to backfill and being able to take out a higher proportion of our delivery resources as a result of automation investments that we\u2019ve been making during the year and as a result of really having improved the service level quality where we are confident. We were trying to be a little bit careful to not go too quickly relative to optimizing our cost base without being sure that we could maintain and continue to increase delivery quality. So those would be the main summary points.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question \u2013 I\u2019m sorry.","Leslie Varon","I was just asking Shannon if she had a follow-up because she mentioned she had a couple of questions.","Operator","Shannon, your line is open.","Shannon Cross","Okay. Thank you. My only follow-up is just, can you talk a little bit about \u2013 you started to retrain and realign the sales force on the Services side. So I\u2019m curious as to what you\u2019re seeing in terms of any benefit from that or how that\u2019s progressing?","Robert Zapfel","Yes. We\u2019ve largely completed the addition of resources in our sales teams and we\u2019ve got good sequential pipeline improvement. So besides the fact that as it was mentioned before our signings were strong in the quarter, we\u2019ve seen our pipeline build out and we are also seeing which was part of the design of the new model going to market by industry, we are seeing a visible increase in the number of opportunities where we\u2019re bringing more than one offering to the customer so that it is leveraging Xerox services broadly rather than an isolated offering by itself. So those would be the primary points.","Shannon Cross","Thank you.","Leslie Varon","Karen, I think we can move on to the next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman from BMO Capital Markets.","Keith Bachman","Hi. Thank you. I have two as well. On the M&A pipeline, I understand completely that you want to focus on righting the ship. But if I think about over the last year and the year and a half, it seems like Xerox hasn\u2019t been able to hit, identify targets associated with M&A in the services area, and in contrast it seems like I get an email a week from Accenture about adding deals or completing deals, I\u2019m wondering is this more Xerox threshold, is it the pipeline, is it supply demand and balance, what has been the challenge associated with adding services revenue through inorganic means and then I have a follow-up?","Ursula Burns","Okay, Keith. I\u2019m going to start with, the way we have historically talked about this, we tended to say in up to numbers. So as an example when we started the year we said M&A up to $900 million and in fact we knew that was kind of quite a big number for us, especially relative to what we had typically been doing in the past, and so we also said at the same time that we expect that we might role some that over until next year. You know I'd note in the recent guidance we just gave we are giving a range because it seems like when we said up to, if we didn't hit the top end of that number, you know people really deemed us for falling short, when M&A is a little difficult to call. If I go to what we need to do to actually get more done, I\u2019d say the core thing we need to do is improve our hit rate, and the changes that we\u2019re looking to make is to pivot more of our activity to a proactive approach rather than just looking at deals that are being brokered in the market. That isn't something that happens overnight; I mentioned that we hired a new leader recently in order to head up that business. And in the meantime, we\u2019re also clearly looking to hold the bar a little higher as we focus over the next couple of quarters on really getting our organic improvements in services accelerating.","Robert Zapfel","If I can just add something, we are clearly part of four models to sell-out capabilities and broaden our reach particularly internationally, we need M&A and so we're not pleased with the fact that we are at the low end of our performance ranges here, but I also think it\u2019s a kind of a fortuitous time in the back half of the year to be focused on organic growth we have all of the infrastructure in place, we\u2019ve hired the capability leaders, we have the sales force full, we have the line of business guys all in place, we have a good start to operating model and focus here is an important thing. I don't want anyone to believe that we're walking away from M&A that we're not going to do it, but based on the reality of where we are I think we're going to be in this $100 million to $400 million range, we're going to spend the last half of the year trying to get that done; and then making sure that we have a foundation, a strong foundation, a kind of unshakable foundation in organic side of the business. So, I know it is not what we want to end up, but it is where we are.","Keith Bachman","Well thank you. That\u2019s certainly the right thing to do, just try to focus on the execution. I think totally appropriate. And my follow-up question though is on the printing side of the business. It does seem like there are some challenges there and I was wondering if you could add color in particular the supply side seems a bit weaker than I would have anticipated and it seems to be a lingering problem and is that just demand or is there a share or is there, how is the technology business seem to be facing incremental challenges, particularly on supplies? Thank you.","Kathy Mikells","And so specifically on supplies, I\u2019m going to first kind of refer back to my commentary when I talked about developing markets and the fact that we don't adjust currency out, right, so when we look at these numbers and publish these numbers it has developing markets at actual currency. If you make that adjustment in tag for supply, it actually moves the number by about two points and that will be the case for the last couple of quarters that currencies in developing markets have really been under pressure. So, I think if you look at it that way, I would say overall supply ebb and flow a little bit, but we don't see any kind of monumental shifts going on, here we think the business is pretty stable.","Keith Bachman","Okay thank you.","Robert Zapfel","One other thing to add Keith if I can is that our supplies mix is a little different than what some of our peers or competitors are as well, so smaller portion of our business, most of our supplies have bundled in contracts and what we\u2019re talking about here is supplies outside of that and it\u2019s a lower portion by and large of our business that's one. And the other thing about supplies is that Kathy talked about the currency impact, but it is, is an extra outside of the currency. DMO is just a basket of uncertainty there, we managed very tightly, we try to get inventory levels lined, everything has to be managed pretty tightly by us there, so we don't get too far over skies. I think fundamentally, we don't see massive changes in the marketplace, particularly when you look at currency, but we do pay a lot of attention to it and also remember that's a small part of a business than some of our competitors.","Keith Bachman","Alright, fair enough. I will see the forum, many thanks.","Kathy Mikells","Thanks Keith.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citigroup.","Jim Suva","Thank you very much. My question is regarding the turnaround of operating services, if I do the math correctly, unless I'm mistaking, it looks like calendar Q4 will have operating margins 10% or above, is my math right and if so can you help us with your confidence and conviction there because it was literally at your Investor Day where Bob literally, we asked you, does he bluff these numbers, he has been at the company now for nine months and looked at the contracts and kicked the tires and toured, and he said yes and then we had a takedown as this year has progressed in this area, so you help us understand and do you actually have the visibility to kind of put your name behind it all as it has been a challenging area? And then my follow-up question is more or probably for Kathy on the cash flow side, varying cash flow held up despite all the stumblings and challenges they actually had this year in the takedown of lots of different things from revenues to margins to M&A, now that not coming through. So, are there things that are helping out cash flow one time this year, whether it is pension or reversals or something that we should be aware that are not sustainable. And the reason why as you know, numbers have perpetually been coming down lower, but cash flow has held up, I just want to know if that cash flow is still protected as we look forward long term in the model? Thank you.","Robert Zapfel","So Jim it\u2019s about our start. So, first your math is accurate. So that for us to deliver the commitments we've made we would expect to drive a two-digit number in the fourth quarter and I guess what I would go back to is we\u2019ve got a broad set of actions that drive that, you know if you will, hockey stick of improvement they start with the productivity that we talked about earlier and restructuring and taking costs out of our delivery model in cost base, it also includes a lower level of losses at our, in our health enterprise for portfolio, we think we've got sufficient contingencies for the unpredictability that we would see their, but that is part of our design model. I talked about the restructuring beyond delivery. ","We've got continued strong profitability in our document outsourcing business and it's got a seasonality that's heavier in the second half in terms of profit yield than the first half and then we are really committed to driving improved revenue dynamics. So we've been pretty visible all along that we thought that we would be at the lower end of the 2% to 4% revenue range, we've run at one for the first half of the year. So, mathematically we'd obviously have to get to 3% in the second half. We've got headwinds that dissipate relative to Texas and student loans. We've got New York ramping. On the other side of it, we will have less in the way of a inorganic revenue growth, but the combination of factors would get us to improve revenue dynamics in the second half and then that profit increase, it's part of for model. So, Kathy do you want to address cash flow or provide more color on.","Kathy Mikells","I\u2019ll go to cash flow. On cash flow, I\u2019d start with as you mentioned, our cash flow has really been strong for the first half of the year and we\u2019re very comfortable with where our guidance is. If you look at some of the charges that we've taken this year, especially in health enterprise, outside of the recent impairment charge which is obviously non-cash, some of those charges are just spread over the contract period where we are doing the health enterprise implementations and so while they have some case impact in the current year, the cash impact is really spread over a multiple year period. As we see declines in our technology business that actually throws off a reduction in working capital until we get a natural benefit there as well as actually just managing our working capital really well. And then finally the lower segment results are in part offset with a little lower restructuring. So as we look out to the back half based on where we\u2019ve been tracking year-to-date this year, we feel very comfortable about where we are at in meeting our guidance.","Leslie Varon","Operator, next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Shope from Goldman Sachs.","Matt Cabral","Yeah. Thank you. This is Matt Cabral in for Bill. So I wanted to better understand the thought process behind the announcement last week to limit health enterprise to the six states you currently have under contract. Was there anything that changed last quarter to necessitate this change? Are there any additional challenges that you see in ramping those four states that are up and running yet. There may be one is clear, three six once a ago and then related to that, just thinking to the longer term revenue target that you guys gave for the Services business, how much of that was predicated on extending health enterprise into additional states beyond the six that you currently have?","Ursula Burns","So, the decision to \u2013 I\u2019m going to have Bob follow-up from with the detail but I\u2019m going to start out with the top level decision. And the decision that we announced last Friday was one that was a fundamental strategic change and the change was not that we didn\u2019t want to be in health enterprise. We just want to get what we wanted \u2013 what we had underway kind of embedded down and tightly focused. We have big states, New York and California, New York just starting, California kind of in the middle of its journey and what I ask the Services team to do is to actually focus on those big implementations. The six states that we have, let\u2019s make sure we get those settle down and then we\u2019ll start to pursue to market again in the future if we think it\u2019s actually useful. So I\u2019m actually then have Bob get into the details of what we see in the states.","Robert Zapfel","Yes. I would just add that as Ursula shared, we are really trying to focus on success in those existing clients and we\u2019ve got the biggest states reference less to really deliver on long term to grow, the best way to grow is to have every customer completely satisfied. So we felt like our delivery capacity, you got to remember, New York really was just one at this point in the last conference call. And as we looked at how much capacity we had, the work to do in California, New York, Montana kind of across the remaining portfolio, we felt that we would be better served to center our resources there. There aren\u2019t that many new bids that come up. It\u2019s not something where all 50 states are rebidding every year. We have D.C. has a long shelf life, so we felt that we would be better both short term and long term to deliver world-class service and platforms with these accounts and then reassess after that\u2019s done whether we would pursue more opportunities in the marketplace.","Ursula Burns","In long term revenue dynamics, we do understand that we will have some backend pressure \u2013 backend meaning out year pressure. But as Bob said, the big thing here is that getting these six states done, we found historically that additional business comes if you operate really well. The quicker we can get them done and the quicker we can get them in line, I think that we can actually balance the revenue and the out years. That would be pressured if we didn\u2019t actually pursue. So I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re going to have significant issues in the out years due to this decision.","Robert Zapfel","And we\u2019ll have \u2013 just to reinforce, we will have visible growth year next year as we ramp New York. So this portfolio of accounts is not going to be a low growth business for us in the short term, but it is a longer term question that we think we can manage.","Matt Cabral","Thank you.","Leslie Varon","Thanks, Matt. Karen, next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex from Morgan Stanley.","Brian Essex","Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if you could start off, first of all, just revisiting the New York contract and maybe Bob you just mentioned and you\u2019re ramping in the next year, obviously we\u2019ve known for quite some time that you had this contract and you\u2019ve been pre-spending so to speak. May be help me understand or help us understand how you expect the trajectory of ramp for the benefits of that contract to be realized by the company. And then with this kind of 18 month implementation timeline, when did that clock start ticking? Are you well ahead of that or how do we think about hitting those goalpost and leveraging. You are now I guess fundamentally complete software development program and how you can gain confidence so you can hit that timeframe.","Robert Zapfel","Okay. Let me start, if I can Brian with kind of the delivery plan with New York, so there are two major release milepost, one is that the first quarter of next year and the second is that the fourth quarter of 2016, those set of deliverables along the way and we are on track across those deliverables. And the reason or might not the only reason but a reason that will after a good start as you referenced is we invested ahead. So we took the financial hit little bit in the fourth quarter and the first quarter from investing ahead. And our initial concept sessions with the state where we confirm designs have been very collaborative all going well. So at this point we are tracking well and as you may remember, New York is basically leveraging the platform that we\u2019ve built for New Hampshire which was just certified by CMS back in June. So it\u2019s now federally certified as a good platform. Relative to ramp on the reverence, Kathy do you want to cover that?","Kathy Mikells","Sure. We just started the contract in the second quarter and so it\u2019s going to be ramping through the rest of the year. We should exit the year with New York just under a point in terms of kind of revenue growth for overall services.","Brian Essex","Okay, great. And then maybe if I could follow-on the obligatory question on the Florida Toll road contract, any update there in terms of progression or what you might expect in terms of the timeline?","Ursula Burns","Yeah. I\u2019m going to take this one. We don\u2019t have an update is what we would expect and the one reason why is that we aren\u2019t predicting this. We have won the bid and we\u2019ve won the bid again. So we won the bid, it\u2019s not a question, but we now have an additional protest that\u2019s going to go through its cycle and when it\u2019s done, we\u2019ll get the business. We\u2019re not going to predict when that protest is going to be done because every time we seem to say something it delays. So it\u2019s going to impact.","Robert Zapfel","But we do think this is the last remaining potential protestee. So hopefully this is the last part of the cycle.","Brian Essex","Okay, very helpful.","Leslie Varon","Thanks, Brian. Karen, next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah from Brean Capital.","Ananda Baruah","Hi. Thanks, guys. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. I have two if I could as well. I guess the first is there seem to be a revenue component to the second half guide down with BMO and there seems to be Services margin component as well, maybe they got down for the second half of the year was a couple of penny. So the question is, what kind of tail should we expect these to have, the two dynamics to have as we think about going into \u201916. And to the extent that they do extend into \u201916, could you make it up anywhere and if not should we feel when we start to think about \u201916. I realize you\u2019re not going to give guidance. But if there is sort of like a $0.02 tail, $0.02 impact of these things in the second half of the year, should we think about having some kind of impact as we move into next year, and then I have a follow-up. Thanks.","Kathy Mikells","So the overall revenue dynamics that we are seeing really intact are stable and we have been expecting to see truck improve a little bit as a result of our execution in areas of growth. So while we are seeing good execution in a place like high end, it\u2019s being offset by developing market and not stabilizing but continuing to be a little bit soft both from soft economies in developing markets and from currency. I mentioned the fact that we don\u2019t adjust out developing markets for constant currency basis and so that kind of heightened the decline for us a little bit.","On Services, really the only change there is the fact that we are a little light on M&A and so that will make us a tad bit lighter in terms of just trying to accelerate growth in the back half. But it\u2019s important to understand the same way that the Services segment margin kind of ramps over the course of the back half. We have a very similar dynamic going on in revenue in large part because we\u2019re going to start to lack some big contract boxes. So you recall the loss of the Texas Medicaid contract, if we look at first half over second half that\u2019s worse about 2 points to us. So between that and New York we have quite good I say organic revenue growth dynamics naturally from half to half and throughout the second half of the year.","Robert Zapfel","Ananda, I would just say I know that we are guiding to the lower end of the range but I want to make sure that we understand that we are still in the range and we\u2019re going to try to do everything we can to overachieve that. But it\u2019s important \u2013 we are trying to hold ourselves to the commitment in the range that we have in both Services margin and in total EPS.","Ananda Baruah","And then hopefully the new restructuring actions, as the new wins that you have in search is going to actually scale up into the cost structure and help the revenue and the margins there as well. So those are both good tick up. And I guess as my follow-up just touching based on M&A again, as it was touched on earlier in the Q&A spend, maybe the third year where you\u2019ve been a little bit on the softer side of the target. My question is, at what point you guys start get a little vary of what\u2019s the longer term top line impact of these to the model, and you guys thinking of it in that context yet.","Kathy Mikells","So I think the things that we are doing to I\u2019d say change our approach and execution in M&A or what we need to do that actually get this engine moving for us more consistently and that\u2019s really pivoting from being opportunistic largely a pipeline of brokers deals to M&A and business development activity. That\u2019s led by our strategic planning and that strategic planning really yielding a team focused on where we have gaps in our portfolio and a proactive M&A activity where we proactively build our pipeline. That shift in overall approach, not a shift in strategy for what we are trying to accomplish through M&A but shift in the execution approach should help us to improve our hit rate. And if I had to kind of point to one soft under valley in M&A, it\u2019s that with a large part of our pipeline coming through broker deals. Our hit rate is not as high as we would desire it to be. So we are taking actions in order to change our overall approach so that we can be both very focused, right, and improve our hit rate.","Leslie Varon","Okay. Thank you, Karen. Next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan.","Tien-tsin Huang","Great. Thanks. Good morning. I\u2019ll ask a derivate M&A question. I\u2019m curious as all these healthcare consolidation especially on the healthcare payers basis, does that have any impact to Xerox in your overall healthcare business.","Robert Zapfel","We are fortunate that we are providers to all of the players that are participating in the consolidation dynamics and my business experience is if you\u2019ve got the acquiree as a client, that\u2019s not a good place to be. When you have both the acquirer and the acquiree, you\u2019re better positioned. So I would expect and we don\u2019t do the exact same work with each side if you will and some of the big visibly announced planned mergers. So I think for us, there is always the chance that you\u2019re going to get \u2013 you\u2019re going to be part of the synergy savings play and help those lead customers achieve their synergy savings. We think we were well positioned to participate in that because we are on both sides of visible transactions. We have very strong client referenceability and we tend to see the clients wanting to consolidate and leverage providers where they would be more likely even use us more broadly.","Tien-tsin Huang","Got it. Makes sense, Bob.","Leslie Varon","Thank you.","Tien-tsin Huang","Can I ask?","Leslie Varon","Certainly, one more question.","Tien-tsin Huang","I\u2019m sorry, just a quick one. Just on the signings, thanks for letting me sneak one more in, just on the services signings front, I caught the Florida comment, obviously New York coming in, I\u2019m curious any other larger deals that could be building up in the pipeline because systematically it sounds like bigger deals are coming back for the sector including within BPO, I\u2019m curious if you are seeing that as well? Thank you, I\u2019ll drop off.","Robert Zapfel","We\u2019re not really seeing an increase in what I would call the big multi or a $100 million or $100 million plus deals, but what we are seeing is we are seeing visible improvement in our pipeline, including the progression, so not just the \u2013 you know how many deals do we have to pursue, but where are they in the sales stage that we need to then leverage to drive improved signings in the second half of the year. That\u2019s our plan. ","Kathy Mikells","Thank you. Next question Karen.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha from Credit Suisse.","Kulbinder Garcha","Hi, both of my questions have been asked and maybe I missed...","Kathy Mikells","Can you speak up a little bit Kulbinder.","Kulbinder Garcha","Most of my questions have been asked, I just wanted to ask, have you given a number for the restructuring amount this year and what the normal level of restructuring going forward the company and then also what tax ratio you would be assuming? Thanks.","Kathy Mikells","So, I think, I am going to try and repeat the question just because I\u2019m not positive that I heard you, was your first question just asking about the level of restructuring generally?","Kulbinder Garcha","Correct.","Kathy Mikells","Yes. So, we have tended to do, I will call it about $0.02 a quarter or between $0.01 and $0.02 a quarter that ebbs and flows in different quarters as we look at and assess our business. We specifically guided to doing about $0.01 in the third quarter, you know and we will assess the fourth quarter as we get closer, but we do have an expectation that in the back half of the year generally our restructuring is going to be a little bit lighter. And I think your second question was overall kind of tax rate. We haven\u2019t changed our tax rate guidance. We expect to be between 25% and 27%.","Leslie Varon","Thank you. I think we have time just for one last question.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question for today comes from the line of Jamie Friedman from Susquehanna.","Jamie Friedman","Hi, thanks for sneaking me in lastly. There is a reference in the press release and sort of deep down there, but with regard to the new Hampshire contract and it states in there that Medicaid, I would just paraphrase them, Medicaid certified your retroactively to the April 2013 implementation date, I guess more generally, I was just \u2013 what the status of New Hampshire is, I understand it is launched and live, but what does that certification mean and is there any financial implication to the fact that it\u2019s retroactive?","Robert Zapfel ","Yes. There really aren\u2019t financial implications to the retro activity, but the certification really means for the other states that as they look at and work with us they [indiscernible] that platform not just that we are selling with its features, but that the feds and CMS agree that that\u2019s you know designed to meet the federal targets. Very good thing. A very good thing.","Jamie Friedman","That sounds like a positive. Thank you.","Leslie Varon","Great. Thanks, Jamie. So that\u2019s all the time we have for questions today. So let\u2019s wrap up.","Ursula Burns","So, as I said earlier, the second quarter was in-line, but we expect more and we are looking to deliver more. We are making choices that increase our short-term performance while retaining the ability to achieve our long-term goals. We are focused on delivering better results and improving the performance of our business and I thank you all for joining us on the call.","Leslie Varon ","Thanks, Ursula. That concludes our call today. If you have any further questions, please contact me or any member of our investor relations team.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a good day."],"22860":["Xerox Corp.

He's joined by Bill Osbourn, Chief Financial Officer. During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com\/investor.","At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and\/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without the express permission of Xerox. [Operator Instructions].","During this call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which, by their nature, address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein. ","At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Jacobson. Mr. Jacobson, you may begin.","Jeffrey Jacobson","Good morning, and thank you all for joining our call. We have two very exciting and important announcements to cover. First, today we reported strong fourth quarter results that demonstrate the successful execution of our strategic priorities. We also announced a transformational transaction in which Xerox will combine with Fuji Xerox, our long-standing joint venture with Fujifilm, to create a global leader in innovative print technologies and intelligent work solutions. We will spend the majority of the time we have today providing details on this value-enhancing combination. However, before we do so, I'd like to spend a few minutes taking you through the highlights of our fourth quarter and 2017 results. ","Turning to Slide 6. I am pleased to report that Xerox had a strong quarter that reflects the significant progress the company has been making. We delivered improvement across all key performance metrics. Xerox generated $2.7 billion in total revenues during the quarter, up 0.5% year-over-year or down 2% in constant currency. This compares to a 5.6% decline on a constant currency basis through the first 9 months of the year and, as we anticipated, represented a meaningful improvement to our revenue trajectory. This was driven by a 5% increase in revenue within our strategic growth areas.","Importantly, equipment sale revenue grew 4.3% or 1.5% at constant currency, which is the first quarter showing constant currency growth since the second quarter of 2013. This was enabled by our focus on capturing the growth opportunities in the marketplace. To do so, we expanded our channel reach, introduced new products for our graphic communications and high-end customers, and successfully delivered our largest ever new product launch. ","Our Strategic Transformation drove solid operating profit margin of 14.4% in the fourth quarter, up 20 basis points over last year, while supporting our investments in future revenue initiatives. As a result of our improving performance, we realized adjusted EPS of $1.04, up $0.04 over last year. Note that due to an estimated $400 million noncash charge related to the enactment of U.S. tax reform, GAAP EPS was a loss. Our solid performance during the quarter enabled us to deliver on our commitments for the full year and put us in a position of strength as we enter 2018. ","Turning to Slide 7. With these results in mind, I would like to take a step back and discuss the broader transformation that has been taking place at Xerox in the past year. When we held our Investor Day a little over a year ago, before the spinoff of Conduent, we laid out a comprehensive strategy focused on achieving two goals, first, increasing margins and enabling investment through our ongoing Strategic Transformation, cost and productivity program; and second, improving our revenue trajectory while increasing our participation in growing market segments.","This was intended to create a new Xerox that is more competitive and better positioned amidst the changing industry environment. Our progress in 2017 is a clear demonstration that we are delivering on our commitments and our strategy is working. We made progress toward improving our revenue trajectory by focusing on the strategic growth areas in production color, A4 multifunction devices and Managed Document Services, which represented 40% of our full year revenue in 2017, up 2 percentage points over last year. ","Our new ConnectKey portfolio received highly positive customer reception. Coupled with the expansion of our channel reach through the addition of 65 new dealer partners, this important launch drove improved fourth quarter equipment sales. We exceeded the annualized gross cost-savings target under our Strategic Transformation program by $80 million, reaching $680 million in 2017. As a result, we delivered operating margin expansion despite currency headwinds, while significantly enhancing our cost competitiveness. These cost savings also allowed incremental investments in our business and growth opportunities. ","Finally, as previously announced, we took important actions to optimize our capital structure this year, including pension contributions and the elimination of account receivable sales programs. While these actions had a near-term impact on our cash flows, they will simplify our business, drive future savings and put us in a better position to immediately generate stronger cash performance. As a result of how well we executed our plans, we closed the year in a much better position operationally and financially than we entered it. And we feel great about the solid foundation we have built as we aim to deliver another year of continuous improvement in 2018.","Turning to the next slide, you'll see a more detailed breakdown of the progress we have made on our Strategic Transformation program, which we initiated in the beginning of 2016. Our focused and disciplined process has delivered over $1.2 billion in cumulative gross cost savings to date against our original target of $1.1 billion by 2017. We expect to realize $1.7 billion in savings by year-end 2018 on a cumulative basis, exceeding the $1.5 billion we initially targeted. You'll find more details on our solid 2017 performance and 2018 guidance in the earnings release and supplemental presentation we put out this morning. We'll take your questions regarding our fourth quarter results during Q&A. ","I'll now shift my focus to the transaction we announced this morning. Turning to Slide 10. This morning, we announced our agreement with Fujifilm to combine Xerox with our long-standing joint venture, Fuji Xerox. As many of you know, we currently have a 25% equity ownership in the existing Fuji Xerox joint venture, with the remaining 75% owned by Fujifilm. In many ways, Xerox and Fuji Xerox perfectly complement each other geographically and in our competitive strengths.","Fuji Xerox is the leading player in the Document Technology business with an estimated $9.6 billion in 2017 revenue. They serve large, stable markets such as Japan as well as fast-growing markets in China and Asia Pacific. They hold the #1 market share in Asia and are widely recognized for their industry-leading R&D, manufacturing and sales platform. They also have a robust product portfolio, with 40% of revenues coming from growing market segments in Graphic Communications and Solutions & Services. ","The transaction we are announcing today will bring together 2 companies and will create a global leader in innovative print technologies and intelligent work solutions. Together, we will be able to better innovate, compete in fast-growing markets and deliver significant benefits for our customers, employees and shareholders. ","Before I explain the enhanced prospects of the combined company, I'll provide some background on what the joint venture structure looks like today and why we firmly believe that this is the best path forward for Xerox. ","Moving to Slide 11. While the Fuji Xerox joint venture has certainly been among the longest lasting and most fruitful partnerships in the history of the technology industry, there are significant opportunities to improve the operational and financial aspects of the relationship. The transaction creates a combined company that will be dramatically stronger and more competitive than either company is on a stand-alone basis. I would like to highlight the key dynamics inherent in the current joint venture as we believe it provides important perspective into the value of this transaction. ","Fuji Xerox is our most important supplier and a key partner in our R&D efforts. The company also has excellent manufacturing capabilities and an attractive technology portfolio with impressive solutions in inkjet, industrial print and workplace solutions. However, our ability to market and capitalize on these assets is somewhat constrained under the current joint venture structure for a number of reasons. Our inability to benefit from the growing Asian markets is an obvious one. But there are other inefficiencies and limitations that come with having 2 separate product portfolios, R&D road maps and supply chains.","The combination will allow us to break down these barriers of value creation and align the long-term strategic vision of the 2 companies. We will also be able to remove duplicative costs in R&D and corporate functions, and fully consolidate our supply chain to improve our cost position globally. This will significantly improve our global go-to-market competitiveness, which should drive increased revenue opportunities.","By gaining uninterrupted access to each other's IP and technology, we will be able to expand the breadth and reach of our offerings and streamline product portfolio strategies to better coordinate our innovation road maps. We believe this is the natural evolution of our joint venture with Fujifilm and will create a much more efficient partnership structure, driving toward one common goal of delivering world-class, innovative solutions for customers.","For further background, shareholders can find additional information about the current structure in the 8-K we filed this morning, which includes the existing joint venture agreement. ","Let's move to Slide 12 for an overview of what this transaction means from a financial and valuation perspective. We believe this transaction has the opportunity to unlock substantial unrealized value for Xerox shareholders. Xerox shareholders today own 100% of Xerox, which includes our 25% equity ownership in the Fuji Xerox joint venture. We neither control nor consolidate this equity stake in our income statement, and it is carried on the balance sheet at book value. Besides the operational inefficiencies I just described, this structure creates complexity in reporting as well as in how our investors model the joint venture interest. We believe this is resulting in a valuation disconnect in the marketplace about the true value of this joint venture interest. ","Consolidating the entire Fuji Xerox with Xerox will allow us to create a much simpler and clearer financial profile and realize the full value of this joint venture interest. Investors will be able to see our global financial results on a consolidated basis and value it appropriately. ","At the time of closing, Xerox shareholders will receive a $2.5 billion special dividend or approximately $9.80 per share. Beyond this substantial immediate cash return, they will own 49.9% of a much stronger and more competitive company. Further value will be created by capitalizing on significant growth and margin expansion opportunities, including $1.7 billion of cost savings by 2022, including $1.25 billion attributable to transaction cost synergies and $450 million attributable to Fuji Xerox's cost-reduction program.","To demonstrate the value that will be unlocked through these transaction synergies, here, we have applied an illustrative industry multiple of 7x to 8x EBITDA to 100% of the $1.25 billion cost synergies. Our shareholders will get the benefit of 49.9% of that amount. When we discount that to today, that would equate to about $12 per Xerox share. This new value represents nearly 40% of our share price, and that's on top of about $9.80 per share of cash dividend, making this a highly value-enhancing transaction for our shareholders.","Let's now move to Slide 13. We have been taking decisive actions to better position Xerox and have considered multiple options and scenarios to drive greater shareholder value. We firmly believe that this combination is the best way to create value for our company and shareholders. Here are the reasons why. By combining with Fuji Xerox, we are creating a global industry leader with approximately $18 billion in annual revenue, adding significant scale and reach to our current market leadership. We believe this is the right strategic evolution of our long-term alliance as it will allow us to optimize the current operating structure for greater efficiency and global competitiveness.","We are projecting to deliver substantial cost savings for the combined company totaling at least $1.7 billion in annual savings, with $1.2 billion to be achieved by the end of the second year post close. The combined company will also have an accelerated path to delivering revenue growth, with direct access to fast-growing geographies as well as the ability to participate in future growth markets such as industrial printing and emerging intelligent work solutions.","Combining the IP strengths and world-class R&D capabilities of the 2 companies will drive innovation in areas that customers are most focused on and which will address future demand. In addition, we will be able to leverage Fujifilm's highly value-added intellectual property portfolio and innovation capabilities. And finally, we will have increased financial flexibility to deploy capital towards strategic growth investments and capital returns over time. I will detail each of these compelling reasons for the combination shortly. But before that, I want to delineate the value-enhancing component of this combination for our shareholders. ","Moving to Slide 14. We see the value this transaction will create for Xerox shareholders as two-fold. First, Xerox shareholders will receive a significant and certain value in the form of a $2.5 billion special dividend immediately at closing, which is more than 30% of Xerox's unaffected share price as of January 10. Second, and more importantly, shareholders will become owners of a stronger company with enhanced growth prospects, significant margin expansion opportunity and a balance sheet that provides financial flexibility to invest in future growth, while delivering attractive capital returns to shareholders. By combining, we're immediately increasing the value of our shareholders' investment. ","Turning to Slide 15. We are excited to be creating this new company with our joint venture partner of 56 years, Fujifilm. We have had a great partnership over the years and look forward to leveraging that history to ensure our new company's success. Both Xerox and Fujifilm leadership teams have significant experience executing large-scale transformations, which will be highly valuable in executing the integration of the two companies and achieving our ambitious goals for the new Fuji Xerox. ","Slide 16 provides a snapshot of the combined company. The new Fuji Xerox will have truly global scale with $18 billion in revenue, presence in over 180 countries and already-established leadership positions in fast-growing markets. We will have a total market opportunity that is currently estimated at $120 billion, with an additional $100 billion future opportunity in adjacent markets in industrial print, leveraging our combined technologies. ","Innovation is in the DNA of both companies. Bringing them together will create a global innovation powerhouse with world-class research and development capabilities and industry-leading IP. And the financial profile of the company will be enhanced with an accelerated path to growth, significant cost savings and margin expansion opportunity, leading to high-teens operating margin and free cash flows of approximately $1.5 billion by 2020. ","Before I go into further detail about the combined company's long-term creation opportunity, I'll touch on a few details of this transaction on Slide 17. As I've mentioned, our shareholders will benefit from owning a part of a much stronger and more competitive company, with significantly-enhanced prospects for revenue growth and margin expansion. This will be supported by an expected investment-grade credit profile at closing. The combined company's capital return policy will be aligned with Xerox's current plan, maintaining a $1 per share annual dividend and at least 50% of combined free cash flow returned to shareholders.","As for the governance and leadership team of the combined company, I will have the honor to lead the combined company as CEO. I am pleased to announce that Shigetaka Komori, Chairman and CEO of Fujifilm, will serve as Chairman of the Board of the new Fuji Xerox. Mr. Komori has been a transformational leader at Fujifilm, having successfully reinvented the company. We will build a world-class management team, pulling from a deep talent at both companies. The new company board will include 7 directors appointed by Fujifilm and 5 independent directors from the current Xerox Board. The combined company will be named Fuji Xerox and trade on the New York Stock Exchange under our current ticker. We believe it is important to retain our brand's strengths in our operating regions, which is why we will continue to go to market as Xerox and Fuji Xerox in our respective regions. We expect to meet the conditions and obtain the necessary approvals to complete the transaction in the second half of 2018. ","Turning to Slide 19 and the strategic rationale I outlined a minute ago, I'd like to take a few minutes to walk you through a bit more detail on the many reasons why this deal is so compelling to Xerox and our shareholders. ","Turning to Slide 20. As I mentioned before, we're excited to create an industry leader with approximately $18 billion in annual revenue, which puts the combined company in the top ranks of global print technology businesses. Establishing this leadership position is especially important in today's competitive environment, which requires broad global reach and scale to be able to effectively and rapidly meet customer demands around the world. Bringing together the geographic, product and innovation profiles of these 2 companies will amplify our market leadership and enable us to more effectively compete for global deals and provide opportunities for future share gains. ","Turning to 21. This combination also creates significant cost saving and margin expansion opportunities. We expect to deliver our $1.7 billion in annual cost savings in total through 2022, with $1.2 billion of the total cost savings expected to be realized by the end of the second year post close. The total cost-saving target includes $1.25 billion in transaction synergies as well as a separate cost-reduction program that will be implemented at the existing Fuji Xerox joint venture and is expected to generate $450 million in annual savings. These amounts are all in addition to Xerox's ongoing Strategic Transformation cost productivity program. Given our proven track record of driving operational excellence and efficiencies, as well as our long history of working together with the Fuji Xerox team, we are very confident of our company's ability to deliver these savings. ","I will now go into more detail on the sources of these savings on the next slide. Of the $1.7 billion in total annual cost savings, a large portion of the reductions will come from cost of goods sold through supply chain optimization, such as manufacturing, sourcing, procurement and vendor consolidation. We also identified significant opportunities from the elimination of duplicative corporate functions and R&D spend. Finally, the Fuji Xerox joint venture is commencing a cost-reduction program immediately, which is expected to deliver approximately $450 million in annual cost savings by 2022. This program is specific to Fuji Xerox and is incremental to the synergy opportunities I just discussed. It will focus on driving efficiencies in manufacturing, R&D and SG&A as well as product portfolio optimization. We expect these efforts to be front loaded, with more than 70% of total savings being delivered by year 2 and 85% by year 3. ","Moving to Slide 23. This transaction is extremely compelling from a revenue standpoint as well. The combined company will have an improved revenue profile, with a greater mix of revenues from fast-growing markets in Asia Pacific. As you can see, Fuji Xerox currently has a strong presence in growing markets such as China and the rest of Asia as well as #1 share in Japan.","As I noted earlier, the combined company will have a nearly $120 billion market opportunity compared to the approximately $85 billion we were able to target as a stand-alone company. Upon completion of the transaction, Xerox will have the opportunity to participate in these markets while benefiting from Fuji Xerox's established leadership position and market know-how. The combined company will also have an accelerated path to future revenue growth as we integrate, including the ability to leverage each company's deep customer relationships, regional networks, shared IP, product portfolios and complementary distribution and service capabilities. ","On Slide 24. With 6 world-class innovation labs globally and nearly 11,500 patents, the new Fuji Xerox will have world-class R&D capabilities. Fuji Xerox's expertise in areas such as automation, security and analytics, will be highly complementary to Xerox's hardware and materials technology. Combining these existing assets with a nearly $1 billion R&D annual spend will enable us to sharpen our focus on innovative print technologies and work solutions, with the aim of accelerating our participation in the more rapidly-growing markets. Together, we will be well positioned to lead the future of printing and enterprise technology and capture next-generation growth opportunities. ","With that, I'll pass it to Bill to provide more details on the financial profile of the new Xerox.","William Osbourn","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I will start with an overview of the new company's financial profile and long-term targets, which will help clarify the significant value we're creating through this combination. As Jeff explained, the transaction we announced today will create a stronger company with enhanced growth prospects and margin expansion opportunities. And as you can see on this slide, we are expecting a rapid acceleration of the combined company's financial performance over the next 4 years. While we made significant progress toward improving our revenue trajectory over the last year, we continue to experience revenue declines. The combination with Fuji Xerox will allow us to accelerate our growth by providing access to key growth markets, unlocking synergy opportunities and leveraging each other's competitive advantages. ","We're starting from a base of $18.2 billion in pro forma combined annual revenues, and we expect to return to revenue growth by 2020. From an operating margin perspective, the cost-savings opportunities we identified will drive significant margin expansion over the next 4 years, with the majority also being realized by 2020. As we begin realizing the benefits from the targeted cost savings, we expect to achieve industry-leading operating profit margin in the high-teens by 2022, which compares to a blended margin rate of 10% on an adjusted basis in 2017. It is important to note that the lower operating margin rate for the combined company versus the 12.8% for stand-alone Xerox in 2017 is primarily due to backing out equity income and royalty revenue from the Xerox margin and adding Fuji Xerox in at a lower margin. ","We expect total restructuring charges of $1.4 billion related to the targeted transaction synergies and Fuji Xerox's separate cost-reduction program, which will be incurred predominantly in the first 3 years, in line with the progression of cost savings that Jeff walked you through. These will impact cash flows in the first few years, but the new company will continue to generate robust free cash flow, which is expected to reach $1.5 billion by 2020. Additionally, we anticipate approximately $80 million in annual tax dis-synergies associated with the transaction. ","Finally, we expect the transaction to be EPS accretive in 2020. Overall, this transaction clearly enhances the financial profile of both Xerox and Fuji Xerox. There is a very significant synergy opportunity over time, and this transaction allows us to go after both revenue growth and cost far beyond what we could do alone. ","Turning to capital structure and balance sheet. A preliminary high-level view of the pro forma capital structure of the combined company results in $1.8 billion combined cash and $8.6 billion total debt on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2017. This includes the transaction-related cash outflows of $350 million needed to pay down a mandatory pension contribution triggered by the transaction and debt associated with the $2.5 billion special dividend to Xerox shareholders at the closing, which will be funded by bridge financing that has been secured. Following the announcement and before the close, the new Fuji Xerox plans to put in place permanent financing, including an amended revolver. All Fuji Xerox and Xerox debt is expected to be retained in the combined company's balance sheet post transaction. ","As mentioned, the combined company will have a robust cash flow generation capacity, particularly beyond 2020. This will further strengthen the balance sheet and provide more financial flexibility for the combined company for attractive capital deployment, which I will discuss on the next slide.","The new company is expected to have an investment-grade credit profile and is committed to maintaining this over time. And the new Fuji Xerox will uphold the principles that currently underpin Xerox's disciplined return on investment approach. With an investment-grade credit profile, the combined company will have broad access to capital markets and the financial flexibility to support all its operations. We will remain committed to delivering an attractive capital return to our shareholders. The new Xerox will maintain the current Xerox's $1 annual dividend per share as well as the target to return at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders.","Moreover, our increased cash flows will enable us to make M&A growth investments. Having the financial flexibility to seize value-creation opportunities is key to our strategy of returning to revenue growth. Over time, the new company is expected to have greater capital deployment opportunities toward targeted growth initiatives, increased dividend and share repurchases. ","With that, I'll turn it back to Jeff.","Jeffrey Jacobson","Thank you, Bill. To conclude, today is a significant moment in the next chapter for our company and shareholders as well as the industry. The strong fourth quarter and full year 2017 performance we announced not only showed clear progress on our stand-alone strategic goals, but also provides positive momentum for the future and a solid foundation for the combination with Fuji Xerox.","We are energized by the opportunities inherent in taking our Fuji Xerox joint venture to the next level, combining 2 industry leaders in unlocking significant value while unleashing innovation for future revenue streams. The proposed transaction will create substantial value to Xerox shareholders through a combination of an immediate special cash dividend and the opportunity to realize value from the future growth of a significantly stronger combined company.","We are excited about the progress we have made at Xerox and the resulting performance improvement. While we work to finalize this transaction, we at Xerox remain committed to continuing our progress and further strengthening the company as we move into 2018. ","With that, I will hand it over to Jennifer.","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks, Jeff. Before we get to your questions for Jeff and Bill, I will point out that we have posted on our Investor Relations website the full set of our normal earnings slides to provide you with the details around our fourth quarter results. [Operator Instructions]. At the end of our Q&A session, I will turn it back to Jeff for a few closing comments.","Operator, please open the line for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research.","Shannon Cross","Thank you very much and congratulations on the deal. I just want to walk through quickly so people -- so I make sure I'm correct on exactly what you're getting. So effectively, if you're a Xerox shareholder today, you're getting $10 a share in the dividend, you're getting $12 effective benefit from a synergy that you expect to receive in the next few years and then you get 50% share in a company that for fiscal -- or sorry, for 2017, generated about $2.6 billion in EBITDA and you expect will maintain an investment-grade balance sheet.","Jeffrey Jacobson","So Shannon, it's Jeff. Thank you, and I think you've summarized it very well. So again, it's a $2.5 billion dividend that we have said is about $9.80 per share. There will be $1.7 billion in total cost reduction. That's the $1.25 billion in transaction cost synergies, plus the $450 million from Fuji Xerox. If you put a normal industrial multiple of 7x to 8x EBITDA on the $1.25 billion, I think we get to the numbers that you stated. And then they get 49.9% of a growing, thriving company that you mentioned. So I think you've nailed it pretty well.","Shannon Cross","Okay. I just want to make sure because I'm getting over $50 a share in value, so I just wanted to make sure that was correct. So with that then, can you talk a bit about, as we look at the company over the next couple of years, you've laid out synergies, but how are you thinking about, first, how the company is going to operate together? What are your first sort of focuses to make sure that go-to-market remains very consistent and then you can continue to see improvement, for instance, on the equipment sales side of things? And then can you talk a bit about like the goalposts we should look for? So again, we know synergies. But beyond that, are there things that we can look toward to see that this combined company is effectively executing?","Jeffrey Jacobson","Yes, sure. So Shannon, the most exciting part of this is, as you said, it's the go-to-market and it's the innovation aspect. The cost synergies drive tremendous value that you delineated in the question you gave. What I really like about this is when you go through integration, people worry about the integration complexity. What we're doing now is we get to participate in growing markets. So Xerox participated in about an $85 billion market that was declining at about 3%. We now have access through Fuji Xerox to a $36 billion market that's growing at 2%, with very large shares in China, Asia Pacific and Japan. And the beauty is we don't have to worry too much about complexity of integration or go-to-market because the go-to-markets for the most part will stay exactly as they are. What I get really excited about is when I look at the innovation and getting into the new markets by combining technologies.","One of the things in unlocking the value is we tended to have duplicative R&D. And now we're going to be able to divide and conquer. We'll be able to take the 6,500 engineers that this combined company has, that produces about 1,500 patents a year over the last few years and accelerate innovation in the areas of industrial print, which is a $100 billion market that is untapped for us today. You know the packaging market very well, flexographic corrugated labels, folding carton, that's still very much an analog market that's not digital. We can take our print technologies and move them into the area on non-paper substrates, printing on objects, virtual reality, Internet of Things, machine learning, voice activation for multifunction devices. So while the cost synergies will provide the value that you delineated, the future is all about the innovation and the growth and the access to the growing revenues.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.","Kathryn Huberty","Thank you. My congrats as well both on the quarter and the deal. I guess two questions. One, do you have a view yet as to whether Xerox's largest shareholders would be supportive of this deal? And then secondly, you just did a good job walking through some of the innovation and revenue synergy opportunities. How quickly do you expect Xerox to take advantage of some of the IP end markets that Fuji plays and that Xerox does not? Is that something you see happening over the next couple of years? Or are those growth opportunities beyond 2020?","Jeffrey Jacobson","Yes. So let me take the two-part question, Katy. So first, regarding the largest shareholder, we have not spoken. Obviously, this is a transaction that's been in the works for many months, so we have not spoken on that issue. So we just don't know, and we only know what we read at this point. With regard to integration and access, one of the exciting areas, if you were to look at inkjet as an example, right now, we have separate strategies for Fuji Xerox on inkjet, Fujifilm on inkjet, Xerox on inkjet. And you definitely know very well, Fujifilm has tremendous IP in the areas of inkjet heads, certainly ink capabilities as well, and we'll be able to leverage those. When we've talked about it and through the conversations we've had through this negotiation with Fuji Xerox, but certainly with Mr. Komori and the team at Fujifilm, one of the things was about how do we divide and conquer, how do we take the best technologies of what was all three companies and unleash it so that we can apply people who are working on some of the things I talked about, like in Palo Alto Research Center, whether it's augmented reality, Internet of Things, machine learning; and then we have people in our Yokohama facility in Japan working on the other things that we need to.","Now we do need to be a little careful because this will be the integration phase. So there are certain things we're allowed to discuss and work on, and there are certain things we cannot. So for the next few months, and we expect to close this transaction sometime in the second half, we can only do a lot of planning. And then hopefully, we'll hit the ground running upon the close.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital.","Ananda Baruah","Congratulations from me as well. Look, there's a million questions. I'll try to keep it short here, so I'll bundle. So do the synergies include -- the cost synergies, do they include what were the existing synergies or are the existing synergies incremental? And then I guess why not, if I read this right or heard this right, why not non-GAAP accretive in 2019 if you're closing in '18? And I might try to squeeze a follow-up in.","William Osbourn","Yes, a couple of things, Ananda. First of all, regarding the synergies. The $1.7 billion, the $1.25 billion combination synergies in addition to the $450 million cost-reduction program at Fuji Xerox, that $1.7 billion is in addition to our ongoing Strategic Transformation program, which we and our regular earnings document that Jeff went through briefly, up to $1.7 billion over the 3 years, approximately about $475 million. So those are in addition to the $475 million that we were doing in Strategic Transformation on our own. As far as accretiveness in 2019, there are -- there's a benefit, the synergies will be coming through relatively quickly as we're incurring costs upfront to obtain those. But our analysis is that we will be getting it in 2020.","Jeffrey Jacobson","Yes, Ananda, let me give you a little background on that as well. Because if you think about it, one is on the $2.5 billion we're going to have interest on the dividend. The equity income, we will no longer get. And then in order to do this deal basically, we're doubling the amount of shares, so if you think about it from that standpoint. So if you were to look at Xerox today, and let's just use a round figure about $8 billion market cap, and we deduct the dividend of $2.5 billion, let's value Xerox from that standpoint at $5.5 billion, we then double the share count; and that $5.5 billion, by doubling the share count, buys us 75% of Fuji Xerox, implying the $7.3 billion value. Now knowing the company and having worked with them as long as we have, we certainly view the intrinsic value as much more than $7.3 billion. So -- but it's really -- there are three factors, we normally get the equity income, we're doubling the shares and interest on the dividend.","Ananda Baruah","Got it. That's helpful. And then just last one real quick. The free cash flow generation, I think you guys mentioned $1.5 billion to start. And then I think there was a remark that, but it will be greater than that, and it would seem that it would have an opportunity much stronger than that. So could you just give us some context around that remark?","William Osbourn","Yes. I don't want to give specific guidance out beyond 2020. But looking at the significant cost of $1.4 billion that we'll be incurring to effect the synergies predominantly in the first three years, we don't expect those to be continuing on. And absent those costs, we would expect even significant free cash flow over and above the $1.5 billion we cited.","Operator","And our next question will come from the line of Matt Cabral with Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Cabral","So on the $1.7 billion in savings for the combined company, Jeff, can you just talk a little bit more about just how you arrived at that number? And how we should think about the net amount of that dropping through versus what you think you'll have to reinvest in the business over time?","Jeffrey Jacobson","Yes. So we've actually done a lot of work on that, Matt. And we've had numerous meetings throughout this negotiation process, and we've done a lot of work with both Fuji Xerox and Fujifilm, outside advisers, et cetera, as we worked through this. So the way I would look at it is, first of all, the total $1.7 billion, and again, that will be in excess of what Xerox is already doing as part of our Strategic Transformation program, that $1.7 billion will be by the end of 2022. Of that $1.7 billion, about $1.2 billion will be by the end of the second year post close, so let's call it 2020, which would be 70%; and 85% of it would be by the end of 2021 or the third year. Most of that $1.25 billion will flow right to the bottom line, okay? So the vast majority of the -- so I'd say on the $1.7 billion, somewhere in the neighborhood of about 80% will flow through the bottom line.","Matthew Cabral","Got it. And then just a clarification, a follow-up for Bill. So FX was a nice tailwind to revenue in Q4. The revenue guidance you gave was on a constant currency basis. Can you just help us understand how you're thinking about, as of today, the FX impact on both revenue and operating margins for 2018?","William Osbourn","Yes. We have modeled that in, obviously, to our guidance. And we do see it, based upon recent rates being a tailwind both from a translation currency perspective in '18 and from a transaction currency. As far as effect on profits, we're estimating that at least a $50 million tailwind and -- could be higher based upon recent rates for 2018.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Jim Suva with Citi.","Jim Suva","First, a question about the fundamental Xerox relationship as it is today, just stand-alone; and then second, more about this new relationship. So first of all, this year and -- well, in 2017, you launched several new hardware products. Just can you update us on how they're going? I believe they came out a little more staggered than what you thought. Are they completely all out the door now and into your retail distribution VAR channel? Or are they all trained? And when do we hit kind of the sweet spot of the most traction from those? And then I'll ask a follow-up question on the Fuji Xerox after that.","Jeffrey Jacobson","Yes, thanks, Jim. No, for the most part, the products rolled out just as we thought they would. So as we discussed before during Q2, there were about 4 A4 products that came out. So by the end of the first half, we had all 13 A3 products and 4 A4 products. And in the third quarter, we had the remainder of the A4 products come out. So if you remember at the last earnings call, we said we had some confidence, but we didn't want to get out too far ahead of ourselves. But based upon what we knew about our September equipment results, we had some confidence. The fact that, and I think the evidence is at constant currency, we grew our equipment sales revenue 1.5%, which was the first time since second quarter 2013 that the company has grown their equipment sale revenue line. So it's being very well-received. Our channel partners are growing to the tune of about 65 last year. And we're pleased with the trajectory and where things are moving.","Jim Suva","Yes. But my question was, is the quarter that you just printed, is that the quarter where basically, they're all in the channel, all your VARs are selling them and distributors are selling them, is that -- and that's kind of the best that it gets? Or is that kind of the early ramp of it, and in 2018, they really hit with a lot more force than even what we saw in this quarter, Q4?","Jeffrey Jacobson","Yes. So Q4 was the first impact that you had seen. Admittedly, it was coming off of a Q4 2016, if I remember, was down about 10%, a little bit of an easier compare. When we get to Q1, what you'll see is we were down about 5.7% at constant currency Q1 2017, compares now to these, we'll get into some relatively easier compares in Q2 and Q3. Q2 2017, we're down 14.6% at constant currency. And then Q3, we were down again double digit, but the thing is people ask all the time, is this something where you'll get four-quarter or five-quarter of benefit out of it? And one of the things -- we will get the normal four-quarter or five-quarter of benefit out of the new products, but the multi-brand expansion strategy is the thing that will prolong this for a while. And the reason I say that is I keep coming back to this $15 billion multi-brand reseller market that we really never participated in.","We only had about 1% market share. And as we can continue to grow the number of multi-brand reseller partners there, every share point is worth about $150 million. I'll also mention that as a result of the transaction, as we're going through best practices with Fuji Xerox, they have a similar, similar issue from the past where they haven't focused on multi-brand resellers. And it's an area that they're going to explore, too, which is part of the beauty of bringing these 2 companies together is comparing the best practices. As I mentioned before, their market shares in Asia are much higher than our market share. We're going to adopt their best practices as well.","William Osbourn","Just a follow-on to Jeff's comments, Jim, just we gave full year guidance in the regular earnings materials that we believe is very strong full year guidance. But just we've historically given -- look, we don't give quarterly guidance, but we give sort of expectations. And just from a revenue perspective at constant currency, we said full year down 2% to 4%. We would expect, just given it is a more challenging compare, as Jeff said, Q4 was a good -- I mean, Q1 last year was a good quarter, we'd expect to be near the lower end of that 2% to 4% on the full year guidance in the first quarter. And as far as our adjusted operating profit margin, our 13% to 14% in the full year is due to seasonality that we expect to be slightly below the low end of that range, but are fully confident in being within the full year range of 13% to 14%. As far as adjusted EPS, historically, we gave -- well, we gave guidance for next year of $3.50 to $3.70, $3.60 being the midpoint. And historically, the first quarter has typically been about 18% to 20% of the total, just to give people some guidelines what we're expecting in Q1.","Jim Suva","Okay. And then my quick follow-up is, are there any governmental approvals or antitrust or just any type of government approvals aside from the shareholder approvals we need to just keep an eye on for this pending transaction?","Jeffrey Jacobson","Well, any transaction of this magnitude, Jim, always has to go through government regulatory review and then shareholder approval, as you said.","Jim Suva","Right. But can you let us know which ones those are specifically, if you happen to know? Or we can do that on a follow-up call.","Jeffrey Jacobson","[Indiscernible] would be the most notable.","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Paul Coster with JPMorgan.","Paul Coster","To start, Bill, any view on where the debt will be issued and what kind of debt will be issued to support this? And Jeff, the more substantive question for you really is, is there any risk here of in product harmonization near term of one or other of the regions being disrupted, the clients kind of not being clear on what the product strategy is and there's some potential dislocation -- very short term?","William Osbourn","Thanks, Paul. Just a couple of things on the debt. As we said in our prepared remarks, we'll be issued at investment grade; we're confident on that. We have bridge financing that is committed to. We will, between now and the close, be looking to potentially issue public debt associated with the $2.5 billion dividend. But details on that to come, but we are evaluating.","Jeffrey Jacobson","Yes. And Paul, on the second part of your question, actually, it's a very fair question and one that most people would think about. In this case, we actually have benefit of bringing the 2 together, and the reason is this. Our 2 companies, even though they were separate, we combine R&D, we combine manufacturing, we do it for each other, but we actually make the same product. So the beauty of it now is now we'll go to things like a common controller so we won't have separate front-ends. We'll have synchronized introduction of new products. So as an example in the past, Fuji Xerox might roll out a product, and we wouldn't see it in our territories till a year later. We're going to have opportunities of also synthesizing our supply chain. When I look at areas, the thing that really excites me because -- while I've never run a manufacturing facility, I've run companies that had very -- been very intense in supply chain and manufacturing.","When we look at gross margin percentages, what happens is people always focus on price, and that's very important. But if you go back to the last three years at Xerox, our gross profit percentage has been relatively flat at 40% in a market that has price decline. The way we do that is we really get a lot of absorption and sweat the assets in our factories. We will have an even greater ability now to fill our factories in both locations, to sweat the assets, to get the right absorption, which is a real benefit of bringing that together. And again, as I mentioned before, the coordination between our R&D centers to unleash innovation, we'll be able to compete much more effectively on global Managed Print Services' deals to increase our win rates, best practice in shares. And then also, we won't have what I'll call the sharing of margin between the 2 businesses, which will be able to make us much more competitive on a global basis because we're not splitting the margin any longer.","Jennifer Horsley","Do you have another question, Paul?","Paul Coster","No, I'm good.","Jennifer Horsley","Great. Operator, I think we have time for one last question.","Operator","Our last question will come from the line of Steve Milunovich with UBS.","Steven Milunovich","So it looks like there's elimination of a lot of current inefficiencies. Are there going to be any issues in terms of integration, particularly in R&D culturally? You've got two headquarters. What are you thinking about organizationally in terms of dealing with that? It's been kind of an arm's-length relationship in the past. Now it's going to have to be much tighter.","Jeffrey Jacobson","Yes. Steve, actually, so first, I never want to minimize integration because integration is always complex. But again, this is a 56-year partnership, so everything we have done over the decade has been joint R&D, joint manufacturing, joint product development. Our people know each incredibly well, and they've been doing this together for a long, long time. So instead of it truly being 2 separate companies that have never worked together, this is a case where if we introduce a product that came from Fuji Xerox in the past, it was with great involvement from the Xerox people and vice versa. If it was Xerox introducing the product, it was with great involvement from Fuji Xerox. So from that standpoint, I think it'll be relatively seamless compared to most integrations.","Steven Milunovich","Okay. And I just want to ask about the sales margin, which was down. Is that because you're moving into more A4-type equipment? And where do you expect that to be heading?","William Osbourn","Yes. Clearly, we have a commitment to A4, which on the upfront has a lower margin than our A3 and high-end products. And -- but we do believe that, obviously, over the life of that equipment, that it is a very attractive margin. But upfront, as we are committing and building up our A4, we seem to feel there is some negative impact on margin.","Jennifer Horsley","Great. Thanks, Steve. That's all the time we have for questions today. If you have further questions, please contact me or anyone else from the Investor Relations team.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This does conclude our program, and you may all disconnect. Everybody, have a wonderful day."],"22739":["Xerox Corporation (NYSE:XRX) Q2 2016 Earnings Conference Call July 29, 2016 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Jennifer Horsley - Director, IR","Ursula Burns - Chairman of the Board and CEO","Leslie Varon - VP and Interim CFO","Jeff Jacobson - Head of Document Technology Business","Bob Zapfel - President, Xerox Business Services","Analysts","Matt Cabral - Goldman Sachs","Shannon Cross - Cross Research Group","George Tong - Piper Jaffray","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan","Jim Suva - Citi","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital","Brian Essex - Morgan Stanley","Keith Bachman - BMO","James Friedman - Susquehanna","Operator","Good morning and welcome to the Xerox Corporation second quarter 2016 earnings release conference call hosted by Ursula Burns, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. She is joined by Leslie Varon, Vice President and Interim Chief Financial Officer. During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com\/investor. At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and\/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without the expressed permission of Xerox.","After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which by their nature address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein.","At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns, you may begin.","Ursula Burns","Good morning. Welcome to Xerox's second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. On our first quarter earnings call, I made our three priorities for the year; achieving our 2016 financial plans, implementing our strategic transformation and executing the separation of the company. I also committed to you that we were pulling all the available levers and taking decisive action to achieve these objectives. Today, I am pleased to report strong second quarter results and significant progress on all of our priorities.","We delivered substantial EPS growth, adjusted EPS above our guidance and margin expansion in both our business segments, putting us on track to achieve our full-year guidance. We also reached major milestones in our separation process, and for our strategic transformation program and remain on track to meet our targets for both initiatives. I am more confident than ever in our ability to create two companies better positioned to compete in their respective markets and capture opportunities to enhance shareholder value.","Today, I will begin the call with an update on our separation and strategic transformation before moving to the quarter's financial and operating performance. As you know, in January, we outlined a two-part plan to create shareholder value and best position our businesses for the future, which we call our new path forward. The plan includes separating into two Fortune 500 scale, independent publicly traded companies by year-end and implementing a three-year strategic transformation program to deliver $2.4 billion in total cost savings from ongoing and incremental productivity and cost reduction initiatives across our businesses.","During the second quarter, we took important steps toward both the separation and our strategic transformation program targets. As a recap, I\u2019m starting with the separation. We named the two companies that will be created through the separation. The Business Process Outsourcing Company will be named Conduent Incorporated and the Document Technology Company will retain the Xerox name. We also identified the CEOs that will lead the two new businesses after the separation.","Ashok Vemuri who officially joined us at the beginning of this month will become the CEO of Conduent. Ashok comes with a successful background in the industry and experience in leading corporate transformations. Jeff Jacobson, whom most of you know from his invaluable work as the President of our Technology business will become the CEO of Xerox. Both are exceptional leaders with highly relevant expertise that will be critical to executing the go-forward strategy for each company. You will hear more from them as we approach the separation, and I look forward to working closely with both of them as we continue to build the foundations of the two companies and prepare them for standalone.","With future leaders of the companies in place, we have intensified our CFO searches for each company and Ashok and Jeff are in the process of identifying the rest of their leadership teams. At the end of June, we filed our initial Form 10 registration statement for Conduent with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This is a major step in the transaction that will separate the companies. The filing kicked off a review process with the SEC and we expect to update the filing in the coming months with additional information.","We have now scoped all costs associated with the separation and are providing additional detail. We are lowering our pre-tax onetime separation cost estimate to $175 million to $200 million. This is a credit to good cost management by the team, executing the separation process, and we have quantified one-time tax-related costs associated with the separation and expect them to be in the $40 million to $50 million range.","Finally, we estimate dyssynergy costs to total $40 million to $50 million. We expect those costs to be more than offset by savings from our strategic transformation program, which I will discuss now. We remain on track to deliver $700 million in annualized savings in 2016 and $2.4 billion in total cost savings over three years from ongoing and incremental productivity and cost reduction initiatives across our businesses. We are already seeing benefits as some of the margin expansion we realized in the second quarter was a direct result of these activities.","All in all, we made a great deal of progress on the company's new path forward during the quarter and I want to thank the strategic transformation and separation process leaders along with the Xerox management team for their efforts.","Now, I'll provide a high-level overview of our second quarter results, before I pass it over to Leslie for additional details. In the second quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.30, representing a 30% year-over-year increase and coming in well above our guidance range of $0.24 to $0.26. GAAP EPS from continuing operations were $0.15, up $0.06 compared to prior year quarter. Year-over-year EPS growth reflects fewer shares and lower tax rate and higher operating profits.","Total revenue of 4.4 billion was down 4% with minimum currency impact, reflecting a modest revenue decline in Services and improvement in Technology business revenue trend. Operating margin expanded 80 basis points year-over-year to 9.3%, led by a 240 basis point improvement in our Services business. Margin gains reflect sequential cost and productivity improvements across our businesses, including benefits from our strategic transformation program. We generated cash flow from operation of 177 million during the second quarter and ended the quarter with a healthy cash balance of $1.2 billion.","So during the quarter, we also had exciting wins in our businesses and bought several innovations to market. This was an important quarter for our Technology business with drupa, the biggest printing industry trade show, which occurs every four years taking place this June. We recorded strong sales in the Production Equipment showcased at the event. In addition, we shared details of our partnership with Koenig & Bauer Sheetfed Solutions Group, which we believe will be a game changer for digital carton printing, a growing area of the printing market.","On the Document Outsourcing side, Xerox Managed Print Services business was named the Services Quality Supplier of the Year by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles U.S. based on the success of the global MPS program we implemented for the automaker over the past year. We also launched 15 new automated workflow solutions for the manufacturing retail and higher education industries.","In our Services business, Everest Group ranked us as the Top Business Process Services Provider in its BPS Top 50 report just this week. The group also named our contact center outsourcing business an industry leader for the fourth year in a row. Analyst firm HFS Research also recognized Xerox, placing us in the high performance category for contact center operations and finance and accounting as a service and just this week, we were named to the HFS Winner Circle for human resource operations as a service.","In transportation, our work for SEPTA, the Philadelphia area mass transit system went live last month. The program, which runs on a new platform developed by Xerox is a major undertaking, bringing transit riders a new modern payment system. The first phase offers 10,000 riders the opportunity to buy cards for weekly or monthly rides on the subway, trolley and buses.","Our healthcare services business introduced a new offering, virtual health solutions, allowing providers to integrate a comprehensive telehealth strategy within their mainstream care delivery system. And Xerox Litigation Services introduced a new analytics as a service platform. The analytics hub provided corporate counsel and law firms real-time visibility into the big data that they manage every day. As you can tell, our industry experts are hard at work, building next generation solutions and capabilities and successfully implementing business that we have won.","I will now turn it over to Leslie, who will provide more detail on our financial results and 2016 guidance.","Leslie Varon","Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the earnings slide and cover the rest of the financials as well as our guidance before handing it back to Ursula to wrap up. Overall, quarter two was strong. Operating profit and earnings both grew with EPS above our guidance range. DocTech trends improved and we're building momentum in our cost initiatives. We have more work to do to capture greater productivity and turn around the revenue trajectory as we prepare to separate our two businesses. But quarter two was a very positive proof point and keeps us on track for the year.","Total revenue of $4.4 billion was down 4% at both actual and constant currency, benefiting from a market improvement in Document Technology revenue, which was down 6% in constant currency, while Services revenue declined 1%. I'll speak more about both segments in a moment. Adjusted gross margin of 31.4% was up 20 basis points year-over-year, driven by improvements in both segments, partially offset by a greater mix of services, which structurally has a lower gross margin.","Adjusted RD&E was lower by $19 million year-over-year and adjusted SAG was down $53 million or 6%. These expense reductions, combined with the gross margin improvement, resulted in operating margin of 9.3%, up 80 basis points year-over-year and a 5% operating profit growth.","Adjusted other net expense was better by $15 million year-over-year, driven by lower interest expense, while equity income of $22 million in the quarter was down $7 million year-over-year. Our second quarter adjusted tax rate of 17.8% was below our guidance range of 26% to 28%, benefiting our earnings by $0.025 due to higher foreign tax credits and the successful resolution of several audits. Bottom line, adjusted earnings of $0.30 was well above our guidance range of $0.24 to $0.26 and was $0.07 higher year-over-year, driven by the lower tax rate, fewer shares and higher operating profit.","Turning to Services, segment profit was up $55 million or 30% year-over-year, as significant margin improvement more than offset revenue pressure. Services revenue was down 2% at actual currency and 1% at constant currency. Document Outsourcing grew 2% year-over-year and reflects continued good growth in Xerox Partner Print Services. BPO declined 3%, driven by known headwinds, including the impact from last year's Health Enterprise strategy change as well as lower volumes and lost business as we continue to focus on turning around some underperforming areas. Our drive to improve profitability also factored into a lower than target renewal rate of 82%, reflecting our decision not to renew several underperforming contracts.","Total findings in the quarter were down 7% year-over-year, but up 2% for the trailing 12 months. The year-over-year decline was driven by lower new business signings, which reflects a tough compare due to last year's New York MMIS signing. We've strengthened our signings criteria, setting the bar higher on price, margin and deal term, particularly in customer care.","Margin and related improvement actions have been an area of intense focus and we were really pleased with the 9.6% segment margin. That's a considerable improvement, up 190 basis points sequentially and 240 basis points year-over-year. Benefits from restructuring and cost actions flowed through and we saw a good contribution to the margin increase across most business areas, including Document Outsourcing where margins are similar to Document Technology. These areas of improvement more than offset continued revenue and margin pressure from customer care where we are taking action to turn around these set of capabilities.","So key takeaways on Services. Document Outsourcing performance continues to be solid on both the top and bottom line. The set of strategic decisions we made in BPO last year, combined with our strategic transformation initiatives, are beginning to be reflected in our results, yielding improved profitability. This has impacted revenue growth. We'll continue to focus on improving our operational foundation and cost structure and then begin to put in place growth initiatives for the BPO business.","I'll now turn to Document Technology. Document Technology had a very strong quarter with both revenue trend and margin improvement. Revenue was down 7% at actual currency and 6% at constant currency, with equipment and annuity each down 6%. The equipment revenue trend improved, driven by mid-range, reflecting new product launches as well as better sales to small and medium sized businesses. Supplies revenue was down 6% year-over-year, slightly better than quarter one results. When we include Document Outsourcing with Document Technology, revenue declined 3%, a significant improvement from quarter one. This largely reflects the current revenue profile of the new Document Technology company post separation.","Turning to activity, within entry, A4 color MFD installs were down 9%, driven by declines in developing markets. Mid-range color MFDs grew 6%, driven by the new I series products launched in March. High-end color was up 14%, driven by growth in entry production color products.","Following a very successful showing at drupa, we expect a greater weighting toward higher end production presses in the second half. This doesn't necessarily translate to better install growth as it will drive fewer units, but at higher-value, which should result in good revenue and annuity growth over time.","Document Technology margin of 12.6% was up 10 basis points year-over-year and 240 basis points sequentially. This is in line with our historical and full-year margin expectation. We knew that quarter one was an anomaly, resulting from the lack of restructuring in the second half of last year, exacerbated by transaction currency headwinds. Quarter two margin reflected the initial benefits of the restructuring actions we ramped over the last two quarters and more modest transaction currency impact as well as equipment price declines at the lower end of our historical 5% to 10% range.","So, overall, a very good quarter for Document Technology. We're maintaining our strategic cost transformation focus and we expect continued good profitability in both Document Technology and in Services as we capture additional savings moving through the year.","Moving next to cash flow. We generated $177 million of operating cash in the quarter, reflecting net income and the strong underlying cash generation profile of our business model. Year-over-year, cash flow was lower, driven by working capital usage due to a reduction in payables related to lower purchases and payment timing, a $62 million Health Enterprise settlement payment, resulting from last year's strategy change, initial separation related payments as well as higher restructuring payments and approximately $50 million due to last year's ITO divestiture.","It's important to note that quarter two and first half cash generation are consistent with typical seasonality and position us to deliver our full year expectations. Investing cash flows were a use of $67 million and included $73 million spent on CapEx. Cash flow from financing was an $87 million use and includes $84 million for preferred and common stock dividends. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $1.2 billion and continues to provide us flexibility as we move through 2016.","Turning to our capital structure and capital allocation. We ended quarter two with $7.4 billion of debt, roughly in line with our year-end debt level. Applying 7 to 1 leverage to our customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt at the end of quarter two was $3.9 billion, leaving core debt of $3.5 billion. We continue to manage our capital structure to maintain credit metrics consistent with our investment-grade credit rating.","While it's premature to discuss the capital structure of the two future companies, all the financing assets and financing debt will go to the new Xerox Company, while the core debt will be split with Conduent. We'll share with you more about the capital structure and capital allocation strategies of Conduent and the new Xerox as we approach the separation. You should expect a continued focus on driving long-term shareholder returns with a strong alignment to each company\u2019s financial profile and market opportunities.","And to touch on capital allocation, we have a strong shareholder returns track record. And in April, we increased our common dividend by 11%. As we prepare for our separation later this year and as we've said previously, we're not planning to repurchase shares as we focus on launching the two companies with the most optimal capital structures.","Before I move to guidance on the next slide, I want to mention that while we're not planning to preview the Q2 Conduent results today, we will be filing them in a few weeks as part of the Form 10 amendment. I'd note that Conduent carveout financials will also reflect margin improvement, although not to the same degree as the Services segment. Conduent results include the student loan business, which resides in our Other segment. That business is in run-off and declined profit year-over-year as anticipated.","I'll now share with you our quarter three and our full year expectations. For the third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings in the range of $0.26 to $0.28 and GAAP earnings of $0.14 to $0.16. We're reaffirming our full year adjusted earnings guidance of $1.10 to $1.20 and our revenue guidance of a 2% to 4% constant currency decline. We're maintaining our segment revenue growth and margin guidance ranges for both Services and Document Technology, and anticipate for Services that we'll be at the high-end of the segment margin range and at the low end of the revenue range.","For the full year, we continue to expect GAAP earnings of $0.45 to $0.55. We continue to anticipate full-year restructuring of $300 million, including approximately $40 million in quarter three. Last quarter, we told you that we expected pre-tax separation costs would be in the range of $200 million to $250 million. We're deploying the same cost discipline in this area as we do across of rest of the business and have therefore, refined our range down by $25 million to $50 million. We now expect to spend $175 million to $200 million in pre-tax separation costs.","We've also now scoped the tax related friction costs associated with reorganizing our domestic and international legal entities to affect the separation and estimate them to be between $40 million and $50 million.","Turning to cash flow, we're maintaining our full year expectations of $950 million to $1.2 billion for operating cash flow and $600 million to $850 million for free cash flow. This anticipates both our second half net income acceleration and the strong quarter four working capital performance we've historically delivered. And finally, our capital allocation expectations remain the same.","So in summary, quarter two solidly puts us on track to deliver our full year guidance and we're confident on our trajectory entering the second half.","Ursula Burns","Thank you, Leslie. In summary, we're very pleased with our second quarter performance, which demonstrates our focus on execution and provides good momentum as we enter the second half. We exceeded our adjusted EPS guidance, made progress on margins and reaffirmed our full-year targets, all while executing at our separation and strategic transformation which will together, strengthen Xerox and the post-separation companies.","Moving to the second half of the year, our priorities remain unchanged. We will deliver our 2016 guidance, successfully complete our separation by year-end and meet our cost savings target for 2016 for our strategic transformation program. You will be hearing more from us over the balance of the year as we continue to hit critical milestones.","We will now open up the line for questions. Jennifer?","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks, Ursula. Joining Ursula and Leslie today, is Jeff Jacobson, Head of our Document Technology business and Bob Zapfel, President, Xerox Business services. Before we get to your questions, let me point out that we have several supplemental slides at the end of our deck, which provide more financial detail to support today's presentation and complement our prepared remarks. For the Q&A, I would ask participants to limit, follow-on and multi-part questions so that we can get to everyone. At the end of our Q&A session, I will turn it back to Ursula for closing comments.","Operator, please open the line for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt Cabral of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Matt Cabral","Thank you. Ursula, can you give us an update on your thoughts around M&A heading into the split, both in terms of your desire to do acquisition as well as if anything has changed around the view that you had previously that both businesses are not up for sale posts split, and that both make the most sense as independent public companies going forward.","Ursula Burns","Let me start with the middle question, which is the potential for sale of the businesses post-split. I think that we should probably wait till split to talk to the new leadership of those two companies to figure out what their plans are as we - as they proceed forward.","As far as our plans for M&A, we have still $100 million in our plan for M&A, fairly modest plans for 2016. We've acquired $18 million so far this year and we're still in the market and still have plans to try to spend the $100 million both in DocTech distribution primarily and in Services, small tuck-in acquisitions if we can find them in the areas that are important for us. I think I answered all of your questions.","Leslie Varon","Yes, Matt. It's Leslie. I'll just add a couple of things. Obviously, with the focus on separation, you can appreciate we are focusing less on acquisitions in the near term. But for sure, it is important longer-term for each of the businesses. So Ursula said that we've been light in the first half, having spent $18 million. We do have our sights set on some opportunities in the second half.","Matt Cabral","Thank you. That's very helpful. And then on the third quarter guidance in particular, can you just drill down a little bit more and help us understand the puts and takes around both revenue and the margin profile for both segments in the September quarter, particularly following the strong performance that you saw in Q2?","Leslie Varon","Yes. So Matt, you know we have stopped giving quarterly revenue and margin guidance. We stick to full year guidance at the segment level, although we do continue to provide earnings guidance on the quarter. I think what you saw in quarter two and I'll start with DocTech, is an important improvement and moderation in the rate of revenue decline, both for the Technology segment, down 6% versus down 9% in the last - in the earlier two quarters. And importantly as well, down 3%, including Document Outsourcing, which is an indication of what the new Xerox will look like going forward. We continue to expect that revenue trends for the second half of the year will enable us to be in line with the full year expectation for the Tech segment of down 5 to 7.","On the margin front, you saw important improvement in the margin in quarter two when you saw margin that's in line with our full year expectation of 12% to 14%. And that's what has underscored our confidence in reiterating the full-year margin.","On the Services side, we've said that we expect margin will be toward the high-end of the 8% to 9.5% range. But revenue will be somewhat more muted. In the first half, revenues were flat at constant currency. Our full year range for the Services segment is flat to up modestly. And we\u2019ve said we'd be at the low end of the range. So we believe that quarter two was an important proof point and you will see continued progress in quarter three and for sure in quarter four, which is typically our seasonally strongest quarter.","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks, Matt. Operator, next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross of Cross Research Group. Your line is now open.","Shannon Cross","Thank you very much. I wanted to talk about currency and more from a DocTech perspective, in terms of both what you're seeing from a pricing perspective, because given where the yen has gone, one would assume that may be pricing will be a little bit better this year, since the Japanese competitors won't be able to be quite as aggressive.","And then also from a Fuji Xerox perspective, clearly you had hit below the line. But just what - how we should sort of think about COGS movement and I know there's a lot of restructuring that can offset it. But I'm just trying to sort of gauge it as we go through the year.","Leslie Varon","Yes. Hi, Shannon. So a few things on currency. What we said about quarter two was we did see equipment price pressures at the low end of our historic 5% to 10% range. So we saw that as a positive signal. Obviously, the strength of the yen helps us in the competitive arena in the marketplace. Importantly on transaction currency, what we saw in quarter one was, it was a significant pressure on DocTech segment margin and in fact, pressured margin by about 100 basis points.","That margin pressure in quarter two was much, much more modest. It was about 20 basis points. And I think you recognize that in terms of the yen, we have both the currency risk sharing arrangement with Fuji Xerox. So it means that we see more modest impacts as we go through the year, both when the yen strengthens as well as when it weakens. And we have hedging in place, which also mitigate some of the impact. So we're pretty pleased with how we're positioned as it relates to the yen vis-\u00e0-vis our Japanese-based competitors.","Shannon Cross","Okay. And so if it stays like 103, do you feel very good about sort of everything that's in place because it\u2019s obviously moved a lot in the last few weeks?","Leslie Varon","It for sure has. And so once again, we have hedges in place. They obviously run out over time and so we'll mitigate the impacts and a currency risk sharing agreement with Fuji Xerox. And as you pointed out to the extent that the yen is stronger, it actually benefits our translation of Fuji Xerox equity income.","Shannon Cross","Right. Okay. Great. And then, maybe one for Ursula. Just as you think about and not specific cash flow generation numbers obviously. But the cash flow generation characteristics of the two businesses and as you start to sort of pull the companies apart, has anything sort of changed in the way how you're thinking about it or how we should think about it, as I guess, all the restructuring comes through. I guess I'm just kind of struggling to trying to figure out, what the right split is between the two businesses both sort of now and then when we get through or you guys get through this significant restructuring you're doing.","Ursula Burns","I think that you can think about these two businesses in the following way. The Technology business is a strong cash-generating business. It's in a very strong annuity based model. While we will be investing more actively in the Document Technology business, it will not substantially or significantly change the ability for us to generate cash in the DocTech business.","In the BPO business, its cash generation ability is a little bit weaker than the Tech business. We'll be investing more actively in that business as we separate and they go into Conduent. So nothing has changed from - our perspective hasn't changed on those two businesses on how we view the cash movements there.","Leslie Varon","So Shannon, the other thing I would mention is that 2016 is not a normal year for operating cash flow generation at Xerox. Our cash expectations of $950 million to $1.2 billion are muted by three things. Number one is the impact of the separation cost, which is a couple of $100 million. Number two is the impact of higher than normal restructuring, which is probably worth another couple of $100 million. And number three are the Health Enterprise settlement payment, which should pressure cash flow this year by about $100 million.","Jennifer Horsley","Great. Thanks, Shannon. Operator, next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Tong of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","George Tong","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Ursula and Leslie, you've reiterated guidance for Services revenue growth of 0% to 3% constant currency. Given the deceleration in constant currency services revenue growth you saw in the quarter, what factors in the back half of the year will help you land within your range?","Bob Zapfel","George, it's Bob. So I would say we had a couple of pressure points in the second quarter that will moderate as we go forward. And we were at minus 1 as you know, in constant currency for the second quarter. To be at the low end of the range, we need to be above 0 as we close out the third and the fourth. The pressure points in the second were really around - we had a very tough compare in public sector, the health in terms of some equipment sales that we had, had in prior year. We have the Health Enterprise, Montana, California, things have changed. That will dissipate as we go through the back half of the year.","And then we also got out of some kind of revenue flow that was not profit producing that won't really moderate, but will basically - we'll basically be able to cover for with our signings. So we do expect that we can meet the range that we had established. And as you know, we've really been able to translate some of that revenue thoughtfulness in terms of what we want and what we don't want to pretty solid margin improvement and the 240 basis points that we delivered year-to-year in the second quarter, we see the ability to continue to drive at the top end of the margin range.","George Tong","Got it. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, can you describe how your pipeline in BPO is performing? And whether you see any large deals or initiatives that can service a near or intermediate term catalyst for bookings and revenues?","Bob Zapfel","I would say our BPO pipeline has improved sequentially during the year. So the good news is that we do see sequential pipeline improvement, both in Document Outsourcing and in BPO. In all honesty, a little bit more aggressive on the Document Outsourcing side. But from a signing standpoint, we expect to drive new business growth in the third quarter. From a signings standpoint, we have seen a little bit of headwinds in terms of with the separation, decisional delays. And we're just working through that. So we expect to deliver better results in the third quarter year-to-year. But I wouldn't say that there's now some next New York MMIS that is so large that it would dramatically change the signings trajectory.","Jennifer Horsley","Great. Thanks, George. Operator, next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tien-tsin Huang","Hey, thanks. Good morning. Good to talk to you guys. Just on the Services margins, they're obviously good. It seems like there's a prioritization of margins over revenue growth. I'm curious if there's a lot more that can be done here in terms of moving away from some of the lower margin business, if things are coming up for renewal or what have you. Is there more? Or is this - was there anything unusual that we saw this quarter?","Bob Zapfel","No, I think. I'm sorry, it's Bob again. I think there wasn't anything particularly unusual. We are being more stringent as we look at new opportunities or renewals, if we're not able to make reasonable margin, it's time for renewal. We've got to convince the client that the service is worth more and they should pay more. And if we're unsuccessful with that, then we would rather move in different directions.","So I do think that we'll see that. We'd still like to drive more new business growth though. This is not a one-dimensional play. We're trying to not grow and improve margins. We are trying to and expect to see some improvement in the second half of the year in terms of our constant currency revenue growth dynamics.","Ursula Burns","And the margin improvement is not solely from the fact that we've made decisions on new business or re-signing of contracts. It's also pure operational management, literally looking at the cost base and managing the cost base downward, independent of signing or not signing new business.","Tien-tsin Huang","Understood. That's good. Just really quickly the sales cycle, just to be clear, just on the BPO front, any big changes in the sales cycle from the past quarter?","Bob Zapfel","I would say we did see some extension, especially in June where not only separation, but where some of the clients, where the Form 10 didn't come out until June 30, wanted to, Ashok is now so that's very helpful in terms of clarity on the new CEO. But we did have a little bit of a push out in June. But as you saw, our overall results were still reasonably okay on a trailing 12-month year-to-year basis. But I would say we did see a little bit of extension in June on some of our pursuits.","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks, Tien-tsin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva of Citi.","Jim Suva","Thank you and congratulations to you and your team at Xerox. A lot of work I'm sure. I have to questions, and they are kind of related. I'll ask them at the same time. First, on the lower renewal rate, it sounds like, from your prepared comments, that it was a decision not to go after lower profitability of work. Should we expect that to continue, and is that kind of one of the main reasons why the service profitability is underperforming so much, it's just a legacy of bidding too low or going after too low products or contracts? Or is it more that your costs are misaligned or things like that? Then the second question is you just mentioned an extension of some deals did not close in the June quarter. Did they close in early July? It kind of seems hard to believe that someone would wait to close it based upon the new name of the Xerox or who the new CEO is. And if that's the case, it seems like there's a risk that they maybe actually went away to a competitor. So did they close or did they go away? Thank you.","Bob Zapfel","We had a good start in July in terms of conversion of opportunities that we had initially been targeting in June. In fact, very large contract signing just yesterday. So I would say that, that piece and on the renewal rate, I mean, we're 85% year-to-date. We were a little bit lower in the second quarter and I think that we still see the ability to run in the 85% to 90% range. And if you get the right ones. So I would rather be 85% with the right mix that we re-won than be 90% with the wrong mix. And so I think we'll be able to deliver in the range as we look forward in the third and fourth quarters.","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks, Jim. Operator next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah of Brean Capital. Your line is now open.","Ananda Baruah","Thanks guys for taking the question. Two if I could. The first is can DocTech actually get close to flat revenue in the second half of the year? The reason I ask is because you are talking about seeing pretty solid momentum through the June Q, and you just put up - you have new products that are going to ramp I presume through the second half of the year coming out of drupa. And you just put up a 3% decline up from 3% comp, and the comps get pretty easy in the second half of the year. You have 4% to 5% decline constant in the second half of the year. So I'd love to hear your thoughts there. And then if it can't get back to down close to flat, maybe it's down 1% or something like that, not totally flat. I'd love to hear why that can't happen. And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.","Jeffrey Jacobson","Yes, this is Jeff. Good to hear from you. I think we have to remember, so first from the text segment standpoint, we reported guidance of 5 to 7 at constant currency, we're staying with that, I think you\u2019re talking more about that we put Document Technology and DO together, where we did improve from a negative 5 sequentially to negative 3. I think you have to remember is annuity is over 70% of our business, okay? So to turn that ship take some time, so you certainly, we won't be seeing that in the quarter or even next year. I mean, it's going to take a big part of the ESR turning. We do have plans in place for when we come out as Xerox, the new company for things we\u2019ll do will certainly be a little more aggressive in M&A appropriate so, but it will take some time to turn the 70% annuity to where we need it to be to get where you're pointing.","Ananda Baruah","Okay, got it. And you're right. I did read that wrong. So I have a follow-up on that, I'm going to hold that follow-up though because I want to ask this next one. So, a clarification on my math here. If you do the midpoint of the September you guide, the low end of your '16 guide, I think by my calculation you need to be $0.30 QoverQ in December Q, which if I recall correctly, is kind of the highest end of what you guys have done historically. So the question is, number one, given the strength of the June Q, is there some conservatism in any context taken into the September Q. And number 2 if there's not, then how do you actually just walk us through the mechanics of how you do the $0.30 to get to low end of the guidance range for the December Q.","Leslie Varon","So Ananda, its Leslie. First of all, it's been really hard to hear all of the elements of your question. But I think that jest goes like this. To get to the low end of our guidance using the midpoint of our quarter 3 guidance looks like our typical quarter 4 seasonality. And you would say agree. So the way we're thinking about this is that we will have the normal second half over first half uptick in profitability. And that will enable us to get at a minimum to the low end of the guidance.","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks, Ananda.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Brian Essex","Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I have a question for Bob, maybe if I could follow on to the question that Tien-Tsin asked, and maybe dig in a little bit more into the margins side of the Services business. And I think we are relatively comfortable with some of the services. One of the double-edged sword in the Form 10 is you saw how well some businesses were performing but certainly the commercial business stuck out kind of like a sore thumb. So, with regard to improving the performance of that business, I think you focused on a little bit signing better and more profitable contracts, but how much can be done on the cost side and what might be the trajectory of the margin improvement as you kind of work to improve that business? And then I have a follow-up.","Bob Zapfel","Yes, Brian. I'm sorry. So it's Bob. On commercial, as you know, the kind of the largest component from an offering standpoint of our commercial business is customer care. The other components, HR, outsourcing, learning, litigation, F&A are largely making good progress and are reasonable from a margin standpoint. So a big piece of our margin turnaround for the commercial customer set because it really is a customer set that buys a portfolio of offerings is really around the recovery plan that we\u2019re driving in customer care we bought in from the outside a couple of exceptional leaders. We\u2019ve got a big team over this. And we think it's not going to be an immediate that next month, we go from 0% to 10% margins. But we think we got a set of actions in place that we will really lift the margin profile of that component of commercial. We are honestly kind of blessed here. We got a great client set. We are ranked in the top quartile. So our problem is more our internal. So if we got the cost management crisp enough, but it's a business that we're able to win in and we've got the set of actions. And I do believe that we can then elevate back to reasonable margins in the commercial component of our BPO. Not as high as we get in public or healthcare where we got a lot of separate industry based IP and solutions. But reasonable within the portfolio of BPO, co-work, Conduent going forward.","Brian Essex","Got it. Maybe as a follow-up - I appreciate the color. As a follow-up, the stuff that's bucketed into other, some of the legacy run-off like student loans and other that are in that \"other category\", how much of a drag on consolidated corporate margins can we expect from those business? When might that stuff go away and at what rate might we see that decline?","Leslie Varon","So it will be a significant drag on Conduent quarter 2 financials. So when you see the Form 10 student loan as anticipated is in runoff and declining significantly year-over-year. And we expect that will continue throughout the rest of this year. But by 2017 should no longer be an issue.","Brian Essex","How much is student loan? What else is in there?","Ursula Burns","Any Other.","Leslie Varon","As it relates to Conduent, student loans.","Brian Essex","Perfect thank you.","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks, Brian. Operator next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman of BMO. Your line is now open.","Keith Bachman","I wanted to ask about the BPO question. If I look really in two vectors, if I look longer-term post-separation, Bob, if you just think about the pipeline now, is there enough to generate year-over-year growth in that business on an organic basis? And related, if the cash flow - all BPO businesses have a lower cash flow, and M&A is clearly a big part of the industry right now and has been for some time. What is going to be the ability of the Services business to leverage M&A to try to not only increase your growth rate but, more importantly, to increase the capabilities and skill sets and reach and all that goes with it?","Bob Zapfel","So let me start with the pipeline and the organic growth component. I would say that the pipeline is sufficient to get to modest organic growth and we would need to build the pipeline to elevate that growth rate to what would be our more likely long-term targets. I think on the M&A component, it's a little bit too early. We're going to be in the cycle as we get ready for Investor Day to talk more about the capital structure, debt, everything else. So I wouldn't want to comment at this point, relative to what the M&A prospects would be for Conduent.","Ursula Burns","Let me make something very clear. The strategy for this business, BPO before we decided to separate and post-separation, one plank of the strategy is going to be acquisitions. It is a business that had to acquire to fill out capabilities and to grow revenue and that will continue to be the case as we move into the Conduent business.","Keith Bachman","Okay. And Ursula, my question was more philosophical, is there going to be enough free cash flow to support that strategy post separation was really the nature of the question.","Ursula Burns","Keith, that's the question. I mean, that's the strategy. That's the plan. That's how we're going to structure these businesses. That's how we are trying to lay the foundation in '16 and our capital structure that allows us to operate Conduent strategically to win. And one of those elements is clearly to acquire is to have an active M&A business.","Keith Bachman","Okay. Great. And just one clarification, I wanted to follow-up with. Could you remind us what the limitations, one of the questions was will they remain independent entities post-separation, but what are the limitations from a tax basis on the ability to complete a transaction post-separation, the tax-free nature of the spin?","Ursula Burns","Well, I think that's something that you should probably call us and talk to Jennifer about later. We have it all comprehended, and Jennifer can bring it you in details. I think it would be a little bit complicated to get through right now.","Keith Bachman","Fair enough. I'll cede the floor.","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks, Keith. Operator, I think we have time for one last question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Friedman of Susquehanna. Your line is now open.","James Friedman","Good quarter here. Congratulations on the improvement in the margins. I just wanted to kind of dimensionalize what the possibilities are for the services margin in particular. Bob, I was wondering if you might have any metrics you could share about utilization. You don't disclose that in the Form 10, or at least in the preliminary Form 10. How should we think about that going forward? Your headcount is down a lot. I would think the utilization would be up. Anything you want to quantify if you could qualify it. I'll just do my follow up now. Could you share what percentage of your contracts were - as either a percentage of contracts or percentage of your Services revenue are losing money? Some of your competitors disclose that. It is just very hard to model the services going forward. Clearly great progress but without those two elements. Thank you","Bob Zapfel","Okay. So first on the utilization question. Your right to notice that our headcount dynamics have turned favorable. That is related not only to utilization. Honestly, we probably got more of the headcount reduction out of non-production workers more in the way of middle management, if you will, then just purely on the production worker component. We don't disclose utilization mostly because it's different in every business. The targets between customer care and transaction processing and HR outsourcing. But a big component of our strategic costs transformation play is around robotic process automation and trying to leverage technology to then increase that utilization rate. So we're managing - we're really, really trying to be very, very disciplined on headcount management. And that will clearly be a component of the ongoing margin lift that we need to drive both in Xerox Services and then downstream in Conduent. Relative to what proportion of the contracts are below water. We've really gotten a lot more sophisticated in looking at fully allocated P&Ls, which has helped us in kind of identifying something that may be didn\u2019t look so bad from a contribution margin standpoint we really need to do even better on. I wouldn't want to give you a hard figure, but it's not a high proportion of the contract. It's not as though out of our, you know, out all of our contracts that there is a big number of them that are below water and the ones that are were on kind of very aggressive active recovery plans.","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks, Jamie. That's all the time that we have for questions today. Thanks for your interest. Ursula, anything more to wrap up?","Ursula Burns","Yes. So as Jen said, thank you for your questions. This was a strong quarter for Xerox with margin improvements across our businesses and encouraging signs of improvement in the technology revenue trend. Going into the second half of the year, we are highly confident in our ability to deliver our three priorities, which are meeting our financial guidance, creating two strong companies - two strong independent companies; and driving our strategic transformation. We look forward to providing you with updates on our progress and more detailed looks at the post-separation company financials and business strategies in the coming months. Thank you, everyone for joining our call.","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks, Ursula. That concludes our call today. If you have further questions, please contact me or any member of our Investor Relations team.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today's conference.

She is joined by Luca Maestri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com\/investor. At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and\/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without expressed permission of Xerox. After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which, by their nature, address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein.","At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns, you may begin.","Ursula M. Burns","Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. We'll get started on Slide 3 with a review of what we're seeing in the marketplace and how it's affecting our business.","We began the year knowing we'd face certain challenges, especially as the European economies came under significant pressure as we made strategic investments to ramp our services growth. However, we did not predict the incremental strains on the business from more worldwide -- widespread economic uncertainty, especially in the United States.","During the third quarter, we experienced a much more constrained spending environment in the States. European economies remained weak, and developing markets were stable. Overall, our third quarter performance reflects shifts in our business as services become a larger portion of our revenue, as well as the dynamics of a challenging economy that's creating cost pressures for large enterprises and governments.","For example, due to budget constraints, less funding is available for major government projects. In the rare case, as we experienced this quarter, implementation on a committed project was halted even after we made upfront investments to get it off the ground. The resulting impact can be seen in our Q3 services margin, which came in lower than we expected.","The conservatism we're seeing in government has transferred to large enterprises as well. It leads to longer sales cycles, shorter contract durations and smaller related contract value. This is certainly a prudent way to manage operations in times of economic volatility. It's definitely how we're managing our business and how our clients are managing theirs.","It's also one of the reasons that we're seeing clients adopt Managed Print Services, which deliver cost savings quickly with minimal upfront capital investment. That said, when I review our third quarter results through the lens of what's happening in the marketplace, I remain confident that our strategy is sound, that our healthy annuity and our diverse portfolio help us mitigate challenges, and that our focus on cost and operational efficiencies give us the flexibility to invest wisely in growth and in building shareholder value.","So let's move to Slide 4. I'll provide an overview of the quarter. Luca will cover some additional details, and then we'll take your questions.","In the third quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.25. On a GAAP basis, earnings were $0.21 per share. This includes $0.04 related to the amortization of intangibles.","Total revenue of $5.4 billion was down 3% and down 1% in constant currency. It is important to note that the fundamentals of our strategy are delivering as expected. We're managing our Services business for growth and our Technology business to maximize profit. Our Q3 results reflect consistent progress in both areas, top line revenue growth from services and operating margin improvement from technology.","Services revenue was up 6% in constant currency. This includes a 9% growth in our BPO business, a 4% growth in Document Outsourcing and 6% growth in IT Outsourcing, solid across-the-board progress.","Services now represent 52% of our total revenue. Revenue from Document Technology was down 7% in constant currency. Equipment sales were more significantly impacted by economic and industry trends than prior quarters, especially in the United States and with large enterprises. We expect continued pressure in this area, and we remain clear-minded on the best way to invest in and manage the business.","For example, we're expanding indirect channels to capture more of the SMB opportunity, and in our mature, print-related businesses, we're maximizing profitability through a more efficient infrastructure.","Margins from our Technology business held up well in the quarter. Margins in Services did not. In addition to making planned upfront investments in several new services deals, which we knew will result in year-over-year margin decline, we saw the profitability of a few large government contracts become hampered by constraints in government spending, resulting in a greater quarter 3 margin decline than we expected.  So the major issues are understood but then, that doesn't make them acceptable. We're reacting quickly and working hard to mitigate the impact and get our margins back where they need to be. To do this, we are planning for additional restructuring during the balance of this year, which will be primarily focused on delivering operational improvements in our Services business. Luca will share more details on the related Q4 charge.","We generated $594 million in cash from operations, keeping us on track to deliver $2 billion to $2.3 billion in full year operating cash, and we're counting -- we're continuing to use available cash for acquisitions and share repurchases. The quarterly numbers give one picture, but understanding the breadth of our new company is fundamental to the value and the sizable opportunities in front of us. The Xerox brand is behind the scenes in many areas that may surprise you, areas where we're asserting leadership, we're earning customers' trust, and we're winning significant new business. Turn to Slide 5 for some of the examples.","It's important to note that many of our government contracts support nondiscretionary programs like Medicaid, which despite budgetary pressures, always needs to be fully funded. In fact, much of health care is nondiscretionary for providers and payers alike. Xerox had a deep expertise in the business of health care simplifying the administrative complexities and preparing government, employers, providers and payers for changing regulations. As a result, major insurers depend on Xerox to handle their call centers for Medicare claims reimbursement. And more and more health care providers are calling on us to help implement electronic health record systems, a rapidly growing business in which we are a key player.","Emerging markets provide another area of growth for us and reflect one of the benefits of Xerox acquiring ACS. Our brand strength is key to expanding outsourcing services beyond the U.S. We're able to tap into long-established relationships with enterprises around the globe to shift from being a Document Technology provider to a broader solutions partner.","For example, we're handling the transaction processing for clients in a major Latin American bank opening -- bank open new retail accounts. And in Russia, we're applying our IT and advanced imaging expertise to develop a new invoicing system for a large retailer.","Enterprise -- expertise and innovation play across several industries and are the differentiated advantage that we bring to clients who want more than a basic service. That's why McDonald's selected us to provide their restaurants' IT support in several regions and why we won $153 million deal to manage the data centers for a global energy company. We don't want for opportunities, and we're making meaningful progress in capturing them around the world and throughout our business.","Please turn to Slide 6. There are 2 important points that these numbers reflect. First, reiterating the increasing strength of our Services business as it becomes a larger portion of our total revenue and why we are so focused on acquisitions, innovation and global expansion to give us even more scale and diversified offering.  A year ago, Services represented 49% of our total revenue, and now it's 52%.","Second, a reminder of the significance of our annuity-driven business model. As you see here, 85% of our revenue was annuity. That's $4.6 billion in recurring revenue, up 2% this year. While equipment sales, the much smaller percentage of our business, is most impacted by economic and industry trends, we continue to benefit from the stability of an annuity-based business model that helps us deliver solid cash flow and earnings.","So in summary, this quarter presented its fair share of challenges, and we believe economic headwinds are still ahead of us. At the same time, we too are closely managing our operations to drive more efficiency and to give us more financial flexibility as our business dynamics shift.","In Services, again our emphasis were in growth and margin improvement, prioritizing investments in areas that provide the strongest return. And in Document Technology, maintaining our leadership in mature markets is a priority so we can continue to benefit from their profitable annuity streams. As important, we're pursuing key growth markets including digital color and SMB to help boost top line and bottom line performance.","Please let me turn it over to Luca, and I'll be back to wrap up and I'll open up the call for questions. Luca?","Luca Maestri","Thank you, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. I will begin by reviewing our earnings and then spend some time on our segment performance, cash flow and capital allocation.","During the quarter revenue declined 1% on a constant-currency basis. We expected Document Technology revenue to be pressured, given a tough year-on-year compare, and in the end, a decline of 7% at constant currency was about 1 point below what we expected, driven by weakness in equipment revenue.","However, segment margins remained healthy. In services, revenue continue to show strong growth at 6% constant currency, but margins were below expectations, driven by pressures on a number of government contracts, as well as lower volumes in some areas. As the result of these trends, we expect total revenues in Q4 to be flat year-over-year.","The margin dynamics in Services drove an operating margin decline of 100 basis points. The bottom line impact was partially offset by improvement in technology margin and continued efficiency and productivity actions on the expense side.","Restructuring was $18 million higher year-over-year, and as a reminder, is fully reflected in our adjusted results. Equity income was $9 million lower year-over-year, driven mainly by higher Fuji Xerox restructuring.","Given the impacts of macro uncertainty, the government budgetary environment and declines in Document Technology, it's important that we continue to proactively manage the cost base of our business. As a result, we will also be taking a restructuring charge during Q4, which we are in the process of assessing, and will likely be in the $50 million to $100 million range. This action will put us in a stronger position entering 2013 and will address productivity opportunities across the enterprise, primarily in the Services segment.","Adjusted EPS of $0.25 was down $0.01 from 2011 with the only adjustment to reported EPS being the amortization of intangibles.","Moving on to segment performance, and we'll start with services. We continue to see good revenue growth, up 6% during Q3. BPO revenue was up 9%, ITO was up 6%, and both were pretty consistent with the first half.","Document Outsourcing growth of 4% slowed a couple of points mainly due to lower volumes, but overall, it is showing good momentum. Year-to-date through September, BPO is up 10% constant currency, and the entire Services business is up 8%.","The 2 areas I would like to spend more time discussing are signings and margins, beginning with signings. Although they were up 19% sequentially, signings came in below our expectations and were down around 20% year-over-year. Certainly, 2011 was an outstanding signings year with several mega deals. In contrast, this year, we have had smaller-sized deals, contract lengths have been shorter, and we are seeing customer decision delays caused by the increased economic uncertainty.  Q4, we'll have another difficult compare, but we expect to see sequentially higher new business signs, and we remain pleased with our high success rate on renewals.","I also want to point out 3 positives that are not reflected in the signings data. Document Outsourcing signings, given reporting limitations, do not include Partner Print Services, which have been growing very strongly. Second, the improvement in renewal rate this year creates less of a headwind from contract losses as we move into 2013. And third, our pipeline is up 9% year-over-year, and it is at an all-time high.","Turning to margins, which were well below our expectations, we had anticipated sequentially flat margins, but we experienced a sequential decline of 120 basis points due to 2 primary factors. Government was the largest driver of the sequential miss. Within government, we specifically had to absorb in Q3 the defunding of a signed contract, which we got a write-off. Additionally, budgetary forces are preventing government from moving forward on historically routine infrastructure advancements, which is lessening our add-on services opportunities. The second factor is lower volumes in some transactional areas.","Given the view that this environment will not change in the near term, we will be looking to proactively manage our cost structuring investments to counter these pressures. Going forward, we expect sequential margin improvement in Q4 and for the foreseeable future, a Services segment margin range of 10% to 12%.","Let's now turn to the Technology segment. Technology revenue was down 7% and document-related revenues, which includes Document Outsourcing, were down 4% at constant currency. The decline was driven by a 15% equipment revenue decline and a 7% decline in unbundled supplies.","Equipment revenue decline reflects greater uncertainty in the macro environment with increasing pressure in the U.S. and continued weakness in Europe. It should also be noted that the trend in revenues is worsened by the prior year tsunami impacts, which disrupted supply in Q2 of 2011 and saw recovery in Q3. We estimate that this specific impact caused revenue deterioration between 1 to 2 points year-over-year in Q3.","Looking at product segments. We saw good growth in entry installs from new products and relative strengths in SMB. High end had good color install growth, driven primarily by entry production products. Mix in high end should improve with the recent launches of our latest iGen device and the new Nuvera platform announced at Graph Expo.","And lastly, mid-range was weaker, reflecting cautionary purchasing trends in large enterprises. This was the segment where we saw the greatest impact from the tsunami on the prior year compare.","We expect equipment revenue to be pressured again in Q4 and therefore, for total revenue to be down mid single digits in Technology.","Segment margin of 10.8% was up 50 basis points from 2011 and reflect a continued good cost and expense control, as well as a gain that we realized as a result of the sale of a portion of our finance receivables.","Turning to the Key Metrics slide. Services signings have been lower this year driven by less mega deals and decision delays, as discussed. But our pipeline remains strong, up 9% year-over-year. And with the improved renewal rate performance, we continue to be well positioned for good revenue growth in 2013.","Document Technology metrics remain relatively stable as does technology annuity revenue. Install growth is good overall. Machines in field is actually improving, and page volumes, although a bit weaker, driven by Europe, are still relatively in check.","The one metric to turn negative was Color revenue largely as a function of the lower equipment revenue and the tsunami compare.","If we now turn to the next slide, I will take a moment to review Q3 cash flow. Cash from operations were the source of $594 million, $228 million higher than Q3 of 2011. Through September, cash flow was $807 million, $124 million higher than in 2011. This is in line with our expectations, and we remain well on track for $2 billion to $2.3 billion of operating cash flow for the year.","Looking specifically at the drivers in the quarter, net income and depreciation were a source of $627 million. Cash contributions to our global pension plans in Q3 were $73 million, which was $152 million lower than 2011, primarily due to the timing cadence this year versus last. Through September, pension contributions were $310 million versus $348 million in 2011. For the full year, they would be about $75 million lower year-over-year, driven by the change in funding requirements brought about by recent pension legislation in the U.S.","Working capital, including finance receivables and operating leases, was essentially neutral to cash in the quarter. Within this, accounts receivable was a $390 million use of cash, and finance receivables was a $412 million source. The driver of this movement was a change in our lease financing strategy, which resulted in cash proceeds from a finance receivable sale of $314 million, offset for the most part by lower accounts receivable factoring.","In 2012, we have undertaken a thorough review of our leasing strategy, which validated for us the operational value and strong financial contribution of our leasing business but also identified some opportunities in our approach relative to the diversity and matching of our funding to our leases. We have a plan over time to improve the efficiency of our funding and employing a modest amount of finance receivables sales such as we did this quarter is one element of that plan.","Moving down the cash flow. We spent $140 million on CapEx consistent with our annual forecast of around $500 million and deployed $156 million on 3 acquisitions, which support our services expansion and SMB distribution strategies. Dividends paid were $69 million, and we repurchased 361 million of stock for a total of 718 million repurchased through Q3.","On the next slide, I will cover in more detail our capital structure and our progress on capital allocation. Our Q3 ending debt balance of $9.4 billion reflect the typical seasonality of our business. We expect strong cash generation in Q4, as usual, and we continue to plan for $8.6 billion for year-end debt. The majority of our debt, $5.4 billion, of the total $9.4 billion debt balance is in support of our financing of Xerox equipment to our customers.  The finance debt is calculated assuming a 7:1 leverage of our finance assets of $6.2 billion. These finance assets represent committed revenue streams from our customers.","Shifting to capital allocation. We are well on track to meet all our objectives for the year. Free cash flow will be in the guidance range of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion and will be deployed in line with our original commitments. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 718 million shares and continue to expect to repurchase 900 million to 1.1 billion for the year. We will spend $243 million on acquisitions, and we expect to be in the $300 million to $400 million range full year. And dividend payments will be in the $300 million range. So we are confident to meet our commitments on all fronts. During our November investor conference, we will provide a view of our capital allocation strategy for 2013.","In closing, we have seen increasing headwinds in areas more sensitive to the economy, and we will continue to adjust our business as appropriate to respond to these pressures while continuing to invest in the growth of our Services business and maintaining leadership in Technology.","With that, I will hand it back to Ursula.","Ursula M. Burns","Thanks, Luca. Let me quickly wrap up so that we can get to your questions. Until we finalize our restructuring plans for Q4, our earnings guidance does not include the expected charge. But it does comprehend our concerns that economic challenges will continue putting additional pressure on the business.","For the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted earnings of $0.33 to $0.35 per share. That brings us to a full year adjusted EPS of $1.07 to $1.09, which is at the low end of our previously stated guidance. This macro environment calls for resiliency and the ability to quickly adapt to marketplace dynamics. That's our focus, and we remain confident that our strategy is sound, and our execution will effectively deliver solid results.","Growth in services, increase in annuity revenue, market share leadership, disciplined cost management and on track performance with past generation and capital allocation. These are all key drivers to build more value in our business, and we look forward to sharing more detail with you at the investor conference next month.","With that, I thank you again for joining us today. As we get to your questions, I know you'll have to -- you'll want to dive deeper into trends especially in our Services business. So as in the past, Lynn Blodgett, President of Xerox services, will also join us for the Q&A session.","Let's open it up for questions, and I'll field them and ask Luca and Lynn to chime in as well. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","I guess, Ursula, just to sort of take advantage of having Lynn and then, this is probably for you as well. I guess, could you bridge for us the Services operating margin this quarter? What was the impact from the government constraints and I guess the deal that you saw that kind of got shut down? And I guess you also mentioned in some of the press release comments, some contracts that were standing up. Are those -- is that a separate issue from what you referenced? And I have a follow-up, if I could.","Ursula M. Burns","Okay. So let me step back and just do a little bit of a Service walk through, and then I'll ask Lynn and Luca to add anything if they want to. So first on a year-over-year basis, margins, as I said, were down about 250 basis points. This is in line with what we expected, pretty much what we expected to happen as we stood up contracts from -- that we signed last year. So contract ramp is one of the pieces of margin pressure, and then what we saw in addition to that, which drove sequential margins to be lower than we had expected were 2 unique items. One is a contract, this is the first time that it's ever happened in the business that we can see that we had signed and committed with a state that was defunded after we had started to actually invest in that contract to stand it up. And we're still working with the state to actually come to some kind of a reasonable conclusion, but we took a write-off this quarter with that -- for that expense that was not matched with any revenue. In addition to that, and that's a significant hit but a unique area. This is something that, like I said, has never happened before. And this is not in an area that is what we would call discretionary. It was not in the Medicaid area or any of the nondiscretionary areas. This was in a segment of the business that the state actually had an option on, and they actually opted to move out. In addition to that, we were seeing kind of across the board, not at a very high level but hitting a little bit everywhere, is volumes are on transactional. Some of the transactional portion of our business is a little bit lighter than it would have been in the government alone. That alone, would not have been a big concern. We would have expected that in a down economy, but the combination of those 2 things, particularly at the end of the quarter, which we couldn't outrun, was the reason why we actually had sequential out of -- out-of-the-expected range margin performance in Services. I don't know if anything else that you want to say, Lynn, on that.","Lynn R. Blodgett","I think that was well said.","Ursula M. Burns","Yes, so that's what we saw in margins. What we expect on a go-forward basis for the remainder of the year and one of the reasons why we're taking the restructuring charge which like I said we'll -- like Luca said we'll spend more time on in the investor conference, is to align -- to make sure that we can align our cost on a more cautionary and restricted go-forward spending environment in 2013. As we do that, we'll be able to bring the margins more in line in a tighter range, probably not in the 11% to 13% range but probably in a 10% to 12% range, we'll be more short of our ability to actually deliver in that range.","Lynn R. Blodgett","And I think, there's one other thing. What we're seeing and as Ursula said, Medicaid contract is not a discretionary program, and that funding is very rock-solid. There is some level of discretionary spending associated with those contracts like a system enhancement or whatever. And what we saw this quarter and what we expect to continue to see given the pressures on states is a little tightening or significant tightening on that discretionary spending. So what we're doing with the restructuring is to make sure that we are aligning the organization to deal with that new reality, and that's where we're moving forward on and confident that we can do it.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","And just a quick follow-up if I could. Ursula, on the December quarter guidance, you don't have the charges in there yet. So should we assume that once you get the charges, a handle on the charges, I know you guys gave a range on the call. By my calculations it's something like $0.04 to $0.07 potentially in that range. Is it possible or is there potential that you could reduce the guidance once you get a better handle on what the charges are? I just want to make sure we understand what the context...","Ursula M. Burns","Yes, so the answer is yes. There is more than a likely potential that we will reduce the guidance. We will not be able to comprehend inside the numbers, a range of $0.03 to $0.06 that the $50 million to $100 million currently represent. We have to work further on this. I mean, we literally are going through the planning process today, now and as we speak. We'll have a lot more information at the investor conference but you should assume that the quarter 4 earnings that I talked about does not include and will be impacted by the restructuring charge.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research.","Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC","I guess, I want to follow up on the Services commentary and just sort of are you seeing revenue resets within contracts or -- I know you talked about lower volumes, but I guess, I'm still struggling with sort of what has changed with regard to how your contracts are priced or your positions in the last couple of years? And, Lynn, maybe if you could even give a little bit more perspective from the standpoint of the restructuring. One of the question I had is basically how much restructuring have you done in the past within ACS? I mean, is there sort of low-hanging fruit that will be easy to pick? Or it's always seemed like you've run a pretty tight ship. So how should we think about that?","Ursula M. Burns","So let me start -- let me open up with the question about Services resets, et cetera. No, we're not seeing a reset in contracts. We're not seeing contracts that have been signed in states across the board asking for new pricing structure or to open them up, not at all. Actually, not at all. What we are seeing though is contracts are generally made up of 3 different buckets. One is the basic contract that you saw -- and maybe 2 different markets, the basic contract that you sign, State of California, State of Texas, whatever it is, structural contracts, for example, in Medicaid. That contract is priced and signed and baked into our ongoing operations. In addition to that, generally almost all the time, there are additional add-ons that come after that contract is signed. Once the state knows what they're doing and what we're doing, they ask for additional add-on work to upgrade a system, to refine a collection process, to find fraud, whatever the add-ons would be. What we're seeing is not the core contract changing at all. That's contractual, which is good. But what we're seeing is those little add-ons that would normally come, that are normally baked into how we would actually manage the business are long, are harder in coming. So harder in coming, so they're not doing as many of them, longer to get if they are doing them, it's a lot of work to get them to agree to do them, or not happening at all. And so those -- that's the part that we have to adjust to, this normal work that we would have seen outside of the discretionary portion. We're now going to have to assume that, that work for the foreseeable future will be significantly constrained for states, and that's what we're actually taking a restructuring for. As far as the restructuring for services, I'll let Lynn go into it, but for the company in the last couple of years and as we've taken restructuring, it has been focused almost solely on our Technology business and getting our Technology business infrastructure aligned more to the realities of the revenue on a go-forward basis. So we have not taken since ACS has come on and as part of Xerox, restructuring has focused heavily on the Services business.","Lynn R. Blodgett","Yes, I think that the issue of us running a relatively tight ship, I think that's true. And I think that's been true for a long time. This has been a very good exercise. We don't like the fact that there isn't as much discretionary money there. But what we have done because of the reality is that we've gone through the organization sort of top to bottom and said, \"Okay, even though we have a good, a very good organization, what can we do to make it better?\" And so we've looked at a very methodical approach to spans some layers and reporting structures and have just gone through and scrubbed the organization. So when we finish this, we will be far more competitive. We've been able to take out costs in some areas that actually have surprised some of our operating people where they say, \"We thought we had that thing tuned about as well as we could,\" and we found, by going through this methodical approach, that there were things that we could improve upon. So we think the organization is good, but we feel like there are reasonable things that we're doing now that will make us more competitive that will deal with this problem of the discretionary and when that restores, which I believe it will in the future, we'll be that much more better positioned.","Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC","Just one follow-up, if I could. If you could talk a little bit about the trends you're seeing on the Technology side, because, obviously, all the questions have been focused on Services, just in terms of demand in Europe and North America, and maybe linearity in the quarter. And then that's my question.","Ursula M. Burns","Okay. Great. So I'll do this quickly. What we're seeing is a continued downward pressure on equipment sales in Technology. The thing that actually we didn't see in quarter 2 that we did see in quarter 3, and we expect to see in quarter 4 and it's not totally that surprising to me when I look out at most of my clients who are reporting around the same kind of environment that we're reporting in is equipment sales in North America across the board in large enterprises in particular, in government in particular are definitely stressed. Europe continues to be very weak. We're not seeing a lot of uptick there. And if anything, we're seeing a little bit of additional headwind. DMO developing economies continue to be pretty stable, a little bit of weakness, but I mean pretty stable. They're outperforming all of the other regions. U.S. is the place that we saw a fairly significant downturn in equipment sales, actually. The equipment sales performance in North America starting in the middle of the quarter and definitely towards the end of the quarter definitely accelerated from a downward perspective. So we're seeing pressure there. From a competitive standpoint, we're not seeing -- we're seeing the same -- the good news is everybody's facing the same environment so we're not losing ground. As a matter of fact, we still hold the #1 equipment revenue share. We're still a leader in color, et cetera, but we're seeing a dampened environment just across the board in general in large enterprises. SMB, a little bit better, and large enterprise is definitely pressured.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Barclays Capital.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Could you talk a little bit more about the factoring of your finance receivables? It looks like it was responsible for over $300 million of the cash flow. Is this something you're going to be doing from now on? And I got to say like you're factoring finance receivables, it just doesn't seem to be something a company with healthy cash flow would need to do and I was wondering what went into that decision and how you balance that.","Luca Maestri","Ben, I'll answer that. As I thought I had explained during my remarks, the reason why we did that transaction is because we really did a very careful review of our leasing business during the first 6 months of 2012. And we clearly identified an opportunity to fund this business better, and increase the diversity of the sources for that business and do a better matched funding of our leases. So we implemented this transaction in Q3. As I explained before, as part of this change in strategy, we certainly generated cash from the sale of finance receivables. We generated significantly less cash from the typical factoring that we do. We, at the end of the day, when you look at working capital in full, it was actually flat. So we did not generate cash to working capital during the quarter. And the gain that we realized actually proves the fact that the funding that we were able to obtain on this transaction is significantly better than the funding that we were able to obtain previously. So as we go forward, we will continue to look at different possibilities to optimize the funding of the leasing portfolio, and it's certainly not an issue that is around our ability to meet our range in terms of cash flow, nothing to do with it.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","How are we supposed to take these gains? Because you guys can obviously do these transactions. This one was $0.01. In addition to the cash flow, I mean, if services margins continue to be weak, is this where we're going to get the earnings power to make up for it? What's the philosophy behind these gains? I mean, it's $0.01 this quarter, how many is it going to be in upcoming quarters in terms of these gains, and is this what we're going to use to offset the Services margin pressures?","Luca Maestri","It's really nothing to do with that. We're really looking at how we can fund a leasing portfolio that is a very profitable business for us, and it's a great way for us to be more competitive as we go to market with our customers. And so we're going to be looking at ways to reduce the funding cost over time, and it will depend on the structures that we're going to be able to find in the market. They will depend on the geographies that we're going to be looking at. So we don't have a firm plan around this, and it's totally independent from how other segments may be doing or not. And as you know, we report Services performance completely separate from Technology, and so we are very focused on the measures that we're willing to take on the Services business.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I just wanted a clarification on Services. What -- so I assume it's California Medicaid and how much more business do you have with California that's at risk? And I guess why wouldn't every other state kind of see what California's doing and do the same thing given these tough times? And then I have a follow-up.","Ursula M. Burns","By the way -- yes, so I just want to make sure we're very clear. We did not refer to California Medicaid as the state that had anything to do with the defunding of the contract. That has nothing to do with California Medicaid, nothing at all. It's really important to understand that. I don't want California to get pissed at us before...","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, I'm sorry. That was mentioned as an example, I guess?","Ursula M. Burns","We didn't actually say anything about California, but California is a very big contract, but they are not defunding anything at all. They're -- I'll have Lynn...","Lynn R. Blodgett","Yes, I think absolutely the defunding was at a different state and...","Ursula M. Burns","And it was not a Medicaid contract.","Lynn R. Blodgett","Yes, not Medicaid. It was a project that would be considered as discretionary. This has never happened to us before, and it was a very singular kind of experience or event. But where you could be thinking about California is that we did say that discretionary, what would be systems maintenance, some of the sort of discretionary system improvements that we normally see in our Medicaid contracts, we're not seeing as much of that, and that would apply to the state of California.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Well, I apologize. Just the question though still is I think has some valid points is that what state was this and could it go into every contract you have with that state? Because I assume that you talk to each other.","Ursula M. Burns","Yes, the answer is we're still working with the state so I prefer to not actually state what state it was and will not. And the likelihood of it going into other contracts is -- I mean, it's infinitesimally small. This is a very unique situation with a very unique state with some very unique politics in that state. So, and we are -- by the way, we've gone through our contracts. We're pretty sure that we do not have an issue that is going to spread across the contracts that we have.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.","Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So you guys have given us a ton of data here on what's going on in Services, but I don't want to beat a dead horse but frankly, there's still obviously a lot of confusion here. And I think I'd like to focus more on how we should think about your government exposure in general. Government and state and local conditions have been very weak for a while. This has been a concern for investors for a while, and we've seen other companies that have taken hits on in over the past year and past few quarters. But the argument for Xerox had been that your Services business wasn't as exposed to this dynamic primarily due to the unique nature of the Services model and the types of contracts you had exposure to. So can you help us understand what really changed in this most recent quarter that suddenly impacted profitability, and why it was a surprise? And I guess, perhaps helping to answer that, can you give us an idea of what percentage of your government-exposed Services business is what you would define as discretionary?","Ursula M. Burns","I'll have Lynn take it.","Lynn R. Blodgett","Yes, I think it would be -- as far as the overall sort of sensitivity to economic conditions and our government portfolio, I think it's really a tribute to the resiliency of the portfolio that even though government, state governments' budgets have been under pressure, as you said, for quite some time, and we have been able to really continue in the face of that pressure. What has happened quickly was this defunding of a contract was an event, unanticipated event that, as we say, we've not seen before and don't expect to see that. And it was not one of our discretionary programs, it was in a -- it was in a discretionary program not a nondiscretionary. And as far as the percentage of revenue in our Government business that is -- that we would consider discretionary, this is an estimate on my part, but it's certainly less than 10%.","Ursula M. Burns","Most of our state work is in -- large bulks of the revenue are in the health care sector, and that's generally mandated by some law or some edict, and that's where we participate a lot. California's there, Texas is there, these kinds of contracts are there. We do have contracts though, smaller percentage of it about 10%, 15% of them that are other things. I mean, we do call-center work for people that are not associated with the mandatory side of the business, and those would be more susceptible to this kind of work. But even with that susceptibility, we've never seen it happen before. It turns out that we do have, as a business, a very strong position in government. We provide services, a lot of them nondiscretionary services to government. And as governments are pressured, we have to pay significantly more attention to that portfolio of business. No doubt about it. But as the largest buyer in the United States, it's really -- it's very difficult for us to figure out a way to run a successful business without serving them. And up until this one contract, we've served them very well. And even in this quarter, we're serving them very, very well. Revenue is growing. Our participation in contracts are growing, and we just have to make sure that we pay very, very close attention to and count on downward pressure from the discretionary portion of the government budget. And that's what we're doing, and that's what we're going to do with our restructuring charge.","Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So just to clarify the defunding issue that Ben was asking about, you generally view that as a one-time issue but the discretionary portion of the portfolio is the reason why you're adding this restructuring and lowering the targeted margin range for the intermediate term?","Ursula M. Burns","Absolutely. And one of the things that we're -- we're just seeing a lot -- the headwind from just a softer economy, it's a bad thing to say but it gives you the opportunity to step back and say, \"Whoa.\" If this is the trend that we're going to see for quarter 4 and 2013, which is what we're assuming, let's go back and let's literally start to scrub everything, scrub it down and as we start to see opportunities arise and expansion, we will match that expansion but we can't assume that we're going to have a lot more upside in 2013. Revenue is holding very well in services across the board in all lines. BPO, ITO and in Document Outsourcing, we're seeing good revenue. We're continuing to expand around the world, Europe and Latin America. And we are very, very, very focused on assuring that the biggest contracts for sure, but all of them have the right cost to match the revenue on the minimum level. So what the restructuring will do is actually take out any service provision that we have, any cost that we have associated with an upside, we're going to manage these things to be very, very tight. And that will give us some breathing room in a tight economy. That's the strategy going forward. It will be interesting to say one last thing on this. We watched the quarter as the months went by, so month 1 in the quarter, month 2 in the quarter. This problem that we had with this particular contract we worked till the last day of the quarter. Literally, we didn't know that we would not end up on the right side of this until the very, very end of the quarter and which is, which goes to show just how tightly this piece of business actually came forward. This is not a widespread move that we saw. We were actually working this till the very end.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gaurav Gupta with BMO Capital Markets.","Gaurav Gupta","This is Gaurav for Keith Bachman. I have a couple of questions as well. I guess the first question is on the services but more on the signings front. I know this quarter, the signings have improved significantly sequentially. So I guess the question is, given all the commentary about the weak economic environment impacting both the government or the commercial side, are you seeing any changes in the competitive environment? And what I mean by that is any change in the structuring of the deal or the pricing? And within the category, are you seeing more strength in the BPO, ITO. I guess you mentioned the pipeline is up 9% and what does it imply about the margin guidance for the next year? Is it actually more on the 10% side versus the 12%?","Ursula M. Burns","So there's like 5 questions in there. I'll start with Luca on -- in the beginning and then we'll kind of walk down the question.","Luca Maestri","So I think I'll try to give you a few points. Yes, I think the increase in the pipeline represent the fact that we are quite competitive in the marketplace and the fact that there have been decision delays. So that decisions that we thought would get to a contract signing during the Q2 and also Q3 have been postponed, right? So but those are not bids that we have lost to competitors, and therefore, the pipeline has been growing. Across the board, we see relatively -- of course, pricing is -- because of the tight environment, pricing has some level of pressure. We see that probably, particularly in Document Outsourcing in our NPS [ph] dates, particularly in large enterprises, there is more pricing competition than maybe we've seen in the past. And that is what gets reflected, of course, on the services margin side. And that's why it is so important for us to adjust our cost structure accordingly to reflect the existing environment.","Lynn R. Blodgett","And I think the other thing that has impacted us is that we have not had this year the kind of mega deal volume that we had last year. Last year was a record for us, and this year, the deals have been typically a little bit smaller. And if it's not a mega deal, it tends to be a little bit shorter. So the duration has been a little shorter, the size is a little smaller, and that has had an impact. One thing that I think we need to make sure people understand is that we talk a lot about renewal rates. And last quarter, there were a lot of questions about it. Renewal rates are as critical to growth as bookings. And this year, we had higher renewal rates than last year to the tune of about $110 million of additional revenue that we didn't lose, if you can think of it that way. So that essentially offsets a significant decline in bookings. Now we want bookings to be as high as we can get them, but the positive renewal rate will help us with growth even if bookings are a little bit lower than they were last year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alban Gashi with Credit Suisse.","Alban Gashi - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess, just looking again at the services margins that you guys have for the quarter, it's about 1.2 percentage points lower sequentially. And if we look sort of some of the things you outlined in the government as being more onetime or due to the write-offs, how do we sort of think of the 1.2% allocated between sort of the more of the transactions and the write-offs and the government versus sort of more longer structural trends within the sector and then sort of how can you guys get back to your historical range of 11%, 13% for the segment?","Luca Maestri","That's a good question. When you think about this write-off that we take, we should be thinking it was a number that was over $10 million. And so when you think about percentage points, you would say there was a 120-basis-point decline. It was possibly half-and-half, half of it was kind of write-offs that we had committed to take in the quarter, and the rest is this more systemic issue that we need to address through restructuring.","Alban Gashi - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. That's great. And then also last quarter, you sort of talked about new business signings as being more of an area that you guys like to focus on. That was up last quarter, and then you also indicated that next quarter should be an increase from the current quarter. What was it in the current quarter?","Ursula M. Burns","New business signings in the current quarter were weaker than they were in the previous quarter. We did have good renewal rates this quarter, but new business signings were down. Signings across the board were down. And I just want to make sure that you heard what both Luca and Lynn said. We're not losing these signings to competition. It's literally they're taking a lot longer to sign now. So the pipeline is big. The pipeline grew by about 9%, and what we're seeing is people taking a lot more time to -- both large enterprises and government are taking a lot more time to make a decision on a contract. But they're still up and open, and we're not losing them to competition but --  and they should be higher in quarter 4 or this quarter, the current quarter.","Lynn R. Blodgett","And they actually were year-over-year as Ursula said, they were down. But sequentially from Q2 to Q3, they were up about 19%, and we expect that trend of increasing sequentially to continue in the fourth quarter.","Ursula M. Burns","But it is a very, very important metric and one that we keep an eye on. And we want to make sure that if we don't sign that it stays in the pipeline and we don't lose it. And that's the key thing. But the trend for contract negotiations and contract just nibbling back and forth is definitely one that's going towards the longer side not towards the shorter side.","Alban Gashi - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's it. I guess just one final question on the inventory levels on the technology side sort of what are you guys seeing on the channel I guess just globally?","Luca Maestri","Inventory levels were very much in line with our historical ranges. We didn't have anything particular on the inventory side.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.","Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","My first question goes back to this problem contract. I'm curious how this happens. My understanding that terms and conditions are pretty well set in the original contract. I'm just wondering around the scrutiny you place on these deals and whether or not you're taking outsized risk to close deals in this tough environment.","Ursula M. Burns","The answer to this latter part of the question is we are not. We do not take outsized risks. But we are extremely focused on that independent of size. One of the things that we have learned we learned it from ACS, we learned it from our Document Outsourcing business is that Ts and Cs and risk review is a big portion of the management of this kind of a business. So we are not taking outsized risk. I cannot get into all of the details. The more I get into the more specific, it will become and the more -- we'll probably have a public disclosure that I don't want to have until we actually manage our way through this with the state. Suffice it to say that we don't take outsized risk. It is very, very unusual. We think it is unusual as well, which is why we're still working with the state, and it is not something that should be considered to be like a natural outcome. The terms and conditions are generally written in a way that we can actually -- almost always written in a way that we have recourse.","Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And just a follow-up. Thinking about the 2013 model, you're guiding to about flat revenue in Q4. Bookings and services have been tracking down north of 20%, and you have some tough compares from a revenue standpoint, et cetera. Do you think you can hold revenue flat in 2013 or should we expect revenue to decline?","Luca Maestri","Of course, we're going to give you total visibility in mid-November when we have the investor conference. But at this point of the planning process, we feel pretty confident that the revenue dynamics both in services and technology will continue. And so we feel confident that we're going to be on the positive side of revenue growth getting into 2013. Again, I think it's important to keep in mind revenue -- renewal rates have been good this year, we got a strong pipeline and there is very...","Ursula M. Burns","Revenue is there. I mean [indiscernible].","Luca Maestri","There is money to be allocated to acquisitions as well.","Ursula M. Burns","Right, exactly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.","Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I have 2 questions, if I could. Just following up on Services. It's been a pretty hot topic throughout the year in terms of the targets or the pursuit of improved operating margin and also gross margin. And some of your commentary earlier today seems to almost suggest that some of this perceived weakness here in the third quarter was actually anticipated, but we didn't really get that sense in the last earnings call. So can you kind of help us reconcile that commentary, please?","Ursula M. Burns","Yes, please.","Luca Maestri","So when we had the call, the Q2 call, we talked about sequentially being more or less flat going into Q3. And what you will see is that we missed by 120 basis points, which as I explained before when you break it down, about half of that miss was driven by one-off charges. And we talked about particularly this defunding of a contract, and the rest was related to these additional government pressures around discretionary spending, change orders in particular and some lower volumes in some transactional areas. That's what happened. I think very clearly we are disappointed with the level Services margins have gone and the miss is about 120 basis points, versus is what we told you 3 months ago.","Ursula M. Burns","But it's important to note, Mark, that we had told you that what we are tracking to is we knew that we'll have -- we thought that we would have sequential expansion, from quarter 2 to quarter 3, but we knew we would have year-over-year pressure, right? So we thought it would be about in the range quarter 2 to quarter 3 about flat, but we knew we would have sequential pressure on margins -- I mean, a year-over-year pressure on margins, and so that part is not changing. We're not -- we are seeing the year-over-year pressure. The difference that we saw this quarter, which is -- disappointing is a mild word, which is angry, is the fact that we actually had one contract that we had to literally take a write-off on and that we have some pressure in some of the transactional volume perspective. If it was only transactional volume, I would actually have felt a little bit better about the quarter.","Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, appreciate that. And then my other question is just around the magnitude of the deterioration. Clearly, your tone in your commentary is a lot more marked here in terms of the incremental deterioration since the July earnings call. I just wanted to get a sense in terms of especially in the U.S. sector both for government and large enterprise, when did this all kind of start to manifest? What month? And then as you went through the rest of the quarter and then into this month of October, has it stabilized or is it getting worse? And then kind of a follow-up to that is, are you starting to see some customers now as a result of the macro pressures drive to a reduced number of preferred service vendors to try to contain costs?","Ursula M. Burns","So let me start with the first. We've seen weakening of the U.S. economy throughout the quarter. So in the first, I don't know, we can like to say the first month or the second month or third month but by the time September rolled around, it was very, very clear that we were headed south from a U.S. economy, and then it was starting to become clearer even earlier in the quarter. I've spent a little bit of time with other CEOs and with other business leaders, and it is clear to me that we are seeing a dampening of enthusiasm in North America or in the U.S. for sure. We see continued weakness in Europe. So I think that we saw that expand throughout the quarter, and we're expecting it to hold for quarter 4. We're hoping that some settling of the economy comes in the beginning of the year, but we're not counting on it. That's that. As far as your second part, the second part of your question about I think it was, are we ready or are we prepared, was that?","Lynn R. Blodgett","This idea of, are customers wanting to consolidate suppliers. I think that, that has been a movement for quite some time. It's expensive to manage a large portfolio of suppliers. And so that idea of consolidating to a few larger and smaller number of suppliers has been going on now for 2 or 3 years. And we haven't seen a marked increase or decline in that.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Ursula, a question for you as you kind of lead your company during this challenging economic time. When you look at the strategy of leading them, is there anything if we continue in this challenging state that you're looking at changing or refocusing or anything that's going to impact your cash flows? Because this year was also pretty challenging. Just kind of as you lead the company, can you give us kind of the big picture of what you see for the direction for them?","Ursula M. Burns","Yes, I think that there is a duality here that you -- that I have to employ when I lead a company of this size and the varying nature of the businesses that we're in. One is to make sure that we're clear about where the opportunities lie and not get ourselves too wrapped up in all of the downside. We have to know where growth is happening, and we have to invest to pursue that growth. And we know where it's happening. In Document Technology, that's a predefined set of either solution types or client types, small or midsized businesses, developing economies, color, we know that. We have to literally focus on those, not get confused about those, and move our resourcing, our funding, our focus away from areas that are not really growing. That doesn't mean we abandon clients or anything, but we actually have to make sure that we weight our investments towards growth. And on services, we have to be literally very methodical and not too impatient, which is not a good -- for that -- one of my strengths, not too impatient and skip over opportunities. Our Services business, it's relatively new for us. The good news is we have an experienced team. One of the first things we have to do was stabilize the business as we brought it on board and start to grow revenue to apply the strength that we had from Xerox to ACS and make revenue growth possible. We have been able to do that. We are very confident about our ability to do that. Second thing we had to do is make sure that we take some of these very large contracts, which we have signed more of them than ACS had ever signed before. We have to actually get those stood up and stabilized, move on that path, and then we have to drive towards margin expansion. And that's that, and literally really not focus on the other areas of the business. So disinvest from contract sell off businesses that are not really core to us or profitable. So focus on opportunities and be kind of brutal and ruthless on things that are not aligned toward growth and not get ourselves too wrapped up in anything too short term or too, too long term. So that's -- and that's the way that you would manage this business and you have to focus on the people and focus on their customers. If you do those 3 things, you got it made in the shade. It's a difficult economy right now, but I think we're doing a pretty good job in navigating our way through it. Thank you for your time and for all of your interest. I really do encourage you to spend some time with us at the investor conference at the New York Stock Exchange on November 13, and we'll be able to get into more detail about the business then. Thank you.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"22610":["Xerox (NYSE:XRX) Q4 2012 Earnings Call January 24, 2013 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Ursula M.

She is joined by Luca Maestri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com\/investor. At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and\/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without expressed permission of Xerox. [Operator Instructions]","During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements which by their nature address matters that are in future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein.","At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns, you may begin.","Ursula M. Burns","Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. During the fourth quarter, we delivered results that reflect consistent progress on our strategy. Our shift to a services-led growth portfolio is paying off. Services revenue now represents 52% of our total revenue and is growing at a steady pace.","Through improved margins, our bottom line is benefiting more from this top line growth. We have a clear understanding of the market dynamics in our Document Technology business. It remains a very profitable cash-generating operation. We're maximizing its profit by lowering the cost base and shifting investments to focused areas of growth.","And we're generating strong operating cash flow, $2.6 billion in 2012. This gives us flexibility to invest for growth and build shareholder value. We bought back more than $1 billion in Xerox stock in 2012, and share repurchase will remain part of our balanced approach to capital allocation.","Xerox is a company that is going through a seismic transformation. 2012 was a year of alignment. Getting our costs aligned with our services-focused business model, getting our investments aligned with key priorities, getting our diverse portfolio aligned with market opportunities and getting our operations aligned to address these opportunities. We're doing this through a customer-centric approach that takes full advantage of our brand, innovation and global scale. I feel good about our progress, and I am confident that we will deliver strong results in 2013.","Here is a closer look at Q4 results. We reported adjusted EPS of $0.30. As planned, adjusted earnings include $0.05 of restructuring. Adjusted EPS exclude $0.04 related to amortization of intangibles, resulting in GAAP EPS of $0.26. Total revenue of $5.9 billion was down 1% or flat in constant currency. Growth came from our Services business, up 7% in the quarter and reflecting solid results across the board.","Business Process Outsourcing revenue grew 8%. IT Outsourcing was up 15%, and Document Outsourcing was up 2%. Segment margin also improved in Services. At 11.2%, Services margin was up 90 basis points. This is very good progress, and puts our margins right in the range of our expectations.","Signings in Q4 were lower year-over-year. With the nature of our business, any 90-day cycle will bring ups and downs, especially factoring in prior year compares and long purchasing cycles. Considering the nearly $11 billion in total business signings during 2012, I remain confident that our pace of signings to date aligns well with our future revenue growth expectations.","In our Document Technology business, revenue declined 8%. We made disciplined decisions in 2012 to be conservative in how we manage this business. Due to the economic uncertainty across most regions, we put our focus on reducing the cost base while expanding distribution through indirect channels. As a result, segment margin in Document Technology improved. At 12.3%, it's well above our target range and gives us flexibility to make important investments this year.","We're about to launch a refresh of products in the first quarter. And we're ramping up marketing investments while broadening our channel partnerships, positioning us better to pursue the growth opportunities in small and midsized businesses. As a result, we expect to see improving trends in install level and equipment sale revenue this year.","Operating margin in the fourth quarter improved 30 basis points to 10.3%. Gross margin was 31.5%. Selling, administrative and general expenses were down $56 million and represents 18.5% of revenue. We generated $1.8 billion in cash from operations during the fourth quarter, $2.6 billion for the year, including the sale of certain finance receivables, and we allocated $334 million of that quarterly cash to buy back shares.","The fundamentals of our strategy are delivering as expected. We're managing our services business for growth. In Document Technology, we're maintaining leadership in the profitable growth segments while benefiting from the overall profitability of this mature business. As a result, Services now represents 52% of our total revenue, up from 48% just one year ago. This mix shift will continue, with Services growing to 2\/3 of our revenue by 2017. That growth then fuels our annuity stream, which is now 83% of our total revenue. It's up 3% in constant currency during the quarter. And during 2012, we generated $18.9 billion in recurring revenue.","Equipment sales are becoming a much smaller percentage of our business, down 13% this quarter, they are the most impacted by economic and industry trends. We expect the equipment sales trends to improve modestly this year. We're launching new products, and we're targeting investments that will boost our share of the digital color and SMB markets.","Summing up the quarter, the strong growth in Services and consistent profitability of our Document Technology business generated significant operating cash flow and contributed to earnings that met our expectations.","Before I turn it over to Luca, let me take a moment to offer my thanks to him. As you know, Luca is leaving Xerox on February 28. He's been a fantastic business partner and is a steadfast supporter of our business strategy. I know his contributions to Xerox will serve his successor, our company and our shareholders well for a long term. Thank you, Luca.","Luca Maestri","Thank you, Ursula, for the very kind words, and good morning, everyone. I will begin by reviewing earnings, and then we'll cover our 2 segments, cash flow and capital allocation.","During the quarter and also for the full year, revenue was flat at constant currency. We continue to see good growth in Services, up 7% in Q4, and as Ursula said, now representing 52% of total revenue, while Technology remains pressured and was down 8%.","An area of focus for us during Q4 was Services margin, and we made really good progress. This improvement in Services also drove overall margin improvement. In total, operating margin at 10.3% was up 30 basis points year-over-year. Gross margins were lower because of the higher mix of Services revenue, but this was more than offset by continued improvement in SG&A and R&D.","As planned, restructuring in the quarter was higher year-over-year and came in at $93 million, as we initiated actions to improve the Services cost structure and maintained Technology profitability. For the year, restructuring of $153 million was $120 million higher than in 2011. The 2012 actions have been taken in order to position us for margin improvement in 2013, and we will continue to manage our cost base proactively going forward, with ongoing modest restructuring initiatives.","Equity income grew $9 million, driven by profit growth at Fuji Xerox, and adjusted tax rate was 23% in the quarter, lower by about 3 percentage points year-over-year. Adjusted EPS of $0.30 in Q4 was lower in 2011 by $0.03, and full year adjusted EPS of $1.03 was lower by $0.05. These results reflect the negative impact of the higher restructuring in 2012 and the pension curtailment gain of $107 million, which we recognized in Q4 of 2011.","Moving on to the Services segment. Revenue growth came in at 7% in Q4, BPO was up 8%, ITO was up 15% and Document Outsourcing up 2%. We are seeing steady growth in BPO all year. And in Q4, we had strong results in customer care, state government and transportation. ITO revenue really accelerated this quarter as we began to see the full benefits from the very strong 2011 signings. Document Outsourcing growth was somewhat lower in Q4, impacted by some decision delays in the enterprise space.","Signings in the quarter were lower year-over-year. This was fully expected, as ITO had 2 megadeals in 2011 that made the compare extremely challenging. BPO and Document Outsourcing signings were essentially flat year-over-year. And in total, Q4 had the highest new business signings of the year from an annual recurring revenue perspective. The average contract length was approximately 3 years for BPO and ITO, considerably lower than our historical average of approximately 5 years and dampened the signings number when looking at total contract value.","The BPO\/ITO renewal rate in Q4 was below target of 79% and reflected some timing factors and price discipline. For the year, however, renewal rate was 85%, which is in our target range and 5 points higher than 2011.","We remain confident that we will continue to see mid to high single-digit Services revenue growth in 2013. As we discussed at our investor conference, our recurring revenue model provides us with good line of sight to expected revenues. And even though overall signings this year have been lower, we have achieved what we expected from new business signings and renewal rates in order to support our growth plans going forward.","Turning to margins. Services segment margin of 11.2% increased 90 basis points year-over-year and 180 basis points sequentially, ahead of our expectations. This sequential margin increase was driven by the initial benefit from our cost actions, the absence of negative one-offs, improvements in Document Outsourcing and some level of seasonality.","Year-over-year, the improvement came mainly from Document Outsourcing where we benefited from lower SG&A. We also had good margin improvement in a number of BPO lines of business, including state government services, customer care and transportation. We continue to expect to be in the 10% to 12% range for the full year, and we expect Q1 margin to be lower than Q4 but modestly better on a year-over-year basis.","So overall, a good quarter for Services, with welcome progress on margins and continued strong revenue growth, which positions us well as we enter 2013.","Let's now turn to the Technology segment. Technology revenue was down 8%. Revenue decline continue to be driven by lower equipment revenue, which was down 14% and was impacted by the soft macro environment and continued focus on segment profitability. As we look ahead, we have a significant mid-range and entry production color product announcement coming next month, and we fully expect activity and equipment revenue to show improving trends as we move through the year.","In terms of product segments, good growth continued in entry A4 products as more purchases are moving to multifunction devices in this segment. Mid-range activity was down in the quarter, partially because the upcoming product launches are centered around this category. And high end continued to show good color growth, driven by entry production and iGen, which offsets the secular decline in black-and-white.","Segment margin of 12.3% was up 60 basis points from 2011, well above our target range, reflecting cost and expense control and a gain that we realized as a result of the sale of a portion of our finance receivables. As we transition into 2013, we believe we have set reasonable expectations for Technology, with mid-single-digits revenue declines and margins within our target range of 9% to 11%. We believe that our opportunities to support these objectives, including new product launches, recent favorable currency trends and easier compares in Europe.","Turning to the key metrics slide. I've already commented on much of this data. But in summary, total Services signings for the year had been clearly lower, but the underlying trends are more positive than the decline would imply. We actually signed 7% more deals in BPO and ITO than in 2011, but there were fewer megadeals and contract lengths were shorter. This, combined with lower renewal opportunities, resulted in lower signings. However, as explained before, we did meet the new business annual revenue and renewal rate targets needed to support our 2013 revenue plans, and our pipeline remains very strong and it is up 6% year-over-year.","Document Technology metrics remain relatively stable, in line with annuity revenue. Install growth was softer in the quarter but should improve with the new product launches. MIF continues to grow and page volumes are still relatively in check. Color revenue was weak, driven by lower equipment revenue mix.","If we now turn to the next slide, I will take a moment to review cash flow. Cash from operations in Q4 was strong at $1.8 billion, in line with seasonality and resulted in $2.6 billion for the full year. This exceeded our guidance of $2 billion to $2.3 billion due to an additional finance receivables sale in Q4, which contributed a net $269 million to cash flow when considering the natural runoff of the sold receivables.","Cash contributions to our global pension plans were $54 million in Q4, $364 million full year, a $62 million reduction versus 2011. We expect pension contributions in 2013 to be more than $100 million lower than in 2012, driven by the change in funding requirements brought about by recent pension legislation in the U.S.","Working capital was a significant contribution to cash in the quarter, in line with usual seasonality. In particular, inventory was a source of $128 million for the quarter and flat for the year. Accounts payable was a source of $346 million in the quarter and a use of $86 million for the year, and accounts receivable was a source of $365 million in Q4 and a use of $306 million for the year, which was $390 million worse year-over-year. This reflects lower contribution from factoring compared to 2011 and growth in our Services business.","Finance receivables generated $947 million in 2012. $580 million of this contribution comes from the 2 finance receivables sales that we did in the year, one in Q3 and one in Q4. The remaining $367 million comes from the runoff of our finance portfolio due to the lower equipment revenue.","We spent $513 million on CapEx for the year, which is fully in line with our guidance, and we deployed $276 million towards acquisitions. Dividends paid were $255 million for the year, and we repurchased 1,050,000,000 of stock during the year. For 2013, we continue to expect $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion in cash flow from operations. We expect lower pension funding requirements. But finance receivables will be a lower contributor to cash by approximately $500 million, due to fewer collections associated with the 2012 finance receivables sales and a lower natural runoff of the portfolio, given our expectation of better equipment activity. We expect the rest of working capital to be essentially flat year-over-year.","The next slide covers in more detail our capital structure and capital allocations plan. We ended the year with $8.5 billion in debt, about $100 million lower than planned. Our cash ending balance was over $1.2 billion, $344 million higher than at the end of 2011. The greater debt reduction and higher cash balance from the strong cash flow in Q4 position us well to meet our capital structure objectives for 2013, which include retiring the $400 million senior note that comes due in May.","Turning to capital allocation. We met our 2012 objectives, with the largest portion of our cash flow going to share repurchase. For the year, we spent $1,050,000,000 on the repurchase of 146 million shares, reducing shares by 114 million on a net basis. This represents a 9% net reduction in common shares outstanding for the year.","We are maintaining the 2013 capital allocation guidance that was provided at the investor conference in November, which includes at least $400 million in debt reduction; up to $500 million in acquisitions, which will be largely focused on the Services business; dividend payments of $300 million, which reflects the planned 35% dividend increase beginning in April; and share repurchases of at least $400 million.","So in conclusion, overall, a very good quarter across the board. I have great confidence, great confidence that Xerox is very well positioned both strategically and financially to take advantage of the growth opportunities in Services and to strengthen our leadership position in Technology during 2013.","With that, I will hand it back to Ursula.","Ursula M. Burns","2012 presented its share of challenges. Thank you, Luca. But it also gave us an opportunity to refine our business model and improve operational efficiency, all while growing our Services business. This progress gives me confidence in our ability to deliver a strong 2013.","For the first quarter, we expect adjusted earnings of $0.23 to $0.25 per share. Our guidance for the full year remains unchanged. We expect adjusted EPS of $1.09 to $1.15, and our strategy remains very sound. We're shifting to a Services-led growth portfolio. You see it in our results every quarter. We're maintaining our leadership in Document Technology, product and platform news next month will demonstrate our commitment to this profitable business.","With improving margins, cost controls and steady growth, we'll consistently expand earnings and generate strong cash. With that, we'll continue to take a very balanced approach to our capital allocation, which creates value for our shareholders.","That's a good place for me to end. Before we open it up for questions, let me turn it over to Jim Lesko, Head of Investor Relations.","James H. Lesko","Thanks, Ursula. Joining Ursula and Luca today is Lynn Blodgett, Head of Xerox Services. Also, let me point out that we have several supplemental slides at the end of our deck. It provides more financial details to support today's presentation and complement our prepared remarks. At the end of our Q&A session, I'll turn it back to Ursula for closing comments. Operator, please open the lines for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Shannon Cross of Cross Research.","Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC","Ursula and Lynn, can you talk a bit about -- bit more about the Services business sort of where you think you are with restructuring, maybe some comments about your conservative outlook on deal pricing? And then I'm curious especially, Lynn, given your history, if you think the trend of the lack of megadeals is something that is just sort of cyclical or is this a change in how customers are thinking about things? And then I have a follow-up on Technology.","Lynn R. Blodgett","Thanks, Shannon. As far as the restructuring activity, we made some good progress in the fourth quarter. We're not finished, as we said in the investor conference. We're really focused on cost. We have a great revenue model, and just need to make sure that our costs stay in line. So we have more work to do, and we'll see that through the balance of 2013. But we made really good progress in this quarter. As far as deal pricing, there's always downward pressure on deals. That's just part of our model. We know that when we come up for renewal or when we're bidding a new deal that the pricing will be down. And these percentages that we have seen in the past aren't changing dramatically. So there hasn't been a significant change there. As far as megadeals, we didn't see -- last year, we had 8 megadeals and -- excuse me, in 2011, we had 8 megadeals. In 2012, we had 3, and that was a significant change, primarily in the ITO business, as Ursula pointed out. But we are now seeing megadeals in the pipeline. Last year was -- it was a little bit of an anomaly, and they're starting to materialize. So we expect that we'll see strong bookings growth next year, where we expect to see that in the -- where we -- we return to plus 10% kind of bookings growth. So we're optimistic about that, and some of that will be driven because we'll have more megadeals.","Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC","Okay, great. And then Ursula, if you could just talk a little bit on the Technology side. I'm curious as to what you're sort of thinking about for 2013 in terms of competition, and especially when you factor in what's going on with the yen. Do you anticipate more competitive environment? I know several of the competitors have launches coming. You guys have a launch coming. Just if you could give any color on sort of how you think the world shapes up especially given the yen depreciation?","Ursula M. Burns","Yes. I think our position for 2013 is very strong. We spent 2012 in a very methodical way, assuring that we positioned ourselves for what we saw were growth areas in this business: color, SMB, developing economies, et cetera. So we managed our cost base. We were very conservative about how we went after deals, given that our product portfolio wasn't refreshed. We positioned ourselves for 2013 refresh, which will come next month. And so I'm actually feeling pretty good about our ability to meet our expectations, improving activity levels, stabilizing of revenue from an equipment sales perspective and total perspective, and I think that we're positioned well against the competition. But our offering that we'll offer, that we'll launch next month are not just about products. They're also about the software and services surrounding the products, positioning us well to expand our Document Outsourcing business as well. So I think that it will be a reasonable year, and we're positioned well against the competition. As far as the yen goes, the good news about the yen is that it gives us a little bit of tailwind, but it also gives our competitors tailwind. So we're going to have to pay attention in the marketplace. We have to price to win where it's smart for us to go after it. We have a big focus on profitability. We have -- most of the yen benefit for us because we hedge, comes in the latter half of the year. But we'll keep an eye on the marketplace and make sure that we are aggressive and win where it's good for us to win.","Operator","Our next question comes from Keith Bachman of Bank of Montr\u00e9al.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Ursula, I wanted to ask you about leadership, and I'll frame it in 2 different ways. One, how are you thinking about filling the very big shoes of Luca, in particular the background that you're looking for? And I'm not necessarily looking for internal versus external but skill sets, particularly as you think about the benchmark of growth is Services. And then two, where do you think the leadership -- do you think you need more depth in Services given relative inconsistency in performance since the addition of ACS?","Ursula M. Burns","Thank you, Keith. So first on the CFO replacement. You are correct that the next CFO has some pretty big shoes to fill. Interestingly enough, Luca had some big shoes to fill as well. And I am very, very confident that we will find a more than adequate replacement for Luca, very confident. The search has already started. I am, in some ways, overwhelmed with the number of candidates that I have to look through. So I think that we'll end up in a good place, in a very good pace with the CFO. What I'm looking for is someone who has global experience, someone who's strong, fairly aggressive in their approach. We have a strategy. It is not going to change because Luca left. So I want somebody who can actually implement the strategy that we have in place, and then think on a go-forward basis  of some of the new things that we have to do.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And I guess just to tease it out for a second or so, would you tilt towards somebody with services experience, given the importance over the next 3 years of Services to Xerox?","Ursula M. Burns","Yes. As we look forward, we're looking for Luca, we wanted someone who had some background in a global -- large global complex business, but also someone who had some services experience. So the answer is yes. But it won't be only a services play. We have a big business to run. It is all around the world, and I need someone who can actually play well and understand well all of those markets. I'm confident that we'll get somebody very, very good. As far as leadership in general, whenever we replace a leader, we -- I look for certain general tendencies. I need someone who is extremely flexible but strong, someone who actually can implement well. I need an operator in the business. And someone who is prepared for the way that the business is going on a go-forward basis. And that obviously means people who have more history or knowledge about services. So the answer to your general leadership question has nothing to do with inconsistency of performance, it has to do with future growth and how I see the business going on a go-forward basis. So I need people who have good services knowledge and background, and that's what I'll look for across the board when we hire.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. Well, let me just sneak in a follow-up, and then I'll cede the floor. Just on bookings, Lynn mentioned that you thought Services bookings would be a positive number in calendar year '13 -- bookings growth, I should say. Is that confidence driven by the fact of the pipeline or the compares or just a little bit more on why you think the bookings will turn the corner here from a negative to the positive?","Ursula M. Burns","Let me start, and this is probably a question that will happen -- a lot of people probably have, so we'll spend a little bit more time on this one. It turns out that in 2011, we signed in our ITO business an amazing amount of business. If you look at the absolute number, we actually doubled a normal signing year in 2011. So the total TCV in '11 was about $3.5 billion and a normal year would be about $3 billion in ITO. This is in ITO. Obviously, the rest of the business is bigger. In 2012, we went back to a normal pace and a normal growth level. So what we're saying is that we are absolutely confident, very confident, based on the pipeline, based on the billings, based on everything that we will be able to grow over 2012 in ITO, and therefore, in the total Services business on a TCV basis. So I want us -- it's interesting when you look at this, this is not a point of weakness. We had a phenomenal year in one line of business and a very good year in the rest of the businesses in 2011. 2012 is back to a normal growth cycle for us. In 2013, we'll be back to that again. So yes, so that's the short of it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes of Barclays Capital.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wanted to ask about cash flow for next year. Your expectation for share repurchases goes down quite a bit. Is there any upside to that $400 million? And how are you looking at that? Is that something that -- it is dependent on who you -- who succeeds Luca? Is there -- are there any puts and takes on how you look at the flexibility of that number? And then I have a follow-up.","Ursula M. Burns","First of all, Luca will answer the rest, but it has nothing to do with who succeeds Luca. As I said earlier in answering the CFO question, we have a strategy, and the strategy has been embedded across the management team. We spent a lot of time on it, and so I am -- it is independent of the individual that sits in the chair. And Luca, why don't you...","Luca Maestri","With those who argue, it's a smart strategy, so I hope it doesn't change. And on the numbers, $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion, it's the same number that we mentioned in November, Ben. It's a bit lower than this year because we're going to have some positives, it's -- the pension contributions are positives. And obviously, earnings are going to be a bit positive because your -- the EPS number is high. The effect of the finance receivables will -- they're not going to be the same level of contribution that we had in 2012 for obvious reasons. But -- so we were confident with the range, $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion. In terms of capital allocation, we talked in November about having some level of flexibility in the numbers to start the year, and that's why we said at least -- so much for repurchase, we said at least $400 million for repurchase, at least $400 million for debt. That level of flexibility had increased a bit because cash flow was so strong in Q4. So we come in with a bit more flexibility. And how much we're going to dial up repurchase will depend, frankly, on 2 factors: One, earnings as we go through the year, and if earnings are strong, there is an opportunity; and we always watch interest rates because they drive discount rate for the pension calculation, right? But yes, there is a bit of flexibility and it's increased a bit with Q4.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Then just my follow-up, as another way of asking the Services question. With trailing 12-month bookings down 26%, you've said that you can still grow and hit your targets for revenue growth for 2013. Another company we cover, IBM, had bookings down 2%, and they're looking for services growth next year of flat, and that obviously makes intuitive sense to us just given where bookings were the year before. It's a much different business. But when we hear bookings down 26% and then hear revenues are going to be 7% or so growth, begs the question, just can you give us a little bit more math? Is there -- for example, IBM again, they kind of give you the 70% of their base contracts that they know they have, and the revenue growth off of that, and then that kind of thing. Can you just give us a little more support so that we can go from down 25% to plus 7%. Is it duration? And do you actually have that 70% visibility, and then you know the duration, et cetera? So that we know you can do it based on the bookings trends.","Lynn R. Blodgett","Yes. Absolutely, Ben. The things that enter into the math are the bookings number, as you pointed out. And as Ursula said, this year was much more the kind of a normal year, especially in the ITO business. So we have a threshold that we -- that we use to calculate the -- sort of our minimum in order to hit the growth targets that we have, and we met that number. The second piece that factors into the growth is the renewal rate. And our renewals for the year were 85%, which is 5% higher than they were in 2011. If you take the positive impact of the higher renewal rate, it offsets pretty close the lower bookings. Does that make sense? They both contribute. And we also have a higher recurring revenue rate than I think what you were talking about. Most of -- ours is about 85%, so that helps us in terms of sort of the predictability of the revenue stream.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Can I just sneak in one more? And I'm done. On supplies, what trends are you seeing there for channel inventory and the trends into '13?","Luca Maestri","Yes. So we have -- '12 was, I think, a fairly typical year. When we talk about supplies, Ben, we talk about unbundled supplies. It's a small percentage of our total revenue. It's less than $2 billion a year. We've seen a development on supplies, which is very, very consistent with annuity revenue in general in 2013 -- in 2012, so '12 was down about 3%. We expect for 2013 something in the mid-single-digit decline for supply, in line with the overall Technology business. So again, also on supplies, we do not have unreasonable expectations as we enter the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz of JPMorgan.","Mark A. Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I wanted to kind of follow on, on the previous question line of thought around just the signings velocity. Was 2011 really just kind of the big peak, if you will, or everything come together in terms of ACS, Xerox synergies, and that's as good as it gets? Just trying to understand why we've never really seen the follow-through in terms of the potential cross-pollination.","Ursula M. Burns","Yes. 2011 was a good year, but you are seeing the follow-through. First of all, 2011 in one line of business, in the ITO line of business was an exceptional year. We are seeing growth, and we'll continue to see growth in 2013 in BPO as well, and Document Outsourcing is doing its normal thing. So this is not the end of the line by any stretch of the imagination. It's kind of hard to downplay our 2011, which was good. But this is -- we continue to sign. We continue to sell. We continue to cross-pollinate. We continue to get new business. We had 7% more deals signed in 2012 than we did in 2011. Contract length was a little bit shorter, and there were fewer megadeals. But our signings velocity continues, and we have 7% more revenue in -- so the business is -- this is not the end of the line by any stretch of the imagination. It's performing fairly well. The math that Lynn just brought you through, which is a math of renewals, a math of signings, we have a strong pipeline that continues to just keep it -- it's up 6%, shows and should give some confidence that the revenue numbers that we have -- we take into account price declines, everything, the revenue numbers that we have for 2013, which is mid- to high-single-digit revenue growth for our Services business is pretty solid.","Lynn R. Blodgett","If I can just add also. The number -- bear in mind, too, that the number that we give is the annual recurring revenue number. And many times, I think people get confused with the TCV. But this is an annual recurring revenue number, and so it's very predictable. The math is easy to calculate, and we feel comfortable.","Mark A. Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","As a follow-up, if I could, when I hear about shorter-term contracts, it does start to beg the question, are we going to see a heightened level of pricing pressures down the road. If the contracts are shorter and they're going to be coming up for renewal faster, maybe there's more and more vendors fighting for less and less business. I mean, how should we think about that pricing slope over time? Is it going to start to get more severe?","Ursula M. Burns","I actually -- I'll take it. The contract length on average has gone from 5 years to 3 years, first of all. Shorter is not a year. Shorter is 3 years. Absolutely, you will see at the end of 3 years people competing for the contracts and they would have normally have competed at the end of 5 years. And price, as Lynn said, is something that is clearly a part of the negotiation when you come up for renewal. So the answer is -- will we see pressure at 3 years? The answer is yes. One of the questions and drives that we have, one of the things I push Lynn for is we interact with clients in a way that penetrates the account and then expands our position in the account. We intend to continue to do that. It's proven successful for us in the past, and it will prove successful, I think, in the future. The shorter contract and less megadeals is a sign of the times today. We had significant pressure in both government and large enterprises, given a very weak macroeconomic environment. That is what I, Xerox Corporation and all our vendors are going to deal with. We'll deal in the marketplace to be very aggressive and continue to win, I think, like we win now.","Lynn R. Blodgett","[indiscernible] Just this one I'd just cover. The other thing is that many of the lines of business, customer care, for example, a 3-year contract life is the normal contract life. And if we don't sign as many ITO deals, which are longer typically and megadeals which are longer, that doesn't mean that the entire portfolio is shrinking in contract length. The other factor is that the discounts that we are required to give at the -- at renewal time tend to be driven by an average annual discount rate. So if we have a 5-year contract, you can take what that annual discount rate is times 5. If it's a 3-year contract, you times it by 3. So the net overall discount is not significantly different, and we have a large part of our portfolio, you're seeing it, is a 3-year deal. It's what -- and we'll build around that. So I wouldn't say that just because we don't have as many 5-year ITO deals or megadeals that the discounting pressure is going to be significantly different.","Mark A. Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, appreciate that. If I could -- real quickly just shifting gears, Ursula, I have to say as an observer, you really sound pumped up today in your cadence. Everything sounds very positive, but yet your guidance isn't changing for 2013. Is that just measured conservatism just because it's early in the year, and you want to see how these new products roll out next month? I do -- you sound a lot more confident and upbeat versus the prior few calls.","Ursula M. Burns","I am upbeat, I'm hoping, in every call. I'm happy I sound better today than I did in the past. I am very confident in the guidance that we have. I -- we've studied the business a lot. We're kind of on a cadence now that is a good rhythm. And so yes, I'm confident in what we've laid out for 2013. This is not going to be a walk in the park. The environment hasn't changed that dramatically to make it that much better around the world. But I think that we know how to operate it, and I think I know we know how to operate it. So yes, I'm confident.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Shope from Goldman Sachs.","Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. So you guys obviously had a nice recovery here in the Services margin, and I think you laid out the drivers there pretty clearly. Could you just help us understand how we should think about the quarterly swing factors here throughout the year, and basically how we should think about the overall drivers of the seasonality from a margin perspective within this range you've provided for the year?","Luca Maestri","Yes. So Bill, we said margin range, 10% to 12% for Services. Clearly, you know that from a seasonality perspective, Q1 and Q3 are lower than Q2 and Q4, particularly in Document Outsourcing where we got more fixed costs attached to the business. For -- and we've launched a number of restructuring actions. They will progress and provide more and more benefit as we go through the year, so you should be thinking of about it in terms of Services margins growing sequentially from Q1 forward. And clearly, Q1 lower than the Q4 that we just had just because of seasonality and -- but we expect already for Q1 improvement year-over-year. I think that should give you enough.","Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then you mentioned hitting the -- your targeted renewal rate range for the year. Can you talk about the renewal rate dynamics exiting the year, again sort of the unusual seasonal aspects to consider there? And then how you're thinking about your renewal rate management plans going into next year, given, obviously, we don't want to see too many surprises there.","Lynn R. Blodgett","Yes. The renewal rates are -- they're pretty sensitive, and the sensitivity is driven by the timing of particular renewals, and here's why. When we calculate the renewal rate, we look at the total universe to be renewed, and then take what percentage of that was renewed. If you have a large contract that you expect to renew that happens to slip from one quarter to the next quarter, that lowers the overall number, and therefore, a loss, has a different and dramatic impact. Hopefully, that makes sense. Yes. And so in the fourth quarter, we had a couple of deals that we had expected to renew that slipped into the -- we believe that will happen in the first quarter. We're very, very focused on -- we know what those renewals are. We're very, very focused on winning those renewals, and that's why we're not overly concerned about. We're confident that our renewal rate for 2013 will be in the range. And -- but we can't call with absolute precision what happens from quarter-to-quarter because the timing of -- an individual customer, we can really believe that we're going to get them signed, and they can shift one week and that can make a big difference in the renewal rate. So that's why we're not overly concerned about it. We don't see a drastic fall off in renewals. Most of this is timing.","Luca Maestri","What we -- I mean, what we really like is the fact that for the year, we were 5 points up in renewal, and that is very, very important for revenue growth going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva of Citi.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","A quick question is in your prepared comments, you mentioned about 2013 a much more healthier year for signings and things. Can you help us better understand about -- are these -- that you're already talking with companies, and they're just really putting off the formal proposal and just has  yet to happen? Or is it any type of real cement or granularity behind that as opposed to just hoping for a bigger market? And indeed, there's some slip from Q4 into Q1, or just kind of help us understand those dynamics.","Ursula M. Burns","Right. So it's a little bit of all that you said, which I know you really don't like that answer, but it is true. Some of these -- some of the signings are things that we know. We're already engaged with clients and we're working through the details of the engagement. We don't -- until we get them, I can't count them. And I don't actually feel comfortable until we actually get the signing. But yes, some of it is that. Some of it is we have some lines of business, state, transportation that has -- and customer care, that have good offers out and are engaging clients. Some of it is yet to come. And our pipeline grew in 2012 by 6%, so we had -- so we have more in the hopper, more engagements in the hopper. It's kind of a normal year. 2013 we're viewing as a normal year. Growth across the portfolios, nothing too unusual, leveraging the synergies of having our 2 companies together, and therefore, growing in a fairly normal range. Nothing too exciting or too special, but still good, but very good.","Lynn R. Blodgett","I think the one shift that we've seen that's different, that was the same in '11, different in '12 is the appearance of more megadeals, as we said, and we have more of those in the pipeline now than we did halfway through 2012, for example.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Was there any slipping from Q4 to Q1?","Ursula M. Burns","Were there any -- excuse me?","Lynn R. Blodgett","Slipping.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Slipping of deals?","Ursula M. Burns","Oh, for sure, for sure. Lynn talked about it a little bit. There were a couple of deals that we thought we would be able to ink in Q4. These are generally renewals. These are -- well, not general, they are generally renewals, and we -- they slipped into Q1 or whenever the customer decides to sign it. Oftentimes, that's actually not bad news for us. If you can keep the client with the same terms and conditions, because as you know when you renew, you usually lower cost a little bit -- price a little bit. It's not a bad thing to actually have it moved, but we would prefer to have them signed, but we have to wait for the customer. We can't force them. They're -- sometimes they're less comfortable or want to delay. Nothing unusual, though.","Lynn R. Blodgett","And I think on the bookings on the new business side, we do have deals that slip. They always slip. And then the next quarter, some slip from the next quarter. So I'm waiting for the day when everything that's slipped from the previous quarter gets closed in this quarter and we have no slips to the next quarter. But yes, we had a couple of deals, and things were a little lighter than we expected because of that. But nothing that was grossly out of order.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Whitmore of Deutsche Bank.","Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I wanted to approach the bookings, maybe from a little bit of a different angle, and specifically wanted to ask about BPO bookings. If I look at the trend line in BPO bookings over the past couple of years, it's been down 2 years in a row from fiscal year '10, $10 billion to $6 billion in fiscal year '12, understanding that ITO was strong, et cetera, and contract durations are changing. But nonetheless, I'm trying to understand what are the implications for the mix in your revenue as you roll forward into fiscal '13 between BPO, ITO and Document Outsourcing. Do you expect a significant change in mix or rates of growth between the segments? And does that have implications on margins?","Lynn R. Blodgett","Yes. I think that right now, we're expecting that ITO -- because of the strong bookings from 2011, ITO is going to continue to grow, and its growth rate will be a few points higher than the BPO rate. But BPO is a much larger business than the ITO business. So don't -- just don't do direct math to say that's going to -- that's going to necessarily drastically changed the overall growth rate. But BPO is, if you think about it in the last year, governments have been under extreme pressure. I mean, it's been as tough a time for states and local entities as I can certainly remember. And so some deals and BPO government deals are almost -- not always, but 80% of them are BPO, there's been a lot of pressure. And we're seeing, as Ursula mentioned, some lightening of that pressure, right? We're not ready to say that it's drastically changed, but we're starting to see a little bit of lightening there. So we're hopeful that, that will help to spur BPO booking. I think most of the downward pressure that you've seen over the last couple of years has really been driven through our -- through the various aspects of the government business, and we're seeing some improvement there.","Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Does that changing mix impact the profitability? In other words, are ITO margins vastly different than BPO?","Luca Maestri","ITO margins are slightly lower than average. We talked about it in the past. But really, it's not a massive shift. Keep in mind that revenue growth, which then drives margins, right, was significantly higher in BPO in 2012 than the other lines. And so I don't see much of a mix impact from the increased growth in ITO. It's extremely manageable.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha from Credit Suisse.","Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just have a question, really, on the direction of Services margins and more about the cost cutting that you guys are doing. In the event that let's say this is a more secular drive towards smaller deal sizes, do you have to do more restructuring to hit your margin targets? Don't you see it that way? And could you remind us of what further cost downs we might see in that business segment as we go through 2013?","Lynn R. Blodgett","Yes. The restructuring efforts, as we said at the beginning, are -- we made some good progress in the fourth quarter. We're just -- we're not through by any stretch, and we will continue to do things that we think are prudent and as aggressive as we think are prudent over 2013. The other side of the coin relative to the deal size is that typically smaller deals have slightly larger -- or slightly higher margins. So even though the deal size may be coming down, that is not a downward pressure on margins. That's actually -- that actually helps lift them a little bit.","Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Just on that point though, like how much more in terms of dollar cost would you say year-over-year you've got to yet reduce in '13? Could you give us a number around that?","Lynn R. Blodgett","I think what we would like to do is an amount similar to the amount that we did in the fourth quarter.","Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And the just a question for -- on acquisitions. On the $500 million that you might spend, is that a very firm number? Or is there a chance, for example, you get the end of this year and you spend $100 million, the rest can be put into buyback for shareholders? Or how should we think about how firm that number is?","Luca Maestri","Can you repeat the question? What number are you referring to?","Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I'm referring to the amount that you might spend on acquisitions this year, how firm $400 million $500 million is, and whether you could actually use that for further distribution to shareholders.","Luca Maestri","I think you need to step back for a second and think about our strategy. And really acquisition, we always said, is an important part of our strategy, and part of the growth that we're going to be experiencing in Services will be driven by acquisitions. We said up to $500 million. It really will depend on the type of companies that we -- that are available. And so I would say the flexibility that we have, it's more around the fact that we've got good cash generation from Q4, some level of flexibility. And if earnings progress the way we expect them to progress, there will be an opportunity to do both, to do more repurchase and to stick to our acquisition number.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Ananda Baruah of Brean Capital.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Two, if I could. Luca, just a clarification, did I hear correctly that you said selling of receivables would contribute $500 million less in '13 than it did in '12? And if I did hear that correctly, is that a gross number or a net number?","Luca Maestri","It's a -- I mean, it's a gross number, I would say, because it's essentially a number, the combination of the fact that we do not expect the portfolio to run off as much as it did in 2012. We believe that equipment activity is going to be stronger in 2013, new products and so on. And the fact that, of course, we have accelerated the collection of certain receivables from '13 in 2012, right? So it is the amount of lower contribution that we expect from finance receivables in 2013.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Got it. Is that -- so is that -- is the comparable number to that in '12 the $625 million or the $502 million or the...","Luca Maestri","The comparable number is $947 million. It's the amount of cash that we generated in finance receivables during 2012, which was $947 million.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","I got you. That was helpful. And then just a follow-up is, Ursula, did I hear you correctly that you expect equipment sales to be up or to grow in 2013?","Ursula M. Burns","No, it won't grow. I said that we expect total revenues to be, in the Technology business, to be down in the mid single digits. We expect some softening of the decline that we saw in 2012. We saw double-digit decline in 2012. I expect that we'll see -- continue to see declines but it will just be moderated a bit as we launch new products.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Got it. I was asking just specifically about equipment sales, not...","Ursula M. Burns","That's specifically about equipment sales. And the total revenue is about the same, anyway. I mean, the answer can go for total revenue or equipment sales.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Got it. And just last one on the equipment sales. Any margin implications from the new product launches, positive or negative due to mix of pricing?","Ursula M. Burns","Not really. It turns out that equipment sales are less profitable than post sales. That's the way that the business model works. But over time, throughout the -- as this matures, as we sell and it matures, I don't think there'll be any margin implications. Margin implications will come from the fact that we actually are restructuring, and we'll continue to do that to drive cost and stay competitive.","James H. Lesko","Thanks. That's all the time we have for questions today, and I certainly appreciate your interest. And Ursula, I'd like to turn it over to you to wrap up, please.","Ursula M. Burns","We covered quite a bit of ground today, and I'd like to spend just a second in kind of raising it up a little -- a couple of levels. Here are the reasons to keep your eye on our company: Services-led growth, possible leadership through Document Technology, cash-generating annuity-based business model, consistent earnings expansion and financial strength to invest and building value for Xerox and building value for you. And that's our focus, and I'm really confident that we'll continue to deliver.","James H. Lesko","Thanks, Ursula, and that concludes our call today.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"22861":["Xerox Corp.

He is joined by Bill Osbourn, Chief Financial Officer. During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com\/investor. At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded.","Other recording and\/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without the expressed permission of Xerox. After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which, by their nature, address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein.","At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Visentin. Mr. Visentin you may begin.","Giovanni Visentin - Xerox Corp.","Good morning, and welcome to Xerox's second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Before we go through our second quarter results, I'd like to take a few moments to share with you my initial thoughts about Xerox since becoming CEO and the priorities we have set to drive value for all our stakeholders.","I joined the company because I saw an opportunity to rebuild Xerox into a leading tech company. I've spent considerable time talking with customers, partners and employees. There is one common theme: they want us to succeed. We are an important and often critical component of our customers' and partners' work processes and their success. They recognize the quality and ease of use of our products and many have strong personal relationships with our company. Channel partners work with us because of the breadth of our portfolio and because of the support we provide, such as the marketing and training tools and resources that help them grow their business.","Our customers and partners expect Xerox to bring breakthrough solutions to the market more quickly to help them keep pace with continuously changing technology landscape and we need to be easier to do business with. Xerox employees care deeply about our company.","One of the first things I did as CEO was reach out to employees and ask them to share with me what they think of Xerox. What do we do well? And where do we need to improve? Their responses reaffirmed my assumption that the team has the knowledge and enthusiasm to transform this company and they want change. They want to be part of a company that is growing, a company with a new way of working, a company they can be proud of.","We have a portfolio of leading-edge, feature-rich products and solutions that support the needs of our customers. In the office, we have ConnectKey technology that is powered by an embedded secure cloud-enabled workflow management software platform with artificial intelligence and real time analytics that enables the same app-based flexibility on our products that app stores do on mobile phones. Software-based flexibility is the new paradigm for hardware and we are leading our industry with ConnectKey.","With the Xerox App Gallery, users can download apps to a ConnectKey device and make their work easier. There are apps with broad appeal like those that scan to a cloud-based repository and apps that are industry-specific like the Healthcare MFP app, which enables a HIPAA-compliant paper to digital content workflow. At the high end of the business, our focus is on helping our graphic communication customers be more profitable.","In May, we launched the Iridesse production press. What is special about Iridesse is its ability to use clear and metallic silver and gold dry inks for print embellishments, a lucrative market for commercial printers. By layering the inks, it can create images that are iridescent in one pass through the machine, eliminating multiple presses and processes saving our customers both time and money. Demand for Iridesse has exceeded our plan.","Beyond products are our software and services. We are a leader in Managed Print Services. Industry analyst firms, IDC, noted in their most recent report that we have been at the forefront of the industry when it comes to enabling workflow optimization. We are growing this business, expanding offerings for the channel but growth remains in the low single digits. This tells me that we have more work to be done.","Our software business are some of our best kept secrets. They are small but they have tremendous growth potential. For example, our DocuShare offering, think Dropbox, think Box is a cloud-enabled and helps companies manage their digital content, one of the biggest challenges we all face. We will soon launch a series of solutions for our DocuShare Flex cloud repository that will connect and allow the integration with applications such as Salesforce, Intuit and DigiSign (05:54). Such integrations will simplify business processes and enable automated workflow apps.","XMPie is a second software business and it provides customers with technology to transform their print business into omni-channel print and digital communication businesses. Just last week, we won an InterTech Award for XMPie's Circle PersonalEffect Edition. This automation software connects every stage of marketing campaign production. We need to take our software and services businesses to the next level.","One of the first areas I recognized that we must take better advantage of is our innovation in high-tech portfolio. I conducted reviews in PARC and our operations in Webster, New York and was impressed by what I saw. We have valuable and differentiated offerings that are underutilized as well as some new technologies, work that's underway in our labs that has the potential to disrupt industries. And as we develop and deploy these technologies, we must think differently about business models.","Is our role to be the system integrator and provider of the entire offering or, for some of these technologies, are we better off following the model of Intel in the PC industry and focus on high-value technology elements and sell them broadly across an industry? What I saw in our labs tells me that Xerox has the potential to go beyond our current core markets and achieve scale by providing a critical technology element for several high growth emerging areas, where we do not participate today.","While we may choose not to develop the product, we have technology that will go into others' products. It could be inks and imaging systems for digital packaging, it could be printheads and materials for 3D printing, it could be low-cost pollution or hazardous gas sensors to keep us and the environment safe. The exact path of these opportunities is hard to predict but the opportunities are real.","Another opportunity is in optimizing our business. To do that, we need to look at things differently. Xerox has been running cost takeout programs for years but they have not been effective. The benefits are not flowing to the bottom line and, as we saw this quarter, margin was down 130 basis points. The processes and the systems we use are complex as is our operating model. For example, there is a lack of clarity on decision authority and who is accountable for outcomes in our current matrix organizational construct.","Often, the result is management by committee and a painful decision making process. We have over 1,000 IT systems that takes resources to manage all these systems and disparate data from various systems hampers the decision making process. From order entry to product install, to repair and billing, we need to redefine our supply chain not only to meet customer requirements but also increase our competitiveness.","We will anchor the transformation of our business on improving how we serve our customers and partners, better differentiating our products, services, systems and resources based on the way they want to be served.","The majority of our revenues are recurring, which drives the dynamic of a relatively stable cash flow over time. This cash flow gives us the room to invest in the business and more directly return cash to shareholders. We have not effectively deployed our capital. M&A has been minimal and we've not done share repurchases in the recent past. It's important that we have a maniacal focus on maximizing cash flow, ensuring its strength well into the future.","From this assessment of the business, we can pivot to our priorities. First, we have an opportunity to drive improvement in our top line by addressing how we go to market. We need to take a strategic approach to customer engagement to meet their evolving needs both in how they choose to buy and the level of service necessary for their business.","We're going to make sure that we have the right mix of direct, indirect and online or e-commerce channels to support our various clients. And we're going to work with our channel partners whether they are agents, concessionaires, document technology partners, solution providers or velocity partners to create frictionless processes and quick response times.","To make this happen, we need to optimize our operations, which is our second priority. This is more than just process optimization. We need to optimize the way we organize our product portfolio, our supply chain, our financial model. Xerox carries the legacy of a much larger business with processes, systems and resources beyond what are required or affordable today.","We need to change the way we operate. In our supply chain, we need to think differently and holistically to eliminate costs while ensuring we get the right offering to the right customer at the right time. We will drive for greater efficiencies, reduced complexity and faster time to market to enable an end-to-end integrated customer experience.","As we improve our operations, we know that to be a tech company, we must re-energize our innovation engine and to revamp our innovation business model, to invest in our own capabilities as well as M&A to enable commercialization of technologies we create. We also need to pursue more partnerships to accelerate our competencies while still maintaining our core differentiation in IP for value capture.","And finally, we will have a priority of always focusing on our cash flow and capital returns to generate shareholder value. I spoke earlier of how cash flow is a critical measure. We are looking at everything, all the pillars of working capital to drive cash flow growth. And in terms of capital deployment, we are revitalizing our M&A engine and we'll deliver our commitment to return at least 50% of our free cash flow to the shareholders.","And, today, we announced that Xerox board of directors authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program and that the company will opportunistically repurchase up to $500 million in 2018. This positive step forward is a strong endorsement of the company and represents an immediate action to deliver value to our investors.","I want to directly address some of the most frequent questions I hear. First, we are not conducting an auction process for the company. An auction is time consuming and costly. If a potential buyer comes forward, it is the responsibility of the board to consider any proposal that could generate additional shareholder value. The team and I are committed to doing what's best for Xerox and we are focused on strengthening the company.","We've been asked if all the recent news headlines and changes have negatively impacted our business. That's not something that is easily measurable but I can tell you we're not here to give excuses. What we've realized is that our customers and partners want us to succeed.","We have work to do to further simplify our operation but we have a solid base to start from. And that is going to be our focus. We're not looking back. That's also why I'm not going to talk about strategic transformation program. We are taking a new comprehensive end-to-end approach to optimize our operations, drive sustainable cost saving more directly to the bottom line and improve how we serve our clients and partners.","The final two questions are related to Fuji Xerox. As you know, in June, I sent a letter to Fujifilm Chairman, Komori, in response to their lawsuit seeking to save the proposed merger of Fuji Xerox and Xerox. We are confident in our right to terminate the transaction and will defend ourselves through the legal process.","The lawsuit was the first communication I received from Fujifilm or Fuji Xerox and it was a surprising tactic from a company that is also our supplier. The letter to Fujifilm stated that we currently do not intend to renew our TA agreement with Fuji Xerox when it expires in 2021. I want to clarify what that means. First, Fuji Xerox is a joint venture between Xerox and Fujifilm and the TA establishes the technology and brand licensing relationships between the two companies.","Not renewing the TA does not dissolve the joint venture. We have a 25% ownership position in Fuji Xerox that is governed by separate Joint Enterprise Contract. As I have said, we will do what is best for Xerox. This is true of the work we are doing to improve our supply chain to be more competitive. This means we need to source products, parts and supplies from the best and most competitive suppliers.","Fuji Xerox is one of our suppliers, today providing 59% of our cost production and we will continue to work with them in areas where they are competitive. We manufacture a portion of the remaining 41% ourselves and have high-quality suppliers for the rest. But we are rethinking the way we choose our suppliers.","The company in the past has not seriously pursued other suppliers. But recently, we were successful in partnering with a supplier for a new product. Just because a supplier has had business with Xerox in the past does not guarantee future business. They will have to earn our business. With all of our suppliers, we execute comprehensive contracts for each product. And these contracts assure continuity of parts and supplies-over the product's life. As for Fuji specifically, we have not seen any disruption in our supply chain.","I am confident in the continuity of supply of Xerox equipment, parts and supplies and we have time to work (16:40) changes in our supply chain to be more competitive and to better serve our customers and partners.","At this point, we turn to the financial results. Our second quarter results were mixed. Equipment revenue and cash flow were good, while margin was pressured. Total revenue declined 4% in constant currency. Within that equipment revenue was better, up 0.9% or down 0.6% at constant currency. Post sale revenue was a disappointment, down 5%. There were a couple of one-off factors that Bill will cover, but we need to deliver multiple quarters of better equipment performance to drive post sales revenue improvement.","Profitability in the quarter was lower than expectations. Adjusted operating margin of 11.9% improved 150 basis points from the first quarter but declined 130 basis points year-over-year, as cost savings were not enough to offset the impacts of revenue declines and other factors. As a result, adjusted EPS of $0.80 was down $0.06, reflecting the impact of the overall lower operating profit.","Through the first half of the year, we generated $451 million of operating cash flow, which was above our expectation and we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet. As I mentioned previously, with the restart of our share repurchase program, we plan to opportunistically repurchase up to $500 million in shares in 2018. We are committed to returning at least 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchase.","Return of cash flow to investors is an important and appropriate element of our capital allocation policy, given our strong cash flow profile. And we are pleased to restart the program, especially at a time when we believe our shares are not trading at their underlying value.","I'd like to hand the presentation over to our CFO, Bill Osbourn, to review our financial performance in more detail.","William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.","Thanks, John. I'll start with a review of the income statement. Revenue in the quarter was down 4% in constant currency, while at actual currency was down 2.2%, reflecting almost 2 points of translation currency tailwinds, a diminishing benefit from the approximate 4% top line currency impact in Q1.","As John highlighted, we're not seeing the degree of turnaround in revenue that we believe should follow our recent significant product launches. And while equipment revenue market share improved 1 point year-over-year in Q1, the latest available share data, we need our market share to recover over multiple quarters to drive increases in machines in fields and improve trends in post sale. I'll cover in more detail what we're seeing in revenue by geography and product area on the next slide.","Turning to profitability, adjusted operating margin of 11.9% declined 130 basis points year-over-year. The decline came from the combination of insufficient productivity to offset revenue declines as well as a few quarter-specific headwinds.","Gross margin of 39.9% was down 70 basis points in the quarter, driven in part by a less profitable mix of revenues. From a stream perspective we had a higher percentage of equipment versus post sale. And within equipment, we weighted toward lower end product sales.","Additionally, last year's results included positive impacts in post sale from a contract buyout and higher licensing revenue. Within SG&A, as forecasted last quarter, we were impacted by $13 million of accelerated depreciation related to a decision to consolidate facilities in Rochester. The combined Q1 and Q2 impact was $22 million. Going forward it will save us about $13 million annually.","We also had a $7 million impact from the write-off of an IT project within delivery that was deemed to no longer have a sufficient return on invested capital due to changes we are making in the business. Absent these two factors, SG&A would have shown a reduction year-over-year of $22 million. Lastly, both R&D and equity income were essentially flat year-over-year, so did not impact margin.","Turning to the below-the-line items, adjusted other expenses net of $14 million were $20 million better year-over-year, driven by a gain of $16 million associated with the sale of a non-core business asset. Adjusted tax rate of 26.7% was within our full year range of 24% to 27% and roughly flat year-over-year. Overall, adjusted EPS of $0.80 was down $0.06 from the second quarter of 2017, driven by the lower operating profit.","On a GAAP basis, we had $0.42 of earnings per share, which was down $0.21 in the quarter, driven by $0.17 of transaction costs. The difference between GAAP and adjusted EPS also includes our normal adjustments around restructuring-related costs, including those for Fuji Xerox; non-service retirement-related costs; and amortization of intangible assets; as well as the $58 million in transaction costs.","Revenue continues to be a mixed picture. Overall, total revenue was down 4% in constant currency, which is modestly better than Q1 and full year 2017, driven by equipment revenue. One factor impacting revenue is higher declines in our OEM business, reflected under other revenue, which was down $31 million in the quarter and represented nearly half of actual currency revenue decline.","As noted previously, the OEM business has a very concentrated set of customers and we recently have been impacted by the change in strategy by our largest customer. We expect this headwind to be with us for the remainder of the year, with an approximate negative 1 point impact on total revenue.","Turning to the geographic sales channels, North America revenues were down 1.8% versus down 2.8% in quarter one with continued growth in Global Imaging Systems, reflecting SMB business as well as an improvement in U.S. enterprise and channels, driven by equipment. International declined 3.9% versus 5.5% in quarter one at constant currency, with the continued pattern of declines in Europe being partially offset by growth in developing markets. Our highest area of decline was in Other, driven by the OEM business as just highlighted.","Looking at the revenue streams, equipment sales revenue or ESR in the quarter was relatively flat at constant currency, reflecting improvement off the prior year weak equipment sales. From a product area perspective, we saw the following: entry equipment revenue grew 10.6% in constant currency with double digit growth in both entry color and black-and-white products. This was a good recovery off the 11% decline last quarter and reflected good demand for new products.","Mid-range equipment revenue comprised 69% of equipment revenue and grew 7.4% in constant currency and had a third quarter in a row of double digit color install growth. We have started to see share gains after having lost share in mid-range prior to last year's product launch. It is important we maintain this positive momentum so we can rebuild our machines in field.","Lastly high-end continues to be weaker, down 9.9% in constant currency, which was consistent with quarter one. Although we saw a good reception for our recently launched Iridesse platform, we only had a partial quarter of benefit and it was not enough to offset declines in other product segments, including iGen.","Post sale declined 5% in constant currency, which was about 1 point worse than trend, driven by the continuing dynamics of lower page volumes, reflecting equipment sales declines in prior quarters as well as an approximate negative 0.5 point impact from the lower licensing and prior year contract buyout I referenced earlier. Within post sale, we did see some improvement in supplies revenue, which comprised 13% of total revenue and grew outside of the OEM business.","I'll wrap up revenue by highlighting that Managed Document Services grew this quarter, up 2.3%, driven specifically by growth in the SMB focused partner print services as well as from higher equipment sales.","Turning now for a closer look at Xerox's profitability performance, as stated, operating margins in the second quarter was 11.9%, an increase of 150 basis points from Q1, however, down 130 basis points year-over-year. And adjusted EPS in the quarter was $0.80, a decline of $0.06 year-over-year.","As highlighted earlier, there were a few unique one-time items we're calling out as we think it is helpful to talk separately to the more operational performance and then to the truly unique items. We believe our operational performance drove an adjusted operating margin of 12.7% and adjusted EPS of $0.81. This reflects a decline year-over-year of 50 basis points to margin and $0.049 to EPS, driven by the impact of revenue declines, which includes ongoing price declines of an approximate 5% on equipment and low single digits on post sale as well as a less favorable margin mix of revenue as described earlier.","These factors were only partially offset by the positive impact of cost savings and currency. In terms of unique one-time items in the quarter, there were three that we believe should be highlighted, two negative and one positive. They include: $13 million of accelerated depreciation associated with the consolidation of real estate in Rochester. This had a 52-basis-point impact to margin and a negative $0.036 impact to EPS. As of June 30, this accelerated depreciation has been fully recognized.","In addition, there was a $7 million IT project write-off, which had a 28-basis-point impact to margin and a negative $0.019 impact to EPS. Partially offsetting these impacts was a non-core asset sale of $16 million. This came through other expenses net, so had no impact on margin but was a boost to EPS of $0.044.","For the second half of the year, we're not giving specific guidance on margin as we continue to build out the plan to support the priorities John highlighted. That said, it is correct to take away from our discussion that the focus on improving profitability is very high and we expect higher margins from this business over time.","Operating cash flow was a source of $235 million in the quarter and we are at $451 million through the first half, while free cash flow was a source of $203 million in Q2 and $401 million for the half. Cash flow is priority one to the business, and I'd like to take a minute to cover our results through six months.","Working capital has been a use of $93 million through six months, driven by timing of payments and includes $38 million of transaction and related payments. A great emphasis is being placed on improving all the cash conversion cycle pillars to drive even greater cash efficiency.","Finance receivables have been a source of $149 million through six months, which compares to $167 million for the same period last year. Typically, finance receivables are a higher source in the first half given the seasonality of revenues, but this is an area where we were traded being less of a source for higher equipment sales.","Pension contributions are $75 million through six months, while restructuring payments are $91 million. Our guidance was for $200 million for the full year for each of these areas. Pension contributions are running under that amount, so there could be an opportunity to do better there, while restructuring payments will likely not be an opportunity, given the greater focus on productivity.","Lastly, CapEx in the quarter was $32 million and is at $50 million through six months. This is an area where we are placing greater scrutiny and could be an opportunity as we move into the back half of the year. In summary, the first half cash flow performance puts us well on track to maintain our full year expectations for both operating cash flow and free cash flow.","If we turn to the next slide, I'll finish by speaking to our capital structure. The second quarter ended with $5.2 billion of debt and $1.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet. In the quarter, we reduced debt by approximately $265 million through the repayment of the May 2018 senior notes.","We break down debt between financing and core, by first calculating the finance debt by applying a 7:1 leverage ratio to our financing assets, finance receivables and other equipment on operating leases, with the remaining debt assumed to be in support of our core business.","In Q2, this calculation resulted in an assumed financing debt of $3.5 billion and core debt of $1.7 billion. As the debt ladder shows, we have no remaining maturities in 2018 with our next maturity of approximately $400 million coming in March of 2019.","Another important element of our capital structure is our pension assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2017, our net unfunded position was $1.4 billion, which compared to $2.2 billion as of December 31, 2016 and includes approximately $850 million of unfunded pension liabilities, which, by design, do not get funded. From a net unfunded perspective, we believe we are well positioned following the higher pension contributions last year.","Before turning it back to John, I'd like to spend a minute to talk about guidance. As you just heard from John, we are confident in our business as demonstrated by our reiteration of our cash flow guidance and the resumption of our share repurchase program. We will be driving improvement in all financial measures. And with 75% of our business recurring in nature, we expect results will follow recent trends.","However, we want to be sure we are making decisions for longer-term sustainability, and, hence, won't be giving specific near term guidance, think balance of the year outside of cash flow.","We'll be providing additional details on financial expectations for the business during an Analyst Day in late 2018 or early 2019.","I'll now turn it back to John for some concluding comments.","Giovanni Visentin - Xerox Corp.","Thank you, Bill. Let me wrap up the presentation with a few closing remarks. We have an opportunity to transform Xerox to return to a technology powerhouse. We are starting from an enviable position. We have tremendous assets. We have great product portfolio and robust innovation capabilities. We have a recognized and respected brand. We have a great customer base, supportive partners and committed employees who are ready for change. We are ready.","We will now open the line for questions. Jennifer?","Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.","Thanks, John. Before we get to the Q&A with John and Bill, I will point out that we have posted on our Xerox Investor Relations website a full set of earnings materials to provide you with a review of our second quarter earnings. During Q&A, I would ask participants to limit follow-on and multi-part questions, so we can get to everyone. At the end of our Q&A session, I will turn it back to John to close the call. Operator, please open the line for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital. Your line is now open.","Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Hey, good morning, guys, and welcome back online here. I appreciate all the \u2013 John and Bill, thanks for all the incremental context, that's helpful to start. Just, I guess, a couple if I could and I'll try to be brief. Just, John, going back to some of your remarks about initial impression when kind of peeling back, how you see Xerox to start, you made comments about opportunities to get more quickly to market, comments about opportunities to be easier to do business with, could you maybe talk a little bit more about that? Are those significant opportunities? And how quickly can those things be addressed? Those seem to be things that might speak to being able to impact the last year revenue growth. And then I have a quick follow-up also. Thanks.","Giovanni Visentin - Xerox Corp.","Okay. Hi, Ananda. If you think of \u2013 if I look at the initial perspective on the business, I see tremendous opportunity. And we're focused on the priorities we discussed. But the complexity of the business is greater than I thought. So part of what we're doing in cost opportunities is we're looking at it in an operational way.","Let me give you just an example. If you're looking at manufacturing a box for a client, you need to look at it end-to-end from the manufacturing, what the costs are, to the development of it, to what's the value to the client and how do you maintain it and how you ship it.","And something as simple as if you can manufacture and ship a box under 45 pounds, you only need one person to deliver that box versus having two people delivering it. So when we're looking at optimizing the business, we need to look at things differently.","Today, as an example, we have 1,400 IT applications to support our business. How do we simplify that? How do we take resources that manage all these systems and put it into an end-to-end solution? And our job is to identify all these issues in our processes, so we can drive a clear end-to-end accountability for decision-making and financial performance.","Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Got it. Got it. And then just quickly, comments about new market opportunities, you highlighted software in a couple of different context. How prominent do you think software can become at the company? And then to the extent you can share now, what might be sort of (36:21), I believe, philosophically some other market segments that you guys think could be attractive to look at?","Giovanni Visentin - Xerox Corp.","Yeah. Capitalizing on our innovation is a key priority, Ananda. Look, so we have assets like XMPie and DocuShare that we have not fully looked at the potential of both these offerings. We also have new technologies that have potential to be disruptive. 3D printing, to make printheads that could change the industry in 3D printing. Packaging, we're creating inks that could revolutionize the way the packaging industry is out there today. We're working on artificial intelligence. We're looking at augmenting reality innovations that will bring more content and more useful, more valuable to our clients. So our researchers are putting a lot of efforts. It's how do we take all of this and how do we capitalize on it. So, I see a lot of opportunity in our innovation and in our software business, which albeit today is small but growing but how do we continue to focus on that.","Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.","Thanks, Ananda.","Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks so much.","Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.","Thanks, Ananda. Operator, next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross of Cross Research. Your line is now open.","Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC","Thank you very much for taking my questions. I guess, John you commented that auctions are off the table and that if a buyer presents itself, you would consider it. So should we read from that that there are no active engagements right now for a deal? Are you committed to the fact that there is no relationship or no potential for an actual deal with Fuji Xerox to come together?","Giovanni Visentin - Xerox Corp.","No. So, an auction \u2013 first of all, hi, Shannon. To run an auction, it's time consuming and it's costly and it's taking our people away from what's important, which is what we said our priority is to fix the business. So we are first and foremost focused on doing what's right for Xerox and strengthening the company. If \u2013 the board will evaluate a strategic alternative as indicated but at the end of the day, if someone wants to offer \u2013 wants to come in with a strategic offer, we would need to evaluate it and bring it to the board.","Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC","Okay. And then -","Giovanni Visentin - Xerox Corp.","But I would not \u2013 yeah, so, I'm not commenting on any potential discussions. So...","Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC","Okay. And then what are your thoughts \u2013 one other things that didn't come up during the call were thoughts on investment grade. That's been something that Xerox has maintained for many, many years since the challenges back in like 2000. So, and \u2013 or actually, I guess, it took a while to get back. But what do you think about investment grade? Is it something that you need to keep? And then, obviously, there was commentary in the press about the leasing business. What are your thoughts on the leasing business at this point?","Giovanni Visentin - Xerox Corp.","Yeah, I would say we're currently committed to our investment grade rating. Nothing we announced today should signal otherwise. We have a strong balance sheet. We've met our commitments on paying down debt earlier this year. So we've got priorities in place to strengthen even further our business. So the board, in keeping with its responsibilities, will consider, when appropriate, strategic alternatives for the company but there is no changes to communicate at this time.","Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC","Okay, and then just my final question, I appreciate you're not providing earnings guidance because you're still going through the strategic review. But I don't know if you or Bill could possibly just talk about some of the trends or thoughts that you think will happen over the next couple of quarters, just so people's numbers don't get sort of massively out of whack in terms of where you guys think things will flow through because, obviously, with cash flow there are a lot of different levers you can pull to generate the cash flow but in light of where we are in earnings, it would be great to have some color.","William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Shannon. So, yeah, just a few things, to reiterate a few of my comments on the prepared comments, we are very confident in the business. We think that the share repurchase is a clear indication of that confidence in the business and that we believe that our current stock price does not reflect its true value of the company. We're driving for improvement on all measures, not just the cash flow measure. And as you know, 75% of our revenues are recurring in nature and thus you wouldn't expect our results to differ significantly from recent trends overall.","And specifically I know you understand, we're early in the new leadership here at Xerox and we're specifically looking at all things, and we're making decisions for the longer-term on sustainability. But our overall commitment is to do what's best for Xerox and that won't be measured by the next three to six months of an adjusted EPS number.","With that said, we do believe that the cash flow guidance does provide some guide rails as far as overall expectations on where we'd be for the rest of the year. A few things to think about when you look back last year's results, obviously, Q4 will be a tougher compare versus Q3. There was some one-time items, you can go back to, specifically looking at what we reported last year in Q3 and Q4, which is calling out like the headwind in Q3 would be \u2013 there was a Grenoble technology sale that created about a $0.09 headwind. There was a lower tax rate during Q3 of last year due to some tax reserve adjustments that took place.","But overall \u2013 and then you look at the seasonality of the business, it's still true, no matter what. Q3 tends to have lower operating margins than Q4. And then, I guess, I'm trying to think through (42:24), finally, on share repurchase, people can model through the impact, but we don't expect much of an impact in Q1. It could be up to $0.05 or so potentially depending if you go to the higher end of the range of the up to $500 million in Q4. Those are sort of things at a higher level to give some context on year-over-year thinking.","Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC","Great. Thank you. That was very helpful.","Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.","Great. Thanks, Shannon. Operator, next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Foster (sic) [Paul Coster] of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes, thank you very much for taking my question, and thank you John for the clarity and candor of your assessment of the company. I think it really helps preferencerize (43:07) the risks for us to understand the opportunities better.","That said, obviously, there is a ton of action points falling out of your assessment already and I'm sure you're going to bring it all together into some kind of program that you'll disclose at the Analyst Day event. Can you, though, give us your hunch as to how long you think it will take to sort of bring about the sort of change in direction that you seek? And to save time, just a quick question for Bill, on total contract value, look like there's a little bit of weakness in that enterprise segment, if you could just provide some color there. Thank you very much.","Giovanni Visentin - Xerox Corp.","Thank you, Paul. Look, as I said in my statement, those are significant opportunities to optimize our business. And we're looking at how we do things differently and it's always focused on how we even better serve our clients.","In terms of timing, by fourth quarter, end of fourth quarter, early first quarter, we'll have an Analyst Day and we'll take you through the whole plan and everything. But we're focused starting today on doing everything that we've said in our business, which is how do we help drive revenue, how do we optimize our operations, how do we re-energize the innovation engine and our continuous focus on capital returns and on cash flows. So that starts today. In fact, it started eight weeks ago but \u2013 and we're continuing to focus on that.","William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.","Yeah. Hey, Paul, it's Bill. Yeah, regarding if you're looking at signings in the quarter being down, MDS signings down 20.6%, just breaking that down in a little bit more detail, new business signings, which are really the \u2013 all signings are important, but it's critical to say that (44:55) new business signings were actually up 2% during the quarter. Renewals, somewhat can be lumpy in nature depending on what is the opportunity and what's available. And actually the amount that came up for renewal during the quarter had a fair amount of impact. There was just less coming up in Q2 of this year versus Q2 of last year. But renewals were down and part of that was also due to the win rate percentage that was clearly lower than our targeted 90% plus win rate and lower than our prior year win rate, we were at about year 75%.","But really that was driven by two larger enterprise deals and so like I said, there's lumpiness and there's also just large deals can drive that percentage from quarter-to-quarter. And clearly you look at it, we're striving to do well in all parts of the market. But clearly, we're also very pleased with what's happening in the SMB side of the signings area, where we don't get as quite as much detailed (46:03) information, because we're dealing with partners a lot, but the end results when you look at what's happening in MDS, we feel good about that.","Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.","Thanks, Paul. Operator, next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva of Citi. Your line is now open.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you very much, John and Bill. I'll ask my questions and you guys can decide how to divide it up and thank you for the details so much. So, first of all, John, in your prepared comments, you mentioned several times about Xerox needing to come to market faster and be more efficient. For myself as well as many of us on the call, we've heard this many, many, many times in the past. So can you help us understand about really what's new or what you found that has prevented this from happening, because it feels like a little bit of a broken record?","And then my follow-up question is on the renewal rate of 75%. That seems to actually counter to your prepared comments of the great relationships you have and the need and the value that Xerox is providing because the renewal rate of 75% is not overly encouraging. So can you help us bridge the gap of those prepared comments and kind of what we're seeing and maybe it's just a matter of time or timing, but something just I'm not grasping there? Thank you.","Giovanni Visentin - Xerox Corp.","Okay. So look, Jim, let me start with answering it. We've talked to a lot of clients, talked to a lot of partners and what came out was a common theme. One, they want us to win. Two, they like the products we have.","As we look inside of our own technologies and our own innovations, the questions that they were asking us is how do you take this to market faster and how do we help you take it to market faster. So we have existing products today that go through our channels, go through our different channels. But how do you take other products whether it's a new technology that you have in your innovation, those are some of the best kept secrets out there in the industry.","So as recently as a few days ago, I spoke to a very high level executive in a financial organization and just took them through some of the offerings we have over and above what we offer today, the MDS, the services. And we're going to do an Innovation Day with their team. And this is in a competitive environment, so it's a non-Xerox account.","And they want to see because most of our clients are asking us tell us what we don't know. You have these great products but what else do you have? And that's where I got excited when asked, hey, John, what's different when I got here? That's one of the area that's different is that our innovation assets are much better than I even assumed when I was looking at it. But how do we get it to market faster? And that's part of getting it to market faster. It's not just what we have today but a lot more. How do we capitalize on that? We have tremendous assets like DocuShare, whether it's XMPie. These are game changers for clients. How do we assure ourselves that we use our go-to-market in our (49:25) channels to help us get that to clients faster?","William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.","Yeah. And I would just add on, Jim, that as I said in a response to previous comment, the 75% was driven by primarily two larger enterprise contracts that came up for renewal. We don't want to lose any contract, obviously, we would prefer not lose any, but I would not extrapolate from just two renewals that we didn't win to how our overall customer base, how satisfied they are with us. And as John said, based upon our discussions and our overall feedback, our customers are clearly with us and want us to do well and serve them well.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. And then my quick follow-up is, in the past the management team kind of gave, I believe, some EPS ranges of, I think, it was, if I remember right, $3.50 to $3.70 and revenues of down 2% to 4% (50:18). You reiterated cash flow for this year. Is it fair to say that the revenue and EPS is something that you guys are no longer affirming to?","William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.","Yeah. Effectively that's \u2013 in my response to Shannon's earlier question, really just giving the rationale, that we have guide rails, we believe, by pointing to the cash. People know, as you know, the industry that there the trends, 75% recurring revenues, et cetera. But \u2013 and you wouldn't expect significant changes from recent trends.","With that said, over the next six months, we have a new leadership team in here. John has been here for roughly 10 weeks and we're making decisions that are going to benefit Xerox's shareholders for the longer-term. And we don't want to be bound just by the next three to six months of results. With that said, we are very confident overall in our business. And there is stability in the organization. We are back to work, not that we are away from work or anything but there was a lot of noise out there in the media earlier in the year but that didn't impact us while we were going through that and certainly now we're all back to work.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks for the details. Greatly appreciate it. Thank you.","Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.","Thanks, Jim. Operator, I think we have time for one last question.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning. Just following on some of the last few questions, obviously, there is some concern around the weaker MDS signings, high-end equipment sales were also weaker. And so just speaks to confidence around the strategy and stability in your large enterprise customer base. So I wonder if you can comment now that the leadership team has been put in place for a couple of months, as you said, everybody is back engaged at work. Have you seen stabilization in those two metrics, MDS signings and high-end equipment sales in the month of July?","And then I'll just ask my follow-up. Bill, on cash flow, you talked about needing to improve working capital. When should we expect to see that impact? What are you specifically doing? And do you need improved working capital in order to hit the free cash flow targets for the remainder of the year? Thanks.","William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.","Great. Let me \u2013 I think most of those questions all fall towards me. Let me answer the last one first regarding working capital. There has always been a focus on working capital within the company. I would tell you with John coming onboard that there has been even more. John said in his comments, maniacal focus on cash. I would view it in terms of that we're comfortable with the cash flow guidance that we provided originally, that we're reiterating, that we provided originally in January.","As far as working capital pillars, days sales outstanding, days sales in inventory, days payable outstanding, we're working to improve all of those significantly even though (53:27) we had originally planned that. It's just that the need to actually \u2013 those will make it even better I guess, I would view it from a cash flows perspective that if you look at where we're at year-to-date on cash flows, we're already at $400 million of free cash flow year-to-date. And seasonally, Q4 is the strongest, that improvements in working capital, additional improvements will only help us and give us upside. It's really my perspective on that.","From an MDS perspective, don't like to start going to the months, as we get to the lumpiness, it can be even lumpier within months, within a quarter. With that said, overall MDS was up 2.3%. MDS revenues 2.3% in constant currency, driven by a significant improvement in ESR, equipment sales revenue, in Q2 within MDS.","The channels or the SMB part of the business continues to be strong, it's growing double-digits again and up 14.4% in MDS revenues. And enterprise still continues to be \u2013 it's a more competitive, more mature market, it was down about 1% in revenues for the quarter. So overall, we view ourselves as the market leader in MDS and we expect to continue to be that. The two larger deals we lost during the quarter, we're not happy about but overall for the longer-term we're still expecting to be strong in MDS.","Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.","Great. Thanks. Katy. Let me hand it back to John to wrap up with a few closing comments.","Giovanni Visentin - Xerox Corp.","Look, I'll end as I started, like this is a new beginning for Xerox. I look to updating you on our progress. We have work to do. But I want to be clear of our objectives and they include we're going to drive revenue, optimize our operations for simplicity, which is key for what our clients are looking for. Re-energize the innovation engine and we're going to focus on cash and increase capital returns.","At the end of the day, our success will be measured based on our ability to satisfy our clients and deliver value to our shareholders. So I'd like to thank everyone for joining our call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may all disconnect.

We will be reporting today our Q4 and full year 2014 results on a continuing operations basis. Prior period results have been revised to reflect this change, details of which can be found on our Investor Relations website at www.xerox.com\/investor. Ursula?","Ursula Burns","Thanks, Jim. Good morning thanks for joining our call. Today we're reporting fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings. A lot has happened in the last 90 days and overall we're pleased with where we ended the year. We're reporting solid results that in some places exceeded expectations. I'll give a quick overview of our financials, provide some perspective on the year and share updates on key initiatives contributing to our results before turning it over to Kathy to go into more detail on the financials.","We delivered strong profit and cash for the year and we closed strong in services revenue and margin. Services revenue growth improved through the year and we saw improved margin performance. Services signings increased as well driven by renewals in BPO and we ended the year with strong Document Outsourcing signings of over a $1 billion. In fact, our Canadian operation closed its largest ever multimillion-dollar MPS deal with the Government of Canada in November.","In Document Technology, we delivered strong margin throughout the year, reflecting both our continued focus on profitability as well as a favorable environment and for the fifth consecutive year we're the leader in equipment sale revenue.","Demand has been strong for our iGen and the new Versant products in the U.S. and Europe. These products provide our graphic communications customers with the ability to produce digital color prints at scale with a high level of personalization, quality and reliability.","As you know, Xerox has been focusing on the segments where we have the most competitive advantage and we have been steadily shifting our portfolio mix. As an example, we announced the pending divestiture of our ITO business through a sale to Atos. This will allow us to focus squarely on Business Process Services and Document Outsourcing and provide additional capacity to invest further in these businesses.","We've aligned our Services go-to-market model into a set of industry teams and our delivery model along functional capabilities such as customer care, human resources, consulting and analytics and transaction processing. We've made progress improving our government healthcare business and in 2014 we committed resources to maturing our MMIS enterprise platform.","While we still have work to do, the hard work of the team is paying off. We remain bullish about this market and its opportunities for us. Innovation is a differentiator for us now and will continue to be in the future. Within customer care, we introduced an intelligent virtual customer care agent that can diagnose and resolve customer inquiries in the same way, if not better than a human agent would.","Xerox invested in HealthSpot, a pioneer in patient and provider-driven healthcare technology. As their exclusive BPO partner, we will support HealthSpot as they provide groundbreaking telehealth patients at convenient neighborhood locations. It's an important step in the transformation of healthcare and an exciting place for Xerox to be.","In the second half, the Document Technology team launched 20 new products that were well received and are a reminder to the market of our innovation power. We continue to receive recognition from the industry for business and technology leadership. Gartner, Quocirca and others recognized us for our managed print and content services, finance and accounting and BPO. Everest Group named Xerox a leader in its service provider landscape ranking for the contact center outsourcing market for the healthcare industry.","We're feeling good about our progress. We remain focused on being the best partner to our clients and making Xerox a great place to work for our people and delivering value to our investors.","Now let's take a look at the results in more detail. We delivered earnings just above our range and grew margin in both our segments and on a total Xerox basis. We're reporting adjusted EPS of $0.31 and GAAP EPS of $0.26. Profit improved this quarter as we made progress in Services. Services margin improved in the fourth quarter to 9.8% and we continued to benefit from a favorable environment and strong operational management in Document Technology.","On the revenue side, the improved growth in Services to 3% in the quarter is notable especially considering the impact from the loss of the Texas Medicaid contract. Document Technology revenue declined in-line with recent trends. Acquisitions remain a key aspect of our portfolio management strategy. For the full year 2014, we invested almost $350 million in acquisitions.","We're focused on enhancing our Services offerings and expanding our global reach. We have a goal in 2015 to get more done on this front, up to $900 million in acquisitions with part of those funds coming from the sale of our ITO business. With that objective in mind, we closed on one modestly sized acquisition since the beginning of the year, Intrepid Learning Systems which includes a service to ensure companies' employees are equipped with the latest skills and knowledge to improve their business performance.","And underpinning our results in business model is strong cash generation. We closed the quarter with $850 million in cash from operations and over $2 billion for the year. This supported our acquisitions activity, growing dividends and share repurchases. In fact, we announced today a 12% increase in our annual dividend rate to $0.28 per share.","Shifting ahead to 2015, our results will be impacted by the recent volatility in foreign currencies. As a result, we have adjusted 2015 guidance to reflect these headwinds. Kathy will go into greater detail on currency in just a moment.","With that, I will turn it over to Kathy, then I'll wrap up and we'll open the call for your questions. Kathy?","Kathy Mikells","Thanks, Ursula and good morning, everyone. We were pleased with the progress we made this quarter. Both Services revenue growth and margin improved and with the announcement of the planned sale of our ITO business to Atos, we took a key step in our portfolio management strategy. In addition, our Document Technology business continued to deliver strong profitability. The positive results in Services and Document Technology yielded earnings higher than our expectations and strong cash flow.","I'll cover the segments and cash flow in a moment, but first let me walk through our fourth quarter earnings. As noted earlier with the pending sale of our ITO business, my commentary will be on a continuing operations basis excluding ITO.","Total revenue in the quarter was down 3% at actual currency and 1% at constant currency. This compares to down 2% at both actual and constant currency in the third quarter. Underlying constant currency growth improved from the third quarter driven by better Services performance. And as expected, we saw the impact of actual currency rates turn negative in the quarter.","Gross margin of 32.1% was up 10 basis points year-over-year as the positive benefit in Document Technology from productivity initiatives, currency and pension expense more than offset the greater mix of services at a lower margin. RD&E was modestly lower year-over-year as increased investments in Services were more than offset by reductions in Document Technology.","SAG was lower in both segments as we benefited from productivity initiatives as well as lower bad debt and pension expenses. These improvements resulted in our fourth quarter operating margin increasing a 100 basis points year-over-year and operating profit growth of almost 7%. And for the full year, operating profit improved $72 million and operating margin was up 60 basis points.","Moving down the income statement, adjusted other net was a $6 million higher expense year-over-year. Lower gains on sale of assets of $20 million and ruble-related currency losses of $5 million were only partially offset by $19 million in lower restructuring costs. For the full year, a tough compare resulted in adjusted other net expense coming in $102 million higher. In 2013, we realized greater benefits from transaction gains and other non-operational below-the-line credits. In addition, restructuring charges were $13 million higher this year.","Our equity income was $41 million in the fourth quarter down $2 million dollars year-over-year driven by the impact of negative translation currency. Our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate of 25.3% was up about 1 percentage point year-over-year and within our guidance of 23% to 27%.","Adjusted EPS of $0.31 was $0.04 higher year-over-year driven by operating profit growth and lower share count. For the full year, adjusted EPS of $1.07 was $0.03 higher as operating profit growth and lower share count were partially offset by higher adjusted other net expense.","I'll now move to the Services segment slide to review those results in a little bit more detail. Services revenue grew 1% and was up 3% in constant currency which was two points better sequentially. Within Services at constant currency, BPO growth increased to 4% from 2% in the third quarter with good growth in commercial healthcare payer, electronic tolling, litigation services and international. Document Outsourcing was up 1% year-over-year at constant currency, a modest improvement from the third quarter but under our segment growth objective. We're beginning to see good traction from our next-generation MPS offerings and we're encouraged by the good signings in the quarter.","Overall in Services we're making progress improving growth and we continue to expect 2% to 4% constant currency Services growth this year. Our growth rate will be lower in the first half, reflecting the impact from the Texas Medicaid contract loss last year, slower first half Document Outsourcing growth and expected ramp timing for a couple of large new business contract awards. The Texas loss creates a headwind of about 150 basis points until we lap it in August.","Total signings in the quarter were up 20% driven by strong growth in renewals including the large BPO contract renewal that I referenced last quarter which helped to drive a strong BPO renewal rate of 93%. BPO new business was light as we're still working towards signed and approved contracts for the New York Medicaid and Florida tolling new business awards. We're getting closer on both and continue to expect them to sign in the first half.","Our sales force is now aligned to specific industry verticals and we're investing in increased sales coverage and training. These actions will positively impact new business signing as we move through 2015. Document Outsourcing signings of $1 billion were the highest in recent history with good growth on both the renewal and new business side. So a good signings quarter for Document Outsourcing which should enable growth to pick up by the middle of the year.","Shifting to profitability, segment margin was 9.8% in the fourth quarter which was up 70 basis points sequentially, up 10 basis points year-over-year and toward the higher end of our targeted 9% to 10% range. We're making progress on our Services initiative and improving execution.","In BPO, we saw multiple lines of business contribute to the year-over-year profit improvement and Document Outsourcing margins remained strong. Our results in government healthcare were in-line with our expectations and we're seeing positive results from our investments to mature the platform and improve our operational performance. We're confident we\u2019re on the right track and we started some work ahead of finalizing the New York Medicaid contract to ensure we get off to the right start there.","In 2015 our focus will be on accelerating growth and driving a solid 50 basis points of margin improvement year-over-year. In summary, the fourth quarter was the strongest quarter of the year for Services both in terms of growth and margins and we're taking the actions required to hit our targeted 2015 core operating results.","With that I will now turn to Document Technology. Fourth quarter total revenue in Document Technology was in-line with our expectations with constant currency results down 6% which was consistent with the full year rate of decline. As expected, the impact of actual currency rates turned on us this quarter with a negative two point impact.","Equipment revenue declines were higher driven by weakness in Eurasia, reflecting the volatility in Russia's economy as well as the timing of large account sales. The decline in annuity revenue moderated a bit sequentially driven by modestly higher supplies demand and a more favorable compare given the prior-year channel inventory reduction. Similar to last quarter, the finance receivable sales in the prior year was almost a one point negative impact to revenue growth.","From a geographic perspective, the U.S. and Europe were relatively stable, while developing markets outside of Russia was a positive contributor to results. Looking at our product groups, High-End remains the best performing sub-segment, reporting annuity growth at constant currency for the third quarter in a row. We saw good traction from the recent launch of our new Versant Entry production color product as well as good growth in our iGen product family.","Mid-Range color activity was relatively flat and consistent with the third quarter as we continue to lap our ConnectKey launch from last year. Mono declined in-line with industry trends.","Entry A4 activity was lower year-over-year given weakness in Eurasia as well as the timing of our Entry product refresh. We launched 11 new products late in the third quarter and early in the fourth. Market reception has been positive, but the timing caused us to only catch a partial benefit in the quarter.","Profitability was quite strong. Our Q4 margins came in above our expectations at 14.4%, resulting in segment profit growth of 14%. This strong performance reflects benefits from restructuring and productivity initiatives, positive transaction currencies that more than offset negative translation impact and lower bad debt expense as well as lower pension expense. So another solid quarter for Document Technology.","Now I'm going to turn to cash flow. Before I go through the cash flow, I would like to make one comment related to the announced ITO sale. Our GAAP net income includes a non-cash loss triggered by the pending sale of the ITO business of approximately $180 million driven mainly by goodwill allocated to that business. You can see the loss is added back further down in the cash flow statement; so net-net there's no cash flow impact.","Moving on, our cash flow from operations was $857 million in the quarter and a little over $2 billion for the year which was just above our range. As expected, cash flow in the quarter and full year were lower solely due to the impact from finance receivable sales in prior years versus no sales in 2014.","Looking at the full year underlying cash flow which excludes the impact from prior finance receivable sales, was $2.5 billion and compares to $2.1 billion in 2013. The largest driver of the year-over-year improvement in underlying cash flow was a reduction in net working capital resulting from both performance and timing factors including lower DSO and improved year-end collections, especially in Services improved terms with a few key vendors as well as seasonal smoothing of working capital.","Additionally, we have higher runoff from our underlying finance receivables associated with lower originations as well as lower equipment revenue. These year-over-year benefits were partially offset by higher pension funding. Moving down the cash flow statement, investing cash flows were a $129 million use in the quarter and a $703 million use for the full year. For the full year, we spent $452 million on CapEx and $340 million on acquisitions.","Cash from financing was a use of $297 million in the fourth quarter and $1.6 billion for the year, included in that full year amount is $1.07 billion spent on share repurchases and $313 million used for preferred and common stock dividends.","Now I'll quickly cover our capital structure. We ended the year with $7.7 billion in debt which excludes approximately $75 million in capital lease obligations related to our ITO business which were reclassified to a discontinued operations liability account. Applying 7-to-1 leverage on customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt at year-end was $4.2 billion leaving core debt of $3.5 billion. We manage our core debt to maintain a leverage ratio consistent with our investment-grade ratings. Our financing debt has come down over the past few years driven by finance receivable transactions as well as lower originations.","During 2015, we have two tranches of debt coming due, about $1 billion in February and $250 million in June. We continue to be comfortable with our leverage position and we plan to refinance these notes during 2015 which will result in our year-end debt being roughly flat at about $7.7 billion. So our capital structure remains stable; and if we move to the next slide, I'll review where we're at in terms of capital allocation. During 2014, we returned close to $1.4 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends.","This equates to approximately 85% of our free cash flow for the year. Those numbers include $1.07 billion of share repurchases and approximately $300 million of dividends. We also spent a total of $340 million on acquisitions, that's $185 million higher year-over-year, but shy of our target of up to $500 million. We obviously have more work to do here and we're focused on concentrating on a bit larger deals as well as adding more resources into this area.","For 2015, our capital allocation plan is unchanged and it reflects the redeployment of the expected net proceeds of roughly $850 million from the ITO sale. On share repurchase, we plan to spend about $1 billion repurchasing stock in 2015. We continue to view our shares as an attractive price and it's a good investment. On acquisitions, we expect to spend up to $900 million. In keeping with our portfolio management strategy, we're looking to acquire companies that will expand our capabilities in attractive service areas as well as extend our global reach in Services.","As I mentioned on debt, we're comfortable with our leverage position and expect to end the year roughly flat at $7.7 billion. Finally on dividends, we're announcing today a 12% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.07 per share. This will result in spend of just over $300 million with share repurchases effectively self-funding most of the increase.","Before I turn it back to Ursula, I would like to summarize our expectation for the full year as well as the first quarter. As Ursula mentioned, we've seen a sharp movement in currencies around the world in the last 45 days. Where we would normally offset modest currency impacts, the dramatic nature of this move creates almost $100 million of profit exposure year-over-year.","Most significant to us in this short time the euro has weakened by about 10% versus the dollar and 9% versus the \u00a5 and the Canadian dollar has weakened 7% against the dollar. These currency moves cause both negative translation and transaction impacts. While we continue to look for ways to offset more of this negative impact, we believe it's prudent to capture the current exposure by revising our guidance.","Let me walk you through the details on where we're at on full year guidance and then I'll cover the first quarter. On revenue, our constant currency expectations are unchanged versus what we communicated at our November Investor Conference, Total company roughly flat at constant currency, Services up 2% to 4% with growth improving as we move through the year, Document Technology down 4% to 5% which reflects some improvement as the negative impact of the prior finance receivable sales moderate and we realize more benefit from our product launches late in the second half of last year.","However, we now expect currency will have a negative 3 to 4 point impact to revenue for the full year versus flat to about 1 point previously communicated with Document Technology having a little higher impact and Services a little lower given the geographic mix of the revenues.","On margins, we continue to target a 50 basis point improvement year-over-year in Services which would put us at the middle of our 9% to 10% range. For Document Technology, we continue to expect to be within our 11% to 13% range, but likely more towards the middle of the range driven by year-over-year increased pension costs that we've talked about previously as well as the negative net currency impact.","As a result of the lower expected revenue and actual currency as well as related pressure on Document Technology margins, we expect the flow-through to impact earnings roughly by $0.06 and as a result we're lowering our full year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 to $1.00 to $1.06.","Turning to cash flow, the timing of the ITO sale negatively impacts free cash flow as we expect to sell the business in the first half and it produces most of its free cash flow in the second. Additionally, currency impacts our cash, presenting another headwind. We expect to offset some of this impact in 2015 and incremental M&A should offset the ITO impact next year. Net-net, we're bringing down our operating cash flow guidance by $200 million to $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion and our free cash flow down $100 million to $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion.","Now to first quarter guidance. In Document Technology, we anticipate revenue declines to be down mid-single digits in constant currency with actual results about four points lower given currency rates particularly the weakening of the euro and Canadian dollar. We expect Q1 Document Technology to continue to deliver very strong margin, but seasonally they'll be lower and below last year's 12.2% driven mainly by higher non-cash pension expense as well as negative currency impact.","In Services, constant currency revenue growth will be at the low end of our 2% to 4% full year guidance range driven by tougher compares, expected timing of ramping awarded new business and slower Document Outsourcing growth. We expect currency to have about a three point negative impact. We expect margins to be seasonally lower, but up modestly year-over-year.","At the consolidated level for the first quarter, we expect revenue will be down 1 to 2 points at constant currency with 3 to 4 points of negative currency impact. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $0.20 to $0.22 which includes approximately $0.02 of restructuring. The decline versus $0.26 last year is driven by higher non-cash pension expense, adverse currency, higher OID given a prior-year gain on asset sale as well as a higher tax rate, 26% planned this year versus 20% last year. That's partially offset by improvements in Services' operational performance as well as lower share count.","Overall, we're making progress in our core business operations and will be working hard to offset the pressure we're seeing from currency.","With that, I'll hand it back to you, Ursula.","Ursula Burns","Thanks, Kathy. I want to get to your questions, so I will summarize quickly. Our fourth quarter shows our strategy is sound and the decisions we've made have put us on the right path forward. We're seeing the benefits of strong operating profit from Document Technology and improving profits and revenue in Services, where we're making visible progress. Our Services business is now better positioned for future growth.","We know 2015 is already bringing some headwinds. As we mentioned earlier, we're watching the unprecedented movements in currencies especially the euro as Kathy outlined, but as always, we will manage with a disciplined approach. We will work hard and make the necessary adjustments to our operations.","Our commitment remains the same and our diversified portfolio and strong cash flow, combined with our operating model, guides our priorities. In Services, building on the momentum to increase sales and profits through portfolio management improved productivity and excellent offerings. In Document Technology, capitalizing on the most advantaged segments of the business to maintain our leadership position in the industry, while maintaining strong profitability and we will continue to generate healthy cash flow to deliver shareholder value.","Thank you and now over to you, Jim.","Jim Lesko","Thanks, Ursula. Joining Ursula and Kathy today is Bob Zapfel, Head of our Services business. Also let me point out that we have several supplemental slides at the end of our deck. They provide more financial detail to support today's presentation and complement our prepared remarks.","For the Q&A, I ask participants to limit follow-on and multipart questions so we can get to everyone and at the end of our Q&A session, I will turn it back to Ursula for closing comments. Operator, please open the line for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of George Tong with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.","George Tong - Piper Jaffray","We saw nice Services margin expansion this quarter, both on the year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter basis. Can you discuss what's changed this quarter to yield a positive inflection in Services margins and the work you have in the pipeline to sustain the positive momentum?","Kathy Mikells","Sure. I'll start and then maybe Bob can add some color. Overall, we have been working throughout the year in terms of building initiatives, especially around reducing our overall cost structure from a productivity perspective, looking to get greater growth out of the areas where we have higher margins and as we pivot forward towards 2015, organizationally; changing our go-to-market approach, focused by industry and putting together operating capabilities that go across the company in order to help us to drive further productivity enhancements.","One of the factors was clearly our overall government healthcare solutions business, stabilizing for us. It came in I would say very consistent with our expectations and our overall margins came in consistent with our expectations as well. So we feel good about the fact that our government healthcare business is performing a little bit better. Obviously, we had a lot of pressure in that business in 2014 and it's one of the areas as we look to 2015 that we're expecting continued improvement.","So as you look towards 2015, our fourth quarter performance I think is right in-line with what we expected in Services and it gives us that much more confidence in our 50 basis point margin expansion expectations for next year. Bob, I don't know if you want to add more color.","Bob Zapfel","Yes, I would just add we had good cost management generally across the board by our teams and in government healthcare we as Kathy said, had stabilization and were really able to absorb investments that we were making in advance on New York and still fit if you will, inside the targeted margins that we want to deliver. So overall, the plays that we've developed relative to global capabilities and managing our cost structure seemed to have reasonable yield last quarter.","George Tong - Piper Jaffray","And then as a follow-up, we're seeing Xerox take a more verticalized industry approach in its Services business. Can you discuss progress you are seeing with this initiative and discuss how verticalization may impact pipeline performance on a near-term and intermediate-term basis?","Bob Zapfel","Let me briefly cover that. This is Bob, obviously. I would say we're seeing already better cross-selling opportunities. So as we go to market and we've moved out of our large number of independent business units and we have a sales force that has a broader responsibility of all the offering set to those clients, we're seeing better cross-selling opportunities. We had the whole team together for a big sales kickoff and I think that that's off to a fair start.","I would say relative to pipeline as you saw from our release, our overall pipeline numbers are down marginally. There are a lot of moving parts relative to pipeline with taking ITO out and trying to count once validated as opposed to just earlier in the cycle, once noticed. But I would expect our pipeline to grow during the year as a result of the sales force additions and the focus on customers in vertical markets.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.","Shannon Cross","A question with regard to acquisitions for Ursula and Kathy and I guess Bob too, actually. Given the $900 million bogey that you've put out there for the year and then the history that we've seen over the past few years, how are you thinking about ramping it up? Is this -- you've got in the hopper a couple of large ones, so you feel like it can be done? Again, it's a much larger number than you've done in the past and then if you can't get there, I assume share repurchase is a focus, but would you want to keep the cash for some other purpose? Thank you.","Ursula Burns","It's a good question. We have been improving our acquisition flow, $150 million to $350 million to $900 million this year. It will be a difficult run for us, but it is one that we're absolutely committed to and we're putting in place activities, meaning people, incentives to the line people, people focused on deals as well to make sure that we can actually get up to the $900 million that we have laid out.","This is a good problem to have, meaning we have the money and we will get a lot of it in the middle of the year and we want to spend it and people know. So we're working through it. I won't comment on any deals that we have in the hopper just to say that we're working on making sure that we can spend all $900 million.","If we don't spend it -- I'll actually turn it over to Kathy. The strategy that we have is pretty much in place, but she can actually just reiterate it.","Kathy Mikells","Yes. One other thing I would comment on which I'm sure I've mentioned before, we have a desire to do what I would describe as chunkier deals. We're never going to get there just doing deals at $25 million at a crack, right? That's just infeasible. So that's clearly part of the overall strategy. And as Ursula mentioned, the fact that we've loudly broadcast this hopefully helps to generate a little bit bigger pipeline.","We're also very actively engaging the business people, right? Bob certainly would tell you it's something that's a top priority in the business people. So we're working collectively across the organization in order to make this happen. Finally on timing, we recognize that this is a big step up for us in 2015 in terms of what we're trying to accomplish. By the way, the incremental money is not coming in the door until the middle of the year, so just a note for folks on that.","So there is a possibility that we won't get 100% of the $900 million spent this year. Our expectation is we would look to flow that over, in trying to accomplish more in the first quarter of 2016. We've already announced that we're going to do roughly $1 billion in share repurchases this year. We ended the year with a strong cash balance to enable us to again be more consistent in terms of being in the market consistently. So that's what we expect to do with the money and we're all working hard to get it deployed as fast as possible.","Shannon Cross","And then as a follow-up, can you talk a little bit about what your metrics are around potential acquisitions? How we should think about accretion, what you're focused on from a financial standpoint when you look at prospective acquisitions.","Kathy Mikells","First and foremost, we're focused on what I would call return-adjusted, risk-adjusted returns. We're interested in doing good deals. We've been historically very disciplined, we're certainly not going to change that in our approach. So first and foremost that's what we're interested in.","Of course, we always look at what's the accretive, dilutive nature of the transaction, how much are we paying for it etcetera, we're focused on trying to do deals that generate synergies because then we have more dollars to play with in what's a pretty competitive marketplace. But those are some of the things that we're focused on overall and I say before any of the math, we're focused on buying companies that are a great strategic fit for us.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.","Tien-tsin Huang","It's Tien-tsin. Just want to ask on the Services margin front again, just all the different puts and takes. I know there is a lot of government healthcare expenses, etcetera you've got some project delays with Texas and Florida. So can it be higher if we normalize for government and healthcare and some of these unusual items? Trying to understand what's going on underneath the business in Services on the margin front, if that makes sense.","Bob Zapfel","Well the overall margins are still lower as a result of our margin dynamics in government healthcare. So without question the Services portfolio runs at an overall higher margin than we publish as a result of the investments that we're still making in government healthcare. But I think as we said, we've got that stabilized. We had improvement both sequentially and quarter-to-quarter. But as we're looking to ramp up, you'll remember from the investor conference a reasonable source of our targeted improvement in 2015 this year was coming out of GHS. We talked about that as being 25 to 40 basis points of potential improvement. So that is still our focus and we think we have got strong plans to yield that.","Kathy Mikells","One other comment I would add is, if you went back to the investor conference along the things that we're targeting -- improvement in government healthcare, delivering productivity through our now horizontal operational capabilities, continuing portfolio management, investing in our platforms, there is a yield we expect from that beyond 2015 as well, right? So 50 basis point solid improvement is what we're trying to put up on the board this year with an expectation that that would continue.","Tien-tsin Huang","Just my follow-up then on Texas, Florida. How much visibility do you have on the timing of that? To the extent that those things are pushed out, could that have any revenue and margin impact? What's the cushion there? Thank you.","Ursula Burns","I think you mean New York and Florida, not Texas and Florida, but Bob will answer it.","Bob Zapfel","Yes, we built the 2% to 4% revenue growth commitment that we've made with a plan to get both Florida and New York to come to closure in the first half. We're still very much on track with both of them in terms of meeting the milestones. So I would say that we're on track with both. They are in our range and we don't expect either of them to not be successful in terms of us being a partner with those clients both with Medicaid in New York State and with tolling in Florida.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Barclays Capital. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.","Ben Reitzes","I wanted to ask about puts and takes for the guidance a little more for 2015. In the fourth quarter, it looks like bad debt year-over-year was a $0.025 benefit, and now moving into 2015, I was wondering what bad debt was for the year versus currency. If that goes the other way with what's going on in some of the economies you serve. I was wondering if the guidance actually had offsets for if that goes the other direction. And then I had a quick follow-up. Thanks.","Kathy Mikells","Sure. As we look at our fourth quarter beat in Doc Tech, we recognize that some of the beat is coming out of bed debt; some of the beat was coming out of pension, right? So we ended the year at a higher level overall for the full year than what we would have talked about at our investor conference last November. So we're taking that into account then as we look at what the year-over-year changes are expected to be.","So my commentary around -- as we stare at our margin guidance of 11% to 13%, back at the investor conference I would have been more bullish on the higher end of that range versus now talking about coming down towards the middle, that's taking into account. Ben, both the fact that bad debt will be a year-over-year headwind for us. We expect bad debt overall I will call it, the rate of bad debt to continue to be just fine.","It's improved over the last couple of years and that should continue, but certainly we had a phenomenal 2014 in terms of what the overall bad debt expense is and so we're reflecting that in our margin guidance.","Ben Reitzes","And then just a quick follow-up on Document Technology. Are you seeing price competition from Japan based competitors who can flow through the benefits of the yen? If so, how is that flowing through your margin guidance as well which you just commented on for that segment?","Kathy Mikells","We have been asked this question I feel like every quarter for the last -- since the yen moved from 85. We haven't seen any meaningful change overall in the competitive environment. We always have pricing impacts that range 5% to 10%. Clearly big enterprise deals are always more hotly competed; but overall, we haven't seen a meaningful shift in the market.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.","Ananda Baruah","Just two if I could. The first is just, Bob with regard to any potential operating margin impact when you go ahead and sign both New York and Florida. Can you give us some sense of whether we should expect any standup impact to manifest and what kind of contingencies you might have been able to put in place heading into those? You just seem to have pretty good visibility to standing them up.","And then I guess just the second one is when you guys announced the sale of ITO, I think the commentary was that at that point you expected to be able to make up any impact to 2016 through the combination of buyback and efficiencies on the EPS line. Now that FX is impacting EPS by about $0.05 to $0.06, do you think there is anything you can do as you go through 2016 to make up that incremental $0.05 to $0.06? And those are my two questions. Thanks.","Bob Zapfel","Let me start with the first question, relative to standing up both Florida and New York, we've built that into our guidance when we shared with you and the rest of the community our target to be a 50 basis points improvement in the 9% to 10% range. We've already absorbed some of that hit in the fourth quarter with New York because we wanted to invest in advance.","So do we have to? Do we not run at as high a margin upfront in standing new contracts? Absolutely. But that's part of our design and sourcing model and you should not need to expect any degradation as a result of winning that business. We want to win it, we plan for it and we have the cost in our outlook.","Kathy, I'll turn to you on the Atos and 2016 question.","Kathy Mikells","Yes. At the time that we announced the ITO sale to Atos, we brought our guidance down to reflect the impact of the dilution which we would only be able to slightly offset this year with an expectation that we would offset the remainder in 2016. So that's really about getting the share repurchases deployed and getting the M&A accomplished as well as, I would say offsetting some of the friction costs associated with the transaction, stranded costs that we then need to attack. So we're still absolutely there in terms of offsetting that impact.","The second question you asked was really about currency and our ability to offset the currency impact. Embedded in our guidance for 2015 already is an expectation we're going to offset a little bit of that impact. You heard me in my prepared remarks say it's worth a little over $0.06. We're bringing down our EPS guidance by $0.05. So we're expecting that we're going to drive harder to offset some of that impact and it's built-in already.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.","Keith Bachman","A question and a clarification, the clarification first. Kathy, the $0.06 that you talk about for FX, does that include the benefit of the yen to cost of goods sold for the printing side? And how much is that benefit in 2015 due to the yen?","Kathy Mikells","So it includes everything and so as you can imagine for any global company, everything is a big everything. It includes all the translation impacts, right? So we talked a lot about impacts to revenue and those impacts have some flow-through to profit. The ultimate margin impact of that is a little bit dampened because it's hitting both revenue as well as profit. And it includes all of our purchasing and the hedging that we do associated with purchasing. So it is all-in.","Keith Bachman","My question is -- I'm going to direct it to Bob. If you think about the sale of the ITO business, Bob, if you look back over the last two years and I realize you haven't been there over the two years. But if you think about the BPO side of the business, is there a way that you could quantify how that BPO business was tied to ITO? In other words, when you think about the work of -- how much of the ITO business or the BPO business had ITO tied to it? And what I'm really going back to is the thought process around -- how is the sale of ITO going to impact the ability of Xerox to win BPO business as you look forward to? I understand you can outsource to folks like Cognizant or [inaudible] I should say to Cognizant, but I'm just wondering how it might impact your win-rate by not having in-house ITO capabilities. Thank you.","Bob Zapfel","Yes. No, I appreciate the question. This was a really big strategic thought for us, because obviously we're betting a lot on our ability to drive growth in BPO and Document Outsourcing. When we looked -- I won't just do the two years, I will go at our portfolio. We had ITO in a little over half of our BPO revenue stream but at a very, very modest amount. So most of our big BPO plays had little server management. I'm not on the ITO contracts themselves which were big contracts for us.","And we really have found in the -- I guess we're 30 days plus, 40 days, we have a very good customer reaction. So as we go around with our clients and say our future delivery model includes Atos as a delivery partner as a piece of this delivery ecosystem. I do not view it as something that's going to compromise or put us at a competitive disadvantage. They bring a lot of assets relative to the ITO space and we think that that team is an even better team for our BPO business than going it alone.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Essex","I guess the first question for Kathy. As we think about some of the headwinds in particular to cash flow this year, whether it's FX or pension expenses and we talk about normalized cash flow being over $2 billion cash from operations, how do we think about how some of those pieces may move? Or how do you think about them as we're forecasting for 2016 and beyond?","I guess which ones would you expect to be more prominent in 2015 given where interest rates and FX are? And when might we see a greater inflection or will we see a greater inflection towards normalized cash flow in '16 and beyond? Particularly post the sale of ITO.","Kathy Mikells","I'm going to just start with a discussion about free cash flow, right? We brought our free cash flow guidance down by $100 million. Part of that obviously reflects the sale of the ITO business. We would expect to start to offset that as we do more M&A, basically utilizing the proceeds. So I would call that impact transitory impact, right?","Clearly we've said we think we'll be able to offset some of the currency impacts in 2015, reflected in the guidance that we gave with respect to free cash flow. But the company is an incredibly, I would say solid and consistent cash flow producer and the sale of the ITO business is really just a modest, transitory impact on cash flow. I'm not going to try and call where currencies go in 2016, but obviously we're going to do everything that we can to offset the currency impact as much as possible.","Overall with regard to pension, we're increasing our pension funding this year by about $50 million. I would expect our pension funding starts to stabilize at that point, unless there is an opportunity to do something more materially with our pension which at this point I don't necessarily see. So I think the overall factors around our cash flow are very solid. We've reduced it at the moment for some transitory issues, but I wouldn't expect those to last forever.","Brian Essex","Okay. And can we get a sense of the capital intensity that ITO accounted for? And where might that have been offset by redeploying those funds into other areas?","Kathy Mikells","Yes. Our ITO business was in the Services side clearly our most capital-intensive business, lower ROIC business for us which strategically is much of behind the sale. Not to mention we were a subscale player in ITO relative to some of our competitors. So from that perspective, its impact on free cash flow is much less and its impact on operating cash flow which is part of the reason we only brought it down modestly. We would expect we're going to deploy it into BPO which is not nearly as capital intensive.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.","Bill Shope","There are obviously a few moving parts in the technology business this year, so I wanted to understand the timing of some of the puts and takes you've talked about. So could you give us a bit more color on how we should think about the revenue trajectory margin path and some of these product cycle dynamics as we progress through the year? And I guess particularly how we think about the dynamics as we move from first half to second half.","Kathy Mikells","Sure. As we progress through the year, just in terms of the revenue dynamics going on in Doc Tech, we'll get a bit of a benefit as a result of just from a year-over-year comp perspective. You know not doing the forward receivable sales anymore. So that had in the third and the fourth quarter about point of negative impact in 2014. So we will get an easier comp towards the back half of the year.","From a foreign currency perspective on Doc Tech with regard to top line, translation impacts to top line have been immediately. The flip side of that is what's going on in transaction impacts. The transaction impacts don't hit us immediately as a result of our hedging program. So that's a little bit more back half it gets worse relative to front half as a result, that's obviously a profit and a margin constraint as opposed to a revenue constraint. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of color.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of James Friedman with Susquehanna. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.","James Friedman","I just had a housekeeping question; I'll ask all mine upfront. So Kathy, I just want to make sure that -- am I correct that the New York Medicaid is not in the signings number at this point? My next question for Bob was if you could comment about the pricing environment. And also, Bob, are there any problem contracts [inaudible] Nevada or Texas that you would call out at this point? Or if that's too specific if you could talk about the risk management at the firm overall? Thank you.","Bob Zapfel","I can probably answer all of those. So yes, Jamie, you're right, New York is not in those signings numbers neither New York nor Florida and while our overall signings were strong and the numbers were very positive, we do need to get new business ramped up and that's a big piece of that. Relative to the problem contract question, I would say we've made real progress in terms of the new systems implementations. We've got a strong team that we've added in 2014 that's really been driving that. So you can never say never in terms of issue in a given implementation. But overall we've made very good progress there and we're optimistic that we won't have big financial hits as a result of future problem contracts.","Operator","Our last question will come from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Jim Suva","The signings number was very impressive for the quarter. A lot of times there is seasonality to them and maybe some deferrals that come in and things like that and so if you look at one quarter, your snapshot is very, very impressive. If you look at a trailing 12 month quarter run rate, you still have down 13%ish for a trailing 12 quarters. So can you help us bridge the gap of that trailing 12 months versus a very strong quarter and the outlook for surfaces and your confidence to grow that Services? Thank you.","Bob Zapfel","Jim, no, I would agree. We were happy with the quarter and the year-to-year growth that we had in the quarter, but still as you represented, we're down double digits on a trailing 12-month basis. And again the big piece that would have changed that is if we would have had a little bit earlier timing in either New York or Florida, but those are in front of us as opposed to already booked and in our signings numbers.","But the renewals have been really strong. We have seven out of the last eight quarters in BPO that we've been over 90%, so we're very positive on the renewal rates and it's really a new business, getting more traction in our new business initiatives and we believe we will do that in 2015. That is a critical, critical element for us, maybe more on our 2016 revenue than on 2015, but it's a critical element for us and we're very focused on it.","Jim Suva","And then as a quick follow-up, you have a couple big contracts and on the call you made some references to New York and Florida that are not in the signings and I understand that correctly. But once they come into signings is there also a little bit of a timing item we should be aware of as far as when they get included into your revenues? I.e., like immediately when they sign, then the next day you can start to recognize revenues? Or is there a, hey, you signed it and then you have to sit down and talk about phases and timing and sometimes a quarter or two? Because each of those look to be quite substantial and I don't want to get too excited or maybe I should that they immediately start to enter the revenue stream.","Bob Zapfel","Yes, we generally begin to recognize revenue pretty quickly, but there is a ramp. So it's that you're not at full annualized revenue in the first quarter after the signing, but I would expect in both and the way we've built our track is we expect in both New York and Florida to sign in the first half, to then start a revenue flow, not at high margins, but that's all built into our guidance. But it does take a little bit of time, typically about two quarters before you get to the annualized run-rate.","Jim Lesko","Thank you. That's all the time we have for questions today. Thank you for your interest And Ursula, anything more to wrap up?","Ursula Burns","Yes. In summary, we have a clear and consistent plan in place and in 2014 we were successful in advancing our strategic initiatives. We have a focused management team, you've heard from them today, prepared to deliver the plan and in 2015 we're committed to enhancing our overall Services business while maintaining our market leadership in Document Technology. Additionally, we will continue to make investments to move the business forward.","Jim Lesko","Thanks, Ursula. That concludes our call today. And if you have any further questions, please contact me or any member of the Investor Relations team. Thank you. Have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect.

He is joined by Bill Osbourn, Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com\/investor. At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and\/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without the expressed permission of Xerox. After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.","During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements which, by their nature, address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein.","At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Jacobson. Mr. Jacobson, you may begin","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","Good morning, and welcome to Xerox's third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. During today's call, we will provide an update on the quarter as well as our expectations for full year 2017. Overall, we delivered a solid quarter. Revenue decline improved sequentially and earnings expanded year-over-year, with margins and cash flow both in line with our expectations. We still have work to do, but we're making headway on our strategy. We're gaining traction in our rollout of our ConnectKey products, as September was our strongest month in the quarter. We also saw improvement in our Managed Document Services results. Both of these factors will help us pivot more over time to our strategic growth areas.","Let me walk you through an overview of our third quarter financial results. Third quarter GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.67 and adjusted EPS was $0.89, up 6% from the same quarter a year ago. Adjusted EPS excludes $0.22 per share of after-tax costs related to the amortization of intangibles, restructuring and related cost as well as certain retirement related cost.","Revenue of $2.5 billion was down 5% year over year or 5.9% on a constant currency basis. We are starting to see new equipment flowing through as we gain momentum into the fourth quarter and 2018. Post sale revenue was 79% of total revenue and declined 3.9% or 4.8% in constant currency. We expect stable post sale revenue coming over time as equipment revenue improves and placements grow.","Adjusted operating margin was 12.2%, down 40 basis points year-over-year and in line with our expectations. Strategic Transformation benefits largely offset transaction currency and lower equity income, putting us on track to achieve our full year margin objective of 12.5% to 13.5%. Operating cash flow from continuing operations included $671 million in pension contributions. Bill will go into more detail on cash flow.","Overall, we have made great progress this year optimizing our balance sheet, which will support both a strong cash flow in the future as well as our investment-grade credit profile. It's also important to note that excluding pension contributions, operating cash flow increased $44 million year-over-year, so good operating performance. And finally, we ended the quarter with a healthy cash balance of $1.8 billion, which includes the $475 million used in October for the early redemption of the 2018 senior notes. So overall, solid results that position us for continued improvement in Q4 and into 2018.","Throughout the quarter, customer and partner feedback continued to be overwhelmingly positive, whether it's about our wide array of Managed Document Services, our industry-leading Graphic Communications Solutions or our new line of smart, secure ConnectKey enabled workplace assistants. This positive feedback translated into increasing ConnectKey orders in September from single A4 devices going into an SMB to large MPS contracts at the world's biggest enterprises. All 29 of our new ConnectKey office products are now available and shipping to customers around the globe, and with sales momentum building as we expected, entering the last quarter of the year.","Here are just a few quick examples. A world leader in the pharmaceutical industry renewed and expanded a multiyear Managed Document Services contract across 76 countries, adding more than 2,200 of our new A3 and A4 ConnectKey printers. A channel partner in Italy secured an MPS contract with a leading chemical company, replacing 400 competitive printers with 300 of our new AltaLink and VersaLink devices. And in Switzerland, a leading professional services firm signed an MPS deal that includes 130 AltaLink and VersaLink devices.","Applications are a clear competitive differentiator for our new ConnectKey workplace assistants, and we reached a meaningful apps milestone during the quarter. There are more than 0.5 million ConnectKey apps now installed on Xerox devices globally, marking a 66% increase since the product launches at the end of March. That is 200,000 additional apps have been installed on our new AltaLink and VersaLink MSPs since their introductions. This is significant, as the large majority of these apps ship with our new devices. So, it's another key indicator of that brisk customer adoption rate.","Finally, ConnectKey is the only print solution containing the power of industry-leading McAfee security protection; McAfee whitelisting technology, which constantly monitors and automatically protects against malware attacks, comes embedded in all Xerox AltaLink products. We've chosen to partner with best-of-breed companies like McAfee instead of building our own capabilities. As almost all of our customers already use McAfee, they feel more comfortable that McAfee solutions are embedded in our platform.","We're also squarely focused on the growth opportunities in the attractive high-end digital color part of the market, where Xerox has been a leader for more than a decade now. At the largest U.S. graphic communications tradeshow, PRINT 17 in Chicago in September, our industry-leading innovation was behind multiple product introductions, including MUST SEE 'EMS award winners, the Trivor 2400 High Fusion Inkjet Press and the iGen 5 Press with White Dry Ink. And sales were brisk with deals for the iGen, the Brenva HD Production, Rialto 900 Inkjet Presses as well as the new Versant 180 and 3100 Presses.","Our third MUST SEE 'EMS award winner at the show was the Xerox Specialty Imaging, a fraud-deterrent technology that helps protect sensitive printed data. In September, we also announced a reseller agreement for Xerox to market and sell the Fujifilm J Press 720S, a sheetfed inkjet press in the U.S. and Canada. This further expands our inkjet portfolio with the addition of a wider format press.","I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Bill Osbourn, to cover our financial results in more detail. Bill?","William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I will start on slide 6 with an overview of our financial performance, which I would characterize as showing progress and in line with our operating expectations, with the benefit of the timing of lower tax rate and the gain from Grenoble sale, more than offsetting lower equity income and placing us above our targets for net income and adjusted EPS.","As Jeff reviewed, the revenue rate of decline modestly improved versus Q2, driven by both equipment sales and Managed Document Services. And we're beginning to see some positive revenue dynamics in currency, which had been a headwind for some time.","Turning to profitability, adjusted operating margin of 12.2% was down 40 basis points as overall cost productivities only partially offset negative transaction currency, lower equity income and the impact of lower revenue. Within the adjusted operating margin, gross margin expanded, driven by post sales and the benefits of our Strategic Transformation program, which more than offset a decline in equipment gross margin, driven by transaction currency impacts that are lessening, but remain negative.","R&D as a percentage of revenue was 10 basis points better, while SG&A as a percent of revenue was up 60 basis points year-over-year as a result of higher revenue declines and some headwinds, including higher compensation and benefits, only being partially offset by Strategic Transformation. Lastly, as stated previously, within our definition of operating income is equity income, almost entirely related to Fuji Xerox, which was down year over year.","Turning to the below the line items, other expenses net of $17 million was $33 million better year-over-year, driven by lower interest expense of $13 million, not quite as large of a year-over-year benefit as last quarter, given the September note issuance, and a gain of $13 million from the sale of our Grenoble Research Centre that we announced at the end of June and which hit in the quarter.","Adjusted tax rate of 19.4% was below our full year range of 25% to 28% and was lower by 3.6 percentage points year-over-year, driven by the favorable resolution in the quarter of a couple of tax matters, an approximate positive $0.03 impact year-over-year to adjusted EPS. Overall, adjusted EPS of $0.89 was up $0.05 from Q3 2016, as the lower tax rate and the benefits from our strategic actions more than offset the impact of lower revenues and equity income. GAAP EPS was $0.67 in the quarter. The difference between our GAAP and adjusted EPS includes our normal adjustments around restructuring related costs, non-service retirement-related costs and amortization of intangible assets.","Turning to the next slide, I will drill down more on revenue. I'll begin with a few high-level comments. Equipment revenue declines in Q3 improved sequentially, as expected, with the strongest year-over-year performance in the quarter coming in September. The best performance in the quarter came in the developing markets and the U.S. in SMB-focused channels, including Global Imaging Systems, while higher declines continued in the longer decision cycle areas of large enterprise and public sector.","Post sale revenue declined 3.9% or 4.8% in constant currency in the quarter. We saw improvement in supplies revenue declines and Managed Document Services revenue. This, however, was more than offset by lower other sales, including sales of third-party IT equipment and lower page volumes in some areas of the business. As previously noted, there is a lag between the installs of new products and the flow through to future post sale revenue improvement.","And now I'll take you through some more details. From a geographic sales channel perspective, North America was down 5.2% or 5.7% in constant currency and represented 61% of our revenues. International represented 34% of total revenue and was down 3.1% or 5.1% in constant currency, reflecting higher declines in Europe that were partially offset by growth in developing markets. The remaining 5% of our revenues is in other, with the largest piece, over 50% being in our OEM business.","Within equipment, mid range saw the greatest improvement sequentially, reflecting the full availability of new products. Entry and high-end, however, remained weak. Entry equipment revenue continued to be impacted by the lower mix of products and the transition to the new portfolio, as not all of the higher-value products were available for the full quarter. Additionally, we saw continued growth in developing markets; however, it decelerated as we lapped easier compares.","Within high-end, we saw good performance in entry-production color from the new Versant products; however, that was more than offset by declines in other high-end product segments, driven in part by higher Q3 2016 sales, following the every four-year drupa tradeshow.","Lastly, to round out the revenue discussion, we were pleased that Managed Document Services revenue turned back to growth, up 2.2% in actual currency or 1.2% in constant currency and comprised 34% of our total revenues. Within MDS, the SMB focused channels, XPPS and GIS which comprised almost 25% of our MDS revenues, grew double digits, while the more mature large enterprise segment, where we are the market leader, had modest declines.","I'll now shift to discuss our key performance metrics, a few of which I have already touched on. Revenues from strategic growth areas to-date are flat in constant currency, an improvement from the down 1% for the first half and comprised 40% of our total revenues year-to-date, a two-point mix shift from the year-ago period. The improved performance was driven by the better MDS growth I just commented on, and we expect that trend to continue as the new product impact takes greater effect. We continue to target to shift our revenue mix to these strategic areas by approximately three points every year.","Turning to installs, we saw improvement across most product areas in Q3. Installs grew in entry, although once again at a weaker mix, given the better performance in developing markets where units tend to weigh towards the lower end of the portfolio. Also driving lower mix was the fact that the higher end new ConnectKey A4 products were only fully available at the end of the quarter.","Mid-range installs were flat in color and declined in mono. We saw sequential pick-up in a number of areas and we expect this trend to continue into Q4. At the high end, installs were down in mono, where the market continues to decline. And within color, results were mixed. We saw growth in entry production color and aqueous production inkjet, which was offset by declines in other areas driven in part by the drupa compare I mentioned earlier.","MDS signings which, as a reminder, reflect only our enterprise business and don't include SMB, were $606 million in the quarter and were down 6.7% year-over-year and down 10.7% on a trailing 12-month basis, both at a constant currency. Renewal rate was 85% and overall in line with expectations. The year-over-year decline in signings was consistent with Q2. And looking forward, the 90-day pipeline shows good expansion year-over-year and we expect Q4 signings to improve from trend. Work remains to get back to consistent growth, but underlying trends are turning in MDS, supported by the new products and investments.","The last key measurement area is Strategic Transformation. We continue to be very pleased with our results to-date, and we are on track to deliver at or above our target of $600 million of gross savings in 2017. This is an important program and one that underpins our strategy to expand margins and support investments to improve the revenue trajectory. We have a disciplined program, which as I expanded on last quarter, includes initiatives that span the enterprise. It's hard work and a never-ending journey, enabled by business and process improvement and simplification, evolving technology and optimization with partners.","I'm often asked what will be the target for 2018 and whether there is an upside to the initial $400 million we laid out at our Analyst Day last year. Our sights are clearly set on continuing to drive productivity improvements, and we are currently building out the plan for 2018, which we'll be in a position to give an update on during Q4 earnings in January once we can finalize the baseline for what we accomplished in 2017.","Before moving on to cash flow, I'll cover the trends and what we expect for the full year and fourth quarter. Total revenue decline of 5.9% in constant currency in Q3 improved from Q2, as we anticipated. On an actual currency basis, the improvement is greater as we saw for the first time in 13 quarters, currency turn to a benefit on revenue, a positive dynamic we expect will continue at least in the near-term. On a constant currency basis, we continue to expect full year revenue declines in the mid-single digits, with Q4 expected to represent the best revenue performance of the year.","Operating margin was seasonally lower than Q2, but remained in line with our objectives and reflected a continued negative impact from transaction currency, 60 basis points in Q3, which we expect will moderate further in Q4. For the year, we remain on track to be within full year range on an adjusted operating margin of 12.5% to 13.5%, with peak margins in Q4. On tax rate, we are maintaining our full year adjusted tax rate guidance range of 25% to 28%, and we anticipate the Q4 tax rate to be at the higher end of the range.","Lastly, and looking at adjusted EPS with a quarter left in the year, we are narrowing to the high range of our full year adjusted EPS range by $0.08, resulting in a revised range of $3.28 to $3.44, which implies an $0.84 to $1.00 range for Q4. This guidance reflects continued progress on our strategy and includes the necessary investments to position us well for the future. We benefited from the timing of the lower tax rate and Grenoble sales that both came in Q3 and we'll be taking a portion of that benefit to fund further investments in quarter four. These include our expectation of a greater mix of entry products that carry negative margin upon sale but attractive post sale margins down the line, as well as higher investments in both sales and infrastructure to support our 2018 objectives.","I'll now shift to discuss cash flow. Operating cash flow was the use of $383 million in the quarter. The use of cash reflected significant pension contributions of $671 million in the quarter, which included the incremental voluntary $500 million we announced in September. The large pension contributions reflect our continued focus this year on optimizing our capital structure and on the pension side, narrowing the unfunded gap, which will be a benefit to future operating cash flows and will reduce future pension contribution variability.","If you pull out pension from cash flow for both years, operating cash flow would be up $44 million in the quarter. The drivers of this underlying cash flow performance included: relatively flat year-over-year pre-tax profit; working capital, which was a modest higher use of cash year-over-year, reflecting the new product buildup and also a modest inventory increase due to the hurricanes; and financing assets being a greater source of cash as a result of lower equipment sales in recent quarters as well as lower financing penetration.","Investing cash flows were a use of $4 million, with CapEx spend of $23 million largely offset by proceeds from the Grenoble sale of approximately $20 million. Cash from financing was $908 million and included proceeds from the $1 billion September senior note issuance, of which $500 million went toward the previously mentioned incremental pension contribution, and $475 million was used in October for an early redemption of a portion of our 2018 senior note. Financing cash flows also included $68 million in dividends, common and preferred.","Before I go to the capital structure slide, I would like to spend a few minutes on updates we're making to our operating cash flow guidance. There are several moving pieces to cash flow that I would like to walk through in terms of their impact to our guidance.","To begin, underlying operating cash flow is running above expectations, as just discussed, giving us confidence to raise cash flow guidance by $100 million. More than offsetting this increase is a reduction from the incremental $500 million contribution to domestic pension plans that was funded with debt, as we announced in September. Lastly, we are announcing that we will be eliminating the majority of our accounts receivable sales or factoring programs which will have an approximate negative $350 million impact to cash flow in Q4.","As background, we have had in place since 2009 accounts receivable sales programs where we sell short-term trade receivables, generally with payment due dates of less than 60 days. This has had a nominal impact on cash flows in recent years, as the largest benefit comes on the program startup. We no longer have a need for this working capital tool. And as a part of our Strategic Transformation program to simplify the business and reduce costs, we are eliminating the majority of these programs. This will give us annual savings of approximately $10 million that does result in the one-time timing impact to cash flow that I just discussed.","2017 has been a year of optimizing our balance sheet, and I view this as another positive step in improving our capital management that will benefit the business going forward. The net impact of these three changes is that we now expect cash flow from operations to be in the range of negative $50 million to positive $150 million for the full year 2017. This update to operating cash flow has essentially no impact on our available cash for capital allocation, as we always had an unallocated element of opportunistic spend in our guidance.","We are also modestly adjusting our 2017 capital allocation to reduce expectations for CapEx by $50 million, as we are running under our full year target, with the shifting of some IT projects to be more pay-as-you-go operating expenses versus CapEx. At the same time, we are increasing our M&A target by $50 million, raising it to approximately $150 million. We have spent $76 million year-to-date and are targeting to close a couple more tuck-in deals before year-end.","Factoring in all these movements, we continue to anticipate ending the year with a cash balance of over $1 billion. I feel good about the progress we have made this year in strengthening our capital structure and we plan to provide during our Q4 earnings call in January our capital allocation plans for 2018.","Before I turn it back to Jeff, I will quickly touch on our capital structure. We ended Q3 with $6 billion of debt. Within that, financing debt remained largely consistent at $3.6 billion quarter-over-quarter; however core debt increased by $1 billion to $2.4 billion, reflecting the $500 million debt we took on to fund the pension and $475 million we used in October for the early redemption of a portion of the 2018 notes, replacing debt with a coupon of 6.35% with 3.625% coupon debt. The replacement of pension liability with core debt is largely leverage neutral. So overall for the year, we have improved leverage driven by the $300 million debt reduction we did earlier this year. And we will continue to manage our debt balance leverage position to maintain our investment-grade profile.","So to summarize, we continue to make progress on our objectives and are on track to deliver on our full-year expectations. With that, I will hand it back to Jeff.","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","Thank you, Bill. Let me wrap up the presentation with a few closing remarks. Our third quarter results reflect continued progress on key performance measures and put us on track to meet our full year objectives. Revenue trends are beginning to improve; however, we are still in the early phase in our strategy to turn the revenue trajectory. Our Strategic Transformation program is a critical enabler to supporting both revenue improvement and margin expansion, and I'm pleased with the strides we have made with opportunities still in front of us.","And finally, I cannot overemphasize the importance of the work we have done on the capital structure front and the key actions we have taken, including paying down debt, putting more toward the pension and ending accounts receivable sales programs, which will make us an even more financially secure and strong company for the future.","We'll now open up the line for questions. Jennifer?","Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.","Thanks, Jeff. Before we get to your questions for Jeff and Bill, I will again point out that we have a number of supplemental slides at the end of our deck which provide more financial detail to support today's presentation and complement our prepared remarks. During Q&A, I would ask participants to limit follow-on and multi-part questions so we can get to everyone. At the end of our Q&A session, I'll turn it back to Jeff for a few closing comments.","Operator, please open the line for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Your line is now open.","Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC","Thank you very much. I have two questions. The first one is, given all of the movements on cash flow, can you give us an idea of sort of how you're thinking about 2018? I know you're not going to give specifics. But if we think about what the one-timers were this year versus what we will see next year, the fact that you sort of raised your operational cash flow guidance and reduced your CapEx for this year, just how should we think about the trajectory of cash flow for next year? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.","William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.","Hey, Shannon. It's Bill Osborne. Good morning. Hey, good question. So a few things. You're right, we're not going to give detailed guidance on 2018, but a few things to think about in light of what we've done this year. First of all, the factoring, just as I said in the prepared comments, are the ceasing of the sales of short-term receivables is a one-time timing issue. It is historically a pull-forward of short-term \u2013 cash related short-term receivables of 30 to 60 days. When you start up a program, it has a favorable impact back in 2009. This hasn't had much of an impact in recent years, plus or minus. But now that we're ceasing a majority of it, it will have that $350 million approximate negative impact this year. It will have no impact to run rate cash flow for next year.","As far as other things to think about when you're looking towards next year. If you recall, we originally had talked about pension contributions over a two-year period being at the $800 million range; $350 million this year, $450 million next year. The incremental pension contribution we made this year with the debt that we issued in September brings down those future contribution levels to more normalized levels. Not to give an exact amount, but historically in the $200 million range, whereas I think before most people were modeling $450 million, $500 million for next year. But the thought is for it to be a more constant, stable number in the future in the $200 million range.","As far as CapEx, our CapEx is primarily related to IT-type spend, and we've been seeing more and more as we go to cloud-based solutions that it's ending up being more OpEx-related IT than CapEx historically. I would still think we'd be in the CapEx range, $100 million, $150 million. M&A type deals we target, tuck-in type deals, especially in the GIS arena. And we've said that could be anywhere, $100 million, $200 million in a given year depending on the number of deals you're doing there. So those are sort of big picture type items with respect to cash to think about future years. But we'll be more explicit obviously in the January earnings call.","Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC","Okay, great. And then can you talk about \u2013 I don't know, maybe Jeff, talk a bit about what's going on in terms of operating margin. It was a bit light this quarter. You mentioned on the SG&A side some pressure from higher compensation and things like that. How do we think about SG&A? And how do we think about the cost benefit rolling through so that you can be back in that range that you guided to for full year? Thank you.","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","Yeah, so if you look at it, Shannon, as you know, we were 12.2% for the quarter and we're 12.3% for year-to-date. So our full-year guidance is 12.5% to 13.5%,so really within the expectations that we thought we would be. If we think about it, we had 60 basis points of currency headwinds. We had a little lower equity income on a year-over-year basis. The productivity came in where we certainly thought it would be and it offset our normal revenue declines. So we're really well on track for where we expect to be for our 12.5% to 13.5% guidance.","William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.","Yeah, I'd agree with everything Jeff says. Just to remind you, Q4 is seasonally the highest quarter of the year from an adjusted operating margin perspective. And based upon quarter-end September 30 rates, we do expect a moderating impact of transaction currency in the fourth quarter versus what we saw in Q3.","Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.","Great. Thanks, Shannon. Operator, next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital. Your line is now open.","Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. Can you hear me okay?","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","Yeah. Hi, Ananda. We can hear you fine. Thank you.","Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Okay, great. Yeah, two for me as well, if I could. I guess the first is just going back to the new equipment shift kind of across the portfolio that actually, I guess, drove volume up Q-over-Q. You mentioned a number of things. Could you guys call out or point out, I should say, which were specifically most impactful and which you believe to be specifically most impactful going forward? That would be really helpful. Thanks a lot. (30: 55).","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","Yeah, sure, Ananda. So, yeah, let me try and cover it in a broad sense and give you the details so that everybody can have an overview of where we are. And again, I'd say, we're right on pace with where we thought.","So if I were to look at the second half of last year from an equipment revenue standpoint as well as the first three quarters of this year, we've been down at 10% constant currency consistently awaiting for the portfolio to come out. So, as you know or I believe you know, the lower end of the A4 products or our entry products came out in the first quarter of this year. And what you're seeing is you're seeing the benefits of that in the installs. So our color installs were up 23%; black-and-white installs were up 26%. But that really benefited the most our developing markets where we're really mixing down into the lower end of entry. So our developing markets actually had growth.","If you then think about the May-June timeframe or later in the second quarter is when we brought out all 17 of our A3 products. So we started to see some benefit from that and improvement to a decline of 8.5% in our mid-range products. And the benefits came, Ananda, I would say really in the shorter sales cycles. We'll start seeing more and more of that in the longer sales cycles, especially in the larger enterprise public sector, et cetera. But I would say even there as we indicated last quarter, our 180-day new business pipeline was up significantly and that's now migrated to continue to be up in our 90-day new business pipeline, which we said all along would benefit us in Q4.","So we certainly expect overall to see our strongest equipment sale revenue in the Q4 as well as our strongest and significant improvement in signings in Q4. And we take some confidence in that based upon what we've seen in September and what we see in our direct backlog.","With regard to the higher-end A4 products or the higher value, if I can call it that, A4 products, those came out more in Q3 with the final coming out in September. So we'll start seeing the benefit of that as well. So we've known all along that Q4 is where we need to start showing the significant improvement. We have confidence in that based upon what we we're seeing in the backlog, based upon what we're seeing in the pipeline, and based upon what we saw in September where we improved the decline in our equipment by more than half of what our normal run rate has been.","Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC","And that's really helpful. And just a clarification on that. Where in that \u2013 just for our benefit \u2013 does the mid-production, light-production units like the Versant, which I think you guys were enthusiastic about, the Brenva, like that, where do they fall in that?","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","Yeah, so that would be in the high-end. So you saw the installs down 2% and you saw the high-end revenues down about 12%. The Versant did very well. So actually Versant did extremely well and the inkjet did extremely well. We had a tough year-over-year compare if you look at things like color press and iGen, because remember we were comparing against drupa last year which is the every-four-year trade show. So we expect to see improvement there in Q4.","Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Thank you. And then just a quick second one is. Can you just give us some sense of where the cost savings \u2013 how you've chosen to use the cost savings year-to-date? That's it for me. Thanks.","William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.","Yeah. So from a cost savings perspective, really I group it into three buckets when I think about it. First of all, just to follow-on what Jeff was saying about the new A4s at the higher end coming available in Q3, fully available. As everyone knows, there's a razor blade model on the A4.So we've had the lower end ones available since pretty much the beginning of the year. The higher-end A4s came out in Q3.We expect to be selling those in greater quantities. And to the extent we do that, there are upfront losses upon sale. Typically that are made up \u2013 more than made up and profitable over the life of the equipment. So that's one area of investment that we expect to continue pushing an increase even into Q4.","Second area, deals with IT infrastructure investments. And some specific examples, I said the spend is tending to be more OpEx than CapEx. And just due to the nature of the type of IT solutions we're doing. But first of all your channel partner business is an area of focus. It's a strategic growth area, and we're building up our back-office business platforms to support that business. Also our service delivery, we're looking \u2013 we're building up a next-generation service delivery platform. And then there's just other general IT infrastructure, whether it's with respect to supply chain, data analytics, et cetera. All those types of items support the business today and going forward we believe in the future.","And then finally the third bucket that I view as far as just the type of investments really goes to the direct selling, are the selling costs, both from a direct sales force perspective. We've been increasing the number of direct sales people during the year, and plan to continue on doing that, and also the support of our channel partners and recruiting those channel partners are also \u2013 there's a cost to that that we believe will benefit the future.","Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.","Great. Thanks, Ananda. Operator, next question?","Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC","Great, thanks.","Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Coster of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. Two please with a sort of longer-term perspective to them. The first one is on the MDS \u2013 in the MDS segment, I think you said about 25% revenue now is coming from the midmarket. What can that share be over the course of time? And how do you get there?","And then on R&D. Your R&D is still one of the biggest in the industry focused on printers. It feels like you've kind of been through a big product cycle. What's next? Are you going to start doing what some of your competitors are doing and move into adjacencies? Or is it just more of what we've seen to date? Some kind of breakdown of the R&D would be useful. Thank you.","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","Yeah. Sure. Paul. Let me try and address that for you. So, first, from an MDS standpoint, we were very pleased that we improved from the decline of 3.9% last quarter to the growth of 1.2% this quarter. As we indicated last time, there was an aberration in the equipment sales where we were down 24% in MDS. That improved significantly with still more room to improvement. The post sale and MDS did grow, so we were pleased to see that, and our channel Managed Document Services was up about 12%. So good double-digit growth, stronger than the market there, actually twice as strong as the market there.","As Bill indicated, the actions were taken there between the new products, our new multi-brand resellers, and the SMB expansion, in addition to the new logo hunters, and we brought in about 30 in North America. And we're not just adding feet-on-the-street in our own direct world, but our resellers are also adding feet-on-the-street, and we're helping support them in doing that. So we're making good progress there, and the SMB part of the Management Document Services is obviously a big part of our strategic growth areas.","With regard to research and development, we're trending at about 4% of our revenue in research and development. That's been pretty stable. We've put a lot of time \u2013 we look at research and development in terms of capital, and everything needs a good return on investment. So to your point about where we will be pivoting, I don't think there's any question. One of the things that we're very excited about now that we're 10 months into the separation is having Palo Alto Research Center back 100% dedicated to us.","For six years or seven years prior to that it was predominantly dedicated to our business process outsourcing firm, which was spun off. And now that's 100% back to us. So yes, we will be pivoting into things with more in inkjet, more in printed electronics, more in the Internet of Things, certainly more in the packaging. Now those investments will take a little longer time, obviously, because commercialization cycles are longer. But when we look at our business, our strategy all along was to say what we call Phase 1, be very strong on strategic transformation, make this business as productive as it can be, as cost-efficient as it can be, take some of that to the bottom line, take some of it to invest in the future.","Phase 2 is exactly where we're at now. All these 29 new products coming out, and now let's begin to show the change in that revenue trajectory. Phase 3, we'll be pivoting to some of those things that I think you were just referring to, what can be the second and third leg in the Xerox stool going forward.","Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.","Great. Thanks, Paul. Operator, next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. Good morning.","Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.","Good morning.","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","Good morning.","Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","First, just a quick clarification. The strength that you saw in September, was that just the ConnectKey products? Or was that across the equipment portfolio? And then can you comment on whether that order strength continued into October? And then I have a follow-up.","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","Yeah, so. Yeah, we'll stay on Q3 I think is best, Katy. So it was in our 29 new products. And it was in also what I'll call the high end of inkjet and it was Versant. So we certainly saw it there with the new products that we brought out, both in the high end as well as in the 29 new products.","As I said, the reason we have confidence is because of what we've seen with September. We actually had signings growth in North America. So we're starting to see some of the benefits of that. We're starting to see our pipeline build with our new logo hunters. And the products are just being very well received by our channel partners as well, especially with the app.","So everything in terms of the detailed reviews Bill and I do with the team gives us the confidence that Q4 will show significant improvement in our equipment sales revenue line as well as in our total revenue line.","Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just as a follow up, how are you thinking about the weaker dollar? Is there an updated view as to the currency impact to EPS in 2017? And then does that become a tailwind? Does currency become a tailwind in 2018? And would you expect to flow that through to the bottom line? Or do you take that upside and potentially reinvest it? Thanks.","William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.","Yes, Katy, it's Bill. A couple things. I'll talk a little bit about Q4. Don't want to go too much into 2018 guidance yet. But as far as you look at quarter-end rates, we do expect moderation of the transaction currency impacting Q4 based upon quarter-end rates. And also from a revenues perspective, translation perspective, Q3 was the first quarter in 13 quarters that we actually had a favorable impact from currency, about 1 percentage point. And we're expecting that to improve into Q4 based upon quarter-end rates.","So, yes, we are expecting a moderating impact or improvement with respect to currency. We look at -one of the things we factor into all the things, pluses and minuses, is that how much we invest into the company and how much we let go \u2013 drop to the bottom line. So can't really give you a specific answer on that component, but certainly it's one of the factors that we look at as far as incremental investment versus allowing it to drop to the bottom line. And 2018, we'll see where rates are at the end of the year, and we'll clearly have a view and comment on that in the January earnings call.","Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.","Great. Thank you, Katy.","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","Thank you, Katy.","Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.","Operator, next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Steve Milunovich of UBS. Your line is now open.","Steven Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you. First of all, I want to talk about the M&A and the channel. Can you talk a bit about what you've seen in the dealer space in terms of valuations? Are you seeing competition from other dealers or private equity? And is consolidation in the dealer channel likely to affect industry dynamics in terms of either pricing pressure or the nature of contracts?","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","Yeah. So, Steve, how are you? This is Jeff. Yeah, so we've seen some consolidation or some resellers being acquired in Europe. And as you're probably aware, that certainly has been one of our strategies in the North American market with our Global Imaging channel. So we've done a few this year. It's part of our strategy as we go forward and as we look at M&A and our overall capital allocation strategy. As we go forward, it will probably continue as part of it.","We also believe very much in some of the M&A. If we do \u2013 when we do it, we certainly want it to benefit the total business, and that could be an igniter from a technology standpoint as just being a channel acquisition.","So \u2013 but channel acquisition is definitely part of our strategy. It's been very successful with Global Imaging. And what we are seeing is certainly the multi-brand resellers that we have that are \u2013 we're now bringing on and we've brought on about 45 so far, equally split between North America and international. They've been very excited about our new products because they're really looking at these as workplace assistants, coherency between our A3 and A4, mobility, benchmark security, cloud enablement. And then they're really leveraging the apps, which is what they like as well.","Steven Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. And then I just wanted to check in on the large enterprise space. It's fairly saturated with declining pages. Is there much risk that those customers shift over time to lower-cost A4?","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","Well, the industry to a large extent is moving to A4. But what we find there, that would actually benefit us to some extent because the vast majority of our business in the enterprise is now Managed Document Services. And when we didn't have as competitive an A4 as we do now, it caused us to put in more A3 when we were architecting the solution and therefore that would hurt our margins to some extent. So some of these deals that you are now seeing us win is very significant for us because we're able to put in more A4 devices, which is actually a benefit. Where you're starting to see some of the industry go down, it's more in the desktop printers, and we tend not to play there as much which is also a benefit for us and perhaps not as much to others.","Steven Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.","Great. Thanks, Steve.","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","Thank you.","Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.","Operator, next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Cabral of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yeah, thank you. I wanted to circle back to the earlier discussion on the operating margins. I guess, looking at the implied Q4 guidance, if I assume an improving revenue performance to get to down mid single-digits, it still implies margins are flat to down year-over-year even to get to the high-end of the range. So I guess with that in mind, why wouldn't you start to see some better leverage given the revenue declines are improving and front-loaded restructuring that you had to start off the year?","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","Yeah. I don't think I want to get that specific within the range of 12.5% to 13.5%, Matt. But we've done our modeling and our expectations for Q4 and based upon \u2013 as everyone knows, Q4 is seasonally our best quarter of the year for revenue perspective, from an ESR perspective in particular and from total revenues and based upon what we expect to happen from a transaction currency perspective that we're very comfortable with the 12.5% to 13.5% operating margin range.","Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And then Bill, as a quick follow-up, in the past you've talked about just potential that you see within working capital. Could you just give us an update on where you stand with some of those initiatives and if possible maybe quantify the size of the opportunity that you see over time?","William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.","Yeah. So working capital, it is an area of great emphasis for the management and for the company. Inventory, receivables, aside from the ceasing of the AR receivables program, still managing receivables on an ongoing basis. Inventory, we're going through a period of time where we're transitioning product lines from the old to the new. It has some impact but we expect to work through that by the end of the year. So there's clearly opportunity there. We don't want to size the exact, but it's an area that we clearly believe we'll be able to work on.","Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.","Thanks, Matt. Operator, next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. Two questions if I could really quickly. I want to follow back up on the channel commentary to Steve's question. Can you give us a sense in terms of the A4 opportunity? Does that create any sort of conflict currently with your installed base of partners? And is that why you're having to maybe get more acquisitive? And then the second piece is around your confidence that equipment sales, the rate of decline can improve. Is that because you have more contracts in hand entering the fourth quarter or in the month of October than you have historically? Or what else gives you that confidence? Thank you.","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","Yeah. Mark, I'm sorry. I just missed the last part \u2013 your original question on the A4 part broke up a little bit. Could you just repeat that part of it, please?","Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Sorry about that. So I was just curious in terms of go-to-market with A4, as it is a little newer here with Xerox after being away from that market for a good number of years. Is it creating any sort of channel conflict with some of your partners? And is that why you're having to maybe increase the M&A expenses or expectations going forward because you may have to actually be more acquisitive related to A4 type of partners from a channel perspective?","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","I see, thank you. Not at all. So no, it's been part of our strategy. Look, we only have about a 5% market share in A4 and when we were, what I'll call a two division company, basically we were managing the business more for profits, more for cash and we're still doing that, don't get me wrong, but we believe now that we have a much more cost competitive A4 portfolio with the 12 new products that we've just introduced, not only will it benefit us in Managed Document Services, as I said, it'll give us much more opportunity, especially with a coherency in A3 and it should actually improve our gross margins in that space because we'll be able to architect the solutions differently. It will also enable us to bring on more channel partners than we have in the past because we've always been the leader in A3 and everybody wants our A3 solutions. But now when resellers go to market they need both an A3 and an A4 solution. So we'll be able to provide both to them and the fact that we now have at least 45 new partners coming on with more to come, says that they really like what they're seeing in the products and there's a lot of excitement in it. And again, if you would \u2013 your second part of the question now?","Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.","The go-forward.","William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.","I think it was regarding confidence on Q4.","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","Oh, confidence in Q4, thank you. The reason we have confidence is when I look at the way that \u2013 the backlog that we have going into Q4 is the best we've been positioned certainly this year, and probably over the last 14 months. When I look at what we have in terms of the pipeline for signings which will benefit us from a signing standpoint in Q4 and then certainly into next year, when I look up at the new resellers that we're bringing on and when I look at our new logo hunters that are just going after new business, it does give us the confidence. And obviously seeing the September results that we had the benefit of seeing, it was a bit of a trend breaker for us over the last five quarters. So that's what gives us confidence.","Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.","Thanks, Mark. Operator, I think we have time for one last question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva of Citi. Your line is now open.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks very much. Two questions, I'll ask them both at the same time. The first one is on the free cash flow guidance taking down. I think that was unexpected by investors and you clearly laid it out this quarter, but I guess the question is, you unexpectedly brought it down. I guess, are there other things you guys are considering that maybe we should be bracing for as we look ahead that could impact free cash flow for our modeling perspective? And then my second question is, on MDS you mentioned that the signings you expect to go up next quarter in Q4. Do you mean up year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter because I believe quarter-over-quarter it's generally up. Thank you.","William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.","Yeah. Hey, Jim, it's Bill. I'll answer the first question regarding the free cash flow guidance. The way that we look at it really is that the underlying cash flow actually we feel very good about what's happened year-to-date and the progress we've seen as far as underlying cash flow as a company, we actually raised based upon the original basis, the $700 million to $900 million range to $800 million to $1 billion based upon that.","But as far as the surprise it's actually the $500 million when we did the debt, or note issuance back in September we disclosed that $500 million of the $1 billion note was going to be used for this and revised the cash flow guidance at that time for that $500 million which we view as a positive because it's allowing us to have more stable pension contributions going forward as opposed to having certain required amounts being higher like this year was $350 million, next year $450 million, $500 million. So we believe it will be more stable going towards the future so that's $500 million we put out there in the September timeframe.","And as far as the ceasing of the short-term sale of receivables, we believe just from a strategic transformation perspective, the savings associated with that, whether it was the interest costs with the effect of borrowing or the administrative costs that that working capital management tool just wasn't for the needed except there's a limited part that's left and we see that as a positive from a savings perspective, $10 million going forward.","So yeah, there is the one-time timing. But as I explained in Shannon's initial question, it's just the timing, pulled forward cash 30 days to 60 days. And as far as ongoing run rates, this really has no impact on 2018.","And as far as other things being thought about or considered really nothing. I mean, I laid out some initial thoughts regarding 2018 cash flow considerations when answering Shannon's question and really nothing else other than that.","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","Yeah, and, Jim, on the signings, if you go from a constant currency basis on a year-to-date basis, we've declined about 7% with growth in the renewables and declines in the new business. We expect to see the new business improving in Q4, so we expect to have strong improvements versus the year-to-date signings we've seen in Q4 for sure.","Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.","Great. Thanks, Jim. That's all the time we have for questions today. We appreciate the interest of everyone who has tuned in. Jeff, anything to wrap up?","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","I just want to thank everybody for your questions. As I mentioned last quarter, we are keenly focused on the work ahead of us. We're positioning ourselves to reverse our revenue trajectory trends over time. We understand the market and are successful come by operationally laying the building blocks to capture share of the growing workplace, marketplace and increase our participation in the expanding high-end color market. We continue to make headway on our strategy and are confident in our ability to meet our full year commitments. We look forward to updating you on our progress. Thanks so much for joining the call.","Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.","Great. Thanks, Jeff. And that concludes our call.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. That does conclude today's program. You may now disconnect.

She is joined by Leslie Varon, Vice President and Interim Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com\/investor. At the request of Xerox Corporation, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. Other recording and\/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without the expressed permission of Xerox. [Operator Instructions]","During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which by their nature address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein.","At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns, you may begin.","Ursula Burns","Good morning and thank you for joining our call. Today, we are announcing significant actions that will define the next chapter of our company. We will spend much of the call today discussing our plans to separate into two strong independent market-leading companies. We will also discuss the multiyear strategic transformation program announced today. And of course, we will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results and 2016 guidance.","Let me begin with our plan to dramatically change the way that we generate shareholder value. Today, we announced that the comprehensive structural review begun in October has been completed. The review has been a top priority for our Board of Directors and the executive team. We engaged outside advisers, including independent advisers to the Board in this process. It was a robust assessment of options for the company\u2019s portfolio and capital allocation that would best position the company to maximize shareholder value. It became clear through this analysis that the benefits of separation outweighed the benefits of maintaining the current structure.","The Board unanimously agreed that the optimal path forward for Xerox is to become two market-leading focused publicly traded companies. We are confident this is the highest value creating opportunity for our shareholders, for our clients and employees. These companies will both be significant Fortune 500 scale companies and leaders in their markets, one comprising our Business Process Outsourcing business; the other, our Document Technology and Document Outsourcing businesses.","Document Technology, with 2015 revenue of $11 billion, will continue to lead the document management and document outsourcing market, leveraging its superior technology, solutions and innovation capabilities. BPO, with 2015 revenue of $7 billion, and already a leader in the growing market, will continue to pursue growth opportunities by capitalizing on its deep industry expertise, market-leading automation solutions and track record of global delivery excellence. I will discuss unique strengths, top line financial profiles and growth opportunities of the two companies in more detail shortly.","But first, let me talk about the compelling rationale that exists behind the decision to separate these companies. We have two strong businesses each facing different market and client realities. Document Technology faces modest secular declines in its markets while BPO participates in the growing, but rapidly evolving market. The businesses have distinct operating models and cash flow characteristics and very different growth drivers and competition. The Document Technology business is one in which operational discipline and the commitment to transformative productivity is vital to sustaining quality and managing cost in an increasingly interconnected digital world. Doing that right creates strong profitability and cash flow that can be returned to shareholders and invested in selected growth opportunities.","BPO, on the other hand, needs to be highly adaptive, able to innovate and adopt technology quickly and shift its portfolio to address the fast changing needs of its clients. We are seeing how new technologies like Software-as-a-Service and robotic process automation are changing the way that services are delivered. Additionally, clients are requiring deep analytics for operational insight and greater personalization. The BPO market is growing at a greater than 5% rate and the majority of the revenue streams are recurring. Based on this, we concluded that these businesses will be stronger and able to create more value for shareholders, clients and employees as independent companies.","We are creating two companies that will be market leaders, benefiting from enhanced strategic and operational focus, distinct and clear financial profiles and capital allocation policies can simplify organization structures. As standalone companies, they will have compelling investment cases and be better positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities and expand margins and market share. We see the BPO company as one focused on revenue growth, margin expansion and disciplined investments in attractive growing markets. Document Technology will leverage its track record of market leadership and strong cash flow generation to a sustained and investment grade rating and shareholder-friendly capital allocation plan.","Let\u2019s look at more closely at each company. The Document Technology company will be the global leader in a $90 billion document management and document outsourcing market with the presence in approximately 180 countries. We have a broad portfolio of products and are the equipment revenue market share leader. Our managed print services offerings are widely recognized as best-of-breed by customers and industry analysts. Despite secular decline in the printing industry, our Document Technology business remains highly profitable with annuity driven revenue representing more than 70% of our sales. Through relentless cost discipline, this business generates strong and consistent cash flows that allow us to make strategic investments to generate, to penetrate higher growth markets such as Aqueous inkjet, high-end color printing, managed print services and workflow.","BPO is a leading enterprise for the next-generation of Business Process Outsourcing with $7 billion in revenues. In this business, we enjoyed the number two position in market share in an industry that is expanding by more than 5% annually. We are advantaged with differentiated capabilities and help clients improve their flow of work, we bring expertise in managing transaction intensive business processes and are applying new innovations to automation solutions.","We have market-leading positions in healthcare, transportation, public sector and a range of other industries. Our high recurring revenue and high renewal rates reinforce our confidence in our ability to grow market share and expand margins going forward. We are very excited about the opportunities ahead of us for these two businesses. With increased strategic focus, we can capitalize on their unique strength and capture the value creation opportunities that we see in each of them. ","In conjunction with the separation announcement, we have also launched a strategic transformation program, targeting incremental savings of $600 million over 3 years. This brings our total cumulative savings target to $2.4 billion during this period, which includes ongoing productivity initiatives.","In 2016, we expect a total of $700 million in annualized savings. The plan is companywide and will include a thorough review of how we work and how we operate. Bottom line, we are not only optimizing our portfolio and capital structure, we are also driving a strategic transformation. This will improve our competitive position and help expand margins in both our businesses during the separation process and beyond.","Our employees will benefit from working for industry leaders with streamlined structures and fast decision-making. The companies will have greater flexibility to align employee incentives and rewards to business performance. For clients, each company will maintain its leading service delivery and innovation excellence, but will be able to more quickly respond to market forces and client needs through focus and agility. And for investors, focus to companies with optimized capital structures and capital allocation policies to present distinct and compelling investment cases and will be well-positioned to deliver value.","Let me spend a moment on the separation process itself. We are committed to executing the strategic actions seamlessly in the shortest possible timeframe. The separation is expected to be completed by the end of 2016, subject to customary conditions. We expect that the transaction to be U.S. federal tax free for our shareholders. During the process, we will remain focused on our clients, partners, suppliers and employees and delivering strong financial results. There are of course, a series of key milestones that we will need to achieve in the upcoming months to complete the transaction and we will keep you updated on our progress. And as you read this morning, Xerox entered into an agreement with Carl Icahn, related to the governance of the BPO company following the planned separation. Details are included in the 8-K that we filed today.","Now let me make a few brief comments on the fourth quarter before turning over to Leslie for a detailed results discussion. We delivered strong performance in the face of challenging market conditions. Highlights were; revenue of $4.7 billion in the quarter, down 5% in constant currency year-over-year, annuity revenue was 83% of total revenue, adjusted EPS of $0.32, above our expectation and $0.27 on a GAAP basis, sequential increase in operating margin to 9.2%, strong cash flow generation of $878 million in the quarter and $1.6 billion for the full year. The changes we have made to the Services operating model are beginning to pay off as demonstrated by sequential margin improvement and double-digit year-over-year signings growth. Document Technology was the industry leader for the 24th consecutive quarter and through focus on performance and productivity, maintained its strong margins. Over the course of 2015, we returned $1.6 billion to shareholders in the form of $1.3 billion in share buybacks and over $300 million in dividends. We have increased our annual dividends by 11% to $0.31 per share, the highest level since 2000 beginning with a dividend payable April 2016.","Leslie will discuss our 2016 guidance and some changes that we will make in our reporting. We expect 2016 to be a strong year for Xerox as well as a foundational year for the two companies. Now I will turn it over to Leslie.","Leslie Varon","Thanks, Ursula, and good morning everyone. I will start by walking through our results and then covering 2016 guidance before handing it back to Ursula to wrap up. In summary, we delivered solid results in quarter four. Services came in above our expectations, driven by good sequential margin improvement. Document Technology revenue was weaker than anticipated, primarily driven by lower supply sales, but margin remained in the middle of our range reflecting our ongoing cost discipline and business model flexibility. Q4 cash flow as anticipated was seasonally strong and drove $1.6 billion of full year operating cash flow resulting in a healthy ending cash balance of $1.4 billion. During the year, we returned a substantial amount of cash to our shareholders with $1.3 billion in share repurchases and $326 million in dividends.","Turning to the earnings slide, I will walk through the income statement. Revenue in the quarter was down 8% at actual currency and 5% at constant currency. Currency cost us approximately $150 million on the top line. Services\u2019 top line was flat at constant currency, helped by solid 3% growth in Document Outsourcing, offsetting a 2% decline in BPO. Document Technology declined 10% at constant currency and drove the overall revenue decline. I will speak more about the drivers when I review the segments. Gross margin of 31.3% was down 80 basis points year-over-year, but up 40 basis points sequentially. Sequential improvement was driven by Services, while the year-over-year decline was driven by Document Technology as well as a greater mix of services, which carries a lower gross margin. RD&E was lower by $5 million year-over-year and SAG was down $59 million or 6%. Good expense reductions in absolute terms, but not sufficient to offset revenue declines, so operating margin of 9.2% was down 120 basis points year-over-year and operating profit declined 18%.","Adjusted other net expense was down year-over-year, driven by lower restructuring costs as anticipated in our quarter four guidance. Equity income was $32 million in the quarter, down $9 million year-over-year, reflecting lower profits in Fuji Xerox driven in part by the continued negative impact of translation currency. Our quarter four adjusted tax rate of 21% was below our guidance of 25% to 27%, benefiting our earnings by about $0.02 and reflecting the impact of recent U.S. tax legislation that extends R&D tax credits. Bottom line, despite revenue headwinds, we delivered solid Q4 adjusted earnings of $0.32.","Moving on to our Services results, while many of the headwinds we have highlighted in the past continue, the benefits of the new operating model are beginning to be realized. Services revenue declined 3% and was flat at constant currency, consistent with both Q3 and full year performance. BPO was down 2% as a result of lower new contract ramp from softer signings in earlier quarters and our decision last quarter to reduce our financial risk and not fully complete the Health Enterprise Medicaid platform implementation in Montana and California. Good growth continues in Document Outsourcing, up 3%, driven by strong Xerox Partner print services growth as well as strong equipment revenue growth in enterprise accounts following continued good signings.","In terms of the opportunity ahead, total signings in the quarter were up 26% year-over-year and 8% for the trailing 12 months. New business signings were up 22% year-over-year in quarter four. This really strong growth includes the Florida tolling contract. We are pleased to close on this contract and begin implementing a comprehensive tolling solution that leverages our best-in-class proven Vector tolling platform. Excluding the Florida contract, new business signings were up 10% in quarter four, so a very good signings quarter. Our renewal rate in the quarter was 78%, below our 85% to 90% target range and reflects in part, one larger loss renewal opportunity, which would have been financially unattractive.","Services segment margin was 9.4%, down 40 basis points year-over-year, but up 130 basis points sequentially and above our 9% Q4 margin expectation. The set of services decisions and actions we implemented last year are beginning to deliver better results. We have recognized that we still have work to do. First, to continue the grow signings and translate that into revenue growth. Second, to improve our business mix with a greater proportion of our revenue from higher value offerings. And finally, to capture additional efficiency, including streamlining and automating more of our delivery capabilities.","I will now turn to Document Technology. Revenue in the quarter was down 10% at constant currency with the additional quarter four weakness coming from lower U.S. supply sales, driven in large part by channel dynamics. For the full year, revenue was down 8%, below our initial 2015 expectation of a mid single-digit decline. The largest driver was a developing markets weakness throughout the year. The Document Technology revenue decline is almost half when the growth from Document Outsourcing is included along with Document Technology. Activity in the quarter was mixed with good growth in a number of color segments, partially offset by the lapping of prior year product launches in areas such as entry production color.","Overall, 2015 was a lighter product introduction year and we look forward to more launches in 2016 starting this quarter with a broad office product refresh following \u2013 followed by a number of exciting production printing announcements we will be making at Drupa, the printing trade show which occurs every 4 years in Germany. Document Technology margin of 11.8% was in line with our full year guidance of 11% to 13%. Ongoing disciplined cost base management and the flexibility of our business model we are able to partially offset the higher revenue decline, negative mix from lower supplies and higher pension expense.","Moving to cash flow, we had a strong post to the year for operating cash flow and a very good full year for free cash flow, which was $1.3 billion. This enables us to continue to invest in select growth opportunities and return value to shareholders through repurchases and dividends.","Cash from operations was $878 million in the quarter and $1.6 billion for the year in line with our full year guidance. Q4 cash generation was roughly flat to the prior year and reflected higher working capital contribution, higher discretionary pension contribution and normal strong quarter four seasonality. Investing cash flows were $19 million used with $80 million spent on CapEx and $9 million on acquisitions partially offset by proceeds from surplus property sales. Cash flow from financing was a $278 million used, including debt reduction of $199 million and $77 million for preferred and common stock dividends. Our cash balance at the end of quarter four was $1.4 billion providing us with flexibility as we enter 2016.","Turning to our capital structure, we ended quarter four with $7.4 billion in debt, a $200 million reduction in the fourth quarter and a $374 million reduction for the year, consistent with our expectations. Applying 7 to 1 leverage on customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt at the end of quarter four was $3.9 billion, leaving core debt of $3.5 billion. We continue to manage our capital structure to maintain credit metrics consistent with our investment grade credit rating.","Turning to capital allocation, 2015 was another year of strong capital returns to shareholders. We repurchased 1.3 billion in shares, resulting in almost 10% reduction in shares outstanding. We also delivered $326 million in dividends, which included a 12% per share increase to the common stock dividend. Over four years, we have almost doubled our common stock dividend when including the 11% increase we announced today. So in total, we have returned over $1.6 billion to our shareholders, greater than free cash flow of $1.3 billion with the incremental capital coming from part of the IPO sale proceeds. We are steadfast in our commitment to return capital to shareholders and be good stewards. And we have a strong track record to backup that commitment having returned greater than 50% of free cash flow to shareholders each year over the past 5 years.","For 2016, we plan once again to deploy greater than 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase, while balancing our need to manage our debt to a level, which is consistent with our investment grade credit rating. We also intend to support our longer term growth objectives and plan to invest $100 million to $400 million on acquisitions with the focus continuing to be on expanding our capabilities in attractive markets.","Before reviewing our 2016 guidance, I would like to highlight a few reporting changes we will be making beginning this year. These changes will bring our reporting and guidance practices more in line with our peers. I will briefly summarize the changes and note that we have a full explanation on Slide 25 in the appendix. We will exclude three additional items from adjusted earnings to give a clearer picture of underlying operating performance. These items include restructuring expenses, certain retirement related costs and transaction costs from the planned separation and strategic transformation. Retirement related costs will also be adjusted out of our segment results and we are moving to student loan business that we are running off from the services segment to the other segment.","Finally starting in 2016, we will include developing markets within our constant currency calculations to give a truer picture of our constant currency revenue performance. We have additional information on these reporting changes in the appendix, including revised results for 2015 that will provide a comparable basis for 2016.","Moving to our 2016 guidance on this basis, we anticipate full year constant currency revenue to decline 2% to 4% with flat to 3% growth in services more than offset by declines of 5% to 7% in Document Technology. At January 15 spot rates we anticipate a negative currency impact on revenue of 1% to 2% for the full year with a higher impact in the first half than the second. Considering the uncertain macro environment, we don\u2019t expect our revenue to deviate substantially from trend, but we do expect modest improvement in both segments as we move through the year and lap the onset of some headwinds in both Document Technology and Services. We expect Document Technology margin to be roughly in line with 2015, that\u2019s within a 12% to 14% range, excluding retirement related costs. We expect Services margin to improve and be in a range of 8% to 9.5%. Adjusted earnings guidance of $1.10 to $1.20 represents a 3% to 12% growth from 2015.","Finally, we expect to generate operating cash flow of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion and invest $300 million in CapEx, yielding $1 billion to $1.2 billion in free cash flow. This guidance is below 2015 cash flow as it includes settlement outflows associated with our decision last quarter to not fully complete the Health Enterprise Medicaid platform implementations in Montana and California, as well as a higher than normal level of restructuring as we implement our strategic transformation program. Transactional-related costs associated with the separation are still being estimated and aren\u2019t yet reflected in our cash flow or GAAP earnings guidance.","For quarter one, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $0.21 and $0.24. So to summarize for quarter one and full year 2016, we have set achievable objectives that reflect first, improvement in the business tied to the actions and investments we have made over the past year; second, prudent expectations given economic uncertainties and headwinds; and finally, continued investment in the business and implementation of the first year of strategic transformation activities that will further prepare the Document Technology and BPO businesses to be strong, standalone companies.","With that, I will hand it back to Ursula to wrap up.","Ursula Burns","Thanks, Leslie. Let me recap and reinforce a few key points. First, this is an executive team committed to enhancing value for Xerox shareholders. And with the support of our board, we are taking bold steps to do that by separating into two companies and undertaking a transformative productivity and efficiency program. Second, the plan to separate into two strong independent companies is the right step forward for Xerox as each company will benefit from enhanced focus and lower cost structure and an appropriate capital structure. Each will have the resources and focus needed to capitalize on unique growth opportunities and an operating model and cash flow characteristics to create value and drive in this sector.","Finally, we are fully committed to becoming a much leaner and more efficient organization both at Xerox in 2016 and continuing on at the two companies in the years after. These efforts will dramatically improve the way that we do business. Thank you for joining us today. Our efforts to transform Xerox are underway and we look forward to communicating our progress in the coming months.","With that, let me turn things over to Jennifer who will open it up for questions.","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks, Ursula. Before we get to your questions for Ursula and Leslie, let me point out that we have several supplemental slides at the end of our deck, which provide more financial detail to support today\u2019s presentation and complement our prepared remarks. For the Q&A, I would ask participants to limit follow-on and multi-part questions, so we can get to everyone. At the end of our Q&A session, I will turn it back to Ursula for closing comments. Operator, please open the line for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from George Tong of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","George Tong","Hi, thanks. Good morning. Ursula, can you provide some examples of how splitting the business can improve execution and drive better services results?","Ursula Burns","Hey, George and thanks for the question. I think that there are probably three areas that I can refer to. And there will be a mix between both Services and the Technology business, not only in Services, for sure. The investment profile that we will \u2013 that we have been making and will need to continue to make is to invest more in automation of our Services delivery infrastructure. That investment \u2013 those investment needs obviously compete with other investment needs in our tech business. And we would be able to actually focus those investments more \u2013 pointedly more, just more and it\u2019s a big focus of ours and as the market has changed, we have realized that we have to make more investments there automation, cloud-based services, service-as-a-service offerings, etcetera. Second is on talent, interestingly this is both businesses. The dynamics of these two businesses, one grows, one doesn\u2019t grow that much, one throws off a lot more cash, the other one doesn\u2019t, actually at the leadership level will be able to actually have more refined incentive structures around the leadership of these two companies that aligns very well toward their dynamics and their growth profiles. And the third is around how we operate outside of the United States. It\u2019s one of the areas that we put a lot of energy in our Services business, trying to actually piggyback on the infrastructure of our tech business. That was probably one of the most difficult areas for us to break into. And now we will be able to interestingly enough focus back our tech business on taking care of the tech sector and be very selective in how we expand further outside the United States in our BPO business, three areas of difference.","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks, George. Operator, next question.","Operator","And our next question comes from Shannon Cross from Cross Research. Your line is now open.","Shannon Cross","Thank you. I have one question on the quarter and then one question on the transaction or what you are doing. The first is just on the quarter, can you talk a little bit about the lower supply sales and how we think about that, is that \u2013 was that sort of the distributors or was that usage, what was sort of in there and how are you thinking about supplies and usage as we go through 2016? And then I had a follow-up. Thanks.","Leslie Varon","Sure, Shannon. So let me start first of all by reminding everyone that unbundled supplies in Xerox represent just 20% of our Document Technology revenues, different from many of our competitors because we sell so much of our supplies as part of the bundled contract. With regard to the lower supply sales in quarter four, it was in the U.S. and had to do with reseller stocking levels. So what we saw in quarter four was a lower level of stocking at the reseller level than we had in the year ago period. And that typically reflects some combination of the following factors; lower end customer demand, given the fact that we have had weaker equipment sales through that segment earlier this year, reseller cash management and the level of competitive discounts that resellers choose to take advantage of versus the price discounts from the Xerox level. So it was unusually weak for us in quarter four. We do expect better performance in quarter one and going forward. But we expect supplies revenue will continue to be pressured given the lower level of A4 equipment sales. Did you have another question, Shannon?","Shannon Cross","Could you hear me?","Leslie Varon","Yes.","Shannon Cross","Hello, okay. Yes. If you could just help sort of help us walk through, if we think about $1 of earnings for Xerox right now and then we split it and we obviously know that the margin differential and you have given guidance in that between the two businesses. But can you sort of help us walk through on the other line item where you think things will kind of play out, I mean I am getting in sort of $0.70 to printing and $0.30 to BPO, I mean that\u2019s very much a squishy number. But just any color you can give us on that. And then also from a cash flow perspective, how we should think about how cash flow has come from the two businesses because we kind of know what they were like in 2009, but if we can get an idea of sort of how you are thinking about it now, that would be really helpful? Thanks.","Leslie Varon","Yes. So Shannon, I will start by saying that more of these details will become clear as we go through the process to separate during the year. So I don\u2019t \u2013 I won\u2019t give you specific answers now. But I will remind you that the margin in the Document Technology segment is higher than the margin in the Services segment. And the margin in the Document Outsourcing portion of the Services segment is above the segment average, which means BPO is obviously below. So that should give you some sense as to the profiles of the margins in the two businesses going forward. With regard to cash flow, I think you know that the Document Technology business and the Document Outsourcing businesses are very cash generative businesses. And the BPO business is less cash generative and is more in an investment and a ramp up growth mode.","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks Shannon. Operator, next question.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Essex of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Brian Essex","Hi, good morning and thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if you would give us a little bit more detail on the process that you went through, how these decisions were made. And then if you could follow-up with the management structure that you anticipate as you walk through the transition process, including what we can expect at the very top leadership level, current President like Bob Zapfel and Jeff and how they are going to fit in, as well as on the CFO search side and how you anticipate staffing the financial side of the business?","Ursula Burns","Three good questions. Let me start with the process. In October, actually before October, but in October, we spoke to you about undertaking a review \u2013 a structural review that was focused on our portfolio of offerings and our capital allocation structure and process. That was in full swing by the end of October and included our Board \u2013 the entire management team and our Board of Directors and some advisors that we had from the outside. And the intention there was to take a look at not only our internal business, but as importantly, the markets \u2013 the trends in the markets, the trends in segments of the markets that we are highly invested in healthcare, transportation, these areas, very contemplative, steeped in fact in data \u2013 facts and data and just a very good bottoms-up process. That process lasted until just recently ended actually. And we made the decision that in the middle of January to separate into two companies and to do a separation. So that was it. We had no external process pressure on that, which has been reported a lot in the news. Actually, it was not engaged at all in the decision making process and so I\u2019m pleased with that. We came up with this decision based on market trends, based on our strengths and weaknesses, based on the performance that we had in these two businesses, based on the current dynamics and thinking by shareholders, by our customers, etcetera. Shareholders meaning, how they value allocation methodologies. ","As far as management goes, one of the things I will start with me as we have gotten this a lot, one of the things that was removed from the process early as we went into this and I did with the Board was to move me out of this discussion. The decision about whether or not we split into two companies or what process we take on a go forward basis can\u2019t be based on an individual or with any worry about an individual. So literally I said, let us go through this kind of agnostic of individual and let\u2019s manage it from a process standpoint. Good news is that we did that, I have a great relationship with the Board. My future will be contemplated. I will make some recommendations to the Board and my future will be contemplated as part of those recommendations. I am both confident and solid in that. ","And in the next year by the way, we have to spend a lot of time doing three things. One is taking $600 million \u2013 $700 million annualized costs out of the business. We have to split the company into two and we have to deliver the 2016 plan. Not small activities. ","As far as Services leadership, if there is one thing that we will change from a structural standpoint today, that we know today, even though it\u2019s not implemented today, is that the Services leadership will come from the outside. But I want to make sure that we are clear. We have \u2013 the BPO leadership will come from the outside. I have a President who runs the Services businesses today. He is a very valued member of our company. He does a good job. We expect \u2013 I hope that he continues to operate in the business on a go-forward basis, but the new CEO of the company will come from the outside. ","CFO, we put the CFO on the backburner. We didn\u2019t totally stop it, but we put the search on the backburner as we went into the structural review. This is a place where we will have strong internal candidates as well as some external candidates. It\u2019s just a good process to go through that. And we will have one and then eventually two CFOs as we go forward. And I am pretty comfortable with that process as well.","I think I got all of the questions answered, I hope.","Jennifer Horsley","Great. Thanks, Brian. Operator, next question.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Cabral of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Matt Cabral","Yes, thank you. So, on the Document Technology business now that you have a more focused printing company as one of the two entities going forward, can you talk about your views on the opportunities for consolidation in the market and if Xerox would look to participate in any of that consolidation going forward?","Ursula Burns","Most of our focus in this area has been on distribution consolidation and we are still actively pursuing that type of activity. We found that our brand is strong and our offers are very strong and we just have to get more people carrying them to the market. So, that will be our primary focus from an acquisition standpoint. That was one part of the question. What was the second part, I am sorry?","Leslie Varon","I think that was it. I just highlight a couple of additional things, Matt. On the distribution side, as Ursula said, we have been adding to the portfolio of businesses in the Global Imaging suite inside of Xerox. And Global Imaging was an acquisition we did in 2007. You know it\u2019s been extraordinarily successful and had a very, very successful 2015. In addition to that, we continue to pursue opportunities to expand our offerings in Document Technology, which includes the acquisition we did of Impika, a few years ago in order to position us more strongly up in the high-end of inkjet. So, we see further opportunities in those kinds of areas.","Matt Cabral","Great. Very good, thank you.","Jennifer Horsley","Great. Thanks, Matt. Operator, next question.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ananda Baruah of Brean Capital. Your line is now open.","Ananda Baruah","Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Appreciate it. Ursula, we would just sort of just love to get what your initial view is \u2013 current view is on how you guys would view I guess sort of the value pitch like really what\u2019s the pitch to investors, what will it be for the Doc Tech company given the revenue growth profile, margins are really solid, cash flow was up obviously. But as investors begin to develop themselves a view of the Doc Tech company standalone as investable assets, how would you like for them to think about it given the constant currency revenue growth profile of the company? And then just sort of a sub-question to that, this will be it for me. Anything that you can talk about that could be additive over time to the revenue growth profile would be \u2013 at least philosophically useful as well? Thanks.","Ursula Burns","Right. So, I will start with the Services, with the BPO company and then get into the Doc Tech company. BPO company, think about nimble, expensive, so growing, really keen focus on operational expertise and flexibility and a capital structure and allocation policy that\u2019s aligned towards investing for growth. Our services business \u2013 our technology business is market leader, cash generative and having a capital allocation strategy that is focused on returning a high proportion of that capital to shareholders. It will likely \u2013 it will have to be investment grade. We are going to push hard for that to be the case and invest and then make sure that we setup the company that way, because it has a financing business that\u2019s captured as you know and will benefit from the investment grade rating. And not look at the top line in total you have to look at the top line in sub-pieces. We will be able to have a better explanation and more discussion about that as we separate the companies, meaning that we will start speaking more about the graphic communications business and what happens underneath there and how it is transforming and how we are leading that transformation, how our Document Outsourcing business is growing, focused and how we are leading the transformations there? So, little bit more focused on the dynamics underneath the business that will help to sell both of these companies \u2013 the differences around both of these companies.","Leslie Varon","If Ananda, I could just put a point on a couple of things that Ursula said specifically to Doc Tech, because I think the growth opportunities on the BPO side are clear. If you step back and look at the Doc Tech market, it\u2019s a $90 billion market. When we combine the Document Outsourcing growth with the Doc Tech segment what you will see is that our performance was essentially down 4% at constant currency in 2015. So, it is clearly under pressure. But certainly, the developing markets economies were under pressure big time in \u201815 as well. So, I would call it modest decline and as Ursula said, with important pockets of opportunity both in Document Outsourcing as well as, for example, in graphic communications. So this is an area where we believe that a more focused business will be able to make selective investments in attractive growth markets and improve the performance on the top line.","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks, Ananda. Operator, next question.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Keith Bachman of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Keith Bachman","Thank you very much. I feel like I am always following Ananda\u2019s question. I wanted to ask you two questions. I agree with the characterization that the Services business or the BPO parts of the service business is probably not congruent or leveraging the core printer business. With that said, I am not sure anything has really changed. I am curious what you really learned? In other words, why would you buy it? And then secondarily, part of the strategy over the last couple of years within the broader context of Services has been M&A. And I think Xerox has been \u2013 has not been able to generate the growth through inorganic means within the M&A side of services. Is that a pricing issue or a structural issue? What\u2019s the process and as you are in \u2013 going through the separation this year, will you have the ability to go ahead to engage in M&A even as you are trying to go through the separation? Thank you.","Ursula Burns","Yes. So, let me take both of those and it will be a little bit of a conversational tone. Let\u2019s start with the M&A piece. We have acquired in the first couple of years of our M&A during the year about $350 million worth of assets for a couple of years in a row and the last 2 years have not been able to generate that same level of performance. We were always shooting for more. By the way, we have \u2013 it\u2019s not, not seeing opportunities. The good news is that we do see some. We also have \u2013 but we do have very specific requirements and high hurdles for accepting an M&A deal. I don\u2019t expect that those hurdles will go away at all. So, we are guiding down as you can see, $100 million to $400 million in M&A, because we do have \u2013 as I said, a high hurdle. I think we will be able to get somewhere in the middle of that range, maybe to the high end if we are a little bit lucky there. So, no strategic change in M&A, no strategic change in our desire to acquire, a little bit narrow and we talked about being a little bit less diversified in our offers, definitely focusing on commercial healthcare, definitely focusing on transportation and those assets. Focusing a little bit in those two areas and maybe others in going internationally, so \u2013 but I don\u2019t think that there is a big change. We are not having a big change in our strategy for M&A and we are going to keep trying. As I keep saying, I have money to spend. I am hoping that we can actually use it more frequently than we have in the past.","As far as what has changed, 7 years ago, I said this a little bit earlier, 7 years in business is like 7 years in dog years. A lot has changed in 7 years. The healthcare market has changed, not only in how healthcare is provisioned and paid for, which has a big effect on us. But in the provider area, how much consolidation there has been, literally buying and selling of very large customers. So, companies saw our customer set has changed. International markets have slowed pretty significantly and the dollar has strengthened pretty significantly. There have been a lot of shifts in technology and etcetera. So a lot of things have changed in the markets around us. And all that have done, they haven\u2019t changed the fundamentals of the two businesses, but it has made it very, very clear that fitness and focus is at a premium right now. And that\u2019s where we have chosen to make our investments. Fitness and focus, I need to invest a little bit more in our Services business, particularly as the shifts are happening in there and as a service and cost of automation, etcetera. And we have to be very pointed in our focus in Document Technology and make sure that we continue to drive efficiencies through that value chain, etcetera. So we didn\u2019t look back. We didn\u2019t spend a lot of time in our analysis looking back to what we did 7 years ago. We spent all of our time looking forward and we are very confident in our decision on a go-forward basis.","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks Keith. Operator, next question.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tien-tsin Huang","Hey, great. Thanks for all this detail. Long-term and short-term question, I guess the short-term one, just the incremental savings from the restructuring that you are announcing. How much of that will we see as incremental in 2016, is that net of any cost synergies we might see from the separation. And then just the longer term question on the BPO front, when you are talking about 5% industry growth, do you think, when you did your long-term study on the strategic review for that asset, do you think that the current business mix can get to a 5% growth rate with better focus and whatnot or do you see there potentially a big shift in the business mix to get there? Thanks.","Ursula Burns","Let me start with the second question, do this first part of the \u2013 first question, then Leslie will take over. Second question, we haven\u2019t really looked at a specific growth rate and whether we can get the 5%. But I can tell you one thing and that\u2019s that we can grow higher \u2013 faster than we are growing today. There is no doubt about that. Particularly as we mix our portfolio, we are heavily mixed towards customer care. That business by the way, we can actually grow that business a little bit faster than we are growing it today, but that business doesn\u2019t have a margin profile that we actually want to expand too much further. So we are being very selective in how we go forward in customer care and picking our customer care accounts and engagements that actually are broader than what we would call bare customer care. And rest of the business lines, transportation for sure and commercial healthcare and even government healthcare, the core portion of it are growing at rates that can support a 5% rate. But we have to do some portfolio mixing to make sure that we can actually \u2013 mixing and timing to make sure that we can get there over time. And you will hear more about it as we do even deeper work in the separation process and looking at the BPO business.","As far as \u2013 I just want to also transition to this $2.4 billion and make sure that we are clear about what we are doing here. Normally in Xerox and so every year in Xerox, we do a fair amount as you know of restructuring and remixing of how we spend the money. We get some productivity benefits from our vendors. And we get the rest of the productivity benefits from us. This $2.4 billion is foundational in three basic parts. One, we will get some part of it from our normal interactions with our suppliers to make sure they actually drive some of their productivity and give that to us. We can get to be about $1 billion over the 3 years plus or minus \u2013 give or take some. And we also get naturally, every year level of productivity from both our tech and services business foundational. And what we are explaining and what we are doing with this transformation was taking that first part and the second part and adding on top of it a $600 million additional savings program. And we are doing that by changing \u2013 focusing on changing how we work. This is not and it\u2019s a big \u2013 we are kind of readying ourselves for the markets in the future and the business in the future and trying to actually shift out \u2013 take out an additional $600 million as we go forward. And I will have Leslie go through some of the \u2013 a little bit more line item here.","Leslie Varon","Yes. So Tien-tsin just to come back and clarify a couple of things, when Ursula was talking about customer care, it is clearly our objective to expand the customer care margin. It is not our objective to increase the proportion of customer care business inside of our BPO business.","Tien-tsin Huang","Perfect.","Leslie Varon","So we certainly want to grow customer care. We want to grow the other higher value offers more quickly so that we can drive the BPO margin up. With regard to cost transformation, we save about \u2013 we capture about $600 million a year, which is roughly 4% to 5% kind of annual productivity. In addition to that in 2016, we are expecting an annualized savings from the transformation program of about $100 million. And that will be captured from a variety of focus areas, things like the structure of the organization, so we can start the two separated companies lien, which will include both layers of management as well as support functions and infrastructure. It will include labor productivity and taking advantage of automation and changing how we deliver services to our customers. So our expectation is that we will invest about $200 million in restructuring this year, in 2016. And since we will be doing the transformation throughout the year, we are really just starting. We expect the savings that we generate in 2016 will be probably around $50 million from the strategic \u2013 from year one of that incremental program.","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks, Tien-tsin. Operator, I think we have time for one last question.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from Jim Suva from Citi. Your line is now open.","Jim Suva","Thank you and congratulations. It seems like you definitely have done a lot of work and a lot of work ahead. I have two questions, one fundamental operations, the other one on the separation. The first is on the fundamental operations, did I hear correctly the renewal rate was around 78% and I believe that seems a little bit normal, was there any cause behind that or something that we should be aware of. And then on the separation, the $2.4 billion, I believe that\u2019s all about the savings. The question I have is have you identified the amount of costs associated with the separation, like do you need an additional ERP system or human resource systems or are things actually already run right now on two different systems. I am just wondering if there is separation cost of the $2.4 billion in savings is net of those costs? Thank you and again congratulations on all the news.","Leslie Varon","So Jim, thanks so much for the questions. Let me start with renewal rate and then I will talk about synergy. So you are right that the renewal rate was light in quarter four and it was at 78%. Although for the year, the renewal rate was up 3 points to 84%. There was one large renewal in the quarter that would have been unattractive for us. And therefore, we walked away. With regard to dis-synergies, we haven\u2019t yet spoken about dis-synergies. But in some of the areas that you are poking about \u2013 poking at, there has not been a whole lot of integration, in for instance, IT between the ACS acquisition back then and the legacy Xerox. So we will talk more about dis-synergies as we go forward. But we certainly expect the benefits of the separation and inclusive of the strategic transformation to more than offset any of the dis-synergies.","Ursula Burns","So thank you for joining us and for your questions. I have a couple of things to close on. First, we are creating two strong market-leading companies, positioned to capture unique industry opportunities and maximize value. Each company will have resources that are appropriate and focus to capitalize on growth opportunities in their markets. We are going to leverage each company\u2019s distinct growth profile, operating model, cash flow characteristics, et cetera. And very importantly, during this year 2016, it\u2019s about delivering 2016, we are really focused on that. We closed 2015 well and I want to make sure that we carry that into 2016 and we will keep you up-to-date on how we are progressing as we speak to you throughout the year.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect.

She is joined by Luca Maestri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com\/investor. At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and\/or re-broadcasting of this call are prohibited without expressed permission of Xerox. [Operator Instructions]","During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which by their nature, address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein.","At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns, you may begin.","Ursula M. Burns","Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. We'll get started on Slide 3. We began 2011 with a clear articulation of our priorities. You see them listed here. While the statements themselves seem relatively simple, the complexity was in the implementations, especially during a year of unexpected external challenges. Here's a report card on how well we did. ","First, accelerating our Services business, growing it faster by diversifying our offerings and expanding globally. More of our total revenue now comes from Services than Technology. In 2011, revenue from Services grew 6%, which reflects an impressive 8% growth in Business Process Outsourcing and 9% growth in Document Outsourcing. ","Our IT Outsourcing business declined 4% during the year, but we're encouraged by our recent uplift in ITO signings. In total, our integrated sales activity resulted in a stronger pipeline and a 14% increase in new business signings. ","Second, maintaining our leadership in document technology. We not only continue to hold our #1 equipment revenue share position, but we also grew share in 2011. We did this by offering a more extensive and affordable portfolio of color products and by expanding our distribution to serve more small and midsized businesses around the world. ","Third, we are very good at managing our business with a disciplined focus on operational excellence. This gives us the financial flexibility to help offset pressures on the business whether it's economic uncertainty or necessary investments that drive growth. Either way, our focus is on delivering strong bottom line results. ","And by executing well on the first 3 priorities, we delivered on the fourth, expanding earnings and returning cash to shareholders. Full-year 2011 adjusted earnings per share grew 15%. We generated $2 billion in operating cash and bought back $700 million in Xerox shares during the year. That\u2019s a buyback of 88 million shares or 71 million net of the pension contribution, which is more than we initially expected. ","So during the year where we faced our share of headwinds, I'm pleased with our progress and confident in our position to build more value for our business, for our clients and for our shareholders in 2012. I often say that some companies talk about transformation, but we're actually doing it. You're seeing the results of the company's strategic shift in our financial performance. ","But to understand how we are achieving these results, it's important to understand the breadth of our business. The Xerox brand is now in places that may seem unexpected, but the link between our well-regarded technology and our diverse services is one more common objective, which is simplifying for clients the way that work gets done so that they can operate more efficiently and more effectively. And as you would expect from Xerox, innovation remains core to what we do and how we strengthen our competitive advantage. ","Turn to Slide 4 for some examples of what I mean. Radical changes to managing information in healthcare are now being more embraced by healthcare providers and payers. We continue to advance our offerings and be recognized as a valuable player in the industry through our cloud-based technology, our advanced security protocols and deep expertise in the complexities of building and managing digital health systems. ","Two examples, 2 very good examples: one, with our recent acquisition of the Breakaway Group, which provides electronic medical record simulation technology, and our contract with the State of Iowa to run its health information exchange. Xerox innovation is also changing the status quo in some of the more basic ways that we live, like using public transportation. Through large-scale contracts with transit authorities, we're developing easy ways for commuters to pay with smartphones and debit cards, doing away with the inefficient token and ticket systems. ","And no matter where you work, where you work takes you, in the office, on the road or at home, we help ensure that printing is accessible and affordable. We do that through continuously extending and refreshing our product portfolio, especially in color and by broadening our Managed Services -- Managed Print Services. Our MPS offerings continue to win the praise of industry analysts. More important, they win new business with clients like British Airways that recently tapped Xerox for a 5-year enterprise print services contract. In all 3 areas, we've developed repeatable, scalable and integrated solutions. This is our approach to real business, improving our clients' productivity by simplifying the way that they serve their clients. Our results in the fourth quarter reflect progress in these and other areas. ","So please turn to Slide 5 for a review of Q4 performance. In the fourth quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.33. That's up 14% from a year ago. Our GAAP -- on a GAAP basis, earnings were $0.26 per share. This includes $0.07 related to the amortization of intangibles. Total fourth quarter revenue of $6 billion were flat. Revenue from our Services business was up 6%. However, revenue from our Technology business was down 5%. While our Technology business improved throughout the year in the United States and in developing markets, we saw a drop-off during Q4 in Technology sales across Europe. ","The strength of our Services business model is particularly evident when we're faced with macro issues. Our Services provide cost-efficient ways for our clients to run more productive enterprises, and our multiyear Services contracts benefit our business for the long term through a healthy base of recurring revenue. ","Signings for BPO, Document Outsourcing and IT Outsourcing were up 15% in the fourth quarter. The increase in Services signings continues to put near-term pressure on margins as we make initial investments to implement new contracts. As a result, operating margin of 10% was down 0.4 points. Gross margin was 32.2 points, in line with our range. And we balance our investments by continuing to improve SAG, with selling, administrative and general expenses now at 19.3% of revenue. ","Q4 cash from operations was approximately $1.3 billion. And as I mentioned previously, we delivered on our commitment to generate $2 billion in full-year operating cash. We're continuing to use available cash for acquisitions and share repurchase. In a moment, Luca will provide a more detailed -- more detail on cash flow, as well as review our balance sheet and reporting segments. Then we'll both take your questions. ","But first, let's look -- take a little closer look at our top line results on Slide 6. Here you see what -- that Services now represents 48% of our total revenue, up from 45% a year ago and continuing to grow in proportion to our total revenue. It's an important metric that reflects investments in building our outsourcing portfolio and expanding our offerings globally. ","As I mentioned, total revenue of $6 billion was flat in the quarter. Annuity revenue, which is 80% of the total, was flat or up 1% in constant currency. Equipment sale revenue was down 3% or 2% in constant currency, largely due to the weakness in Europe. While operating in this challenging economic environment, we've grown our global market share for equipment revenue. And installs of Xerox equipment grew 8% in the fourth quarter, a good indication of future annuity. ","During the year, we launched 27 products, with an emphasis on broadening our color portfolio for both production and office markets. And we've -- and we expanded our channels of distribution. As a result, our MIF, that's machines in the field, for our color devices grew 14% in 2011, an important contributor to our annuity stream. ","Growth in Services is also a big benefit to our annuity. We continue to focus on joint sales activities between Xerox and ACS. In 2011, this resulted in more than 300 revenue synergy deals, delivering significant total contract value for the company. These deals include a multiyear contract with a major consumer goods company, to manage their  IT Systems, and enterprise print services win with a large financial investment firm and expanding our business with one of Latin America's largest banks to now support their commercial foreign exchange operations. ","To further accelerate our joint sales activities, we increasingly see the value of going to market as one Xerox, demonstrating to our clients that our Services-led, Technology-driven strategy offers value to their business through the strength of our offerings, the power of our innovation and the expertise of our people. ","Therefore, we're retiring the ACS brand in many areas of our Services business and will lead with Xerox as a master brand that now represents the world's largest enterprise for business process and document management. It's more than a logo change. It reflects the progress that we've made in transforming the company, the meaningful growth in front of us and the value we\u2019re building for stakeholders. ","With that, let me turn it over to Luca, and I'll be back to wrap up and open the call to your questions. Luca?","Luca Maestri","Thank you, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. As Ursula just explained, revenue was flat in the quarter, both at actual and constant currency. Services continue to show good growth, up 6%. And Technology was down 5%, affected by the weakness that we saw in Europe. ","Operating margin in Q4 was 10%, a sequential improvement from Q3, in line with seasonality, but down 0.4 year-over-year. Gross margin of 32.2% was lower year-over-year due to the shift of business towards Services and the ramp of new contracts. We expect this gross margin dynamic to continue in the near term as Services growth accelerates and new contracts start up. ","We partially offset the gross margin impact through disciplined expense management. Both R&D and SG&A ratios continue to show significant improvement from restructuring and synergies. Within SG&A, bad debts increased year-over-year by $12 million, as improvements in North America were more than offset by higher write-offs in southern Europe. ","For the full year, operating margins grew by 30 basis points. We deployed several cost and expense reduction initiatives to offset the disruption from the natural disaster in Japan during the first half and ongoing currency headwinds. Below the line, we had improved results from lower interest expense and higher equity income at Fuji Xerox. ","Also, in the quarter, we made 2 one-off entries which are worth mentioning. We realized a $66 million after-tax pension curtailment gain that is associated with our decision in Q4 to fully freeze after December 2012 any further service and benefit accruals in the Xerox defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. This impact was partially offset by a restructuring charge of $39 million after-tax we took to improve the efficiency of our operations and help counter the pressures in the macro environment. ","As a result, adjusted EPS in Q4 was $0.33 and grew 14% year-over-year. The only adjustment to reported EPS was the amortization of intangibles. It should be noted, this adjustment was higher than in previous quarters because in Q4, we accelerated the amortization of the intangibles related to the ACS trade name, following our decision to discontinue the use of the ACS brand going forward. For the full year, adjusted EPS grew 15% and GAAP EPS more than doubled. ","Let us now move to the Services segment on Slide 8. The 6% revenue growth in Services is a reflection of the breadth and diversity of our portfolio. Within Services, BPO growth accelerated, it was up 8%. And Document Outsourcing was also up 8%. ITO revenue was down 6%. The 8% growth in BPO came from both commercial and government. Commercial growth was driven by financial services, customer care and recent acquisitions. Government revenue growth came primarily from the ramping of the California Medicaid contract. The 8% increase in Document Outsourcing reflects both the impact of strong new signings and benefits from our partner print services offerings, which began to be reported in Document Outsourcing this year and are accelerating. The competitiveness of our product portfolio and our unique document management software and tools continue to clearly differentiate us in the marketplace. ","ITO revenue was down 6% in Q4, driven by 2 main factors: past contract losses and lower product resale revenues. On the positive side, during 2011, ITO signings were at $3.4 billion and up by more than 150% year-over-year. The impact of a few contract losses will continue to have an effect on revenues through midyear, at which time the ramp in new signings will deliver revenue growth. ","Total signings for the entire Services business increased 15% year-on-year in Q4, and the trailing 12-month signings calculation is now flat, even after including the California Medicaid new business and the Texas Medicaid renewal, both signed in 2010. ","Our pipeline continues to be healthy and is up 5%, including synergies. Segment margin of 10.3% was down 1.7 points year-over-year due to the contract startup costs and lower renewal rates we just discussed. California Medicaid alone impacted margins by over 0.5 points. We expect this margin pressure to remain in the near term but to gradually improve as we move through 2012. ","Let's now turn to the Technology slide. Technology revenue was down 5% or 4% at constant currency. The largest factor in this decline was the slowdown in Europe where equipment revenue was down 15%. It should also be noted that as planned, our Technology results are impacted by the launch of our partner print services, which have been very successful and are reported in Document Outsourcing. ","In spite of the revenue decline, segment margin of 11.7% was flat year-over-year and at the highest level for the year in line with seasonality. Overall, a good result, thanks to strong control and expense control. ","Looking at our product segments in detail. Entry install performance improved in the quarter, although revenue was impacted by price and mix. We're building momentum in this segment with the recent launch of a new price-competitive platform providing both mono and color capabilities. Entry represented about 21% of our Technology revenue. Mid-range was the strongest performing area in Q4 and for the full year, thanks to our strong color portfolio. This is the product segment that was also most impacted by the disaster in Japan. As we had expected, supply availability has now returned to normal, and the backlog, while healthy, is not artificially high due to the product constraints. ","Mid-range accounted for 57% of our Technology revenue. High-end results were mixed. With continued strong performance in production color, driven by iGen4 and the 800\/1000 Color Press, we're also improving our performance in entry production color with the recent launch of our Xerox 770 system. High end represented 22% of our Technology revenue. ","Going into 2012, we're very confident in our Technology offerings, given our market share gains and recent improvements we have made to our industry-leading portfolio. ","Moving on to our key metrics on Slide 10. Our most relevant operational metrics this quarter were quite positive. Total Services signing of $4.2 billion were up 15% year-over-year, with over $1 billion of signings in each of the 3 lines of business. For the year, we signed over $14 billion, flat year-over-year even with the 2 large Medicaid deals in the prior year compare. New business signings for the year were up 14%. ","Looking at the Document-related metrics, please keep in mind that these include the Technology segment, plus Document Outsourcing. Total color revenue was up 2%, both actual and constant currency. Digital machines in field continue to grow, was up 3% in total, 14% for color-capable devices. Lastly, digital pages were stable and down 3%, with pages from color devices up 9% both in Q4 and for the full year. All color segments showed strong install growth, and total installs for the company were up 8% in the quarter. This did not translate into equipment revenue growth, even [ph] price erosion and mix impacts, but this will feed annuity over time. ","Moving on to the cash flow slide. Cash from operations of almost $1.3 billion was in line with Q4 of 2010 for a full-year total of $2 billion. Earnings contributed $383 million. And consistent with normal seasonality, working capital during the quarter was a source of $696 million. For the year, working capital was essentially flat. ","Pension cash contributions in the quarter were $78 million and $426 million for the year, which is about $200 million higher than our 2010 funding. We expect a similar level of pension contributions in 2012 due to a very significant drop in the discount rate in spite of truly outstanding returns that we achieved in 2011 on our plan assets. ","CapEx of $134 million was in line with the annual trend, and we had limited M&A activity during the quarter. ","Let us turn to the next slide to quickly review the uses of our operating cash flow in 2011. So we generated $2 billion of cash from operations. CapEx came in as anticipated at $501 million full year. And the resulting free cash flow of $1.5 billion was used as follows: we paid down over $600 million in debt, and we have now repaid the debt we took on for the ACS acquisition. We ended the year with $8.6 billion of debt, of which $6 billion can be associated with the financing of Xerox equipment for our customers. The finance debt is calculated assuming a 7:1 leverage of our finance assets of $6.9 billion. ","We also had $265 million in dividend payments, and our current yield sits at approximately 2%. Our focus was to deploy our available cash primarily towards the share repurchase program. As mentioned earlier, we repurchased $700 million worth of shares at an average price of $7.97. We also continue to invest in tuck-in acquisitions, spending $212 million full year, primarily in Services. ","Let me now move to guidance for 2012. For revenue growth in 2012, we are guiding to 2%-plus at constant currency. We expect Services to grow mid to high single-digits with growth accelerating throughout the year and Technology to be flat to modestly lower, given a macro environment and our strategy to lead with our Managed Print Services offerings. ","We expect GAAP EPS in the range of $0.97 to $1.03 and adjusted EPS in the range of $1.12 to $1.18. The change in guidance from May of last year is driven by a pension expense increase of well over $100 million because of the significant decline in discount rates, negative currency dynamics and worsened economic outlook in Europe. ","Our earnings estimate would put us in a position to deliver strong cash flow between $2 billion and $2.3 billion. This is also lower than we were assuming back in May of 2011 due to 3 main factors: revised earnings as I just explained; pension funding in line with 2011. This is $200 million higher than previously assumed due to the historically low discount rate and restructuring payments of approximately $150 million instead of an earlier assumption of nominal payments. We took a $61 million restructuring charge in Q4 and anticipate taking a modest amount of additional restructuring in 2012. This will allow us to improve our operating leverage and offset some of the cost pressure in the environment. ","We expect operating cash flow to be negative in Q1, with higher pension contributions adding to the typical working capital seasonality. On CapEx, we're planning for investments of $500 million, which will result in free cash flow of between $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion. ","Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. In 2012, we expect to repurchase between $900 million and $1.1 billion worth of shares, skewed to the second half of the year, consistent with our cash generation seasonality. We are announcing today that our board increased the share repurchase authorization by $500 million, so it now stands at over $1.3 billion. ","We anticipate spending between $300 million and $400 million on acquisitions, with primary focus on expanding our Services offerings. And dividends are planned to be a use of around $300 million given current payout and number of shares outstanding. ","With that, I would turn it back to Ursula to wrap up.","Ursula M. Burns","Thanks, Luca. Let me quickly wrap up so that we can get to your questions. 2011 presented its share of challenges, and our performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year reflects our operational discipline in delivering strong bottom line results while scaling our Services business and maintaining our leadership in Document Technology. ","Signings continue to grow for our diverse services offerings. Installs are up for our industry-leading technology. Both of these areas contribute to a healthy annuity stream that serves us well for the long term. In the near term, we are planning for continued economic weakness. So we're being somewhat guarded with our expectations and remain focused on operational efficiency. ","For the first quarter, our expectations are for adjusted earnings of $0.21 to $0.24 per share, including $0.01 to $0.02 of restructuring. And as Luca noted, we expect full-year adjusted EPS of $1.12 to $1.18. ","Throughout 2012, our productivity initiatives will be balanced with making the necessary investments to expand our Services business and aggressively pursue growth opportunities in key markets around the world. And our business model will continue to yield strong cash flow. We're confident we have the right strategy, the competitive strength, the skilled leadership team and a disciplined focus on execution to build on our progress. ","With that, I thank you again for joining us today, and let's open it up to questions for Luca and me.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Barclays Capital.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Luca, given the lower cash flow estimates and the pension being $400 million-plus in terms of funding, do you plan to issue more equity like you did a quarter or 2 ago to fund the pension? And is that an option to you? And what would be the offsetting share count impact?","Luca Maestri","So Ben, yes. Pension contributions are going to be, in total, similar to what we've seen in 2011. So at this point, even though we have not made a final decision, we are planning to issue stock in a similar size of what we've done in 2011. Bear in mind that the contributions to the pension plan this year is going to be skewed towards the first half as opposed to the second half as we had last year.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Is there any benefit to issue equity and be buying back stock at the same time rather than just fund the pension with cash and then just buy back less stock? Is there a reason that -- to go through the motions of buying back stock while you're issuing equity?","Luca Maestri","The reason is the same that I talked about last year. It really gives us a bit more flexibility with our cash. It allows us to be more consistent in the market as we buy back the stock. And frankly, particularly because these contributions this year are so skewed towards the first half, we want to make sure that we retain appropriate cash balances throughout the year.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Can you just recap how many shares you issued in the last tranche? This is 16 million, right?","Luca Maestri","16.6 million shares.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right. So that -- when you say similar size, maybe you do it a few times like that.","Luca Maestri","We would be looking to do -- I'm talking about the absolute amount that we're talking about, right? I mean, last year, we did about 130 million. It's probably going to be a similar size. And obviously, the amount of shares is going to be depending on the share price on that day. But we're thinking of doing one single contribution in stock.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Then my follow-up issue is with regard to cash flow. So it sounds like you were at $2.6 billion, $2.9 billion in cash flow from ops. Now we're at $2 billion to $2.3 billion, so call it $600 million of a difference. You're going to issue some equity for pension, so it sounds like pensions may be $200 million of the lowered cash flow from the May. Can you talk about where the extra $400 million in lower cash flow is coming from now if I'm right on the pension?","Luca Maestri","You're right on the pension. And if you remember, when we were talking at the Investor Conference back in May, we gave guidance on earnings of $118 million to $128 million. So that's come down. So we got about $200 million in earnings there. And I think when you think about earnings, you need to think about currency, you need to think about the economic outlook for Europe. And also the pension expense itself is $100 million higher than we were expecting at the time. So we got about $200 million in earnings, $200 million in pensions. And restructuring, we're going to be doing a bit of restructuring. We talked about $150 million of restructuring in 2012, but we were expecting only nominal payments back in May. So that's the rough math, Ben.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So that gets us to the $600 million. And then with all that, my final question is, okay, we know about 2012 now. You just went through the bridge, really. Does 2013 have a snapback now if we have flattish cash flow this year slightly up? And then due to all these headwinds, where current rates are today and best we know, without giving earnings guidance or anything technically, do we have a snapback in cash flow next year or do similar factors keep it flattish next year?","Luca Maestri","The one thing that I can tell you right now, all else being equal, that pension is necessarily going to be a tailwind going into 2013 and '14 and '15. So we are at a point where you've got discount rates which are historical lows given the dynamics of our pension plans. We've now frozen future service and accruals, so we kind of capped the exposure there. We've had great a return on assets on the pension plan during 2011. So if discount rates do not come down further, then you could have certainly well over $100 million just from pension moving forward. And then of course, we're going to be trying to grow the business and all the other things that should bring additional earnings into the company.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research.","Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC","My first question is with regard to Europe. Ursula, can you give us a little more color on sort of linearity during the quarter, where you specifically saw some of the weakness? And have you seen any changes as we've entered 2012?","Ursula M. Burns","So on linearity, it's got worse as the quarter went on. If you recall last quarter, we spoke about Europe, and we were guarded because we still had positive results in Europe or good results in Europe where we knew -- we were suspecting that something would happen. It started to happen in the early parts of the quarter, and it definitely continued throughout the quarter. And I don't see any -- foresee any significant change in either direction in Europe. That's the way that we're planning. We're planning for continued weak activity in Europe. So linearity, yes, it got worse as the quarter went on. And it's all over Europe. Obviously, southern Europe, the Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece, et cetera, are worse than the rest of Europe, but we do see weakness even in the stronger countries where decisions are delayed and activity is a little bit lower, et cetera, et cetera. So we do see a significant change in Europe. Interestingly enough, balance that off against what's happening in Europe, in United States in developing markets, developing markets were strong throughout the year. It had up and down based on war here or war there but strong business throughout the year. In the U.S., as the year went on and we implemented changes and kind of rationalized, our coverage got better every quarter -- every month and every quarter. So we see a relatively strong, on the equipment side, U.S. business and a strong developing market business offset by weakness in Europe.","Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC","Okay, great. And can you talk a bit about the Services business just in terms of the contracts that you've signed, the 14%, I think, or 15% year-over-year increase in signings? Like what type of contracts are you signing? Where are you seeing the strength? And maybe talk a little bit about ITO as well.","Ursula M. Burns","Yes. So think about Services signings almost across-the-board. So we've signed in the public sector. We've signed transportation contracts with -- in Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, for example, which we announced earlier. We signed in a private sector with airlines, with banks. So we are seeing a broad range of signings primarily in the U.S., obviously, which is where most of our business is, but we also have signings in Latin America in developing markets and signings in Europe. As we spoke before, Europe is in the BPO business, and the ITO business is the smaller portion of our business, the smaller portion. And we did a change in strategy at the end of the third quarter, in the third quarter, to move an executive there to actually manage, stickhandle our European business, which is particularly important now because we're seeing some headwinds in Europe, not yet in the Services business but we want to make sure that we start up that business with the right cost base in mind. So across-the-board, signings everywhere, it's really good. ITO signings were unbelievably strong. We are managing ITO. The ITO business is one that clearly we're learning about as we go through more and more. ITO signing, as you know, we have some cancels from last quarter that are hitting us on the revenue side this quarter. We also have a business in the ITO that's a resale business, the equipment resale business, that while good, should not be our major focus and will not be our major focus on a go-forward basis that also puts some pressure on our revenue. So our purpose with ITO is twofold. One is to actually accompany the rest of the business that we have and make us felt more relevant in the rest of the business to Document Outsourcing and the BPO business. But in and of itself is to get around these things that you're now hearing, the vernacular sick [ph] verticals, where you're not just selling a bunch of technology, you're not just selling some software, you're actually trying to sell a solution around the vertical market. Healthcare is the most obvious one to talk about. It's one that we're spending the most time on. So ITO, what we're doing with ITO is repositioning it. Focusing on longer-term, more higher-value engagements with our clients, focusing on -- assuring that we renew. This is a problem that should not exist. Renewal should not be a problem for us, and it was in quarter 3 and would have been in quarter 4. So we're focusing on actually changing that and making sure that we actually have value with our clients and intimacy with our clients. ITO should be good.","Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC","Okay. And then my last question is just sort of more of a philosophical one. As you think about the fact that you're getting strong growth from services and good signings but it's clearly impacting the margin a little bit with the pressure that you're seeing in Europe, how do you sort of balance and think about the investment required on the services side versus the growth, given some of the macro trends that are out there?","Ursula M. Burns","It's a great question, by the way. And the way I would think about this ","  is to think both in the short- and the longer-term, right? So in the short term, we have to make sure that anything that we sign falls within a set of parameters that allow us to deliver it with high quality and not sink our financials, right? So we get lots of deals proposed. Some of them would not be good if we took them in the beginning. If we did a lot of California Medicaid, I said this over and over again, we would be having a significant and broader problem. By the way, the good news is to winning at least 1 or 2 or 3 Medicaids because they are big and foundational for our business. So what we do with signing is we look to make sure that we can operate them well, that we can actually stand them up, that we can deliver the revenue, the SLAs, the revenue and the profits that we want and have strong margins. That's in the short term. In the long term, we try to make sure that we have platforms that are repeatable, that lightens the load. We stay close to our customers that keeps our renewal rates high, and we continue to expand outside of the areas that we have today to continue to grow our services offerings. So the way that we think about services, it is an engine for growth. And if we and when we operate it well, it actually does fuel the growth that we're seeing today, 6% growth even with a very poor ITO revenue quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Murray.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","My first one, I guess, is on operating margin. There was an explicit operating margin guidance for 2012, and it feels kind of flattish, I guess, after we adjust for the share buyback. But I just wanted to confirm that and get your thoughts.","Luca Maestri","Yes, Ananda, to confirm, I think we're planning around operating margins to be flat to slightly up. As you go through the year, probably, they're going to be accelerating throughout the year because you're going to be seeing better growth as we go through 2012, but flat to slightly up.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And I guess just sort of follow-up to the Services comment you guys made. The BPO signings, I guess, just optically appear to be a bit light, particularly after last quarter. Were they in line with your expectations or were they, in fact, light? And if they were light with the strength in ITO signings, does that maybe push out some of the ramp to margin expansion as you move through this year and maybe even in the '13?","Ursula M. Burns","So Ananda, signings were a little -- BPO signings were a little bit light. But then, I mean, they were not significantly off, nothing to panic about. They were a little light. We had a huge signings quarter, as I said, up, and as Luca said, up 150%. And some huge number in ITO and Document Outsourcing remains a strong thing. I wouldn't -- I don't see any real issue with BPO signings. It's bumpy, it comes -- they come and they go, and we're focusing on them. So they should continue to come.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","Got it. And Ursula, would it tend to shift your thinking around the roadmap to operating margin expansion over the next year to 2 years given the mix of the Services signings?","Ursula M. Burns","I don't think so, but...","Luca Maestri","So if I understand the question correctly, Ananda, we -- as we look at operating margins, we know that in the short term, we've got a number of pressures. Pension is one, currency is another one and obviously some weakness in Europe. At the same time, we have a number of tailwinds, and obviously, we want to capitalize on those positive factors. We got the very strong signings that we bring in from 2011. We got a Technology portfolio which is market-leading. We've gained share in every geography of the world. And obviously, in share repurchases, we'll have a bit on earnings. And we will continue to do tuck-in acquisitions. So as we think about it longer term, longer than 2012, of course, it's our aspiration to continue to grow operating margins.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","Last one for me. Just regarding the comments about the restructuring that you'll be doing as we move through the year, can you give us some sense of how we should layer those into our quarters in terms of earnings just so we get the linearity of earnings appropriately set?","Luca Maestri","Well, let me give you the Q1. I think we said $0.01 to $0.02. They are part -- it's part of our guidance. We said $0.21 to $0.24. You should model $0.01 to $0.02 of restructuring. As we go through the year, we'll see how much we're going to be doing. It really depends on the environment and many other factors.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","Could it top out at $0.02 or should we almost certainly expect something beyond that as we move through the year?","Luca Maestri","It may round up.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Luca, I wanted to ask just on the -- for the guidance. For the sale of the IP that happened in Q4, did that get recognized in Q4 or is that more coming in calendar year '12? So that will be -- is that included in the guidance as well?","Luca Maestri","Yes, it's included in the guidance, Keith, and we've got it well laid out in the MD&A. The majority of the sale was recognized in Q4. I think the profit impact was about $16 million. But then we've got smaller amounts in '12 and '13 because of the way we set up the arrangement.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. So could I say that the amount in '12 and '13 is relatively -- I mean, it's not material to the guidance?","Luca Maestri","Yes, again, in the MD&A, it's $12 million and $8 million, respectively, to the guidance.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. Then let's go to -- well, let's go to -- then to -- in the EPS forecast. Could you give us your underlying assumption for operating tax rates, please?","Luca Maestri","Yes. We are guiding at 29%.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. You've been consistently coming in below that. Okay. Well, we'll go with 29% then. Then on -- perhaps this is for you, Ursula, if I could. The operating margins, just confidence that, that works its way through. I think it's understandable that as you ramp new contracts, it's a bit tougher for the new contract versus the maturing contracts. But just confidence that you're going to be able to manage that margin sequence, particularly in ITO where those renewals, I think, has been a bit tougher than you anticipated.","Ursula M. Burns","So, I mean, it is the operative question and the place that we spend a significant amount of our focus, Keith. We are confident. I mean, we're confident, as confident as you can be before you do it. We have mapped it, we know the customers in ITO. It's all around renewals here, right? Because the signings are coming, we know the ramps, we don't have any really egregious contracts, large contracts that are outside of California, in which we already are comprehending for sure, that will take up a significant amount of investment before we get revenue so that we have a normal kind of layout of contracts. And so our focus is going to be on renewals. Our renewal rate overall is a little bit lighter than normal. BPO is a little bit lighter, but fine, Document Outsourcing not really that relevant. The big place that we have to spend a lot of our attention is in ITO, and we are doing that. So we're getting the business, and now we're managing the customers to assure that we stay intimate with them. And if there is a nonrenewal, it's because the customer no longer needs the service versus they are not pleased with our service delivery.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. Yes, you just hit my -- my follow-up on that one would be, to say it a different way, you're not losing those ITO renewals on price? It's just the customers, say, insourcing?","Ursula M. Burns","Yes. Price is generally not the issue here. There are 2 -- there are 3 reasons why you can move. Obviously, one is that the customer doesn't need the service anymore, they in-source or their contract is just done. The second one is price, meaning -- or some other competitive type thing, price or terms of conditions, which will end up in price. And the third is the outright loss. I mean, you compete with somebody and they say, \"I like Joe better than Peter. And I like Xerox better than someone else.\" The place that we have to make sure we continue to focus, price is not going to be our issue. We will manage price. If we want to win it, we will win it. If it looks good in the long term, that's not the issue. It's all around assuring that we continue an even level of contact and service with the clients and making sure that they understand that we are in their camp. It's basic customer care. We will -- we are -- we've taken a really big focus on this in the ITO business, and we'll continue to do that, which will drive up the business. Clearly, price has something to do with everything, Keith, everything.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, fair enough. I'm going to ask one more philosophical question, particularly for you, Ursula. If I look at your layout on Page 13 -- Slide 13, excuse me, about 25% of your available cash for 2012 is targeted to acquisitions, with the balance towards share repurchase. And I just wanted to know, kind of an IBM type of question. Is that how you think about the model over the next number of years? Or is there any kind of comments or color you could give that we should be thinking longer term?","Ursula M. Burns","Yes, I think the way that we should think of it, for '12, clearly, the plan, as laid out in Slide 13, and the philosophy, pretty much the same as happened in '11. The way that you should think about '13 and beyond is along the same bucket. So clearly, we are going to use our available cash to buy back shares, think about the dividend, so that type of shareholder return, acquisitions and dividend. But the mix may change, depends on a lot on the price of the shares, what's available in the marketplace. Right now, we're using a disproportionate amount of our cash towards share repurchase, and it'll -- it may change. But it will not be so far different. So we'll not walk away from share repurchases, still a very valuable tool for us and very lucrative for the shareholders. So we'll continue to do that. And the whole question is around the edges, [indiscernible] one way or the other.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. Okay. Well, I'd encourage you to think about mix more.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Richard Gardner with Citigroup.","Richard Gardner - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I wanted to, I guess, not to beat a dead horse but go back to the Services margin decline a little bit more and maybe try to ask the question differently. You've always said that 5% to 10% was sort of the right -- well, I think it's fair to say that you said 5% to 10% was the right growth rate to think about for the Services business, and yet the margins are coming in a little lower year-over-year. So I just wanted to see if you could help us parse out how much of that is new contract ramps, how much is contract run-off and how much is price pressure. And then I have a follow-up.","Luca Maestri","I'll give it a try, Richard. We have been -- when you think about the dynamics of gross margins, clearly, they came in on the Services side slightly below what we were expecting. And I think the issue has been around the combination of contract ramps, which were pretty much included in our projections, and renewal rates, which were below the historical ranges. So we've always talked about renewing at about 85%, ideally, aspiration into 90%. Our renewal rates have come in, in the low 80s for the year. So that's where you really see that level of gross margin compression that we want to avoid going forward.","Richard Gardner - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And in light of that, Luca and Ursula, could you talk about the right way to think about operating margins for Services for this year and, I don't know, maybe even philosophically for 2013?","Luca Maestri","I would say, for 2012, we -- probably during the first half, we're going to be seeing a continuation of what you're seeing during 2011. But we believe that we're going to be improving margins in the second half because there's going to be an acceleration also in the revenue growth for Services. And then as we go into 2013, of course, again, our aspiration is to grow margins all the time. But we need to recognize that if growth accelerates and we end up winning very large deals like we've done in the past, for example, with California, this is something that in the short term, because they're so sizable, will have an impact on margins. But as you look longer term, they become profitable contracts, and they expand our position in the marketplace.","Richard Gardner - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then one other question for me, and that is, was there any meaningful benefits from Japan expedite expenses going away in the fourth quarter? I think that had been a meaningful drag for you earlier in the year. Could you talk about whether that was a benefit in Q4 and whether there's any residue left there or we're back to 0?","Luca Maestri","We've had very minor expenses related to the disruption in Japan in Q4. It wasn't a big issue. So quarter-on-quarter was obviously a slight positive. I like to step back for a second and talk about operating margins for Technology for the year. We were up in Technology 60 basis points in operating margins in spite of all the disaster from Japan, in spite of currency. I mean, the yen is more than 30% higher against the dollar over the last 3 years, in spite of the weakness in Europe. So I think if you step back and you look at our performance in Technology in terms of preserving margins, I think it's been admirable.","Richard Gardner - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, great. If I can sneak one more in, Ursula, have you seen any movements on supplies pricing in the marketplace? We've heard from some contacts out there that there are general price increases going through on the supply side here in January and February, and I'm wondering if you're seeing that and whether you think that, that could potentially benefit Xerox here in Q1.","Ursula M. Burns","Through to Q4, just earnings period, we didn't see any. And we've heard the same things that you've heard. And we'll look around and see how we're positioned competitively. And if we have space, we'll take it. If we're positioned in a place that allows us to take price up, we'll do that. We want to stay competitive to the marketplace, we want to make sure that we continue to gain share. And so we'll look at the marketplace out there. And if we can fit it in, we'll do it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.","Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So I have a question on the Services division as well. Specifically, drilling down on some of the challenges you're having with renewals, can you help us understand exactly how you address those challenges, particularly this year? And from your prior experience, how much control do you really feel you have over this dynamic? And I guess, really, what we're trying -- what I'm trying to get to is, can you give us some assurance that this isn't a sign of an emerging problem with competitive positioning or anything?","Luca Maestri","So we have -- Bill, we got a long history around renewing contracts and particularly ACS, but also on the Document Outsourcing side. And we've always been in a range of 80% to 90%. And clearly, our target is to be 85% to 90%. What we've seen during 2011 has been a specific issue around renewal rates exclusively in our ITO business. And it's been related to 3 or 4 meaningful contracts. It hasn't been a widespread loss on renewals. It's been specific -- 3 or 4 specific situations, different reasons. At the same time, we have signed up significantly more than what we've lost. So the net-net of the 2 things, the growth in signings versus the loss of renewal is clearly a positive that we'll translate into revenue growth, we believe, starting from the second half of 2012. So there isn't anything systemic that we're concerned about. And I would say that having grown signings by 15% year-over-year actually tells us that we are quite competitive in the marketplace. If you exclude the California and Texas contracts that we signed in 2010, mega deals, very specific events, actually, our signings are up 40%. So we feel very, very good where we are in the marketplace. We've had specific circumstances in ITO. It's about customer engagement, and that's what we need to work on.","Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, that makes sense. And then a final question, I know we're getting towards the end here. On cash flow, if there are any further downward surprises, whether it's macro or whatever it may be, or mix, at what point, just trying to gauge the risk here, what point do you have to be more constrained with your cash usage in terms of the share repurchase plans in particular? Is there a line in the sand that you're looking at where you'd have to step back a bit or where it would make sense to step back a bit? Or do you feel fairly comfortable at this point that you've really factored in all the risk to this cash flow outlook?","Luca Maestri","Just to be practical, and we've included this in our, of course, in our earnings range, we will be doing most of our repurchase activity during the second half of the year. So we're going to have much better visibility. If something happens, any collapse somewhere else around the world, we would be dealing with it. We don't need to make a decision right now. We feel, at this point, given all the puts and takes, we feel very confident that we can deliver on this capital allocation strategy. Of course, at any point in time, we can revisit. It's very difficult for us to get ahead of ourselves because most of the activity will happen towards the end of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.","Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Two questions, if I could. I want to get a sense, if you can kind of give us some context, you've been kind of a perennial cost container or restructuring type company and very diligent in that process. But are we getting close here to starting to cut into too much muscle with this next round of restructuring and probably more restructuring down the road if the macro worsens?","Luca Maestri","I can assure you that we got plenty of opportunities, plenty of opportunities in our product costs. We have really a gold mine there in terms of removing complexity, reminding [ph] the portfolio, rationalizing components. And again, we have a significant infrastructure. It's a legacy infrastructure. We're not near the end. I mean, we'll continue every day that we come to the office to look for efficiency in our operations. If we can get revenue growth, that efficiency will go into the revenue growth. If we cannot get revenue growth, that efficiency will go towards cost reductions.","Ursula M. Burns","And this muscle or things like research, our selling resources, our customer engagement, that's muscle. And I think what Luca is saying that while everything is needed -- a lot of things are needed to run the company. There are certain things that are really hard to rebuild if you take them away. We are not focusing on those areas. Those areas, for as long as we've done restructuring, that, to the 2000 time, have been protected and exalted because we know it's difficult to get them back. But we have a lot of cost in this company. And as the world changes, we're going to have to actually morph the cost to actually be more appropriate to where growth is coming or just remove it from the company. And that's the path that we're on.","Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Then my second question is around cash flow. Clearly, it's been a hot topic for investors over the past year, and I kind of share Keith Bachman's sentiment here. I'm trying to figure out if your cash usage is being applied appropriately here. And what I mean by that is we've been hearing now for almost 2 years about all these signings, and eventually, we're going to get the revenue and thereby the cash flow. But I hear more about BAND-AIDs and I do really about return on the cash flow here. And I'm just wondering if you need to maybe jump-start the acquisition machine to really get that cash flow and the return on the cash flow work in the right direction over the next 12 to 24 months.","Luca Maestri","I don't know where to start. I think we are making the investments that we believe are appropriate. We're looking at acquisitions in a very disciplined manner. ACS has done it consistently. We keep doing it even now. And so we look at attractive returns on our acquisition investments. And so we're going to be looking at the opportunities. We bought 16 companies during the course of 2011. It is very important for us that our cash flows are sustainable for the long term. And so sometimes we get asked why our cash flow has come down a bit versus past expectations. And one of the reasons is because we put a lot of investments into the business, and sometimes they don't come through acquisitions. Sometimes they come through a new large contract, like California, for example. So maybe there's been a bit of a shift between investing acquisitions versus investing in the organic business. But again, I think we look at it from a return on capital perspective, and that's the way we actually assess our investment.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.","Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I wanted to ask about the sustainability of Technology margins. Specifically, I'm interested on what you're seeing from a pricing standpoint on equipment. It sounds like you've turned a bit more aggressive on equipment to drive some unit placements. How does that flow through to margins over the next couple of quarters, number one? And number two, is it fair to say that you have gotten more aggressive in order to drive those unit placements?","Ursula M. Burns","I think that you can look at the unit placements from 2 different perspectives. Price, we're still in the range of 5% to 10%, price erosion on a year-to-year basis, maybe a little bit higher this quarter, at the higher end of the range than in the past but not anything outside of that range. Big driver here is mix. Mix is -- mix in all of the categories, entry, mid and high. If you look at the product sets that we've been very successful on and the products that we've launched, these 27 products, they're skewed towards the lower end of the mix range, the price range. So we get lots of activity, we'll get good post sale, but the revenue doesn't necessarily map to it in the short term because the prices are lower. I think that the margins for the Technology business, connecting it to the previous conversation that we just had, the previous question, are -- I mean, we're in a range where they are sustainable, they take work, take work to get there. This is where we manage cost and expense continuously, simplification, et cetera, et cetera. But I do believe that they are sustainable, and I think that we're showing good results from that.","Luca Maestri","Yes. Just to add to that. So as we get into 2012, I just said 2011 was very good for margins in the Technology business. We actually expanded margins despite of all the pressures. We continue to have currency issues, and we continue to have pension expense issues for 2012. And so that will put some pressure on Technology margins, and that is the reason why we're talking about efficiencies and we're talking about restructuring and we keep managing it. But I would say, net-net, when you look at Technology, we are industry leader, gaining market share, expanding margins. I would say that it's a testament to the quality of our products.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Deepak Sitaraman with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Deepak Sitaraman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First, just a clarification, if I could. I just want to confirm that your revenue guidance for the year does include the impact of acquisitions, which I expect would probably add a couple of points of growth in itself.","Luca Maestri","That includes acquisitions, Deepak.","Deepak Sitaraman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then, Luca, if I can just follow up on Europe. Can you remind us of your revenue exposure to Europe in the Technology segment? And x Europe, can you give us a sense of growth in the Technology segment in the fourth quarter? And maybe just talk us through your expectations for the year, both for Europe versus x Europe.","Luca Maestri","So Europe in total is about -- we're exposed about 20% of our revenue base. In Technology, just to give you a sense, Deepak, equipment revenue for the company was down 2% in Q4. It would have been up 2%, excluding Europe. So both the U.S. and DMO were solid in Q4, and we definitely saw the weakness in Europe.","Deepak Sitaraman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's really helpful. And then maybe lastly for Ursula, in the Technology segment, can you give us an update on where you are in terms of just expanding distribution, particularly to reach SMB-type customers? And any metrics that you can share around contribution to the overall Tech segment revenue and perhaps growth that you saw in your SMB revenue last year would be very helpful.","Ursula M. Burns","Yes, expanding distribution is just something that has been very successful for us. I think it's showing up, by the way, in the U.S. revenue dynamics and the activity dynamics that we just talked through. The performance of the Tech business, without Europe, would have been up, which is a change for us, which [ph] has been on and off. We have, I think, a solid footing now, primarily focused on the products and the expansion of distribution. So it's worked out fairly well. We have everything that comes available that is good for us to tuck in, we tuck in. My -- I don't think I've said this publicly before, but after a while, you ran out of things to buy. I don't know if we're quite there, but we may be getting there in the Tech side. So a lot more of our acquisitions will be focused on Services as we go forward. We'll pick up the odd SMB distribution capacity in United States. So good news across-the-board, I think that we've done as much as we can do with a little bit around the edges to expand it, and we'll be focusing on Services in a go-forward basis. ","So all of you, thank you very much for your time and for your interest, and have a good first quarter.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com\/investor.","At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and\/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without express permission of Xerox. [Operator Instructions]","During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which, by their nature, address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein.","At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns, you may begin.","Ursula M. Burns","Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. During the first quarter, we delivered results in our Services business that align with our growth strategy and our expectations. However, we fell short in our Document Technology business, which put pressure on our overall results. We'll talk today about the consistent trends that we see in our business, with Services becoming a larger part of our total revenue, now at 55% and fueling our annuity base, which is now 86% of total revenue. And we'll discuss the consistent trends that we're seeing in the marketplace, which require fast implementation of business model changes. We remain focused on earnings expansion and generating strong cash flow, and we remain committed to our full year expectations on both.","And here is a closer look at Q1 results. We reported adjusted EPS of $0.27. This includes a $0.02 benefit from the reduction of a litigation reserve. As a result, earnings were above our guidance. In Services, we delivered 4% revenue growth, along with a stable segment margin and a 64% increase in the TCV of signings to $3.7 billion. Again, the results in our Services business were as expected for the first quarter, with signings coming in better than expectations and margins slightly lower. We're making steady progress on managing the cost base to improve the profitability of the Services business as we continue to ramp for growth -- for more growth.","In Document Technology, revenue was down 9% and segment margin declined 1.7 points. Q1 performance was weaker than expected due to timing issues with our recent ConnectKey launch of mid-range products, as well as continued tough market conditions. I'll provide more detail in a moment but want to assure you that we understand the issues and are taking immediate actions to address them, including plans to reinvest our earnings upside in Q1 to accelerate restructuring activities in Q2.","During Q1, we used $87 million in operating cash. That's in line with normal seasonality and reflects a temporary increase in inventory. On the next slide, we'll take a closer look at the income statement.","Total revenue of $5.4 billion was down 3%, reflecting growth in Services and weaker-than-expected revenue in Document Technology. Based on our product backlog and steady growth in Services, I am confident top line results will improve throughout the year.","During Q1, lower revenue put pressure on margin. As a result, operating margin of 7.4% was down 1.1 points from last year. And here's what contributed to the margin decline in the quarter. First, as with any major product launch, we made investment -- incremental SAG investments in Q1 to support the ConnectKey announcement, invested in sales training, channel outreach and marketing. We planned for the initial revenue benefit from the launch to offset the incremental costs. But the revenue ramp got off to a slower start, and total Q1 Document Technology revenue declined more than our expectations. So the revenue shortfall resulted in SAG at a higher percent of revenue. Some of this will self correct as revenue picks up both for ConnectKey and in our production color business. But as I mentioned, we'll implement a higher level of cost actions in Q2.","Second, Services is a larger part of our total revenue. As a result, margin is impacted by higher growth in lower-margin businesses such as IT Outsourcing and Transactional BPO. In Q1, our adjusted Other was $12 million. That's down $67 million due to the litigation reserve reduction and lower restructuring.","Equity income of $47 million grew $7 million, driven by profit growth of -- at Fuji Xerox, and the adjusted tax rate was 22%. This includes a benefit from the Taxpayer Relief Act. Adjusted EPS of $0.27 was $0.04 higher than 2012.","I remain confident that we'll deliver solid earnings growth in 2013, benefiting from our cost actions, share repurchase, portfolio expansion and Services growth.","On Slide 6, we'll review our Services segment. The 4% revenue increase in Services reflects steady growth in BPO, which was up 3%; ITO, which was up 13%; and Document Outsourcing, up 1%. And here's a closer look at each of these areas.","Business Process Outsourcing represents more than 60% of our total Services revenue. We are benefiting from strong growth in transactional processing and state government services. This was partially offset by volume declines in other areas. We're quite pleased with the organic growth in BPO and had less contribution from acquisitions in this space. Keep in mind that in Q1 of last year, BPO increased 13%, giving us a tough year-over-year compare.","I'm also pleased with the solid performance in IT Outsourcing. It's the benefit of megadeals that we signed in 2011. In Document Outsourcing, growth was lower in the quarter, a slower start to the year than we expected. But signings for new Managed Print Services and renewals were quite strong and will flow through to improve revenue later in the year.","As a matter of fact, total signings were our good story across the board. They were up 64% year-over-year. Renewals were particularly strong as well this quarter. The renewal potential and the high success rate is reflected in our 89% win rate. New business annual recurring revenue was up 8% year-over-year. The pipeline is up 5%, a steady growth even with strong signings. Segment margins of 9.3% was flat. We offset negative mix and pricing with cost reductions.","In quarter 2, we have a tough compare from last year's 10.6% margin, but we'll continue to press for efficiency while never compromising on client satisfaction. So we expect Q2 segment margin around 10%, reflecting strength in BPO and ITO and a lower margin from Document Outsourcing. And for the full year, we continue to expect to be in the 10% to 12% range, with modest year-over-year improvement.","So Services in summary, revenue metrics trending well and margin holding ground, delivering solid performance as expected.","I'll turn to Slide 7 for a review of our Document Technology business. In Document Technology, we expected a revenue decline of mid-single digits. During Q1, revenue came in lower at a 9% decline, driven by a 12% decline in equipment sales. In reviewing the results, here's where we saw the shortfall in revenue, which created pressure on segment margin, and here's why we're confident that the results will improve going forward.  First, lower-than-expected performance from Europe and some spot weakness in developing markets resulted in lower post-sale revenue. We continue to have our eyes wide open to the macro trends. That's why we're scaling investments in higher growth areas, not only in outsourcing services but also in color printing and expanding distribution to small and mid-sized businesses.","Install rates are good indicators of our progress in these areas. A4 color MFDs, up 16%; and high-end color, up 44%. Second, in February, we announced ConnectKey. It's a software system embedded in 16 new Xerox multifunction printers, some of which began shipping in Q1 and many that are shipping now in Q2. This is a significant launch for our mid-range business. As I said, the install ramp started a bit later than expected. It has since picked up, and we now have a healthy backlog that will serve us well during the year.","For the balance of 2013, here's what will contribute to revenue improvement: a full launch of ConnectKey; new high-end color systems, including advanced iGen presses and the addition of Impika inkjet printers; and expanded coverage of SMB through our global imaging distributors and through additional indirect channel partners. These are all profitable growth drivers to help offset uncertainty related to macro conditions.","Again, focusing on the cost base continues to be a priority. We're making progress in taking costs out of a legacy infrastructure, but we need to accelerate this progress especially in Europe. Considering our expectations for improving equipment revenue and the competitive price environment, Q2 segment margin will be somewhat lower year-over-year, but sequential improvements from Q1.","Slide 8 is a look at cash flow in the quarter. Cash from operations in Q1 is in line with seasonality. The $87 million use of cash is a bit weaker than in 2012, but that's largely due to a temporary increase in inventory. Accounts receivable was less of a cash use in the quarter due to lower reliance on factoring in Q4. In line with our expectations, finance receivables was less of a source of cash.","Also, as anticipated, cash contributions to our global pension plan was lower year-over-year by $34 million, and this reflects our expected full year decline of $150 million.","Moving down to investing. We spent $107 million on CapEx and $58 million on dividends. And as we announced in February, our quarterly dividend will increase by 35%, effective with dividends payable in April. Cash from financing was a much smaller source of cash. And last year, we went to market in Q1 to pre-fund a May note. This year, we have a smaller note coming due in May of $400 million. We plan to retire this note in line with our debt reduction guidance. And as a result, debt of $8.5 billion was lower year-over-year by $1.1 billion and flat to year end. And $4.9 billion of our debt is associated with our financing business.","We did a nominal amount of share repurchase in Q1, driven by our cash flow timing. We continue to plan on repurchasing at least $400 million in shares this year weighted towards the second half, in line with cash flow. And we continue to expect $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion in cash with no change to capital allocation plans.","So let's turn to Slide 9 for a wrap up and then we'll take your questions. So in summary, I call our performance mixed in the quarter. Again, I am pleased with Services, and we're seeing improving trends, especially in reducing the cost base, delivering stable segment margins and growing signings. These results are strategically important to the transformation of our company. But I'm disappointed in the slow start to the year in the Document Technology business.","I also believe that we understand the issues in our control and that we are taking the right actions to make progress from here. Our product innovation brings differentiated value, investing in areas of growth like in Services, high-end color and in SMB distribution. And we're divesting in lower growth, non-core areas like our North American paper business.  Our pricing is competitive, and we continue to take cost actions to maximize profit. Across our entire business, we'll continue to rationalize our portfolio and restructure our cost base to create a leaner and more flexible business model.","So for the full year, we expect total revenue to come in at the low end of our flat to 2% range. Our full year guidance for earnings, for cash flow and capital allocations remain unchanged. For the second quarter, we expect adjusted EPS of $0.23 to $0.25. Again, we plan to increase restructuring activities in Q2. Approximately $0.02 of restructuring is comprehended in our second quarter guidance.","Expected first half results will keep us on track to meet our full year guidance of adjusted EPS of $1.09 to $1.15. With improving margins, cost controls and steady growth, we'll consistently expand earnings and generate strong cash. We'll continue to take a balanced approach to our capital allocation, which creates value for our shareholders.","That's a good place for me to end. Before we open it up to questions, let me turn it over to Jim Lesko, Head of Investor Relations. Jim?","James H. Lesko","Thanks, Ursula. Joining Ursula today is Lynn Blodgett, Head of Xerox Services; and Armando Zagalo de Lima, Head of our Document Technology business. Also, let me point out that we have several supplemental slides at the end of our deck. They provide more financial detail to support today's presentation and complement our prepared remarks.","[Operator Instructions] At the end of our Q&A session, I'll turn it back to Ursula for closing comments.","Operator, please open the line for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research.","Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC","This is a question for Ursula and Lynn. I'm not sure who wants to take it. But looking at the Services business, you'd anticipated some improvement, and it was obviously flat year-over-year. You're accelerating restructuring throughout the business, I believe. So how do we sort of think about what's going on, underlying in the Services business? And how do we think about the growth that you have in terms of signings if that might impact your ability to see substantial -- or some improvement in margin as we go through the year, just if you guys can sort of take that and better frame what you're seeing in Services right now?","Ursula M. Burns","Thank you, Shannon. I'll take it and maybe turn it over to Lynn in a little while if I don't get to all of the points. First of all, we're very pleased with the performance of Services in the first quarter. Our signings -- our revenue growth at 4% was as expected, without a big contribution from inorganic -- from acquisitions. Our margins were essentially in line with what we expected. We expected a little bit of improvement, maybe 10 basis points or so, but we came in strong. And our signings, renewal rate, new business rate were all very, very, very strong. The predictions that we have for second quarter, the outlook that we have for second quarter is continued expansion in margin on a sequential basis. We have a tough compare in quarter 2, so it will be down a little year-over-year in quarter 2. Sequential expansion and then throughout the year continued expansion. We expect to end the year in the 10% to 12% range, up a little bit on a year-over-year basis. So I think that if you look at our -- the underlying of our business, the cost actions that we're taking, the management focus that we have on good mix of business and new business and the look for continued acquisitions, you should be fairly confident in how we'll -- how the Services business will play out in 2013.","Lynn R. Blodgett","The other thing, Shannon, I think, is that in our cost restructuring that we talked about last quarter, we saw the flow-through of that. It was north of $30 million. We did have the runoff of our -- we've started to see the runoff of our student loan business, which is very high margin. It's a very mature contract. And so that had an impact, but our cost restructuring of the fourth quarter offset the discounts that we have expected and the runoff. The other thing that we're doing to -- that gives us confidence about the ongoing margins and our ability to grow them is that we have a -- our restructuring and our basic shift of our cost model is -- we're just kind of getting underway with that. And we saw -- we did some things in the fourth quarter. We have a program now called Project Compete, that is our effort to move work -- more work to low-cost domestic locations and to low-cost offshore locations. And that's underway, and it's going to run through right now clear through '14 and probably beyond that. So we still have an awful lot of high-cost labor in our model, and we're working to reduce that. And I think that's our -- probably the main thing that gives me the confidence that we can increase margins.","Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC","Great. And then my second question is just -- Ursula, can you talk about what you're seeing from an economic standpoint, both perhaps in the enterprise, as well as SMB and geographically? Because we've heard from obviously several companies so far, and it's clearly not a robust market environment out there. But I'm curious as to what you're seeing in your verticals and just whatever you can provide to us.","Ursula M. Burns","Macro and fiscal uncertainty definitely continued in Q1. We saw that in our Document Technology business primarily. From a geographic perspective, Europe remains weak. And in the first quarter, it had its -- some shocks that weakened it even further. And we did see a slowdown, a bit of slowdown in some developing market economies. We're hoping that, that doesn't stay for a long time. But our business model is fairly resilient in the developing market, which is good. We have a very flexible cost base there, so we can actually adjust our infrastructure cost to whatever revenue comes in. U.S. remains stable but weak. I mean, we have not seen a pickup in the U.S. Sequestration didn't hurt us a whole lot. It didn't help us. It made decision-making -- it continued to keep decision-making slow. So what I would say is overall, we have a status quo weak environment around the globe with -- whenever there's a little bit of a shock, we see a little bit of a shock in people's outlooks. But nothing too significantly worse than we saw in the first -- in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Barclays.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Wanted to -- I wanted to ask about technology. One of the -- I wanted to hash out the end. You probably get a profit benefit that's either coming, or you saw a little bit, but then it also -- the last time this happened, I don't know, 12, 13 years ago where the yen weakened quite a bit, Canon cut price quite a bit and took a lot of share. And I was wondering if that has started and what you think the pricing environment will be throughout the year, given the weak yen?","Ursula M. Burns","Yes. Let me start with the yen and the impact on our business and then I'll go into pricing a little bit. So the yen weakening overall is a positive for us. But as you know, we actually have 2 hedges there. We -- one, we have currency sharing with Fuji Xerox, and second is that we hedge the yen on a forward basis. We did -- we were fairly aggressive in hedging in the fourth quarter, in the second half of 2012 as we saw the yen continuing to weak. So we don't benefit as much from the yen weakening immediately as other -- as the yen would -- as you would expect from the yen, because we do have these 2 mechanisms to help offset those major moves. The benefit in the first half was less than -- was kind of nominal. It'll be more in the second half. It'll be probably -- total around $50 million in the year, back end loaded for us if the yen stays where it was at the end of the year. As it weakens further, obviously, more benefit. We'll continue to hedge in the currency share. So as far as pricing goes, we have seen a little bit of a move up in pricing aggressiveness. So we generally are, and have been over time, in this 5% to 10% range. This is primarily in Document Technology, obviously, and primarily on recruitment because the post-sale contracts are locked in for longer periods of time. And we are seeing activity at the higher end of this 5% to 10% range. And we are being aggressive. I mean, so -- especially as we launch ConnectKey, which gives us a set of offers that allows us to be aggressive in the marketplace, a new set of offerings. We're matching price as we have to, to win back share that we lost when we didn't have the products in the second half of 2012. So pricing at the higher end of the 5% to 10% range, and we're being aggressive to make sure that we stay competitive.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then could you just elaborate a little more on the government in particular? What -- I mean, in the last question, you mentioned some of it, but what is the latest in terms of government as a percent of sales? And what -- and the difference that you're seeing in Services, in particular, between state and local and federal and how it impacts your business? And in particular, if you could touch on whether you expect things to get better this quarter in that vertical, maybe if -- somehow?","Ursula M. Burns","Yes. So we are not heavily exposed to the federal government. We have a small portion of our revenue, 5% or so, in federal government. More heavily concentrated in state government, 20% -- 15%, 20% in state government. What we've seen -- and so I'm speaking about state government here, not too much about federal government because it's kind of de minimis for us, as I've said. State government, we are seeing some good news, particularly in health care. We have a strong position, as you know, in MMIS around the United States, and California is our big contract. New Hampshire just went live. We're doing well there. Decision-making -- so health care is a big segment for us. We do well there, and our profitability is improving in that segment actually very, very well. So I'm very -- I'm bullish about health care -- government health care services. What we are seeing though, is that any new decisions -- any decision in the government takes a little bit longer. A lot more discussions, a lot more engagement, a lot more senior-level engagement with state officials and by us. So myself, Lynn, our CFO, are engaged in these kinds of discussions with state officials. The good news is that they do eventually come and we win our fair share. So slow reaction time, slow decision-making progress, but our concentration is good. And we are -- our major concentration is in health care. We also have a transportation business that's clearly government-based as well, and we do well there. So I don't know if Lynn wants to say anything else.","Lynn R. Blodgett","I just -- I was going to add the comment about transportation, that we saw good signings, and we manage it separately. But as Ursula said, it's part of our -- most of them are government entities. So we saw good signings there and just agree with what Ursula said.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Two if I could. Did I hear correctly that the technology operating margins are expected to be sort of in the 10% to 10.5% range for the June quarter? I just wanted to get a clarification on that.","Ursula M. Burns","Yes. You heard that correctly. As you know, last year, for the full year, our operating margins were north of 11%. And we -- which is above the range that we have. And we guided to somewhere around 10% to 11% margins for the second quarter -- operating margins for the second quarter. So expansion over the first quarter, pretty significant, below last year and in line with what we would expect.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Got it. So it sounds like overall, operating margins are expected to be right back on track once we get to the second -- during the June quarter? They should be back on track there?","Ursula M. Burns","Yes. Yes.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","And then I guess my follow-up is will you guys -- the strength in signings for the March quarter, I mean, for the March quarter, how is that relative to your expectations? And what's best for us to think about with regards to how timing of those signings, turning in -- sort of converting into revenue? And does it change your, I guess, your revenue run rate in any particular way?","Lynn R. Blodgett","Well, I think that -- first of all, the -- part of the good news of not having a lot of megadeals is that smaller deals are easier to ramp. And so we expect to see impact from the signings probably a little quicker than if we'd -- we've said many times, if we sign a big Medicaid deal, they take a long time to ramp, and these deals are typically -- that we've signed in the last quarter are a little bit smaller. So we do expect to see the flow-through on that. It's going to be -- still take some time. So that's why we're predicting that our revenue growth will pick up more in the second half than in the second quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I have 2 also, the first is on Services and the second is on Technology. The first on Services, I'd like for you to address, if I could, Ursula, I think your characterization of the Services performance was generous. The signings were great, particularly in BPO, but the margins and revenue continue a string of disappointments. It wasn't communicated to investors that margins would be flat in the first quarter. Margins would improve, and yet, once again, they came in flattish even with the help of restructuring. You are guiding the margins of, I think, 10% in the June quarter. That's down on a year-over-year basis, but a tough comp. Your guidance for the year is 10% to 12%, but I think at the low end is, I think, how you'd characterize it. What are the consequences for continuing a -- to having a year of -- if, in fact, you've -- the margins fall short on Services, what are the consequences of another year of disappointment on margins?","Ursula M. Burns","So Keith, we expect that we'll have margin improvement throughout the year. We'll fall in the 10% -- the 10% to 12% range and have margin improvement on a year-over-year basis in 2013. I -- my characterization was just a characterization. I don't know generous or not. I think that we came in where we expected in revenue. We came in ahead of where we expected in signings, in renewal rate. And in mix of business, we were fairly solid. As far as margins for the quarter, what we ended up producing, which was flat on a year-over-year basis, was slightly lower than we expected, driven primarily by the fact that we actually had great signings and had some compensation payouts that we had to make for those great signings. But I think that if you look at the business on a go-forward basis, looked at signings with the new business rate that we have, with the renewal rate that we have, et cetera, et cetera, that as the year continues, we'll meet expectations that we laid out. We also did a fair amount of restructuring, as Lynn said. That restructuring did come to the bottom line and allowed us to actually deliver the flat margins. I think that we were fairly well contained in Services in this first quarter, and we will be for the rest of the year as well.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","All right. Well, before I ask my second question, I just want to stress, Ursula, I think clearing 10% this year in Services margin is incredibly important for the trajectory of the stock, and another year of disappointments will be just that.","Ursula M. Burns","We would agree with you on that. We expect to be in the range of 10% to 12%, and that means that we have to clear 10% to be in the range of 10% to 12%. And Keith, I think you know that we actually manage this and track it. We have a restructuring program, a signings program, a mix of business programs. We're trying to acquire in the right areas. We're a little light on acquisitions this quarter, expect to pick those up as we go along. We don't acquire willy-nilly. We try to do it in a very disciplined way. And so I think that the business is actually running pretty much in line with the way that I would expect it to run.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","All right. Just to mention then my second question on Technologies, is there a way to think about -- with the product introductions, it feels like it shifted perhaps some revenues from March to June. Is there any way to think about that in terms of dimensions? I know you mentioned backlog was up. I just wanted to see if you could provide any color on -- or quantification on how much backlog or how much do you think was perhaps shifted from March to June in the Technology segment because of those product introductions? And should we be thinking about any of that for the June quarter with -- it might get further shifted to September?","Ursula M. Burns","Thank you, Keith. I don't -- we expect to capture a lot of the miss in the first quarter -- in the second quarter, but it'll continue to flow through in the rest of the year as well. Our backlog was up around 25%, which is significant in the quarter, and we saw in the second quarter. So, so far, in April, we saw installs up and activity up. So that backlog is not just sitting on the books, it's being fulfilled in the quarter. So I think that -- I'm fairly confident that we will -- that we are fulfilling the promise of ConnectKey, which is to move our activity up. One of the things I want to actually make sure that is clear, we actually predict this business to be down mid-single digits, the Document Technology business. We are very, very -- our eyes are wide open to what's happening in the marketplace, so we're not delusional about the progress here. We're investing in areas that grow, and we're trying to take our costs down in areas that are not growing and are moving away. So we're investing in Document Outsourcing, we're investing in low-end distribution, we're investing in color across the board and in high end color in particular. And as we do that -- ConnectKey is one of the key elements there. We were a little slow off the launch of ConnectKey, even though we invested in SAG, we invested in marketing, we invested in the areas that we should. I'm fairly confident that quarter 2 -- very confident that quarter 2 will deliver back to the mid-single-digit revenue declines and get our ratios better in line and, therefore, our operating margin better in line. One of the key points here as well is if you look at gross margin, our gross margin in Technology was flat, which is harder to move. It turns out it's harder to improve your gross margin than it is to improve your operating margin in Technology because our operating margin is around investment that we make on an active basis, if you know what I mean. We just make them. So I'm actually feeling pretty good about Document Technology in quarter 2. I was very disappointed in quarter 1.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.","Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I have a question on the Services segment as well. Last quarter, you had mentioned that some renewals slipped into Q1. Can you talk about how that impacted the renewal rate and how we should, off of that, think about the renewal rate heading into Q2 and for the remainder of the year?","Ursula M. Burns","Yes. Lynn will take it.","Lynn R. Blodgett","Great. The -- yes, had some deals that moved our renewal universe, if you want to think of it that way in Q1 was quite large. And we've had a very, very good success rate. We're up about -- I think, about 40 bps in terms of renewal rate quarter-over-quarter. And that has a dramatic impact. A renewal is as good as a booking and -- or in some ways, better. So we are optimistic that our renewal rate in the second quarter will continue to be within our range, and we think we'll actually have very strong renewals this quarter.","Ursula M. Burns","And if you look at the mix of the business, Bill, it's also good for us. We talked about this -- I don't know if we talked about it in signings, but if you look at our signings number -- this is off of renewals and into signings, but also in renewals. BPO, very, very strong across the board in just -- on every metric that we have. And BPO is -- has better margins than ITO. So BPO for the first quarter and for 2013 should be strong. Document Outsourcing was also very, very good. ITO, we're benefiting from 2011 signings turning into revenue today. So revenue growth is very good. The mix of business for Services is looking good. I mean, it's coming out the way that we planned for it to come out, or we would like for it to come out on a go-forward basis. So good BPO; good signings in Document Outsourcing, which helps us to offset this low Document Outsourcing revenue. So that's really good. And ITO, delivering on all the -- all of the signings that we had from 2011. So looking pretty good.","Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","If I could, just one more on Services. Can you comment on -- you had a big signings quarter. Can you comment on the average contract length for the Services deals you had this quarter, given that obviously, last year, you had a pretty significant shortening of contract length? And obviously, that has implications down the road for profits. So could you comment on whether that trend has continued and how you're  thinking about that as you look at your signings pipeline for this year?","Ursula M. Burns","Lynn will take it.","Lynn R. Blodgett","Yes. As you have guessed, our average contract term was shorter in the first quarter. Last year, we were at about 4 years. This quarter, we were closer to 3. And that's reflected in the fact that we have a lot of BPO signings, not much in terms of ITO -- ITO tend to be longer contracts -- and deals that were a little bit smaller. So we -- but we have a good renewal rate, and so we're confident in terms of the long-term growth.","Ursula M. Burns","By the way, the shorter contract length contributes to -- if they were longer, the TCV would be even higher, which is an interesting thing. One of the things that Lynn mentioned, he said more contracts. We have 38% more deals signed in this -- giving us that $3.7 billion. It's actually an amazing thing and a positive thing in that, as Lynn said, big deals are longer to stand up to shorter deals, and the smaller deals and shorter deals are a little bit easy to stand up. So we should be able to see the revenue flow through these starting in the second half.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.","Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Ursula, in your prepared remarks, it sounded like you're shaving the low end of the expected revenue targets for the year, closer to flat versus slight growth. Was the primary change there related to the outlook for the Technology business? And if so, is it largely the pricing dynamic, or is it the revenue timing of the mid-range refresh?","Ursula M. Burns","Yes. So the -- we did say lower end of the range, and it is all from the Document Technology business. And it's a mix of both things that we're seeing. One is we expect that the revenue from the product refresh will come in, will start to come in. That's not going to be the biggest -- it'll contribute a little bit. And the other piece of -- the other contribution is from what we're seeing in Europe and the slowdown in DMO that's creating a post-sale -- a usage lower -- lower usage, and that one is harder to kind of outrun. In addition, we are light on acquisitions. And acquisitions -- we're going to make acquisitions in second quarter and beyond, but the timing of those acquisitions will make it hard to have. The revenue flow through will have a big impact. So 3 areas: one is acquisitions; second is some slow start to the Document Technology, but not that much there; and then page volumes and pricing and that whole mixed environment, particularly in Europe and in DMO.","Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. I wanted to ask specifically around -- maybe to get some more color around that post-sale line, it was a bit weaker than I expected. What were the primary drivers there? Was it primarily just straight usage? Are you seeing any kind of changes of pricing around the back end of these deals?","Ursula M. Burns","Yes. So the way that -- well, back ended deal pricing, specifically, no. But what we're seeing is the mix of 3 things coming together that gets to a lower post-sale. One is usage down. What we're selling, the mix is lower. So not that the price of any individual device is lower, but people are buying more lower end things. So mixed a little bit lower, which gets you lower page volumes, lower price per page on lower devices. And we're participating in some segments, just back to the second one, particularly in high end color. We're participating in -- we're participating more in the lower end of high end color devices. And so it's a combination of low economic activity in DMO and in Europe, mix and mix-driven low page volumes and mix-driven lower price. But we're not seeing a change in the pricing of a deal, if you know what I mean. If you put an iGen, we're not seeing a change in the pricing of an iGen deal.","Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And then last one for me, just finally on the pricing environment. Does the more competitive pricing environment impact your overall revenue outlook for the year? Or is it relatively small in the scheme of things?","Ursula M. Burns","Yes, I think it's relatively small in the scheme of things. Most of it is in Document Technology, and most of it is in equipment sale, which is like 10% to 15% of our total revenue. So it's not -- I mean, something that we have to overcome, but it's not going to be a significant mover at all. We would be more concerned -- or I know it would be more of an issue if post-sale prices across the board went down, but that's very, very hard to do. Very hard to do.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Notably, the signings numbers were super impressive. But I also want to take a bigger-picture look at this, and the prior quarter was weaker than expected. So maybe if you can, Ursula, from a longer-term strategic CEO perspective, kind of help us kind of smooth it out a little bit to say -- is there a certain run rate that you want these signings to come in at, to continue to grow your business organically? Because I imagine there is some rolling off all the time, some coming on? And how we should look about that? And then this quarter, was it truly kind of off the charts? Or was some of that pushed to deferred from the December quarter? And then in lieu of that, with sequester, were there some actually that didn't close, that may close into the June quarter?","Ursula M. Burns","So signings, one of the things that we learned early on, came over when we got into Document Outsourcing, but even more when we brought ACS and got BPO and ITO in, signings are lumpy, Jim. I mean, there is not a predictable nature to signings, particularly as we participate in the full mix of small to large deals, which we do. So I -- unfortunately, I can't give you an \"Expect x.\" They are lumpy. Do not underestimate or dampen too much the signings that we did in the first quarter. They were very, very good, even with the move of some deals from quarter 4 to quarter 1. 64% increase is real -- is a real increase. The number of deals, just the number of transactions, was significantly bigger than we would than would naturally happen. So the quarter was a really good quarter in signings, no -- not just because we moved, et cetera. And sequestration, we really haven't seen a specific -- so we didn't see specific line items stop or specific deals stop. What sequestration does is it just puts a damp rag over everything from a time perspective. So that's \u2013 and that's -- but we're kind of used to that now. We didn't see a deal stop because something got de-funded. Not at all. But we did see a lot of slowness in decision making. And we expect good signings again in quarter 2, as Lynn said. So we do not expect quarter 1, quarter 3 -- quarter 4, 1 and 2 to kind of average out to be an okay set of quarters. We expect -- we had reasonable -- in quarter 4, a little bit light. Very, very good in quarter 1, heavy, and we'll have a very good quarter in quarter 2 in signings as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse.","Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just have a question on restructuring and the cost basis. There's been a lot of mention on things potentially being accelerated, so I just want to kind of frame the question in terms of \u2013- for Ursula, I guess, between, let's say, 2012, the end of the year and the end of this year on a run rate basis, all to 2014, how do you want to describe it? Can you speak about how much cost you're trying to take out of the business? Can you put a dollar number on that? And then also, in the event that the Services margins may not come through, or the Technology business doesn't come through, can you speak about the flexibility you have to further become aggressive on the cost base? Give me some examples maybe for where you could actually accelerate savings.","Ursula M. Burns","So in 2012, we took about $150 million of restructuring charges, primarily in Document Technology. And towards the end of the year, as you know, we did a restructuring in Services. And in the quarter \u2013- and that flowed through to about $50 million to $60 million worth of savings in the first quarter of the year. And we expected the savings for the full year to be north of $200 million, $225 million. For 2013, we expect a similar level of restructuring in 2013 to 2012. What we've done in quarter 2 is accelerate some of that restructuring into the quarter, and that will be primarily, again, in Document Technology. We're going to take a bigger focus on Europe. Europe is, as you know, difficult. You may not know, but Europe is difficult to restructure in. The paybacks are very long. It's a challenging environment. But we're going to go after it with full force in quarter 2 and see what we can do in quarter 2 in European restructuring. And the rest of that, a smaller amount of it, will be the continued restructuring and continued movement of labor in Services that Lynn spoke about. So about the same year-over-year, a step up in quarter 2. That step up will allow us to continue to meet the first half earnings and assure that we'll meet the full year earnings expectations that we laid out. And we're going to focus on Europe and Document Technology.","Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So that I've got that right -- so that's $150 million of restructuring probably this year, and hopefully, like $200 million -- that results, let's say, going into \u201914 and on a full year basis, $200 million of potential savings. Am I understanding that right?","Ursula M. Burns","Correct. I think I answered all your questions, I think.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.","Mark A. Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","The first question, Ursula, is around the Services business. You're entering the fourth year now with the ACS services piece as part of your company. I\u2019m just kind of curious, if we exclude the Document Outsourcing, so the 27% or so of Services as Document Outsourcing, it would put your ACS-related services around 40% of total company revenue. Is that kind of how you, Lynn and Tom, kind of think about where you want that mix? Is it kind of over, under where you were targeting, say, a few years ago? How should we think about that mix right now?","Ursula M. Burns","Yes, it's a great question, actually. We expect a little bit more. We expect a little bit higher mix at this point in BPO and ITO. And the biggest gap that we have is in acquisitions. And that gap, the acquisition gap, is one that we're working really hard to remedy. But the organic growth in Services is coming in actually this year, ahead of where we expected it to be, tail end of \u201912 and first quarter. And what we need to do is -- another point or 2 from acquisition revenue would be good. And as far as the Document Outsourcing business, it\u2019s definitely a lumpy business. It comes and it goes and right now, we have lot of signs that'll translate into revenue in the tail end. So I'm actually pretty okay with Document Outsourcing. And organic growth in Services, I'm good with as well.","Mark A. Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Just as a follow-up, so you said the -- where you could have a remedy is more on the acquisition side? Where could those remedies lie? I mean, can you give us a sense of what we could look to over the next 12 to 18 months as far as some of those remedies?","Ursula M. Burns","Yes. So here are the priorities that we have now. The thing about acquisition is that you have to find a candidate that you -- which we find a lot of, but we have to actually like the candidate and have a reasonable value match between the seller and the buyer. You know all this. Here's the focus areas that -- we're going to continue on capabilities, particularly in what is called outside big data, but I call it in data analytics or whatever to actually enable more business in our in situ business -- lines of business today. That\u2019s one area that you'll see. The second area that you'll see is we're going to continue to double down and triple down in health care. Some of that is big data, but also in ways to mass market -- path to market in healthcare. And the third will be international acquisitions across the board in our Services business. Our international operations are growing, but I want them to grow even faster. And what it allows us to do is get revenue, but also get talents that can be sitting internationally as well, which is something that we need to actually accelerate. So it will be in those 3 areas.","Mark A. Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And my second question is around cash flow. Just kind of curious -- just given you are kind of entering years 2 and 3, or at least the more mature parts of these Services cycles that you signed on a few years ago after you acquired ACS, can we see a situation where later this year -- maybe your total revenue actually could be flattish to even down, but you could have some accretive benefits from some of these Services deals. So we could actually see cash flow actually improve more than expected. I mean, are we getting to that positive inflection point from a cash flow perspective?","Ursula M. Burns","Yes, I think some and some, but I don't think you'll see the revenue come down based on the signings. Right? If you look at the signings and if we operate when we operate the contracts, as they say, I don't think you'll see revenue coming down. You will see -- you could see strength in cash based on how effectively we bring those contracts and all other contracts that we have to maturity. So you could have some benefit in cash. I don't think that you'll see a negative in revenue. Right? Megadeals have -- the megadeals that we've signed have a cash -- as they mature, they have a cash benefit. Right? So the most famous megadeal is California. Right? And as California's maturing -- thank God -- and is doing fairly well -- I'm not going to say very well because very well always jinxes me -- it's doing well. And so as that matures, of course cash becomes easier to get out of the megadeals. But I don't think revenue will be down. I think cash has some opportunity and -- yes.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of George Tong with Piper Jaffray.","George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","I wanted to get some color on your Services pipeline. Could you tell us where you're seeing the greatest activity? What you're seeing in terms of mix and whether you're seeing any megadeals potentially come up?","Lynn R. Blodgett","Yes. we are on \u2013 the main areas that we're seeing activity are transportations, health care, our financial services, customer care and in our government space. As Ursula said, we're seeing good growth in government health care, and we continue to see a good pipeline there. We're seeing a few more deals that are larger in size, but not as many as we've had historically. That's why I think it's important that we demonstrate that we can execute on these smaller contracts. The number of deals that we did is up significantly, and -- so I don\u2019t think we should count on a huge influx of megadeals. But we do believe that we\u2019ll have continued strong signings growth through the year.","Ursula M. Burns","And this -- Armando will speak about Document Outsourcing.","Armando Zagalo de Lima","Yes. So megadeals in quarter one were 30% of total, what I think helps the quick turnaround to revenue. So we don\u2019t have \u2013- we have 70% of our deals that are not megadeals. Industry-wise, I give you a perspective about 2012. So public sector was our major industry with 18 megadeals in 2012; financial services, 16; manufacturing, 10; health care, 8. Quarter 1 was a little bit different. 3 deals -- megadeals in education, 3 in manufacturing, and 1 in health care.","Ursula M. Burns","So I think that from the 2, you'll see that we have \u2013- we participate in a broad set of industries, and we are seeing the benefit of historic megadeals. But today, now more -- just across the board, good activity from many different-sized firms and many different-sized engagements, and that\u2019s actually very good.","George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","And then as a follow-up question, what percentage of your first quarter signings came from renewals that slipped from 2012? And are there any renewals slipping into the second quarter that could help drive second quarter\u2019s bookings growth?","Lynn R. Blodgett","Yes. There's always -- as Ursula said earlier, the bookings tend to be lumpy, and there are always things at the end of one quarter that tend to slip to the next. I think that if I had to put a percentage on it, I would put it at about 10%, maybe 15%. And we had deals -- a couple of deals actually that we expected to close the last day of the quarter. It didn't close, and we've signed those already. So -- but that's kind of normal.","James H. Lesko","Thanks, George. Okay, that's all the time we have for questions today. Thanks for your interest. And Ursula, anything more to wrap up?","Ursula M. Burns","Yes. Thanks, Jim. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that Kathy Mikells will join us on May 2 as our new CFO. She brings to Xerox extensive financial experience and a broad business acumen in both services and technology. And Kathy plans to reach out to our investment community almost immediately after she arrives.","We covered a lot of ground today, so let me bring it up a couple of levels.

Today we're reporting our first quarter 2014 earnings that reflect the benefits of our diversified portfolio and improved performance across a number of areas including ITO, Document Technology and Document Outsourcing.","And within BPO, our commercial business, especially commercial healthcare showed good results. We did have challenges in the quarter especially in the area of government healthcare, which I'll get to in a few minutes.","So let's begin with a review of our 2014 priorities. The first priority is growing revenue. Today, Services represents 57% of our revenue and we continue to expect that number to grow to two-thirds by 2017. The shift over time will drive improved revenue growth. To realize this growth we need to strengthen and differentiate our portfolio. We participate in some very attractive segments of the Services and Document Technology market. We are investing in these areas to increase the value we bring to our customers.","I was very encouraged by what I heard from our customers a few weeks ago at our event called simple@work. Over 800 customers had to see all that Xerox have to offer. The innovation we're bringing and the commitment we have to solving their real-world business problems. What I heard from them was very positive. They are eager to understand all of our offerings and work more with Xerox.","Another priority for us is to improve our cost structure and eliminate areas of underperformance. We've made great strides on this in Document Technology over the past few years and we're on the path to do the same for Services. Key to executing on these priorities is having a strong team to drive long-term results. We have a very seasoned team of executives with good subject matter expertise and we have brought in proven leaders to broaden our perspective and execution capability.","A few weeks ago, I announced the appointment of a new head of our Services business, Bob Zapfel and the retirement of Lynn Blodgett. I want to thank Lynn for his service and dedication to Xerox and welcome Bob, who is with us on the call today. Bob and his team are focused on the areas where we know we can and must improve. He will lead the implementation of our Services five-plank strategy, which includes driving our cost initiatives while supporting investments in areas where we see opportunity and benefits for our customers, opportunities like global growth where we are seeing progress. And across both segments, Services and Document Technology, we have a keen focus on supporting our customers, our investors and our people.","Our final priority is to continue to focus on capital allocation to deliver shareholder returns. We have a business that \u2013 with very strong cash flow and we're committed to deploying that cash in a balanced way to drive shareholder value now and in the future.","Moving on, I would like to share my perspective on Q1 results, a few positive takeaways from the quarter. We reported adjusted EPS of $0.27, which was above our guidance. Operating margin was up year-over-year by more than a point and operating profit grew double-digit driven by Document Technology and Document Outsourcing as well as improvements in commercial BPO and ITO and we generated over $250 million of cash in the quarter, which positions us well for our full-year objective.","We repurchased $275 million in shares and we're increasing share repurchase expectations for the year. Some challenges did persist on a couple of fronts.","Revenue declined 2%. Although this is an improvement from quarter four and is within our expected range for Q1, is below our full-year objectives. So we'll need to continue to see improvements especially in the second half when we lapsed some of the near-term headwinds.","And we came up short in Services margins, which I know is an area of keen focus for investors, and I can assure everyone an area of intense focus internally. The shortfall is driven by incremental costs incurred in our Medicaid and health insurance exchange implementation. Kathy will add more detail but know that we are committed to doing what's needed to get these systems stood up and we're confident that these investments will pay dividends down the line in this very attractive market segment.","As we deal with challenges in this business and work to remedy the issues for the future we need to reset our guidance expectations. We'll go through the specifics in a moment.","It is important to note that we're making margin progress in other areas. For instance, we saw good margin improvement year-over-year in our commercial BPO and ITO businesses. And I'm extremely pleased with the revenue growth and margin improvements in commercial healthcare, but we have much more work to do.","With that I'll turn it over to Kathy and then I'll wrap up and we will open the call for questions. Kathy?","Kathy Mikells","Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by walking through our earnings.","Overall, we were pleased with our growth and operating profit and the related operating margin improvement in the quarter. Our core operating results came in a bit better than expected, driven by strong margin expansion in our Document Technology segment with the gain on the sale of real estate and lower tax rate also aiding our EPS beat versus guidance.","We saw a positive results and trends in a number of areas within Services, but disappointing results within our government healthcare business cost us to miss our Services segment margin guidance for the quarter and adjust down our Services margin expectations for the year. I will walk through this in greater detail when we get to this segment review.","Revenue in the quarter was down 2% at both actual and constant currency. This was better than the 4% constant currency revenue decline in Q4 as both Document Technology and Services revenue growth rate modestly improved. Gross margin of 30.2% was down 30 basis points year-over-year, as improvements in Document Technology was not enough to offset the incremental pressure on Services margin. Ongoing productivity initiatives, as well as lower pension expense, yielded significant improvements in both SAG and RD&E. As a result our operating margin expanded 110 basis points to 8.6% enabling operating profit growth of 13%.","Moving down the income statement, adjusted of the net was $72 million, an increase of $59 million year-over-year. The drivers of the increase were higher OID and higher restructuring expense. OID was up year-over-year; the largest factor was that this year's gain of $30 million associated with the real estate sale was less than the prior-year's $37 million litigation reserve reduction. We've been working on the real estate sale for some time and expect that it would close in 2014, but a bit later in the year so it aided our beat this quarter.","Restructuring was $27 million, which was $35 million higher than in 2013 and about $0.01 higher than our guidance. Adjusted tax rate of 22% was in line with 2013 and under our guidance due to favorable high resolutions, which were a discrete item in the quarter. Adjusted EPS of $0.27 was flat year-over-year and above our guidance range of $0.23 to $0.25 with the upside coming from Document Technology profitability, the real estate gain and tax rate partially offset by higher restructuring.","With that, I'll move to the Services segment slide to review those results in more detail. Services revenue growth was flat year-over-year, which was a modest sequential improvement from Q4 when Services revenues were down 1% to constant currency, although it was short of our 1% growth target.","Document Outsourcing continues to grow mid-single digit. ITO was slightly up and BPO was down a couple of points as good growth in commercial healthcare and international were offset by student loan runoff, lower volumes in customer care and transportation, and less inorganic contribution.","Turning to signings. Signings were up 1% on a trailing 12-month basis but were down year-over-year. As we highlighted on our Q4 call, we had a challenging signings compare this quarter as our Q1 2013 was one of our highest signings quarter in recent memory. That said, signings in the quarter were a bit softer than we expected. New business signings were down 7% year-over-year as we saw some decision delays and shift of contracts to Q2. New business pipeline remains very strong, up 9%, and we expect sequentially higher signings in 2Q, although once again we faced a relatively strong year-over-year compare.","Total contract values from renewals were quite a bit lower year-over-year despite a renewal rate of 91%. Both new business and renewals can be lumpy and the lower renewals in the quarter were a function of fewer renewal decisions. So all in all, renewals aren't a concern, and we would have liked to have seen a little bit better new business growth but we feel we're well-positioned as we enter the second quarter.","Shifting to profitability, segment margin was 8.6% in the first quarter, down 70 basis points year-over-year and lower than our target of 9.3%. The year-over-year decline and outlook shortfall is driven by incremental costs associated with the rollout of our new government healthcare Medicaid systems, and implementation of the Nevada healthcare exchange. The work involved with implementing these new platforms is significant and we faced greater challenges than anticipated getting new clients to a good level of operating performance and then costing down the ongoing maintenance of the program. While we're making progress on improving our operational performance, it's costing more than we expected and it's going to take us more time before we can lean out the resources supporting these projects.","We're making good progress in other businesses within Services. Excluding the higher than anticipated government healthcare costs, Services margin would have been flat year-over-year, with improvement in Document Outsourcing and our commercial businesses where we saw benefits from our cost actions roughly offsetting headwinds from student loan runoff and lower volumes in some areas.","Turning to guidance, we're resetting our expectations for Services. On revenue, we continue to expect Services revenue growth to improve sequentially as we move through 2014, driven by signings ramps, moderation of headwinds impacting BPO, and greater inorganic contributions averaging mid-single-digit growth in the back half of the year. Taking into account the slower start with flat revenue growth in Q1 and later ramp in new business and acquisitions, we believe full-year Services revenue growth will be approximately 3%.","Given the Q1 margin performance and expectations for continued higher costs in government healthcare, we expect full-year Services margin to be down and in the range of 9.4% to 9.8%, which should, compares to our original expectations for a 50 basis point improvement to approximately 10.3%.","Government healthcare was an area where we had expected good year-over-year profit growth, specifically in the back half of the year when we expected to get significantly reduced costs. Our Q1 experience was just the opposite as we had to dedicate incremental resources. We're taking a number of actions to address the issues. In the past few months, we've brought in a new leadership team for government healthcare, an experienced Chief Development Engineer from our technology group, as well as Bob to run Xerox Services.","We're enhancing our program management under a single-point of accountability that also serves to enable quicker learnings across different implementations of the same platform. We know it's going to take us longer and will cost us more to get these implementations right and we're committed to do that in support of both our current and future customers.","I'll now turn to Document Technology. Revenue in Document Technology was down 4% at actual currency and 5% to constant currency. We saw consistent performance in the U.S., some improvement in Europe and ongoing weakness in developing markets. Equipment sales revenue was down 4% year-over-year and supplies were down 3% year-over-year, and improved sequentially from down 9% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. In addition, our previous finance receivable transactions negatively impacted revenue growth by about a point.","Looking at our products group, high-end had positive equipment revenue growth again this quarter driven by strong color install activity. Midrange also continues to show good color install activity driven by ConnectKey. Finally, entry although impacted by weakness in developing markets did show improvement from the fourth quarter.","Looking to margins, Document Technology margin was very strong at 12.2%, which was 340 basis points higher year-over-year. This improvement reflects the ongoing benefit from cost and efficiency savings, lower pension expense and a currency benefit from the weak yen. In addition, we had a relatively easy prior-year compare. The strong margin performance resulted in operating profit growth of 34% despite the revenue decline so good overall performance for Document Technology.","Looking toward the second quarter, we faced a more difficult compare especially in equipment revenue given the timing of last year's ConnectKey product launch and we continue to expect Document Technology to have revenue down mid-single digit with good margins although most likely not at Q1 levels.","With that, let's turn to cash flow. Cash flow from operations was quite strong at $286 million in the quarter, which compared with an $87 million use of cash in the first quarter of 2013. The year-over-year improvement was driven by working capital. Accounts receivable and accounts payable were the largest factors year-over-year, reflecting in part timing benefits related to our efforts to continue to smooth out working capital. Inventory was better year-over-year as we had higher than normal buildup of inventory in the first quarter of 2013 related to the ConnectKey launch timing.","Moving down the cash flow statement, investing cash flows was $120 million use in the quarter. We spent $103 million on CapEx and $54 million on acquisitions. In January we closed on Invoco, a German customer care company, which supports our international expansion. We've had a better start in M&A this year. But had hoped to get a bit more done by this point. The pipeline continues to look good and we're close on a few opportunities so our full year expectation to spend up to $500 million in 2014 is unchanged.","Cash from financing was a use of $349 million, and includes $275 million spent in share repurchases and $74 million in preferred and common stock dividends. Wrapping up cash flow, we have a good start and our full year guidance remains $1.8 billion to $2 billion of operating cash flow with the more even distribution through the year. Q2 cash flow will be down year-over-year, but overall cash flow for the first half should be roughly in line to the prior year.","Moving to the next slide, I'll walk through our capital structure. We ended the quarter with $8 million in debt which is consistent with our beginning of year balance. We have $1.1 billion in debt coming due in May, $200 million of which we pre-funded as part of last December's note offering. We plan to refinance the remaining $850 million throughout the year. Applying 7 to 1 leverage on customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt is $4.4 billion, leaving core debt of $3.6 billion. Financing debt has come down over the past few years, driven by the finance receivable transaction as well as from lower originations.","As we've previously indicated, we don't plan to do any finance receivable transactions this year, and thus we expect finance debt to be relatively stable. We manage our core debt to maintain a leverage ratio consistent with our investment grade rating. We continue to expect to end the year with about $7.8 billion in total debt, with the reduction simply reflecting the $200 million that we pre-funded last December. Additionally, it's worth noting that we amended our $2 billion revolver to extend it through 2019 with more favorable pricing. We feel good about our stable capital structure and if we move to the next slide, I'll review where we are on share repurchases and dividends.","Our strong cash flow and beginning of year cash position enabled us to repurchase $275 million, or 25 million shares in the quarter. We now anticipate doing at least $700 million in share repurchases for the year. Share repurchase has been a consistent element of our capital allocation plan for the past few years, and as a result, we've reduced shares outstanding by net 17% since 2010. As part of our commitment to creating value for shareholders, we announced last quarter a 9% increase to the quarterly dividend to $0.0625 per share which is effective for common dividends payable on April 30. We'll spend about $300 million on dividends in 2014, so combined with share repurchases, we're targeting to return at least $1 billion to shareholders this year.","Before I turn it back to Ursula, I'd like to summarize our expectations for Q2 and full year. We're pleased with the performance of Document Technology and expect continued strong margins, albeit likely lower than Q1, and relatively stable revenue declines with a somewhat more difficult compare in Q2, given the timing of last year's new product launch. So overall, Document Technology is on track with full year margins expected to be up modestly year-over-year.","Within Services, we're seeing good results in document outsourcing, commercial healthcare, international and other commercial BPO businesses reflecting the progress we're making implementing our five-plank strategy for improved margins and growth. But required additional spending in our government healthcare business has triggered a revision to our guidance. We expect Q2 Services revenue and margin to improve sequentially with lower margin year-over-year, given the strong 10.2% prior-year compare. As I mentioned earlier year, we expect to be between 9.4% and 9.8%.","At the consolidated level, for Q2 we expect revenue will decline approximately 2% and adjusted earnings per share of $0.25 to $0.27, which includes approximately $0.02 of restructuring. And for the full year, given the change to our outlook for Services, we now expect consolidated revenue to be flat to slightly down year-over-year and adjusted earnings per share of $1.07 to $1.13, which compares to our previous full-year guidance of $1.10 to $1.16.","With that, I'll hand it back to you, Ursula.","Ursula Burns","Well, thanks, Kathy. I want to get to your questions, so I'll quickly summarize our performance.","First quarter performance reflects how our portfolio mix benefits our business. Our profits in Document Technology helped offset the shortfalls that we faced in government healthcare solutions. Our distribution and international expansion is extending our reach to more customers around the world and our strong cash flow follows us \u2013 allows us the flexibility to increase the value we bring to customers by investing in growing vertical markets.","We are consistent in our priorities and our focus. We continue to strengthen our management team and we are executing on our five-plank strategy in Services, designed to promote revenue growth and improved margins. Despite the current pressure on government healthcare, we are optimistic about our healthcare business overall. There is good growth and profitability on the commercial side and room for improvement on the government side.","We will capitalize on the most advantaged segments of the Document Technology business to maintain our leadership position in the industry and we'll continue to use our healthy cash flow to deliver shareholder value.","Thank you. And now over to you, Jim.","Jim Lesko","Thanks, Ursula. Also, let me point out that we have several supplemental slides at the end of our deck. They provide more financial detail to support today's presentation and complement our prepared remarks. For the Q&A, I ask participants to limit yourself to one follow-on question, so we can get to everyone. At the end of our Q&A session, I'll turn it back to Ursula for closing comments.","Operator, please open the line for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Bill Shope from Goldman Sachs.","Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs","Great. Thank you. So I have a question for Bob, whom I believe you said was on the call and perhaps Ursula as well. Given the challenges and the volatility we've see in the Services segment, particularly on the margin line, could you give us some early thoughts on the changes we might expect to see in the management of the business and how that'll hopefully produce more predictable results going forward?","Ursula Burns","Why don't I start and then I'll turn it over to Bob. One of the important things that we did when we outlined the five-plank strategy was to do that from a broad-based leadership perspective so not only in Services, but including the leadership of the company, the CFO, head of strategy, and myself and obviously the head of Services. So the strategy that we have in place for margin improvement and revenue growth in Services is one that is in place and will continue.","What we realized at the time though is that we needed to change our implementation process and cadence. And we did a couple of things there, one is a structural change inside which is not that much interest to the external world, but was really important to how we manage the business for transparency and clarity across many different lines of business and many different implementations.","Second, and probably first for most, was we look at our leadership team and the capabilities that we had their and made sure that we understood if we had any gaps and if we had gaps we actually went out to fill them. Three areas we had to look at to improve and we did. One was we brought in a new head of our government healthcare business and he has brought in leaders underneath him to help assure that we can have this standard of limitation across the many different implementations that we have around the nation, both in MMIS and in our health information exchanges.","The second thing that we did was we actually moved some technical resources that we have from our Technology business to our Services business to manage this platform, these platforms which are fairly complicated.","And the third and most important that we started searching for and we brought on Board a new leader to actually implement the five-plank strategy, somebody who had experience in doing this type of management structure and process and that was Bob. So let me now turn it over to Bob now.","Bob Zapfel","Thanks, Ursula. Bill, I would just add, I mean I had a good opportunity before coming and joining the Xerox team to really in the due diligence, understand the five-plank strategy, and it really matched my experience space in terms of how do you drive value for clients by transforming your delivery model?","Services is at the core, a delivery business and we're still in the relatively early part of a journey, but a journey that is very well mapped out to drive best practices across our units through improved process standardization, automation to take work out of the workflow, and leveraging a global talent pool. So on your question of volatility, I really think as we mature our process, we will be even more predictable and it was part of what made Xerox and the Services business very attractive for me personally.","Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs","Okay, thanks and congrats on the new role Bob. I guess outside of the Services segment, the Technology business, we're obviously seeing some positive surprises. Should we be \u2013I understand that this quarter was sort of a bit of an outlier in terms of the margin strength, but should we be thinking about tech segment margins that are potentially sustainably above the range as you've given us in the past when we think about modeling longer-term?","Kathy Mikells","So I'm not going to attempt to give 2015 guidance this early in 2014, but we're really pleased by the performance that we're seeing in the technology business. We had commented in the back half of last year that the Technology business had really stabilized and we have a great focus on driving profitability and margins in the Technology business with ongoing restructuring plans.","So we feel good about the margin we produced this quarter. In my commentary about the second quarter, I clearly said, we expect continued strong margins, albeit expect it to come down a little bit from where we are in Q1. So overall we're really pleased. We expect will be up a little bit year-over-year in Technology margins and we expect continued good performance there.","Jim Lesko","Thanks, Bill. If we could have our next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross from Cross Research.","Shannon Cross - Cross Research","Thank you. I had another question on Services and maybe Bob wants to jump in, or Ursula. As you look at what's happened in Nevada and the challenges and that, has it changed your thoughts regarding government healthcare opportunities? And, sort of how do you view the landscape given what we've seen, not just at Xerox, but obviously other companies as well?","Ursula Burns","I'll take it and Bob can follow up if there's a need for it. The government healthcare market is relatively large and it's definitely growing and the demographics are all tailwinds for it, all in the favor of government health. The majority of our healthcare business is not government healthcare, and the majority of that is not new platforms.","And let me just break it into two parts so that we can parse out where we're having the challenges and what we're doing to fix it and therefore, I think it will help you understand why we're still so bullish on the market. MMIS is one large amount of engagement that we have. This is a long and historic business for ACS and now Xerox. It's Medicaid, it, we've been in it for many, many, many years and we've been managing on a platform that's an old platform.","When the platform is in, it lasts for many years, 10, 15, years plus. And after you stand it up, the business on an ongoing basis is very predictable and very profitable, actually very profitable. Where we are today on Medicaid is that we are implementing a new set of platforms around the nation. The most famous one is California, which we are engaged in. We've been engaged in for many years, and California is going fairly well, and MMIS is actually going pretty well and we're now at the point where we're starting to lean out our implementation on California and drive it to increased profitability.","MMIS, we also have some new implementations as well, and those new implementations, which some of them started late last year, a couple later this year, and one in 2015 and more to come, I'm sure, will be going through the same process of implementing the new platform and then leaning it out and driving it towards profitability. MMIS is an area that is a challenge but it is not a large concern for us. We know our path forward there.","The place that is the biggest challenge for us right now is the health information exchanges and it is the one that we lead on, and that's Nevada. And what we, this is a brand-new platform, it's a one-of-a-kind implementation for us, so far to-date, this is the only place that we've done it. It has not gone well. We are working very hard and closely with the client to make sure that we do two things.","One is, stand it up to the client assurance and comfort that we do that. We're doing that very well and aggressively with leadership in Nevada, but also lean it out as we go forward. That is taking a lot longer than we thought, as Kathy said, and as I said, and as you're hearing probably when you read the newspapers. It's taking a lot longer than we thought and is taking more resources than we thought. As we lean that out, we will do the same thing. As we stand it up we'll lean it out and then we'll drive it toward more stable operation and profitability.","On health exchanges as well though, we're involved in a lot of other states in varying ways. Not implementing the platform, but handling transaction processing, handling call center, doing some specific modules and health exchanges in six or seven states. They are going very well. So the focus area for us in health exchanges is fixing Nevada. We do that, we should be able to actually glide on a go-forward basis in the implementations that \u2013 following the implementations that are going well. And on MMIS it is literally just about continuing on the improvement path that we're on which is very good already, and driving towards profitability.","So it's a good market, a growing market, and one that I don't think that we can actually step away from. I know that we can't step away from because we have a history of success in this business.","Shannon Cross - Cross Research","Great. Thank you. And then my next question is just for Kathy. You've maintained cash flow guidance but your lowering Services margin. So you can just give us some ideas of what's supporting that decision, where the incremental drivers of cash flow will come from?","Kathy Mikells","Sure. And so I'll start with our first quarter cash flow was very strong performance, I feel good about where we're starting the year. If you look at, I'll call it overall income obviously bringing down Services margin that is that we partially offset by pretty strong margins that we're seeing within Document Technology. And even within Services, some of the reduction in overall income is coming from slower implementations, which are a non-cash change that we're taking.","So overall, that plus top line is coming down a little bit more and that gives us another working capital benefit. I feel really comfortable we'll be able to hit our full year guidance. So we're not going to see nearly as much flow through to cash flow as you're seeing kind of from the income statement.","Jim Lesko","Thanks, Shannon. We go to the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Barclays.","Ben Reitzes - Barclays","Yes. Thanks a lot. Can you just talk also on cash flow about your efforts to smooth it out meaning make it less volatile? Obviously, the cash flow in the first quarter is a greater percentage of the total than usual, and what's going on there as well to make it smoother as we go throughout the quarters? And will you still have the big hockey stick in the fourth quarter, Kathy?","Kathy Mikells","We will still have in the fourth quarter a big push, Ben. What you're seeing is largely payable timing being smoothed out during the course of the year. As I look at our first quarter, I feel really good about gains that we're making in terms of just receivable days outstanding, which I'm certainly expecting are going to hold for the year. So while you'll see sort of quarter-over-quarters, sort of year-over-year movements, that's going to just result in a little better cadence of overall cash flow during the course of the year. So we're still going to be, I'll call it seasonally peaking in 4Q, but yes less though than you've seen us in past years.","Ben Reitzes - Barclays","Okay. And then I was just trying to quantify the hit from the new guidance on the EBIT line. I was thinking just backing into your Services guidance, it's like $60 million to $80 million and less operating profit in terms of when you add up the revenue, the lower revenue and the hit.","And then I was wondering, is there an incremental restructuring on top of that which also accounts for the lower guidance for the year? I'm just trying to tally it up to get to the $0.06 or to the $0.03 or so in the range, and trying to get the EBIT numbers right. Is that about the way to think of it? And what is the incremental restructuring versus what you are thinking on previously before this call again?","Kathy Mikells","Yes. And so we had given guidance on restructuring kind of roughly similar year-over-year, and that really hasn't changed. If you look overall in Services, we're taking the biggest hit in terms of operating earnings there as a result of the change in Services margins coming down. So we had initially said, we thought we'd see a 50-basis-point improvement. If you look at the range I'm now providing, in the middle of that range it would be down 20 basis points so call it a 70-basis-point change relative to where we started. That's worth about $80 million in terms of overall operating profit.","Now I expect Document Technology is offsetting a little bit of that, right, because we clearly saw really a strong first quarter gains in terms of overall margin and I suggested I thought we'd be up modestly now in Doc Tech margin year-over-year. And so you're getting a little bit of an offset there.","And then if you just kind of look to what other things changed to get us to a full year change, just call it down $0.03. We're doing a little bit more in share repurchases. So we started out a little stronger in terms of the timing of those share repurchases and we've upped our guidance now from $500 million to at least $700 million. And so we get a little bit of pickup there as well.","Ben Reitzes - Barclays","Okay. Great. Thanks for that. That was good detail. I appreciate it.","Jim Lesko","Thanks, Ben. If we could have the next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah from Brean Capital.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital","Hi. Thanks, guys for taking the question. I guess, hey, the first one for me, Ursula, is and then maybe Kathy, just sort of could you walk through the contribution, or I guess the sort of different buckets of impact to the Services growth for the quarter, and what you think the underlying reason for this were and I have a follow-up. Thanks.","Kathy Mikells","Okay. I'll go ahead and take that one. When I look at top line, we had initially targeted that we thought we'd be up 1% and we ended up being flat. There's really two different things contributing there. Slower ramp, so both within some of the healthcare implementations that are taking us a little longer so the new ones that we're standing up are having a slower ramp. And we saw a little bit of overall volume decline specifically within transportation, that's in part weather-related and also due to some slower ramp there.","And then finally, I point to M&A. While we started out the year stronger than we did in 2013, we're still getting a relatively low contribution from M&A, less than half a point, and that's clearly below where we'd like to see it. So while I feel good about the pipeline, we're close on a couple of opportunities, I still feel good about our ability to get closer to spending $500 million for the year. It's coming on a little slower than we had hoped.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital","Got it. Thanks. And then I \u2013 with regard to buyback, and congrats on raising the rates there, I guess what philosophically, how should we think about you executing the rest of the buyback through the year? I think the idea was to do it more ratably through the year this year, commensurate with cash flow, and you had a really strong Q1. So sort of how should we think about strategy on buyback?","Kathy Mikells","Yes. I think that's exactly how you should continue to think about it. In contrast with last year where we really did essentially all of our share repurchases in the back half and very heavily weighted to the fourth quarter, we intend to continue to be in the markets throughout the year with our share repurchases.","Jim Lesko","Thanks, Ananda. If we could have the next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal.","Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal","Hi, guys. I'm going to follow on Ananda's question on growth, and I was hoping for my first question, if you could talk about your confidence surrounding, Kathy, I think you said 3% revenue growth in Services? And while you're doing that, if you could address a few things; a) the bookings looks \u2013 was weak this quarter and I think you said it's going to be down on a tough compare. What does that suggest about the longer-term growth, b) pricing and then c) also ITO?","I question the strength of ITO as we get to the back half of the year when you're really I think anticipating a pretty dramatic increase to mid-single digits in the broader Services category. So if you could perhaps just talk about your confidence interval on Services, and then I have a follow-up. Thank you.","Kathy Mikells","Okay. So on Services, I feel really good about our renewal rate, 91%. We had a 92% renewal rate last year. In this quarter, our new business was a little softer than I had hoped, down 7% for the quarter. We had some things that's taking us a little longer to get the contract on. I feel pretty good about second quarter, clearly mentioned that we expect to see sequential improvement. We do have a tough compare.","I mean in the second quarter of 2013, we were up total contract value 40% year-over-year, so it's a little bit of a tough compare from that perspective, but we should benefit from the strong signings that we saw last year. And so overall, I continue to feel really good about our organic growth and I like some of the places that we're seeing good organic growth.","In the first quarter, we had double-digit growth in Europe overall within Services, and a piece of that was inorganic, but even our organic growth was actually up double digits, so very strong growth there as well. So we're feeling pretty good about the sequential improvement that we expect to see over the course of the year. And again, while I said M&A started out to a slow start, I feel good about the pipeline. We've closed on a couple of deals.","And then finally, some of the other things we're doing, we mentioned in our Investor Day last November that we have a big push on improving our overall mix of business, and so you referenced ITO growth slowing, which has clearly been expected and anticipated by us. We're adding a number of sales people into the businesses where we have higher margins. We recently announced hiring another 60 sales people, so we're making investments to ensure that we get the organic growth we're expecting.","Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal","Okay. Thank you, Kathy. For my follow-up, just philosophically, Xerox has had a couple quarters of disappointment in Services and you're bringing in new leadership, exciting new leadership. How do investors take some comfort in the fact that Bob's having a new role, will be digging underneath the covers and will, could uncover some additional areas that he's not comfortable with, is the guidance the right guidance?","In other words, you're asking Bob to step into a position and you're providing guidance at a position, which presumably he hasn't had a chance to really dig underneath the covers? Or is that an inaccurate perception and we should assume that Bob's kind of blast these numbers and this guidance?","Bob Zapfel","Keith, this is Bob. So no, I have \u2013 I would say that in the first 22 days here, I have been through these numbers in excruciating detail. I've had a good chance to be out with clients and with the Xerox team as well. But no, I'm on the call and on the hook and I think from an investor standpoint, we appreciate that you're going to measure us based on our results. So \u2013 but this is not a \u2013 I'm not inheriting somebody else's call in terms of what we're committed to deliver. The 100,000 person Services team and I are on the line for what we've covered on the discussion today.","Kathy Mikells","I'd be excited to add a little bit to that, Keith, when I look at the first quarter and kind of peel back the layers of our performance, the additional spending we had within government healthcare was truly what caused us to miss our guidance on Services segment margin for the first quarter.","If I look across the business, I mean we had very good margin expansion in document outsourcing, we had margin expansion in ITO; we had margin expansion in commercial BPO. Obviously, our government transportation business is where the student loan pressure shows up. But overall, we're seeing exactly what we expected in terms of Services margin expansion outside of the government healthcare solutions group.","Ursula Burns","It's an important point. I'll just ring in here, Bob has been here for 21 days, fortunately came on board right during the time that we have to actually look at our go-forward commitments and so he was actively involved there, one bringing up what Bob said and what Kathy said. If you look at the parts of the business excluding government healthcare or the part that we called that would come down in government transportation solutions group literally we're expanding margin in every other line of business. The biggest business that we have commercial BPO which is about 75% of our business, margins expanded to the point where we had planned them to. ITO they did as well, in document outsourcing, they did as well. So we do have an isolated issue here, it's a big one, one that we're in front of, but not one that causes us to adjust the rest of the business areas and the path that we had going forward there.","Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal","All right. Fair enough. Thanks, guys.","Ursula Burns","You're welcome.","Jim Lesko","Thanks, Keith. Pick up the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citi.","Jim Suva - Citi","Hey. Thank you very much and I guess concluding comment is, hey, it could've been a lot worse. So anyway I guess you could laugh about that a little bit. But when I think about it, is it really that Xerox miss estimated the amount of person, bodies and hours it needed to be on this to get this state healthcare exchange up and running? Is it the state is asking you to do more than what were originally planned or it's more complicated than what you thought? Or how come Xerox seems to be the one eating all the costs on this? Or am I just misunderstanding the key issues here?","Ursula Burns","So it is a combination of many things, and I would not \u2013 I don't think it's fair, the government would think, Nevada would think that we're the only ones eating all of the costs here. I think that they probably feel a little bit of a sting as well. But it's a combination of things. One, it is clearly that we miss estimated and I will say that we miss estimated the amount of energy and effort that it would take to. One, get the system defined right, this is jointly between the state and us one to do that. And then once you get that, to stabilize it to the point where the operations are predictable that we can understand what volumes would come in at what time, what number of people would try to enroll on certain days.","Something that you've seen, unfortunately across a lot of the health exchanges is just the flood of people on any given day, or any given time is just not predictable. So we had something to do with just not understanding fully \u2013 not predicting fully what could happen at any given time.","But it's also change in requirements, it is a new set of laws that we're trying to develop a system around, it's a combination of many things here. But I want to make sure that I leave the call with understanding that Xerox is responsible for it and has to be responsible for fixing it and we're going to do that on behalf of the government of Nevada and that what we'll do. MMIS is different, we're pretty comfortable with what we have to do there, we have a couple of implementations that are going fairly well, we know how to lean it out, we know how to move, it's taking a bit more time but it's not as unpredictable as Nevada has been.","Jim Suva - Citi","Okay. And then Kathy made a comment about M&A and the pipeline being strong there. You had M&A continues to come in softer than expected and many investors like the M&A and the accretiveness of it. Kathy, is it just so much of your effort has been diverted to trying to fix the Services business? Or why would this M&A additions continue to take longer and longer and longer and yet the pipeline continues to be healthy and healthy, it seems like there's some type of disconnect there about we've heard the story before, and what's the delay here?","Kathy Mikells","So, I'll start with, M&A actually started out stronger this year than it was in 2013, so while I am also pointing to M&A as we had hoped to get more done, at this point than we've been able to get done, on a year-over-year basis just the Invoco deal alone is an exit of the Services deal that we did in 2013.","So it isn't that M&A isn't improving and on a good track it's just not going as fast as we would desire it to go. And it's more timing I would say than revising our overall expectations in terms of what we think will get done this year. And so, we have one decent sized deal, I'd say, under our belt we did another deal, but it was relatively small in this quarter, and so it's not going to give us all that much in terms of revenue and profit. But we've closed on a couple of things and I do feel good about our ability to get more done.","Ursula Burns","And Kathy is not distracted. I mean she has a team that works on this that is pretty much separate from the rest of the operational areas of the business. We are focused on this, at a level of intensity that is pretty high. We're not going to do as we say all the time, we say it continuously. Any deal that we don't think we can manage and bring in comfortably into the company, and we're not going to do a deal that doesn't fit into strategic growth areas that we have and we do have a pipeline that's pretty good now. And as Kathy said, some that are tipping towards the end in the coming quarters.","Bob Zapfel","I would just add that I think our process is really strong. So on your comment on whether people would be distracted. We largely wouldn't be looking to do it in the space where we've had the government healthcare solutions problems that we've talked about so extensively. And I would say the process in terms of the discipline, what's the economics, how does it fit from a growth standpoint is very strong. So they don't happen overnight and we still have more that we see that will be able to drive.","Jim Lesko","Thanks Jim. We could have the next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray.","George Tong - Piper Jaffray","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Kathy, you touched on this earlier, but could you provide some additional color on the progress of your various margin initiatives in Services outside of healthcare in terms of productivity initiatives and off-shoring efforts? And if you were to think about excluding healthcare sort of giving us a sense of what margins for Services would be for the full-year?","Kathy Mikells","So I'll speak a little bit more to the quarter as opposed to the full year, and then I'll come back to circle back to the full year. So I really appreciate the question because overall the additional costs and resources we've had to pour into government healthcare really overshadowed I think the good progress that we're making elsewhere. Clearly, we had pointed to in our Investor Day in November a big push on I'd say bold shifting labor offshore in order to get benefits from those lower costs as well as just improving efficiencies overall. Really both of those things targeted to try and get labor costs as a percent of revenue down, which is a big part of the push towards margin expansion.","And so I feel good about the progress that we made in the quarter there, again excluding the incremental cost that we poured into government healthcare, both in terms of moving people offshore and hiring more offshore as we attract people in the U.S. But I\u2019d say especially, George, in terms of just getting enhanced productivity and putting more money to work in terms of restructuring. So I feel very good about that, other planks of our five planks strategy, international expansion, I think the Invoco acquisition and ongoing organic growth seems to be going very well. I spoke to some of the things that we're doing to push up growth rates organically in some of our more advantaged businesses with higher margins.","So as I look across our five-plank strategy, I feel good about what we're doing to execute, and if you put government healthcare aside that was worth 70 basis points in the first quarter. If you look at the adjustment we've made to full year it's basically a 70-basis-point adjustment on full year from where we had originally started thinking we were going to get 50 basis points of expansion. So I think we're on track in terms of making progress outside of government healthcare.","George Tong - Piper Jaffray","That's very helpful. Thank you. And for my follow-up question, Ursula, could you discuss the leverage you're seeing from past government healthcare platform implementations and what kind of leverage you expect once Nevada Health Exchange and other current MMIS implementations have been fully stood up?","Ursula Burns","Right. So what we \u2013 we have a business where we actually operate MMIS systems in 12 states today plus the District of Columbia, maybe a little bit higher, maybe 13 states but 12 states plus the District of Columbia. We implemented those states under platform from many years ago and those states and the operation of them smooth operation and very profitable business for us and very happy customers in the state.","Each platform as I said take a little bit of time to stabilize, obviously, a little bit more difficult than on the new MMIS than on the old one. They last a very long time, a decade, decade and a half easily, and if you look at our history there. We expect as we stabilize the new MMIS enterprise platform in the states that we have won and that we continue to compete for that we'll have a mirror, essentially a mirror of the government health MMIS business that we had in the past on a go-forward basis.","If we didn't do a new platform, by the way, we would not be able to compete very effectively for this business, so it's a necessary thing to do to hold our position in the enterprise space.","On health exchanges, we operate in a number of states, six or seven states generally in a partnership fashion, a consortium fashion with other providers doing other pieces. In those implementations we are humming along, they're delivering as we expect, the profitability in the model is that as we expect in Nevada as I said in the new exchange that's the place that we're going to have to stabilize. And it'll take us a little bit more time to do and we're figuring it'll take us for the rest of the year to get this all straightened out and so that's interesting.","So I think healthcare historically, government healthcare historically and on a go-forward basis it will be very profitable and is very attractive. And we continue to expect it to be. Commercial healthcare is the winner for us, already growing revenue ahead of where we expect and expanding margins so a commercial healthcare broad participation there, a big business for us actually bigger than government healthcare business and a very profitable business for us. So we expect this whole space of healthcare to actually be a good business for us, continue to be a good business for us as we go forward.","Jim Lesko","Thanks, George. We can have the next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha from Credit Suisse.","Kulbinder Garcha - Credit Suisse","Thanks. I just want to ask a question really about the cost of these government contracts in the sense that it looks like if your margins [have been revised] (ph) it would have been sliced it probably cost about $20 million more than it costs this quarter, maybe $80 million for the year. Are those in the ballpark, firstly?","And then beyond that, as you win new government business, I'm trying to think about the synergies you might have and could it be the case that next year you go for more this type of business, you win more states or more exchanges or how do you want to describe it on those costs meaningfully drop to zero? Or would there be an on going level of cost that just Xerox obviously have to go through a learning curve?","I know it's going to be a hard question to ask because every contract is different. I'm just trying to think of what level of visibility you have as you try and build out this government business? Thanks.","Kathy Mikells","So let me start with first you mentioned, hey, was government healthcare going to cost you about $20 million in the quarter and about $80 million for the year? And my answer to that is yes year-over-year. It did cost us $20 million in the quarter and as we look to full year and our revisions to Services margins which I talked about earlier, that is for us to now anticipate and build into our overall guidance and expectation of just higher costs in government healthcare throughout the year. As we look forward to incremental implementations, our expectation would be that we will get better at incremental implementation.","I mean, as we are bidding on new work, we are taking the learnings that we have today into consideration and looking forward and bidding on new specifically MMIS platforms in other states. As it relates to Nevada, I think it's really important to understand we actually participate in a handful of other state healthcare insurance exchanges. We just don't play this role in terms of being the primary on the implementation of the platform. And in those other states we're doing really well in terms of supporting call center work and other BPO claims processing work and the like, and so that continues to be I think both a strong business for us today and a good opportunity on a go-forward basis.","Kulbinder Garcha - Credit Suisse","Thank you.","Jim Lesko","Thanks, Kulbinder. Can we have our last question now, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our final question for today comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan","Great. Thanks. I'll try and be quick. I just kind of want to build on a couple past questions. First, the confidence in the second quarter signings, you mentioned some customer decision delays. Can you elaborate on that? Is that cyclical and broad-based and has that persisted in April? And I have a follow-up.","Kathy Mikells","And so if we look at signings in the second quarter, we're expecting we're going to see sequential improvement relative to the first quarter, but the other thing I mentioned is we also have another tough comp year-over-year. So last year, the signings number was about $3.7 billion and at that point it had been up 40% year-over-year, so I'm expecting good sequential improvement.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan","Okay. Then just the higher cost tag the government healthcare maybe had a lot of questions. It feels a little bit like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu to me, but any risk in meeting SLA milestones? Is the state cooperating? And then just trying to understand if you're spending enough. I know $20 million is a big dollar amount, but I just wanted to make sure we're covered here in terms of any other future surprises?","Ursula Burns","So I think from the MMIS perspective, I'm very comfortable that we're spending what we need to spend. MMIS spreads across many different states, so small increment spending. First data, I think we have that pretty well comprehended.","In the Nevada exchange, we have comprehended a fairly big chunk of additional spending throughout the year, and I think that we've comprehended that well in this go-forward guidance. So I don't believe that we have much additional upside or downside depending on how you do it, downside in margin or upside in cost. We've actually comprehended a fairly large amount for the rest of the year.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan","All right. Great. Thank you.","Jim Lesko","Okay. That's all the time we have for questions today. Thanks for your interest. And Ursula, anything more to wrap up?","Ursula Burns","Thanks. Xerox is focused on serving our customers very well, a major point of pride and cause for my optimism and confidence in the coming quarters. We'll focus on the customers and assuring that they're doing well. I'm confident that we have the right strategy, the competitive strength, a skilled and proven leadership team with some new, exciting members and the motivation to help our customers to be more successful.","Jim Lesko","Thanks Ursula. That concludes our call today. If you have further questions, please contact me or any member of our Investor Relations team. Have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a good day."],"22738":["Xerox Corp. (NYSE:XRX) Q1 2016 Earnings Call April 25, 2016 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Leslie F.

She is joined by Leslie Varon, Vice President and Interim Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com\/investors. At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and\/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without the expressed permission of Xerox.

Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein. At this time, I'd like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns, you may begin.","Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I am pleased to report that at the end of the first quarter, we are on track to deliver on our three commitments for the year. Meeting our guidance, reaching the first year target for our strategic transformation program and completing our separation into two companies.","I will begin with an update on our progress on the new path forward for Xerox. Before turning to first-quarter results.","In January, we announced plans to separate into two independent publicly traded companies. One comprising our Document Technology and Document Outsourcing businesses and the other our Business Process Outsourcing business. Both will be Fortune 500 scale companies that are leaders in their respective industries.","Further demonstrating our commitment to driving shareholder value, we concurrently announced a strategic transformation program to deliver $2.4 billion in cumulative savings over three years which includes both ongoing and incremental initiatives to enhance productivity and efficiency. We are looking at all aspects of our business to make them more agile and competitive and expect to achieve $700 million in annualized savings this year.","Together, these actions will create two focused companies that have strategies, talent and the organizational and capital structures needed to compete in their markets. We are making progress on both of these initiatives and I am confident that we are making the right steps to best position each company for the future.","We've had positive feedback on our plans. Over the last few months we've been talking to employees, clients and partners regularly about the benefits of the separation and what it means to them. Our clients see the benefits of increased focus and responsiveness to the market. In fact, I met with the executive teams of two major clients in the past couple of weeks, both in the top 75 of the Fortune 500 and both express their positive view.","And our employees tell us they are excited to be part of the journey and to work for companies that are innovative and leading their industries. During the last three months, we have made substantial progress in building strong operational and financial foundations for both companies.","We formed a program management office or PMO that is driving the separation and strategic transformation initiatives. Reporting to an Executive Steering Committee that I lead. The PMO working with the business teams is designing operating models and organizational structures, is also responsible for structuring the separation transaction and designing the optimal capital and legal structures.","We are also taking a close look at the business strategies for both Document Technology and BPO to ensure they are fully optimized. We have identified a number of ways to sharpen each business strategy and improve execution. We are completing this analysis and will develop detailed action plans to capture the highest value opportunities. Some of that implementation will begin this year with more to come post separation.","Many of you have asked about milestone decisions regarding leadership and financials. These are critical decisions that require a thoughtful process. While I can't answer all of your questions at this stage, I can share a few insights on where we stand.","With regard to the leadership of the two companies, our searches are well underway and we have high quality candidates for each key executive role. While the timing for completing the hiring process for very senior roles is difficult to predict, we are targeting to fill the top roles by midyear. In addition to the management teams, we are reviewing candidates to fill the additional board seats created as a result of the separation.","On financials, the big milestone is the filing of our initial Form 10 Registration Statement with the SEC. We are on track to do that in July in line with our goal of completing the separation by year end. We've decided that the optimal way to execute the separation is through a tax-free spinoff of our BPO business. The Form 10 will describe the transaction in detail and provide more information on the BPO company.","We have also quantified the cost associated with the separation in the first year of the strategic transformation program. We expect to incur one time separation cost of $200 million to $250 million and restructuring costs of $300 million. Leslie will provide further details on this shortly.","So all in all, very good progress on these initiatives. We are on track to launch two companies at year end that will have the right strategies, the right structures and the right leaders.","With that said, I want to emphasize that we are managing these programs to ensure our executives team and employees remain focused on serving our clients with excellence and delivering our 2016 plans. So let's talk about how we are doing on that front.","In the first quarter of 2016, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.22 within our guidance range. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.03. Total revenue of $4.3 billion was down 4% or 3% in constant currency. Reflecting growth in our Document Outsourcing and BPO businesses, offset by continued revenue pressures in our Document Technology segment.","Operating margin of 7.2% declined 130 basis points year-over-year. In Services revenue growth improved and margin increased modestly compared to last year. Document Technology revenue continues to be impacted by the weakness in developing markets. And currency negatively impacted Doc Tech margin. As a result of these factors, we have accelerated our cost reduction initiatives resulting in a sizable restructuring charge. We expect to realize the benefits of these actions beginning in the second quarter.","During the quarter, we also continued to strengthen our portfolio with new products and offerings that showcase our innovation. Here are a few examples. In the healthcare market, we launched Xerox Health Outcome Solutions, a full lifecycle population health management solution designed to help providers adapt to value-based contracts.","The centers for Medicare and Medicaid services have set a requirement that by 2018 50% of all payments must be value-based, meaning providers are compensated for healthy outcomes rather than each service provided. According to a survey that we sponsored, healthcare providers and payers need to significantly accelerate their efforts to adapt to this standard, so we see a big opportunity for this product.","Our transportation team introduced the Go Denver and Go LA mobile apps to help residents and tourists make transportation choices more easily and effectively. Commuters in Denver and Los Angeles can use Xerox powered apps to search for the cheapest, fastest and most sustainable ways to move around these cities.","We expanded the capabilities of our ConnectKey platform targeting the large office market. This new and refreshed collection of apps and tools boosts workplace productivity by tightly integrating our 14 ConnectKey i-Series multifunction devices with cloud-hosted services and mobile communications technologies.","It is innovations like these that enable us to maintain our number one market share position in MPS.","And for our graphics communications customers, we introduced two new next-generation inkjet presses: the Xerox Brenva HD Production Inkjet Press and the Xerox Trivor 2400 Inkjet Press. These represent the first of a new series of innovative inkjet products that will enhance our high-end printing offerings; we look forward to ramping up sales later this year.","Looking to cash flow, we used $25 million in our cash from operations, which is in line with seasonality, and ended the quarter with a healthy cash balance of $1.2 billion. Bottom line, we met our guidance and are confident that we're taking the right steps to achieve full-year objectives.","Some of our underlying results were mixed and we are pulling all levers within our control to successfully navigate in a challenging market environment and best position our businesses for the future.","I will turn it to Leslie, who will provide more detail on our financial results and 2016 guidance.","Leslie F. Varon - Interim Chief Financial Officer, Vice President, Investor Relations","Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by walking through the income statement and then discuss guidance, before handing it back to Ursula to wrap up. Before I get started, I'll remind you that the information I'm sharing reflects the reporting revisions we announced last quarter.","Total revenue of $4.3 billion and adjusted earnings of $0.22 were within our expectations. Services delivered modest profit growth, while Document Technology declined due to revenue and transaction currency headwinds and cost reduction timing.","Revenues in the quarter was down 4% in actual currency and 3% at constant currency, an improvement from the 5% constant currency decline in quarter four.","Services top-line was up 2% at constant currency with growth in both Document Outsourcing and BPO. Document Technology declined 9% at constant currency and drove the overall revenue decline. I'll speak more about both segments in a moment.","Gross margin of 30.3% was down 130 basis points year-over-year, driven by declines in Document Technology and a greater mix of Services, which structurally has a lower gross margin. RD&E was lower by $8 million year-over-year and SAG was down $35 million or 4%. Good expense reductions in absolute terms, but not sufficient to offset gross margin declines resulting in operating margin of 7.2%, down 130 basis points year-over-year and an 18% operating profit decline.","Adjusted other net expense was higher by $8 million year-over-year, driven by higher litigation reserves, while equity income of $37 million in the quarter was up $3 million year-over-year.","Our first quarter adjusted tax rate of 22.5% was below our guidance range of 26% to 28%, benefiting our earnings by about a $0.01, and reflecting higher foreign tax credits, as well as the geographic mix of profits. Bottom line, adjusted earnings of $0.22 was within our guidance of $0.21 to $0.24 and was $0.02 lower, driven by Document Technology.","Taking a closer look at Services, results in the quarter were largely in line with expectations. Good top-line growth continued in Document Outsourcing and BPO was up slightly. Margin improved modestly year-over-year. Together, those two drove 2% segment profit growth.","Services revenue grew 1% or 2% at constant currency. BPO was up 1% at constant currency, as growth from acquisitions and new contract ramp, particularly in healthcare, more than offset headwinds in commercial from volume declines and lost business. Our decision and subsequent agreements with California and Montana not to complete the Health Enterprise Medicaid platform implementations was a revenue headwind but was partially offset by last year's first quarter California Health Enterprise adjustments.","Good growth continues in Document Outsourcing, up 5% at constant currency, driven by strong Xerox partner print services growth as well as strong equipment revenue growth in large enterprise accounts following strong 2015 signings.","Total signings in the quarter were down 11% year-over-year but up 9% for the trailing 12 months. The year-over-year decline was driven by fewer renewal opportunities this quarter. The total contract value of our new business signings was up 6% year-over-year driven by good growth in public sector. Our renewal rate in the quarter was quite strong at 89%, so at the high-end of our 85% to 90% range.","Services segment margin was 7.7%, up 10 basis points year-over-year. Improvements in government healthcare, including the Health Enterprise decisions we made last year, were partially offset by margin declines driven in part by customer care where we have operational and efficiency opportunities. We've hired two well-respected leaders from the industry and they're beginning to implement changes to drive improved results","Document Outsourcing margins while down modestly in the quarter remained strong and well above the overall Services margin. So good progress on growth and we're taking additional actions to drive further margin improvement.","I'll now turn to Document Technology. This was a challenging quarter for the Document Technology business with economic, currency and product cycle headwinds. Revenue was down 9% at constant currency, in line with quarter four. Equipment revenue was down 14% year-over-year, including much higher declines in developing markets, especially the Middle East and Russia. Supplies revenue was down 7% year-over-year, much better than quarter four as channel inventory returned to more normalized levels.","When we include Document Outsourcing with Document Technology, the revenue declined continued at about 5%, which largely reflects the current revenue profile of the new Document Technology company post separation.","Turning to activity, within entry, A4 Color MFD growth was up 1% but overall results were pressured by developing markets. Midrange color MFDs also grew 1%, driven by growth in Document Outsourcing. We are expecting the new i-Series products, launched in March, to result in better midrange growth as we move through 2016. High end was the strongest performing product area with color installs up 56%, including strong growth in the entry production color products and iGen, and we are looking forward to the upcoming drupe printing trade show in early June where we will be highlighting a number of exciting new production printing products, especially in production inkjet.","Document Technology margin of 10.2% was down 250 basis points year-over-year. As you know, quarter one is seasonally weak. Approximately 100 basis points of the year-over-year decline was driven by transaction currency. At March 31 rates, we expect very modest transaction currency impact in quarter two and for the balance of the year.","Equipment price declines in the quarter remained within our historic range of 5% to 10%. The quarter one margin also reflects productivity, only partially offsetting the impact of revenue declines.","Following lower restructuring in the second half of 2015, we significantly ramped up restructuring in quarter one and expect to capture incremental benefits from the strategic transformation program as we move through the year. Despite the first quarter challenges, we're confident the trend in both revenue and margin will improve, benefiting from recent product launches and cost actions.","Moving to cash flow, operating cash flow was the use of $25 million in the quarter and in line with our expectations reflecting lower net income, the Health Enterprise settlement payment, and normal working capital seasonality following a strong close to 2015.","Investing cash flows were a use of $125 million and included $72 million spent on CapEx, a $52 million payment to Atos for the final working capital adjustments from the 2015 ITO divestiture and $18 million invested for small technology acquisitions.","Cash flow from financing was a $42 million use and includes $77 million for preferred and common stock dividends. In the quarter we retired a $700 million senior note and refinanced it with a senior unsecured bank loan.","Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $1.2 billion and continues to provide us flexibility as we move through 2016.","Turning to our capital structure and capital allocation, we ended quarter one with $7.4 billion of debt, roughly in line with our year-end debt level. Applying 7:1 leverage to our customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt at the end of Q1 was $3.9 billion, leaving core debt of $3.5 billion.","We continue to manage our capital structure to maintain credit metrics consistent with our investment-grade credit rating.","Now to touch on capital allocation, we have a strong shareholder returns track record, having returned over 70% of free cash flow to our shareholders since 2011. Building on this, we announced last quarter an 11% increase to our common dividend, effective with the dividend payable on April 29 of this year. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter.","Turning to the next slide, I will share with you our second quarter earnings expectations and update our full year guidance to incorporate the separation related costs and higher restructuring, which Ursula discussed earlier.","For the second quarter, we expect adjusted earnings in the range of $0.24 to $0.26 and GAAP earnings of $0.06 to $0.08. For the full year, we are reaffirming our revenue guidance of a 2% to 4% constant currency decline and adjusted earnings guidance of $1.10 to $1.20 per share. We are maintaining our segment revenue growth and margin guidance ranges for both Services and Document Technology.","We're adjusting our full year GAAP guidance to incorporate the $200 million to $250 million of separation costs that Ursula previously discussed. Separation costs include professional fees, transaction costs and operational separation investments. We haven't yet included any tax charges to prepare for the separation. We plan to share additional separation details in July after we file the initial Form 10.","As Ursula mentioned, we're accelerating our strategic transformation initiative and therefore expect to incur higher restructuring and related costs. We now expect to spend $300 million for the full year, $100 million more than we previously guided. And in quarter two, we expect to incur about $100 million in restructuring costs.","Including the separation costs and the higher restructuring costs, we now expect full year GAAP EPS of $0.45 to $0.55 per share. We're adjusting our cash flow guidance to reflect both the cash separation costs and higher restructuring. We began this year with operating cash flow guidance of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. We indicated at the time that our guidance included $200 million of restructuring costs but did not yet contemplate separation costs.","Factoring in cash separation costs of $200 million to $250 million, and the $100 million higher restructuring costs, we now expect operating cash flow of $950 million to $1.2 billion. We are also modestly increasing our CapEx guidance to $350 million to incorporate separation expenditures resulting in updated free cash flow guidance of $600 million to $850 million. This is an unusual year with separation related investments pressuring cash flow well below normal levels.","We're revising our capital allocation expectations to reflect our updated free cash flow guidance. Dividends will be approximately $350 million for the year and reflect the 11% increase. We expect acquisition investments will approximate $100 million and we'll use the remainder of our free cash flow to reduce debt as we seek to optimize the capital structures of the two companies.","Share repurchases have been a significant part of our capital deployment during the past few years including $1.3 billion last year as we returned to shareholders a large portion of our strong cash flow including the ITO divestiture proceeds. This year, given the separation, we don't plan to repurchase any shares.","So in summary, a mixed quarter but we met our guidance and remain committed to delivering our full year objective with accelerated strategic transformation benefits to protect the bottom line.","With that, I'll hand it back to Ursula to wrap up.","Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Leslie. To recap, at the end of the first quarter we are on track to deliver on our plan for the year. Our first quarter results were in line with expectations. We saw good performance on key measures in our Services business and continued pressure in our Document Technology business. We've taken decisive actions to address our challenges and improve margins including accelerating our cost optimization efforts in line with the strategic transformation program that we announced in January. Looking ahead, we're focused on our three commitments, meeting our guidance, reaching the targets for our strategic transformation program and completing our separation. We remain confident that we'll do so.","With that, let me turn it to Jennifer.","Jennifer Horsley - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Ursula. Before we get to your questions for Ursula and Leslie, let me point out that we have several supplemental slides at the end of our deck which provide more financial detail to support today's presentation and complement our prepared remarks. For the Q&A, I would ask participants to limit follow on and multipart question so we can get to everyone. At the end of our Q&A session, I will turn it back to Ursula for closing comments.","Operator, please open the line for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess on the \u2013 the first one just on the restructuring, I just wanted to clarify the higher restructuring cost. Is the incremental more on the Doc Tech side or the Services side? What is included there?","Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, we expect the additional restructuring to span the business, both Doc Tech and the Services business, as well as our central corporate costs. So not focused on either side particularly, spanning both businesses.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got you. And I'm curious with the plans on the restructuring \u2013 I think we talked about this a little bit last quarter, just the impact on Services and signings and renewals. It sounds like nothing stood out this quarter, but how does it feel, Ursula, in terms of the conversation flow? I noted that the margins have been holding up even with some of the healthcare changes, so any additional color you can share there? Thank you.","Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think just focus a little bit on your question, yes, what we're seeing in the business and the actions that we're taking is to assure that when we separate these two businesses, and obviously in 2015 as well, that we get the cost structure and operating model right for these two businesses. When we look at restructuring and all of the strategic transformation programs, it's focused on leaning out the infrastructure of the business. So everything from spans and layers to how we approach the market from a selling perspective, how we approach the market from a supply chain perspective, et cetera. All in leaning out cost and efficient operations, not to impact our revenue flow or how we service our customers. And I think that what we've shown in the first quarter is the ability to actually do that, to drive restructuring and kind of fall in our expectation range and hold up our full-year commitments in both BPO and in Doc Tech and in the full company perspective.","So, I think you're right; we're trying to balance all these things. There's a lot of stuff going on, but I think we're keeping our eye on the ball and delivering fairly well. In line with separation as well, by the way, we'll do that by the end of the year.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right.","Jennifer Horsley - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Tien-tsin.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks for the answer (29:38).","Jennifer Horsley - Director-Investor Relations","Operator, next question.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah from Brean Capital.","Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So I guess just quickly, a question clarification. You guys mentioned $700 million in annualized savings this year. I was just hoping to get some context around that. How much of that is to the bottom line versus invested? And I guess my quick calc is it's something like $0.60, which is big. So, if you could give us some sense of pass-through versus invested. And then as part B of that, is the tax-free spin, are those tax saves in there as well? Just context around that and how that would hit? Thanks.","Leslie F. Varon - Interim Chief Financial Officer, Vice President, Investor Relations","Hi, Ananda. It's Leslie. So first of all, with regard to the $700 million of annualized savings this year, it's consistent with what we had previously said and underscores our commitment to deliver adjusted earnings of $1.10 to $1.20 this year. We, as you noted, increased the restructuring, quite frankly we did that in order to underscore our ability to deliver the range even though Document Technology revenues have begun the year a bit softer than we would have liked. So this year we don't anticipate investing any of the $700 million. Any investments of restructuring savings are ahead of us, not in 2016.","With regard to the tax-free spin, I think what we've said is it's tax-free from a Federal income tax perspective. Any tax dis-synergies associated with the spin or any one-time tax costs associated with the spin will be explicitly identified post the Form 10 filing, so as we get to quarter two earnings announcement at the end of July.","Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC","Awesome (31:50).","Jennifer Horsley - Director-Investor Relations","Great. Thanks, Ananda. Do you have another follow up?","Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC","I was just going to ask quickly, now that you've identified sort of the amounts initially of the cost saves, like where should we think about in the context of Ursula's comments, they lying across both businesses? What are just the major buckets for the cost saves and the efficiencies as we move forward? That would be helpful, thanks.","Leslie F. Varon - Interim Chief Financial Officer, Vice President, Investor Relations","So you should think about them benefiting both gross margin and SAG.","Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Right. In both businesses, by the way. In both the BPO and the Doc Tech business.","Jennifer Horsley - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Ananda. Operator, next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Thanks. Good morning. Ursula, can you discuss how you might frame up potential cost dis-synergies that will arise from the split, including how dis-synergies may compare with the cost synergies you originally achieved from the ACS acquisition?","Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","George, what we are going to do on dis-synergies is we're going to try to hold that conversation until the middle of the year when we can get a better grasp on what they are specifically and not kind of dribble it out. But some of the general dis-synergies are what you call independent company cost dis-synergies; setting up a board, those types of things are the general buckets. But we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves and kind of piecemeal it out. We'll have some very specific clarity in the middle of the year when we file some of the Form 10 documents and start to communicate more. But think about setting up two independent companies and the structures that you need for that.","Leslie F. Varon - Interim Chief Financial Officer, Vice President, Investor Relations","So, George, it's Leslie. If I could just add on to that a bit, we certainly expect that over time, the benefits from our strategic transformation will significantly outweigh any of the dis-synergies associated with running two companies. As you know, as Ursula just mentioned, there are certainly public company costs, but when you look at dis-synergies that typically impact other companies, there will be less that we face because we haven't done a tremendous amount of integration of BPO with what was the Doc Tech organization.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Very helpful. And, Ursula or Leslie, Services margins in the quarter came in below the full year guidance range, which means there will be a catch-up event that will have to happen later in the year. Can you discuss your expectations for the cadence of services margin improvement through the year and what those drivers are? Thanks.","Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Think about expansion throughout the year quarter-by-quarter, that's the expectation, the plan. Services margins came in about where we would've expected them to come in, we expected to be below the \u2013 at the lower end of our full year ranges in the first quarter; it's a seasonally lighter quarter for us in general, and second quarter will be better third or fourth, like that. We are fairly confident of coming in, and that's why we're reiterating the guidance on our Services margin for the full year and by the way for our EPS, adjusted EPS for the full year, our cash flow we've adjusted down, and in our Doc Tech we reiterated as well. So it's kind of come in where we expected.","Leslie F. Varon - Interim Chief Financial Officer, Vice President, Investor Relations","George, a couple of things. You know we took $126 million of restructuring charges in quarter one that should benefit both businesses as we move through the year. We've announced another $100 million of restructuring in quarter two, which should also benefit the margins of both businesses as we move through the year. We called out a specific weakness in quarter one in customer care, where we have new leadership that we've recently brought into the company and we do expect to be able to address some of those operational and efficiency challenges as we move through the year. So we're pretty optimistic about delivering the 8% to 9.5% Services segment margin for the year.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Thank you.","Jennifer Horsley - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, George. Operator, can we have the next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross from Cross Research.","Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC","Thank you very much. I wanted to dig a bit into the Doc Tech margins and especially given that this is a drupa year and there may be some, I would assume, timing challenges with when the expenses for drupa versus, theoretically, the benefits coming through on the commercial print side. So when we think about the 12% to 14% operating margin target that I assume you guys are holding to here, and you were at 10% this quarter. I know there's a lot of restructuring going on, but can you maybe give us some idea of how we should balance the need to invest in drupa, which only happens once every four years versus sort of the timing of the cost cuts coming through since you did lay off a pretty significant amount of people in the first quarter?","Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, so I'm going to start and then Leslie will chime in. And I just I want to start with a level of clarity about what we are reiterating. We are absolutely reiterating full year Doc Tech margins in the 12% to 14% range. That is, we are confident that we can deliver that. We are also reiterating Services margin in the 8% to 9.5% range. We are reiterating revenue \u2013 our revenue guidance and we are reiterating our adjusted EPS guidance. All three \u2013 all of those things, four or five I just mentioned are not changed at all. We did have lower delivery of margin in the first quarter for Doc Tech but we are very confident.","drupa, other product launches, timing of our save (37:55), the flow of currency and how it impacts our margins, they will all come out in the next three quarters, delivering somewhere between the 12% and 14% margins that we spoke about. Leslie can speak more on this as well.","Leslie F. Varon - Interim Chief Financial Officer, Vice President, Investor Relations","So, Shannon, just to reiterate, the transaction currency costs us about 100 basis points year-over-year in terms of the Doc Tech margin. So Doc Tech margin of 10.2%, down 250 basis points, 100 basis points of that was transaction currency. We believe that $19 million pressure in quarter one turns to essentially negligible in quarter two. And when you add on top of that, the restructuring benefits that we expect to capture, from the restructuring that we did in quarter one and that we're doing more of in quarter two, we're very, very confident of being able to get to the 12% to 14% range for the year. With regard to drupa, you're absolutely right. It is in the investment that we make once every four years but it is relatively modest compared to, for instance, the transaction currency headwind that we faced in quarter one.","Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC","Okay. Thank you. That was helpful. And then, Ursula, can you talk a little bit about just philosophically if anything has changed on how you think about the capital structure of the two companies once they're split? How you think about what type of debt pay down might be required on the Doc Tech side given some of the pressures or just has there been any changes as you work through the last few months looking at the split?","Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So the answer to that in general is no. And I'll answer the question from the combined company perspective. That's the best way to address it and we'll talk about the split companies when we get further in the year. Our ability to generate cash and to have it available to operate the business in 2016 is identical, nearly identical, to our ability to generate cash and have it available in 2015. It's really important that we understand that, you understand that. About $1.6 billion operating cash flow in the year in 2016. We have to spend more on restructuring which we talked about. I think that's a good investment, a very solid investment in 2016 and will benefit us some in 2016 and will definitely benefit the two companies as we separate.","We have separation costs which are unique in 2016. We'll have some in 2017 but a very small amount, a very, very small amount. We have normal CapEx of about $300 million. We have an additional $50 million of CapEx associated with separation that is also unique in 2016. That gives us a cash balance, a new free cash flow of somewhere between $600 million and $850 million, but most of that $850 million to $600 million, the reason why we're there is because of things that we don't expect to repeat in 2017. So as we flow into 2017 and leave 2016, we'll have a cash ability, generating ability of the two new companies that will be circa $1.6 billion just like it is this year without these one-time costs associated with the separation and with the bid restructuring that we're taking.","So we don't say that \u2013 we don't view that a lot has changed over the last four months that we've talked to at all. We're getting more clear which we expect to do. We get more clear as we speak to you throughout the year, but it is important that you keep an eye on the fact that the fundamental cash flow and fundamental operations of the business haven't changed that much.","Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC","Great. Thank you.","Jennifer Horsley - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks Shannon.","Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Jennifer Horsley - Director-Investor Relations","Operator, next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Schneiderman with BMO Capital Markets.","Steven Schneiderman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Thank you very much for taking my call. I'm pinch hitting for Keith Bachman today. So my question is regarding capital allocation. We noticed that you reduced the M&A target towards the lower end of the previous range. What I want to ask is, is that more of a reflection of market conditions, a focus on separation or more of a reduced confidence to get the deals in the pipeline over the hump? And as a follow up to that regarding, excuse me, share repurchases can you talk a little bit more about the decision to waive the share repurchase for the rest of the year and focus more on the debt reduction, what some of the puts and takes were and why the focus in that regard?","Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I'll start with the share repurchase \u2013 with the M&A and I'll have Leslie take the share repurchase. Last quarter, we guided that we would be in the $100 million to $400 million but at the lower end of the range. What we're doing this quarter is we're narrowing it to the lower end of the range. We don't expect for us to be in the $400 million range, so we've actually take that off. Most of the change is driven by the fact that we're doing separation. It's not really a big indication of any significant change in the market. We are pushing hard for the $100 million, as I said, between both Doc Tech and Services, with a big focus on starting these two companies with the right financial position and capital structures and that's why share repurchase, M&A, debt reduction are all being played against each other to assure that we have good capital structures.","For M&A, $100 million towards the lower end of the range was the ruling there. Share repurchase, Leslie will talk about it but we've moved share repurchase off the table. Did $1.3 billion last year, a very large amount of share repurchase last year and we don't think that we'll do any this year with the focus on debt reduction.","Leslie F. Varon - Interim Chief Financial Officer, Vice President, Investor Relations","So I think Ursula has stolen most of my thunder. As she said, we did do $1.3 billion of share repurchase last year and we have also increased the dividend, which is the other way that we return capital to our shareholders. With modest M&A this year, we are going to prioritize the remaining cash toward debt reduction in order to optimize the capital structure of both companies. So we're pretty intent on ensuring that each of the two new companies starts competitive, start lean and start with an optimized capital structure, and that's where we're focusing our efforts.","Jennifer Horsley - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Friedman from Susquehanna.","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to ask about this slide nine and the contract signings. I didn't hear you mention it in the call, but with regard to the 14% decline in contract signings, I was just wondering is any of that a function of your de-emphasis on government healthcare? Like is that really an apples-to-apples number or is there something else going on?","Leslie F. Varon - Interim Chief Financial Officer, Vice President, Investor Relations","So, it's actually lower renewal opportunities in the quarter.","Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Right.","Leslie F. Varon - Interim Chief Financial Officer, Vice President, Investor Relations","So we're really pleased with the renewal rate that we delivered in the quarter of 89%, which is at the high end of our 85% to 90% target range. But there were less renewal opportunities. We're also really pleased that the new business signings in the quarter were up 6% year-over-year. So, strong new business, less renewal opportunities, but strong renewal rate.","Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We do expect the renewal opportunities for the full year to be essentially the same as it was in 2015, but as you probably know, if you don't know now that renewals come up in the year at various times. So we expect the full year bucket to be about what it was in 2015, maybe a little bit higher.","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","That was my follow up so that's helpful. Thanks for the clarification.","Leslie F. Varon - Interim Chief Financial Officer, Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you.","Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Jamie.","Jennifer Horsley - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Jamie. Operator, next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex from Morgan Stanley.","Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Good morning and thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if I could touch a little bit on the BPO side of business, so up 1% constant currency. Given what you see in the pipeline, particularly with the signing of the toll road contract now and then New York MMIS coming, I guess how much visibility do you have into long-term growth? What might you anticipate that growth to be relative to, I think you stated last quarter, the BPO industry growing at 5% and what kind of levers should we look for as we go throughout the year to achieve those benchmarks?","Leslie F. Varon - Interim Chief Financial Officer, Vice President, Investor Relations","Okay. So it's Leslie. I think over the longer term we are certainly focused on growing at the market. There are clear industries where we participate well, like healthcare, like transportation, like customer care, where over time we, for sure, should grow with the market rate.","In the near term, we do have some puts and takes associated with some contracts that we have opted out of, or contracts that we've lost. So we're pleased with the BPO growth in quarter one and believe that for the year. It will enable us \u2013 BPO combined with Document Outsourcing, will enable us to deliver the Services revenue growth that we've committed, which is flat to up 3%. BPO will be a little lumpy in certain quarters depending upon the prior year compare.","Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Any color in terms of those contracts that you've either kind of skipped or opted out of and what the philosophy is around growing the business going forward? What were the dynamics of those contracts and were they issue riddled or pricing related or what might we be able to take away from those?","Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So outside of the government healthcare space where we've made and Health Enterprise in particular, where we've made a set of very conscious decisions to not complete the platforms. In general, if we move out of a contract it's because the contract profitability doesn't meet our thresholds; that's basically it. We don't have a lot of these, this is not a large bucket of business, but we are being very disciplined in ensuring that as we move forward with contracts that, particularly if they are not in the areas of focus for us, which are transportation and healthcare, if they're not in those areas, and they have very low profitability or marginal profitability, we will move out of those contracts, obviously working with the clients and not leaving them in the lurch.","Leslie F. Varon - Interim Chief Financial Officer, Vice President, Investor Relations","And as we think about the new business that we compete for, we're also being very measured in ensuring that the new business that we take on has the margin profile that we're seeking longer term for the Services business.","Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Jennifer Horsley - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Brian. Operator next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Cabral from Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. I wanted to dig a little bit deeper into the impact of currency and specifically the yen on Doc Tech margins. If I look at current spot rates on the yen, it looks like it will be up about 9% year-over-year across the remaining three quarters relative to a 4% comparison in Q1. I guess, with that in mind, why wouldn't we expect the margin headwind to get a little worse throughout the balance of the year relative to the 100 basis point headwind that you saw in the first quarter?","Leslie F. Varon - Interim Chief Financial Officer, Vice President, Investor Relations","So, Matt, there's a few things that I think you should understand about the impact of the yen. First of all, we have a currency risk sharing arrangement with Fuji Xerox, where they take half the good news or the bad news and we take the other half, that happens over time. Second of all, we do hedge and therefore the impacts of currency movements will be more muted and will flow in over time.","The last point that I would make vis-\u00e0-vis the yen strengthening in particular is that it tends to lead to a less competitive or a more muted competitive pricing environment; a good thing, and we also have the benefit of translating our equity income from Fuji Xerox at a more attractive rate when the yen is strong.","Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. And then, Ursula, as a follow up, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you've identified some ways to sharpen the business strategy and improve execution post split, is there anything that, at this point, you can share in those opportunities? And related to that, how should we think about the go forward strategy for the two businesses heading into 2017 after this bid is finalized, relative to how these businesses have been over the last few years?","Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think we've had a pretty intense engagement over the last, I think, let's say, six weeks or so, that has been refreshing; painful but refreshing in many ways, for both our Doc Tech business, Doc Tech with DO now, and our BPO business. We have found ways to improve three major areas. One is how we approach our customers, how we approach them organizationally and in what areas we dive deep with them and that should help us on the top-line, how do we organize that go-to-market in a little bit more efficient way.","Second is how do we adjust our cost base inside, particularly we've talked about this a lot, spans and layers which \u2013 where we've done a lot of work, but with the help of some outside resources we've been able to look at to find ways to even be more sharp there. And then as we separate the two companies, we're taking this chance to look at just about every other piece of the business that moves and figuring out a way to lean that out those pieces of the business that move, lean them out and be significantly more efficient.","The fundamental strategies though of the Doc Tech business and the BPO business, the fundamental strategies are the same. What we're doing here is we're rounding the edges a bit to make ourselves even more efficient. I was pleased with the work that we've done so far, but we still have some work to do.","Leslie F. Varon - Interim Chief Financial Officer, Vice President, Investor Relations","Yeah, as Ursula said, I think there's two primary outcomes. One is sharpening the strategy for each of the two businesses and then the second is, for sure, improving our strategic execution. And part of the strategic execution is the transformation that we've been talking about.","Jennifer Horsley - Director-Investor Relations","Thanks, Matt.","Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks.","Jennifer Horsley - Director-Investor Relations","Operator, next question?","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citigroup.","James Dickey Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you very much. Realizing that the separation has a lot of added costs and a lot of those costs are upfront breakup fees, can you help us understand \u2013 are 100% of them or the majority of them all going to hit this year? Or do separation costs continue beyond \u2013 so I'm talking separation, not to synergy which I believe that your synergy costs are permanent in nature?","Leslie F. Varon - Interim Chief Financial Officer, Vice President, Investor Relations","So the separation costs are dominated by both cost and outflows this year. There will be minimal costs that are incurred and cash outflows that are incurred in 2017.","James Dickey Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you. And then \u2013 go ahead, Ursula.","Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. I was just asking if you had more questions, so continue please.","James Dickey Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Oh yeah, as a follow up, on the Document Technology, it's clear it started off a bit softer than expected in Q1, but you're kind of (54:44) your goals for Document Technology for 2016. Is it through additional restructuring that's going to come in and close that gap there? Or easier comps or some visibility, there's something that you can give us some confidence because it looks like the operating margins, and just the whole segment overall is starting off a little bit not quite where you'd like to, so how do you close that gap? Thank you.","Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jim. Full year, we were careful to be clear about the full year this year because we know that we have a lot of ups and downs in any given quarter. On a full year basis, Doc Tech margins, Doc Tech revenue we are reiterating our guidance and confident that we'll be able to get there. So no debate there. As far as the margins go and the revenue in the first quarter, they were a little bit lighter than we would have expected but not anything that would allow us that would cause us, as I said, to change our guidance.","If you think about what we did in the second half of last year, and actually in the first quarter so far of this year, but in the second half of last year, we took no restructuring in the Doc Tech business. We did all of our restructuring in the Services segment, so we knew that we would have pressure in margins in the first quarter because we had literally no restructuring to offset the revenue declines. We've doubled up on restructuring in the first quarter. We have even more to do and we've announced an additional $100 million in the second quarter and we'll top the year at $300 million of restructuring which is why we are confident that we'll be able to actually hit the margin range for the full company that we talked about, the EPS that we talked about and the adjusted EPS we talked about. And the revenue shouldn't change that much.","So it's the way that the business is flowing, no restructuring second half of the year, big restructuring this year help us to maintain and drive the margin range that we talked about in Doc Tech and in Services and no we're not moving away from focusing on the market and we'll be able to actually hit the revenue guidance that we've given as well.","James Dickey Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you very much for the details from you and your team.","Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Jennifer Horsley - Director-Investor Relations","Great. Thanks, Jim.","Jennifer Horsley - Director-Investor Relations","That's all the time we have for questions today. Thanks for your interest. Ursula, anything to wrap up?","Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","This is, as you can sense from listening to the call, this is a significant year for Xerox. We have three fundamental commitments that we have made to our shareholders. The first is to deliver our 2016 guidance. We are on track to do that. We are reiterating our full year guidance in EPS and in revenue; we're doing that for both BPO and for Doc Tech and for the full company.","Second is to actually implement a strategic transformation that gives us two very strong companies, well-seated companies, on January 1, 2017. And we are well onboard, well on path to do that, and we are very confident in our ability to hit the second.","The third is to hit the separation date, which is January 1, 2017. A lot of work on that, going very well. And we're very confident in our ability to do that.","So these three things, we are focused on and we're pleased with the progress we are making and very confident in our ability to pull it off. So thank you for joining our call today and we'll see you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a good day."],"22865":["Xerox Holdings Corporation (NYSE:XRX) Q3 2019 Results Earnings Conference Call October 29, 2019  8:00 AM ET","Company Participants","John Visentin - Vice Chairman and CEO","Bill Osbourn - CFO","Ann Pettrone - Director-Corporate Finance","Conference Call Participants","Matt Cabral - Credit Suisse","Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital","Shannon Cross - Cross Research","Jim Suva - Citigroup","Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to the Xerox Holdings Corporation Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Release Conference Call hosted by John Visentin, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. He is joined by Bill Osbourn, Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com\/investor. At the request of Xerox Holdings Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and\/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without the express permission of Xerox. After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which, by their nature, address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein.","At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Visentin. Mr. Visentin, you may begin.","John Visentin","Good morning and thank you for joining our Q3 2019 earnings call. We delivered a strong quarter marked by increased cash flow, earnings per share and adjusted operating margin and we improved the revenue trajectory. Results were underpinned by the team\u2019s strong execution of our strategy to drive revenue, optimize operations, innovate and focus on cash. We\u2019ve recognized the challenges facing our industry, but have laid our focus on the opportunities and our path to standup a better more agile and competitive company for the future.","We\u2019re pleased with our cash performance. We generated $356 million of operating cash flow in the quarter, an increase of $82 million from a year ago. Free cash flow was $339 million, up $88 million year-over-year. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 12.1%, up 120 basis points year-over-year, strong evidence of the hard work we\u2019re doing as a team.","Margin expansion contributed to adjusted EPS of $1.08 in the quarter, up $0.23 year-over-year. The benefits of near term revenue directive initiatives are starting to flow through results. Third quarter revenue declined 5.3% at constant currency year-over-year in line with expectations. While we\u2019ve made progress, we\u2019ve more work to do here. Results paired with our execution give us the confidence to raise guidance. We\u2019re increasing our free cash flow outlook to be in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion from $1 billion to $1.1 billion.","We\u2019re also raising our full year adjusted EPS to $4 to $4.10, up from our previously increased range of $3.80 to $3.95. We remain on track to deliver at least $640 million of growth savings this year due to Project Own It, our enterprise wide initiative to simplify and streamline our operations and build the culture of continuous improvement.","During the first half of the year, we started executing several components of Project Own It such as transforming our shared services operations. As I previously alluded to, we intentionally move fast knowing there would be some disruption. The strength of our third quarter demonstrates our ability to rebound and react fast to change. We remain focused on managing our shared services operations to mitigate the risk of further disruption.","Our investment initiatives are beginning to take hold. For instance, Robotic Process Automation, RPA is enabling parts of our order to cash operation to increase accuracy and reduce the amount of time it takes to generate complex invoices from days to minutes. RPA also is driving efficiencies in new areas such as pursuit and bid development. Using this technology to respond to multi-faceted bids allows us to respond to RFPs in record times and knock-out competitors. This technology helps us secure new business with one of the U.S.\u2019s largest school districts for its intelligent workplace services. We see potential for RPA to be employed more broadly.","We believe our results show, we\u2019re marking meaningful progress towards establishing an operating framework that will continue to deliver sustainable productivity improvements. This momentum will continue into the next year as we progress with the planning of 2020 programs that we expect to generate at least $450 million of additional savings and allow us to increase investments in our business.","Our revenue roadmap is starting to take effect. However, there is more work to do to improve revenue and the team is laser focused on this. Our revenue trend improvement in the third quarter compared to the first half was largely driven by XBS, high end sale and our U.S. Enterprise business. XBS had the good quarter demonstrating the team\u2019s ability to rebound quickly from organizational and account changes we made.","Near term revenue generating investments in areas such as supplies and IT services also helped XBS improve its revenue performance from the first half. The trade and geopolitical friction was in Europe, particularly in developing markets continues to create a weaker economic environment. While [ERS] performance was in line with last quarter it was below our expectations. We did however see an improvement in transactional supply sales in Europe, where we made investments to improve the attach rate of Xerox supplies in unbundled equipment sales. To capitalize on growth opportunities in the region, we\u2019re increasing our focus on small and medium sized businesses.","Growing our software and services business is key to improving our long-term revenue trends. Healthcare, government, retail and insurance clients are experiencing fast evolving and user expectations, regulations and technological innovations that pose increasing challenges. We\u2019ve designed a suite of industry specific services that leverage our full portfolio from device to software including DocuShare and XMPie that address these challenges and allows Xerox to move up the value chain.","Our industry specific services specifically Xerox services for digital patients and digital citizens are seeing traction with new clients such as the Cardiff Council of Wales and expanded business with clients such as the U.K.\u2019s National Health Service. These services can also have an impact on the real world. In the case of Xerox services for digital patients, our offering enables doctors to have instant access to medical records helping to reduce the time to diagnose and treatment. Our services improved the patients\u2019 experience and more importantly let doctors focus on what really matters. Treating patients and saving lives.","We continue to invest in our core technology business and are seeing the benefits of this strategy. In the high end category, Iridesse continues to grow double-digits year-over-year. In the third quarter competitive knock-outs and new business drove nearly half of our Iridesse placements. Supporting our momentum in the high end is our recently announced Baltoro HF Inkjet Press. Compared to the competition, this first of a kind smaller press offers increased productivity and better image quality at a lower total cost of ownership. These differentiators have enabled us to build a strong pipeline within a few months and the team has started to deliver product.","We saw improvements in the mid range category. The product assessment where our rate of decline improved the most compared to the first half. We expect this momentum to continue with the recent launch of our PrimeLink line of equipment. In production, we believe there is no other competitor that can match with capabilities at this price point. PrimeLink positions us well to maintain our dominance in an area where we\u2019ve led for the past five years.","In early 2020, our new embellishment accessory will further differentiate PrimeLink and allows to capitalize on our installed base in this fast growing segment. This accessory allows clients to produce EMEA with florescence, gold, silver, wide and clear embellishments that until now required offset printing or much larger production devices. We believe there is no technology on the market like this or at this price point. In fact, the association for print technologies named our embellishment accessory a game changer, awarding us a Vanguard Breakthrough award. The association also awarded the Baltoro with a Vanguard Pioneer award making Xerox the only company to win two Vanguard awards this year.","Xerox has long been one of Americas best known brands. To reenergize our brand and build greater awareness of today\u2019s capabilities, we launched a digital first color campaign at the start of the U.S. Open around the tennis balls\u2019 color, a new capability now available on the iGen 5. For the second installment, we announced Xerox\u2019s first color of the year clear, acknowledging this are debates on whether it\u2019s even a color. The new campaign approach is driving strong interest in the Xerox brand with engagement rates higher than industry benchmarks.","We said since February, we\u2019re going to capitalize on and commercialize the research coming out of our labs and we\u2019re making progress with our innovation roadmap. Two products, AI workflow assistance and 3D printing are nearing the commercialization phase. The promise of bringing 3D printing for manufacturing has long been a futurist vision for advancing the industry, building on decades of experience in printing and material science, Xerox is turning this vision into a reality. The Xerox difference is liquid metal technology and our AI based designed software which allows manufacturers to make complex parts in hours instead of days without sacrificing quality or strength.","Similarly, our SAAS based AI workflow assistant that support knowledge workers with authoring business document has potential to disrupt the RFP process, an area where company spends an estimated $60 billion annually. We expect to introduce commercially available products in these two areas in 2020. We\u2019re pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made on increasing our cash flow and we still have more opportunity.","In the quarter, we improved all aspects of net working capital. Free cash flow in the third quarter was $339 million, up $88 million year-over-year. Our year-to-date free cash flow was $847 million, an increase of $195 million from the prior year. We repurchased $68 million of our shares in the quarter and distributed $61 million in dividends. As of the end of the quarter, we returned $551 million to shareholders including $368 million in share repurchases and we expect the repurchase at least $600 million of shares for the full year.","Before wrapping up, I want to directly address some of the most frequent questions we receive. There are macro-economic conditions such as trade and geopolitical uncertainties creating well known headwinds in our industry. Despite these conditions, we\u2019ve been able to improve our operating margin and cash flows and increase our planned investments for the year. We\u2019re taking the required actions to mitigate the risk; these uncertainties could impose on our business.","Our strong cash flow means, we\u2019re well positioned to accelerate our growth through M&A and can pursue opportunities big and small. We\u2019ve built a broad M&A pipeline that includes targets both within our industry and in adjacent markets. And we plan to deploy our capital opportunistically and strategically to increase our competitiveness and maximize the return on our investments.","Lastly, we conducted a thorough evaluation of our customer financing business. We received multiple attractive bids both for all and specific parts of this business and we took a methodical approach when evaluating these bids against the benefits of retaining the business. The bids confirm something we already knew, this is a valuable business. Given the strength of our balance sheet and where we are in our transformation journey, we determine that retaining and optimizing the business through Project Own It will generate the greatest return for shareholders.","Now I would like to hand it over to Bill to cover our financial results in detail.","Bill Osbourn","Thanks John. We are very pleased with our performance this quarter. As we said last quarter, we saw signs that our long-term strategy was gaining traction. Revenue in the latter half of the second quarter showed an improved rate of decline and we expected this trend to continue which it has. We increased planned investments as a result of first half margin expansion and continue to make these investments for the long-term while sustaining a profitable business in near term.","This quarter results from our transformational program Project Own It continue to materialize with expense reductions contributing 120 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin year-over-year. On the top-line, total revenue declined 5.3% in constant currency which is an improvement in the rate of decline in the prior periods driven by improvement in North America where performance in our XBS channel continues to stabilize from the disruptions that impacted the first half.","We generated $339 million of free cash flow in the quarter, which was $88 million higher than last year and year-to-date we have generated $847 million of free cash flow which is a $195 million higher than the same period last year. Adjusted EPS in the quarter was $1.08 or $0.23 higher year-over-year reflecting the increase in adjusted operating margin, higher equity income, a lower share count and the impact of a gain on an asset sale that we closed in the quarter.","I will now review the income statement in more detail. Total revenue declined 5.3% in constant currency and 6.5% in actual currency. The constant currency decline reflects 190 basis points sequential improvement, which as I mentioned was largely driven by North America where we saw improvement in XBS as well as in large enterprise, which benefited from a large account refresh order in the quarter. EMEA performance was in line with last quarter and less than our expectations as certain countries remain impacted by an uncertain and weaker economic environment. I will discuss revenue dynamics in more detail shortly.","Turning to profitability, our adjusted operating margin of 12.1% improved 120 basis points year-over-year and drove $10 million in adjusted operating profit growth. And the majority of the improvement was driven by expense reductions as our Project Own It transformation continues to deliver and offset the pace of our revenue decline. The improvement also included a 20 basis points benefit from a $5 million write-off of IT projects in the prior year that impacted this year's comparison.","Next, gross margin was roughly flat in the quarter compared to last year as savings from Project Own It mostly offset a 20 basis point unfavorable impact from transaction currency. RD&E as a percent of revenue was 20 basis points higher primarily due to lower revenue as well as certain investments in topline that we discussed last quarter. SAG improved 150 basis points as a percent of revenue driven by cost reductions from Project Own It as well as a benefit in the prior year from a $5 million write-off of IT projects that impacted this year's comparison.","Below operating profit, equity income of $58 million increased $15 million year-over-year continuing the higher trends seen this year and reflecting improved performance from Fuji Xerox in 2019 partially as a result of their 2018 restructuring initiatives and lower restructuring charges. Other expenses net of negative $3 million was $60 million better than prior year this improvement includes $43 million of non-GAAP adjusted items of which the vast majority or roughly $35 million is due to lower non-service retirement related costs, reflecting the favorable impact of 2018 amendment to our U.S. Retiree Health plan and lower losses from pension settlements in the U.S.","Removing these non performance items, other expenses net improvement primarily reflects a $90 million gain on sale of non core asset. Overall, as I mentioned earlier adjusted EPS of $1.08 was up $0.23 compared with Q3 2018, primarily due to improved operations, share buyback, higher equity income and the asset sale. The lower retirement related cost is excluded from adjusted EPS performance while the asset sale and the impact of the prior year write-off of IT projects are included in adjusted EPS.","GAAP EPS of $0.96 was $0.62 higher year-over-year reflecting the improved operating performance as well as retirement related cost improvements, restructuring related costs including restructuring related to Fuji Xerox, amortization of intangible assets, transaction costs and related costs associated with the terminated Fuji transaction, other discreet unusual or infrequent items and the tax effect on these adjustments. In Q3, we reported $27 million of restructuring related costs bringing the year-to-date total to $176 million. We continue to expect up to $225 million of restructuring charges for the full year.","Moving now to slide 7, which is our cash flow. We are laser focused on managing cash and this quarter we generated $356 million of operating cash flow which is up $82 million year-over-year. Free cash flow was $339 million, up $88 million. Key cash flow drivers in Q3 included approximately $90 million source of cash from working capital which is better year-over-year in every area; accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable.","Lower inventories reflect lower sales volumes and improved inventory management. The increase in cash from accounts receivable is due to lower revenues and to the timing of collections and the increase in cash from payables reflects the timing of purchases. Cash is a top priority for us and I'm very pleased with the improvement in working capital this quarter.","Contributions to define pension plans of $37 million was nearly flat year-over-year and cash for restructuring related payments of $17 million was $22 million lower than Q3, 2018. Year-to-date cash payments for restructuring totaled $71 million and when combined with $62 million of restructuring related payments reported in other current and long-term liabilities which were primarily related to severance payments associated with the shared services arrangement entered into HCL earlier this year and third-party consulting costs. We have spent approximately $130 million on restructuring. For the full year, we continue to expect up to $200 million of restructuring and related payments. Cash generated from finance receivables was lower year-over-year due to stronger originations. This is a good use of cash and we expect this trend to continue into Q4.","Through the third quarter we generated $895 million of operating cash flow and $847 million of free cash flow. CapEx of $48 million through September continues on the lower trend and we now expect full year CapEx to be around $75 million as compared to our previous expectation of $150 million. Therefore, we are raising our free cash flow guidance range for the full year by $100 million from $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion to $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion.","Lastly, with financing cash flows, we returned $129 million to shareholders in the quarter consisting of $61 million in dividends and $68 million in share repurchases. We managed our pace to share repurchase in line with our free cash flow generation and with the strong cash flow in the quarter, we were able to purchase shares. Through the first half, we returned $551 million to shareholders including $368 million of share repurchases and we expect to repurchase a total of at least $600 million of shares in 2019. We ended the quarter with $979 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash on our balance sheet.","Let's turn now to slide 8 for more detail on revenue. Third quarter revenue declined 6.5% or 5.3% at constant currency. This included a 70 basis point negative impact from the run-off of the OEM business. Overall, the rate of revenue declined is in line with our expectation compared to the first half and is primarily driven by stronger performance in North America, while EMEA remains challenged particularly in developing markets.","Our XBS channel continued to bounce back from the disruptions we experienced earlier in the year, at the same time we saw the expansion of IT services in XBS with a large field primarily installed in Q3. We expect ten of our core XBS businesses around one-third of the channel to be selling IT services by year-end. Looking at the detail, equipment sale revenue was down 3.3% or 2.2% at constant currency compared to a 9% constant currency decline last quarter. We saw improvement in many areas, but the biggest positive impacts came from high end sales, large enterprise in the U.S. and the ongoing mitigation of earlier operational changes in XBS.","I'll briefly elaborate on each of these drivers. First, high end equipment sales grew this quarter reflecting continued strong demand for our Iridesse color production system and higher sales of our Versant entry production system. We are also seeing a good response to the Baltoro inkjet press announced last quarter, which received a prestigious award for unique breakthrough technology at the recent Print 19 trade show and our most recent forecast indicates that we are on track to meet our expectations for installations of the Baltoro press this year.","Next, in mid-range, the U.S. equipment revenue compared to the prior year reflecting a large account refresh in the U.S. some of which occurred earlier than anticipated. Last, our XBS units showed improvement in the rate of decline as it continues to stabilize from the operational changes that were put in place earlier this year. EMEA on the other hand continues to be challenged by a weak and uncertain economic environment, particularly in developing markets impacting overall revenue. However, installs of mid-range color products improved in Western Europe.","Post sale revenue declined 6.2% in constant currency, which was a slight improvement over the rate of decline in the first half. The IT services sale on our XBS channel that I mentioned earlier is recorded in post sale. We also saw an improvement in transactional supply sales in EMEA where we made investments to improve the attach rate of Xerox supplies in unbundled equipment sales.","Offsetting these positives were the contractual component, which continues to decline on trend reflecting lower page volumes, prior quarter equipment sales declines and higher mix of low usage products, as well as lower paper sales in Latin America. Services revenue which is included as a part of both equipment sale and post sale revenue streams declined 4.6% at constant currency overall, but grew in the SMB channel. Services revenue comprised approximately 38% of total revenue in the quarter and 30% of services revenue was from SMB. The decline reflects the factors driving equipment and post sale as well as the impact of lower signings in prior periods. We are increasing coverage in SMB and have actions in place to drive growth in this area, which we are expecting the gain more traction in 2020.","To wrap up on revenue, in our results we are beginning to see the impact of the revenue related investments we are making, such as the improvement in supplies and the expansion of IT services sales in our XBS channel. We remain focused on our strategy and investing to achieve our strategic goals and are maintaining our full year revenue guidance to be down approximately 6% at constant currency.","Turning to slide 9, as mentioned earlier, adjusted operating margin of 12.1% increased 120 basis points year-over-year reflecting the progress of our Project Own It program which is on track to deliver $640 million of gross savings this year and provides an offset to the impact of revenue declines while enabling investments for future growth.","We are maintaining our adjusted operating margin guidance to be in the range of 12.6% to 13.1% full year. Our adjusted EPS expanded 27% year-over-year to a $1.08, therefore we are increasing our full-year adjusted EPS guidance from $3.80 to $3.95 to $4 to $4.10. This also incorporates expectations for investments in Q4, as well as the current assessment of the impact of tariffs that recently went into effect. While we are taking actions to mitigate the impact of these tariffs such as raising prices on certain products, at this time we are estimating approximately $24 million cost impact from tariffs in 2019 with a significant portion occurring in Q4.","Last, I will review our capital structure and I'll wrap up with a few words on the leasing business. We ended the third quarter with $4.8 billion of debt unchanged from last quarter, but approximately $400 million lower compared to year end as we repaid a March bond maturity with cash. We breakdown our debt between financing debt and core debt, financing debt is allocated by applying a 7 to 1 leverage to our finance receivables and equipment on operating lease which together comprise our total financed assets.","Core debt was approximately $1.6 billion, which is well inside our target core debt level of less than 2x annual free cash flow. We ended the quarter with $979 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and our core debt net of cash was approximately $600 million. As the debt ladder reflects, we have a $550 million bond maturing in December this year. We believe, we have access to capital sources as well as sufficient liquidity to handle upcoming debt maturities. In addition to the $979 million of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, we have a $1.8 billion bank revolver which is undrawn. ","Another important element of our capital structure is our pension assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2018, our net unfunded position was $1.2 billion which compares to $1.4 billion as of the end of 2017 and $2.2 billion as at the end of 2016 and it includes approximately $775 million of unfunded pension liabilities, which by design do not get funded. From a funding perspective, we continue to expect contributions of approximately $140 million in 2018, and believe we're well positioned to have a stable level of pension contributions overtime.","Before turning back to John, I'll provide some detail around the review of our customer financing business. As part of our business transformation, we embarked on the comprehensive strategic review of our entire business and customer financing was one component of that. As part of this review, we evaluated our own operations as well as a number of alternatives including a sale of all or a portion of the business. We received multiple bids with attractive premiums, but considering the IRR, ROI and cash flow yield of the bids received compared to retaining and optimizing the business through Project Own It as well as given the strength of our balance sheet and where we are in our transformation journey, we determined that retaining the business will generate the greatest return for shareholders.","Now to wrap up, we continue to execute on our strategy and this quarter we are seeing results. We improved our revenue trajectory sequentially and we are on track to meet our full year revenue guidance of down approximately 6% at constant currency. We also delivered strong cash flow in EPS, which allows us to increase our guidance for both of these measures.","I will now hand it back to John to summarize before we move to Q&A.","John Visentin","Thanks Bill. Our strong financials are an important part of our transformation story. But there are only one part. The hard work our employees have done over the last 18 months is yielding result. Our transformation is ongoing and we know we still have more to do. We are confident in our long-term strategy to return Xerox to growth and excited about the future.","We will now open the line for questions. Ann?","Ann Pettrone","Thanks John. Before we get to the Q&A with John and Bill, I will point out that we have in the appendix to our materials additional supplemental reconciliations and posted on our Xerox Investor Relations website a full set of earnings materials. Operator, please open the line for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Matt Cabral of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Matt Cabral","Thank you. I wanted to start off on revenue. Wondering if the XBS account transitions that you talked about being a challenge in the first half of the year, if those are fully back to run rate yet or if there's still work to do to improve execution there? And then, going into next year, just if you can talk about, if you're still comfortable with the guidance for down 3% that I think you laid out at the Analyst Day earlier this year?","Bill Osbourn","Matt, it's Bill. So addressing the first question XBS, as we said in our prepared remarks we're pleased with the improvement in Q3 and moving into past, lot of the disruption that occurred earlier in the year. With that said we still believe that there is improvement to be had there in Q4 and going forward within XBS. As far as guidance, really until, we will give guidance on 2020 in our yearend earnings call late January. So this time we're not formally updating guidance for revenues for 2020.","Matt Cabral","Got it. And then, margins continue to be the bright spot for you guys. John, I'm wondering if you talked a little bit more about the progress of Project Own It? Now that you're about a year into the initiative and in particular how you think about the potential for additional upside for the balance of this year going into next year and I think you had laid out 450 million for 2020 initially. So I am just wondering if that's still the plan.","John Visentin","Yes. Hi, Matt. That is still the plan. So we implemented a lot of changes with Project Own It. We reconfigured our go-to-market, our DMO, we transferred 28,000 accounts to XBS. We consolidated our real estate footprint and we're pretty much on plan to deliver $650 million, at least $650 million of growth and now we're getting on track to deliver our growth savings for 2020 which is $450 million.","Matt Cabral","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital. Your line is now open.","Ananda Baruah","Hi, good morning guys, appreciate you guys taking my question. A couple of revenue and then a free cash flow question, quickly if I could. So clarification, it sounds like, I hear you guys say that you achieved your revenue targets, your eternal target for September quarter?","Bill Osbourn","Yes. I would say if you look at the guidance we gave, the updated guidance at the end of Q2 being down approximately 6% for the full year that implied with the first half being around 7.1%, the second half would be around 5%, at constant currency down we ended up at 5.3. So, we're always striving to do better, but it was in the zone of what we were thinking about for the second half and being in the 5% zone.","Ananda Baruah","Yes, no doubt, that's helpful Bill, thanks. And could you just sort of rinse for us what you're seeing is the sort of order of magnitude, the contributing factors to the improvement you saw later in the June quarter and then sort of tracking to your expectations, sort of September quarter and forward? How much do you think, I mean, eventually couple things is new products is obviously the structure Own It initiatives, it sounds like you have some refresh of what\u2019s going on and then just sort of plain old macro. Anyway to bridge for us, you guys personally what you're seeing as the strength contributors that would be helpful and then I have quick follow up.","John Visentin","So Matt just to be clear you are talking more on the revenue standpoint or cash?","Ananda Baruah","On the revenue?","Bill Osbourn","On the revenue standpoint? So yes, I mean we sort of forecasted what we would be thinking would be happening in the Q3, based on what we saw late in Q2, we saw XBS starting to pick up late in the second quarter. We knew the pipeline. We had an IT sale coming, but with it said, in other areas like large enterprise and high end, there was the large customer refresh in the large enterprise that helped mid-range, but overall large enterprise performed well relative to our expectations in Q3 and high end, Versant and Iridesse demand continues to be strong and we were pleased with that.","Ananda Baruah","It sounds like for you guys it's more structural and that this stuff is somewhat incremental and maybe sustainable in the context that whenever a macro backdrop is?","Bill Osbourn","Yes, I think some of it is sustainable. You guys heard me, obviously we talked to the one large IT sales for other things within large enterprise, there was a refreshment overall things were doing well there and also in the supply side as we talked about in our prepared comments the unattached cash supplies we made investments in that area and we saw improvements in the unattached supplies, post sale revenue performance and we're expecting that to continue on into the future also.","Ananda Baruah","Thanks guys, one last quick one for me. You talked about the reduction in CapEx for this year. Is that really what's leading to the increase in the free cash flow guide or is there something more structural? I know this won\u2019t work in cap improvements and really what I'm wondering is your guiding up the free cash flow goal for this year. I know that in your three-year plan from Analyst Day, the intent was to continue each of the next three years to improve upon free cash flow. Now that you sort of reset the level up here, should we continue to expect sort of the aesthetic, the spirit of the three year plan to continue? So regardless of where you come in for 2019 free cash flow, can you increase in 2020, can you increase in 2021 still? And that's it for me, thanks.","Bill Osbourn","Yes. So couple things. So the free cash flow you are right. The CapEx contributes to that that also our confidence in that range raising, the range also comes from stronger working capital management throughout the year. So it's a combination of the two that's giving us confidence and raising the range. As far as guidance to the future in our three-year plan for 2020 was 1.1+. I'm pretty sure, we laid out there at Investor Day and we're not formally updating guidance at this point, but we're confident that 1.1+ still holding for 2020 and beyond.","Ananda Baruah","Great, thanks so much guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Shannon Cross of Cross Research. Your line is now open.","Shannon Cross","Good morning and thank you so much for the questions. I was wondering if we could start by talking about what kind of a competitive landscape you're seeing, clearly Xerox outperformed certainly in the U.S. But I'm curious as to pricing, how some of the competitors who are struggling a bit more than you are reacting to the situation. If you can just provide some color that'd be great?","John Visentin","Yes Shannon, its John here. What we're doing is, we're focused on a maniacal execution of our strategy. So we've invested in our transactional supplies organization and we're putting a focus directly on the clients. And we will always see a pressure on pricing, but if you think of our solutions where 85% of our businesses are wrapped in services that's a strategy that we have that's working for us and we're seeing a lot of competitive win backs with our new products like Baltoro and PrimeLink, those are competitive advantages. We're seeing some traction there, but it's really on investments and it comes down to blocking and tackling and that's where we are with the competitors right now.","Shannon Cross","And then, with regard to the large deal you had this quarter just, are there any more large deals in the pipeline in the near term and is that deal completely installed at this point or did some of it fall through to fourth quarter?","John Visentin","The large product represses was certain large customers, it will happen periodically each year, throughout the years. This one was mostly installed during the quarter. So it might be a little going on Q4, but with that said, even outside of that our large enterprise performed well especially in the U.S. And so, we have a confidence of continued strong performance going into Q4 even without those large customer refreshes, which tend to be more periodic in nature.","Shannon Cross","And then, my last question is just on M&A. Curious your balance sheet is in pretty good shape, is there willingness to lever up the balance sheet or we\u2019re looking at more sort of tuck-in deals and what kind of valuations are you finding out there? Thank you.","Bill Osbourn","What we said is that we're not going to comment on our M&A, but we've built a pipeline both looking at large and tuck-in and we're going to go through our vigorous analysis of it whether it's ROIC, looking at cash flow yields, looking at how it fits into the business, whether it's an adjacent or not into what we do and tuck-ins what we continue to look at tuck-ins, but all of it we're looking at it in evaluation. So we're using our evaluations to make sure that we're making a right flow.","Shannon Cross","So size is not as much of a consideration as contribution?","Bill Osbourn","No. It's not a question of size, it's really a question of where does it fit with us and then does it fit the metrics we're looking for it and it's all the usual suspects whether it's IRR, cash flow yield, ROIC where does that fit into the metric, EBITDA evaluation. So, we got a whole list that we go through and what we're saying is we're looking what size is not of an issue right now. We continue to look at tuck-ins and we continue to look at different opportunities.","Shannon Cross","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jim Suva of Citigroup. Your line is that open.","Jim Suva","Thank you very much. You've provided a lot of commentary and additional details which is greatly appreciated. I just have one question and that is, you increased your cash flow, your earnings, you made a lot of progress, but this stock buyback you kind of kept the same, maybe it's because the question you mentioned are the same in at least. But also it seems like on this earnings call maybe just what I picked up with my ear, you mentioned maybe M&A a little bit more than in the past. So is M&A be taking a higher priority than in the past or am I just kind of hearing that and kind of pulling that out as far as a priority?","Bill Osbourn","Yes, I wouldn't necessarily say that. We evaluate our capital allocation continuously. We have a plan for the beginning of the year and we will evaluate it throughout the year. We're comfortable with the $600 million this year in share repurchases and as John just said on M&A front, we're looking at various sizes deals to the extent that would make sense and complement our company at the right price.","Jim Suva","Right, but you got a lot more cash flow coming in and lower CapEx spending than previously thought. So I'm kind of wondering where do you kind of earmark those dollars to go to.","Bill Osbourn","Yes. I mean, we have flexibility in our allocation obviously earlier this year we paid down $400 million of debt that was due. We have $550 million. It's coming due here in the December timeframe that we'll evaluate on how to deal with that. We may initially pay for that out of our funds on hand and then refinance that later. But we believe, as you point out, the strong cash flow does provide us flexibility whether its additional share repurchases or M&A as John spoke to.","Jim Suva","Thank you so much for additional questions and answers. It's appreciated.","Bill Osbourn","Thanks Jim.","Operator","Thank you and our next question comes from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Katy Huberty","Thank you, good morning. What did demand linearity look like in Europe, did it deteriorate as you move through the quarter or was it just consistently weak? And you mentioned investments in SMB market within Europe. How long do you think it takes for those investments to convert to better growth?","Bill Osbourn","Yes. The demand in Europe was pretty much weak throughout the quarter for the most part. We didn't see it increasing or decreasing. I should say, it was weak relative to our expectations. We had expected Europe to do better in Q3 than it did. Americas performed within or slightly better than our expectations. I wouldn't say that there was really a ramp up as far as weakness in Europe during the quarter, but it was below our expectations throughout the quarter.","Katy Huberty","And SMB investment impact?","Bill Osbourn","Yes that some of it will take effect sooner than later to the extent we're looking at tuck-ins, those tuck-ins that are XBS like that we're looking to do that potentially over in Europe also obviously it's a timing of windows with them, with close or the extent we find those to actually act upon and then other areas as far as sales coverage, we're seeing particularly with XBS. We made investments in terms of trying to get better sales coverage and working through disruption we talked to earlier this year and we've seen a fairly quick response and turnaround with respect to that in Q3.","John Visentin","And if you think of our investments Katy, like our guidance for fourth quarter it doesn't materially change economic environment in Europe or for the year frankly. But, we are making investments now that in some cases can take a little bit longer. No different than what we have done in the last few quarters.","Katy Huberty","That's helpful and then just one other follow-up. Fourth quarter implied EPS guidance is a little bit lower than where consensus was coming into this quarter, is that just conservatism or timing of how it's impacting the most?","John Visentin","So, a couple of things. So yes, I was actually waiting for that question to come. I knew it would come here at some point. We looked at closely a couple of things to think of. One thing is the investments we are talking about. On last call we said, we would be ramping up in the second half of the year, the level of investments and that's true even from Q3 to Q4 in the investments we are making whether in the revenue side or on the Own It side. Those investments will clearly impact the core, but it will benefit us for the long term. There also will be an increased impact, Q4 we expect to have greatest impact of the year from the tariffs that were enacted in the September timeframe. And obviously that will have a year-over-year impact also. But those are just a couple of items to look to, but I think the high end of the range gets close to about what we were last year, but we just have those couple of variables that I mentioned.","Katy Huberty","Great, thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to John for any closing remarks.","John Visentin","Thank you everybody for being on the call. While we made progress, we have more work to do. And in each quarter we get better, but we will continue to do so by remaining laser focused on executing our strategy. Thank you for joining the call today.","Operator","Well, ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."],"22613":["Xerox (NYSE:XRX) Q3 2013 Earnings Call October 24, 2013 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Ursula M. Burns - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Kathryn A.

She is joined by Kathy Mikells, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com\/investor.","At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and\/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without express permission of Xerox. [Operator Instructions]","During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which by their nature, address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein.","At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns, you may begin.","Ursula M. Burns","Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. Before we review the third quarter, I'd like to take a moment to remind everyone that earlier this week marked the 75th anniversary of the invention of xerography. Back then, the vision was to make work simpler by automating the copying process. Since then, simplifying the way work gets done has influenced the development of our products and more recently, the expansion of our Business Process services.","We've remained true to that purpose. And today, we ensure that our strategy is linked to that original vision. It's key for moving Xerox into the next 75 years.","So let's review the strategy. The first plank is to shift our business more to services, while enhancing our services offerings and improving our profitability.","Services revenue now represents 56% of our total revenue, up from 51% in 2012, so we've passed the tipping point on revenue but still have work to do on margin. To this end, we continue to focus on improving our cost structure, while maintaining investments in particular areas where we see opportunities, such as health care.","Secondly, we are focused on maintaining our leadership in Document Technology and effectively managing this profitable business with strong cash characteristics. The past 2 quarters, we've shown good progress. This quarter, we saw revenue decline stabilize and very good profitability and continue our market share leadership with #1 equipment share revenue.","Delivering on these strategies will enable us to deliver consistent earnings expansion and strong cash flow, which we are committed to deploy in a balanced way that will enhance shareholder value. During Q3, we successfully delivered on our objectives. And although we still have work to do, I believe that we are moving in the right direction.","So here's a closer look at our Q3 results. We reported adjusted EPS of $0.26, GAAP EPS of $0.22, which includes $0.04 related to the amortization of intangibles. Total revenue was flat year-over-year, down 1% in constant currency.","We continue to see growth in Services, which was up 3% in this quarter, although it is flattening a bit as we lap a ramp of large ITO contracts and inorganic contributions. Services operating margin was 9.9%. And although an improvement year-over-year, it's an area where we need to make more structural progress.","Our renewal rate in BPO and ITO is at the high end of our range, with continued positive pipeline growth and solid new business signings, which positions us well for the future.","In Document Technology, revenue stabilized with positive results in Global Imaging and the high-end business, offsetting weakness in developing markets and Europe.","Segment margins were above the high end of our range, reflecting both continued cost and expense management, as well as the onetime benefit from our finance receivables sale. In total, margin was a solid 9.4% and up 50 basis points year-over-year. Good progress, but we have more work to do, and we have several initiatives underway that will deliver, over time, margin improvement.","Cash from operations was very strong this quarter, and we're on track to deliver at the higher end of the full year operating cash flow range and to exceed our threshold share repurchase targets. So all up, all in, we had good results in Q3.","As we look to Q4, we face greater challenges, where our revenue and operating profits will face some headwinds, so we remain well positioned in our markets and confident in our ability to expand earnings over time.","With that, let me turn it over to Kathy, then I'll wrap up and we'll open this call to your questions.","Kathryn A. Mikells","Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. Overall, we had a solid quarter. One key highlight this quarter was that we saw operating profit growth from both our Services and Technology segments. We also continued to see positive trends in leading indicators and strong cash flow.","Let's start with a look at overall earnings. Revenue was flat year-over-year but down 1% at constant currency, with Services growth of 3% and Document Technology decline of 4% or 5% at constant currency. We experienced a slowing in Services growth, which was expected and stabilization in Document Technology decline.","Gross margin of 31.5% was flat year-over-year despite the fact that the relative growth of our Services segment naturally pressures gross margin. RD&E and SAG were both lower year-over-year, benefiting from our ongoing productivity initiatives, as well as the greater mix of Services.","Operating margin was 9.4%. Flat gross margin and expense line performance resulted in a 50 basis point margin expansion year-over-year, driving operating profit growth of 5%.","There were specific dynamics in Services and Document Technology that contributed to this positive performance. I'll cover that in more detail when I get to the individual segment slides.","Adjusted other net of $79 million was flat year-over-year, with the benefits of a building sale offsetting higher restructuring in the quarter. And equity income of $43 million was a modest contributor year-over-year, reflecting continued solid performance trends in Fuji Xerox.","Our adjusted tax rate came in at 28%, about 4 percentage points higher year-over-year. Adjusted EPS of $0.26 was up $0.01 from 2012 and at the high end of our guidance range of $0.24 to $0.26. Clearly, this is 1 blueprint for the type of operating results we want to see going forward over the long term, recognizing that we have to overcome some near-term headwinds to consistently get there.","As we move into the segment performance slides, I'll run through the drivers of the third quarter results, as well as what we're expecting in Q4.","Turning first to Services. Services revenue growth was 3% overall, with BPO up 1%, Document Outsourcing up 5% and ITO up 8%. Growth rates are playing out as expected, with Document Outsourcing showing stable mid-single-digit growth, ITO growth beginning to taper and BPO growth being somewhat pressured as we begin to lose organic contributions and continue to absorb the headwind from the runoff of the student loan business.","Looking to Q4, we expect these dynamics to continue, with Services growth closer to flat as we hit our most challenging compare on student loans, ITO growth further decelerates and we lose inorganic revenue contribution. Additionally, we anticipate some increased volume pressure in wireless customer care.","As we look to 2014, we expect growth will begin to pick up again, driven by favorable signings and renewals, a strong new business pipeline and a richer and more mature pool of acquisition prospects.","Shifting to profitability. Segment margin was 9.9% in the third quarter, up 50 basis points year-over-year, driven by margin gains in Document Outsourcing, an easier compare given the prior year government contract write-offs in BPO, and savings from cost actions. Partially offsetting these positives were margin pressure from a less rich mix, as we've grown ITO and absorb the impact of the student loan runoff.","We've also seen increased expenses associated with the rollout of our new Medicaid platform and health care exchange operation. We're very pleased with the successful implementations of these platforms with Alaska's Medicaid Management Information System and Nevada's health insurance exchange both launched successfully this past quarter.","As with many large new programs, there's an initial period of higher costs during rollout, including noncash amortization of the platforms. We continue to be excited about these long-term health care-related opportunities and expect to gain scale and experience efficiencies over time.","Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect margin pressures to continue, with the year-over-year student loan compare being the most challenging of the year, resulting in about a $20 million decline in operating profit from that business unit. As a result, we expect Services margins will decline from the relatively strong 11.2% from the fourth quarter 2012 to about 10%, with full year Services margins a bit lower than 10%.","So while we're seeing positive trends in key performance indicators, we're in a transition period where we're pressured by line of business mix and investments. At our November investor conference, we'll walk through in detail the Services business' dynamics and actions that we're taking to drive sustainable margin improvement.","I'll now turn to Document Technology. Revenue in Document Technology was down 4% or 5% at constant currency this quarter, which was in line with the second quarter as the trajectory of the business stabilized. Equipment sale revenue year-over-year was up 1% for the total company and down 3% within Document Technology, reflecting continued good success from our recently launched products in mid-range and high-end.","Within mid-range, we continue to see good activity across the ConnectKey platform. High-end also experienced good growth in both entry and production color, and we continue to feel good about the improving trends and our position in this segment.","Finally in entry, once again, color A4 MFPs had good growth. But in total, entry continues to be down, driven by weaker results in developing markets. Overall, Document Technology margin was very strong at 12.1%, up 130 basis points year-over-year and above our target range of 9% to 11%.","On an absolute basis, this quarter's finance receivables sale resulted in a $25 million gain, boosting margin by about 100 basis points. However, the benefit year-over-year was negligible, as we had a similar gain in the prior year period. Contributing to the year-over-year improvement were cost and efficiency savings and a modest currency benefit from the weak yen.","Looking towards the fourth quarter, we expect Document Technology revenue growth down mid-single digits, generally consistent with the third quarter performance but with a bit more pressure in developing markets. In terms of margins, we expect they will be down versus the very strong 12.3% from the fourth quarter of 2012 but at the higher end of our 9% to 11% target range.","This incorporates lower finance receivable gains, as well as higher pension settlement activity and associated costs, as retirees seek to cash in their benefit before a higher discount rate goes into effect next year. So overall, good performance in Document Technology.","With that, I'd like to turn to cash flow. Cash flow from operations was strong, with $960 million in the third quarter and $1.4 billion year-to-date through September. Free cash flow was similarly strong at $860 million in the third quarter and $1.1 billion through the first 3 quarters.","While there are some timing differences coming into play year-over-year, one of the drivers of our improved performance is better contribution to cash flows from Services, which reflects improvements in working capital.","Looking specifically at the third quarter, the improvements in operating cash flow year-over-year was driven primarily by accounts receivable, which was a source of about $85 million this quarter versus a use of $319 million last year. The drivers of this improved contribution were improved DSO and a higher level of factoring versus prior year.","Finance receivables, although not much of a swing factor year-over-year, probably deserves further explanation. It was a source of a little more than $400 million this past quarter and in the third quarter of 2012, with both periods benefiting from a finance receivables sale.","Looking to the fourth quarter, we're planning another finance receivables sale, but it will be approximately $150 million or so less than the one that we did in the fourth quarter of 2012. Considering the smaller-sized sale and the lower collections due to past sales, we anticipate finance receivables will likely be a modest source of cash in the fourth quarter, which compares to a $260 million worth of cash in the fourth quarter of 2012.","Overall, we expect the fourth quarter operating cash flow to be close to $1 billion, which is lower than our traditional seasonality, due to the expected lower contribution from finance receivables, as well as working capital timing, which has been more smoothed out this year. Given the strong cash flow through September, we expect to end the year towards the higher end of our $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion range.","Moving down the cash flow report. Investing cash flows were an $82 million use in the quarter. We spent $102 million on CapEx; had proceeds of $41 million from asset sales, primarily the sale of our Dallas facility; and we spent $24 million on acquisitions.","Cash from financing was a use of $870 million and included the retirement of our $600 million senior note in September. Also included was $77 million of common dividends and $162 million that were spent in share repurchases.","Moving to the next slide, I'll walk through our capital structure and capital allocation plan. We ended the quarter with $7.5 billion in debt, which is $600 million lower than the June ending balance, driven by the senior note repayment, a portion of which we intend on refinancing. Applying the 7:1 leverage on financing assets, our allocated financing debt is $4.5 billion, leaving core debt of $3 billion.","Our financing debt continues to decline, driven by finance receivables sales and lower originations. Our strong year-to-date cash flow and expectation to be toward the higher end of our free cash flow guidance of $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion provides more flexibility with our capital allocation plan.","On share repurchase, given the positive cash flow trends, we expect that repurchases will be at least a couple of hundred million dollars above our $400 million minimum guidance.","On acquisitions, year-to-date, we've spent about $160 million relative to our full year guidance of between $300 million to $500 million. The slower pace of Services acquisitions has put a damper on Services revenue growth. But as I mentioned earlier, I continue to feel good about the quality and progression of the deals that are in our pipeline.","And finally, dividends will use about $300 million of cash, which factors in our Q1 dividend increase to $0.0575 per share a quarter.","So in summary, a good quarter. Document Technology has stabilized despite some weakening in developing markets but will face a difficult margin compare in Q4. Services continues to face headwinds that will knock down growth and margin in Q4 but the underlying metrics remain positive, and we continue to work hard at improving our cost structure.","As a result, we expect that fourth quarter total company revenue will be down a couple of percentage points year-over-year and operating margin will be lower than our prior year 10.6%, yielding an expected earnings per share of $0.28 to $0.30 for the quarter, bringing our full year EPS guidance to the low end of the range.","Our guidance includes approximately $0.02 of restructuring, as well as $0.02 negative impact from the higher noncash pension settlements that I highlighted earlier. Cash flow has been very strong, and we're on track to meet our capital allocation objectives, with an opportunity to do more in share repurchases.","And with that, I'll turn it back to you, Ursula.","Ursula M. Burns","So thanks, Kathy, and here's a quick wrap-up. Overall, the fundamentals of our business are strong. In Q3, we overcame headwinds in Services to deliver Services profit growth. We saw a stabilization in Document Technology, margins in line with expectations and strong cash flow.","That said, Q4 will be a more challenging quarter. We'll face more difficult compares and continue to absorb health care sector investments, while not fully realizing the benefits of our longer-term margin initiatives. For our fourth quarter, we expect, as Kathy said, adjusted EPS of $0.28 to $0.30. This includes approximately $0.02 of restructuring and $0.02 from higher pension settlement expenses.","And we are narrowing our full year adjusted EPS to $1.08 to $1.10.","Throughout 2013, we've navigated the headwinds of negative Services mix, a slowdown in developing markets and continued weakness in Europe, while continuing to make investments in areas of opportunities such as health care. We have delivered at the high end of our range over the last 3 quarters and with strong cash flow.","In spite of this, Q4 is anticipated to be a weaker quarter but I'm confident that we are taking the actions to position us better for the future. And we look forward to sharing them with you at our Investor Conference on November 12.","Before we open it up to questions, let me turn it over to Jim Lesko, who's the Head of Investor Relations.","James H. Lesko","Thanks, Ursula. Joining Ursula and Kathy today is Lynn Blodgett, Head of Xerox Services business. Also, let me point out that we have several supplemental slides at the end of our deck. They provide more financial details to today's -- to support today's presentation and complement our prepared remarks.","[Operator Instructions] At the end of our Q&A session, I'll turn it back to Ursula for closing comments. Operator, please open the line for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research.","Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC","I had a question on the Services business. Specifically looking at the operating margin, which obviously is below 10%, with only about 1% of growth in BPO. Can you talk more about what you're doing specifically from a restructuring standpoint, what kind of changes you're making, perhaps in how you're selling or where you're selling, balancing the mix? Just how are you going to -- how you're working on improving that. And then I have a follow-up.","Kathryn A. Mikells","Sure. So a couple of different things. First, I'll speak to restructuring in the quarter. We had about $0.02 of restructuring costs, Shannon. About 40% of the restructuring costs were for the Services segment. I'd say the biggest piece of restructuring that we're doing within Services is continuing to move our mix, right-shoring more offshore. And we've talked about that previously. I'd say we're making progress there but certainly looking to accelerate that progress, which will continue to have some level of restructuring costs associated with it. In terms of the overall mix of the business, part of what we've talked about is we've had negative mix kind of headwinds recently. We've obviously seen, over the past several quarters, the fact that ITO has tended to grow at a faster pace than BPO, and ITO has a lower margin overall than BPO. And so that's been giving us a negative mix. More recently, the additional negative mix that we're seeing is just the runoff of the student loan business. So from a top line perspective, as I look out to the fourth quarter, that pressures top line by about 1.5 percentage point. And from a margin perspective, that's worth 60 to 70 basis point pressure in the fourth quarter year-over-year. So that's some of the mix elements that we're seeing that are causing pressure. But as I look out forward beyond that, I continue to point to just overall strong signings, really strong renewals, strong new business pipelines. So year-to-date, Services -- our signings are up 30%. And within BPO year-to-date, signings are up 40%. And new business only within BPO on a year-to-date basis is up 8%. So I think we've got really strong fundamental trends. So as we look towards 2014, I'd expect to see, overall, our growth rate pick up and our mix start to improve, as we'll begin to lap things like the student loan runoff.","Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC","Okay. And then just again on Services, perhaps I don't know if, Kathy or Ursula, you want to talk about or whoever wants to talk about it, the health care opportunity, with $2 billion of revenue from health care services and the ACA starting in January. Can you help to provide some color as to how we should think about benefit from this in terms of both the revenue? And then obviously, this quarter, we were hit by the startup in Nevada in that. So how do we sort of balance thinking about benefits from the ACA as we look at 2014?","Kathryn A. Mikells","Yes. So within BPO, health care is our fastest-growing area, and we're clearly benefiting from our #1 position in MMIS. So on the Medicare side, we're very strong. We were incredibly pleased that we've been actually standing up the new MMIS systems successfully. I think if you look in the newspapers recently, if there's one thing that's clear, standing up these systems is not particularly easy. And so while it's certainly come with a little bit higher cost that's pressuring margins, we continue to look at our overall position in health care and feel very good about the fact that we're participating across a number of different sectors. We obviously have a very strong position in MMIS in state and local government. We clearly have a strong payer position on the private side, as well as within our support that we provide to hospitals. So we continue to look at the changes that are occurring in health care generally, in part driven by the Affordable Care Act, and view it as just a really great opportunity. And the really nice thing about platforms is while -- when you're putting a new one in place, you clearly go through some of the pain of standing it up for the first time. This becomes a pretty replicable process for us. And so we certainly think, over time, we're going to get scale and experience gains in that area. So we're really excited about these opportunities. And while I mentioned Nevada specifically as a health care insurance exchange that we helped to stand up, we're also behind the scenes, participating in at least a handful of others and we're gaining more experience. And so as more states look to put these in place, we view that as an area of incremental growth going forward. So we continue to be really bullish about this.","Ursula M. Burns","I was going to add something, but there's nothing else to add. Kathy said it all.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Barclays.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I want to talk about cash flow. You guys mentioned several times in the pre [ph] that cash flow was really strong. And I just wanted to challenge that a bit. I mean, without factoring in selling finance receivables, it looks to my math that cash flow is going to be much closer to $1 billion this year than something at $2.4 billion. I mean, I cover a lot of other companies. We never include factoring in their cash flow and we exclude factoring from finance receivables, and then you factor in the accounts receivable line. And that's not very well understood. And it would seem to me that once we get done with this factoring, then cash flow normalizes in like a $1 billion range, and that's below EPS. And it says something about the earnings quality as well. And I mean, how am I wrong on this? I don't count factoring. I mean, that's like a onetime gain, and it's flowing to the P&L as well. I just -- I don't really agree with this, and I want you to deconstruct it and explain how real cash flow is not really just $1 billion.","Kathryn A. Mikells","Yes. So I'm very happy to talk about this. So with respect to factoring, all the company factors in the very near-term receivables, and it's been a practice that the company has been doing for a very long period of time. So it really has absolutely no impact on the company's core operating cash flow performance. So all we're factoring is near term, call it, within the next 60 days. It's a very efficient program that we have, and so the costs associated with doing that are de minimis. We view it as a very economic...","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. The finance receivables, $850 million this year, and you just can't do that forever. I mean, you take out the $850 million from the $2.4 billion, and my math is still pretty close.","Kathryn A. Mikells","Yes. Can you kind of give me a second to walk through my explanation because I'm going to go back to start with? I think your math is completely wrong. So with respect to factoring, again, it causes absolutely no plus or minus to operating cash flow. All we're factoring is the very near-term receivables, and we're doing it because it's a very efficient form of, I'll call it, near-term financing for us with de minimis cost. If you look at what's going on year-over-year, we have a much smoother pattern of working capital this year. And so we're seeing some year-over-year changes, and that's just because we've got a much smoother pattern. I'm then going to turn to just financing receivables sales. So we did last year finance receivables sales. We're going to do about the same amount this year. That's just a movement in terms of timing, right? And overall, this year relative to last year, it's actually going to be a modest headwind as opposed to a gain year-over-year. By doing those finance receivables sales, we actually kind of trigger a need to pay down debt because our finance receivables actually get a much higher leverage factor. And so it really isn't anything that ultimately changes our overall cash profile. And I guess, if I get down to sort of the nuts and bolts at least of what some of our investors, I think, are focused on, which is capital allocation and how much excess capital we have to deploy against things like share repurchases, as I look out to 2014, while we may have some year-over-year differences in terms of the level of finance receivables sales the company may do, I think we're going to have a very consistent and balanced approach in terms of overall capital allocation continuing to look to do a meaningful amount of share repurchases.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Well, I think that you might want to change that definition to cash flow x financing, so we can look at it apples-to-apples. And I don't think everybody understands it. I really don't because when you put it in above the line, it makes it seem like it's real cash flow. And it's just a very unique way of portraying it, and I would highly suggest that. And I appreciate the answer.","Kathryn A. Mikells","Yes. And certainly, I think our disclosures on this have been very fulsome. And if you don't get the math right, I certainly encourage you to talk to our IR group after the call because I think...","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","No, I think I get the math right. I think I get the math right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Tong with Piper Jaffray.","George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Services signings this -- for the past 12 months was up about 9% but fell 7% in the quarter due to the timing of contracts eligible for renewal. How does the renewal pipeline look like going forward? Do you have more contracts coming up for renewal in the coming quarters that can help drive improved performance in Services bookings?","Lynn R. Blodgett","The renewal pipeline tends to be -- it will be a little bit lumpy just based on the exact timing of a particular contract, and then 3 or 4 years later when it comes up to renewal. But in general, the renewal rates pretty much average across the average contract life. And right now, we're somewhere between 3 and 4 years. And you're going to see a little bit of lumpiness from 1 quarter to the next. But overall, if you look at a year -- the cumulation of a year, it's going to be pretty consistent.","George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And as a follow-up, the upcoming fourth quarter does pose some particularly challenging revenue and margin comps and operating environment. Could you talk about how we should think about, from a Services perspective, revenue growth in 2014, factoring in the headwinds from the student loan processing business and your ramping businesses with the Affordable Care Act? And how we should think about margins going forward, if we can continue to expect a step-up in margins, acknowledging that 2013 will be somewhat a flat to slightly down with the Services margins?","Kathryn A. Mikells","Yes. And so I'm going to talk a little bit about what we're seeing in the fourth quarter, and then I'd say, at a high-level expectations for 2014. But we're going to talk a lot more in detail at our investor conference for 2014. So if you just look at what we're expecting, we're seeing in the fourth quarter, clearly, the runoff of the student loan business is giving us a big headwind on revenue, with that basically worth about 1.5 points of headwind on revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Acquisitions have historically been kind of a 2% to 3% revenue growth driver for us. And so if I look at the fourth quarter in the prior year period, 2012, it was worth about 2 points of growth, and it's going to be worth about nothing in the fourth quarter of this year. And so that's a near-term headwind. But certainly as I look out to 2014, we would expect that we'd actually have more acquisitions, and therefore, more growth coming from that area. And on student loan, obviously, we're seeing the biggest impact in the fourth quarter. And so as we head into next year, that impact will be kind of early on a headwind for us. And then as we get towards the end of next year, we'll start to lap that. As you mentioned, in your first question, I mean, overall, we've continued to have really strong signings and renewal and new business. And so as I look out into 2014, the year may start a little bit slower, but we certainly expect that new business and acquisitions will help us to then pick up overall growth.","George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","That's helpful. And how would you think about the margin cadence playing out?","Kathryn A. Mikells","Yes. So in terms of the overall margin cadence, as I look forward, the impact year-over-year from the student loan business runoff actually abates a little bit next year in terms of margins. So this year, it's worth, on a full year basis, about 35 basis points of margin headwind. Next year, that's probably closer to 25 basis points of margin headwind. I think really importantly, while we're starting to see some positive pick-up in terms of offshoring, that obviously takes a little bit of planning and timing to implement, and we'd expect a lot more gains from that as we head into next year. So I think those are some of the gives and takes. And then in terms of overall mix, typically, acquisitions are margin accretive to us. We're obviously looking to acquire things that have significant synergies associated with them, and we tend to target businesses that would be margin accretive. And the ITO growth slowing, that also just will help us from an overall mix perspective on margins. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit on the puts and takes. And obviously, this is an area of a whole lot of focus on from our part, and I think we're going to see progress.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I wanted to just ask about Services, please. And if I think about your calendar year EPS guidance, the pension expense wasn't in there. So it looks to me like you're taking down guidance by about $0.02 or $0.01 to $0.02, and yet the printing side of the business outperformed. So it really seems like the variance was on the Services side. And so if I think about it, it raises the problem from investor's perspective of consistency of execution, which in my mind comes back to leadership. So I'm really trying to understand what changed to cause you to take your calendar year guidance lower. And specifically student loan was known. You've talked about that since the March quarter. So was it the magnitude of the student loan? What -- or was it the ramp down of BPO. Because as part of this whole, I think, disappointment in the Services side of the business -- in addition, the signings were relatively weak for the quarter. So if you could just really address what was the disappointment from 91 days ago when you gave guidance on the Services side of the business?","Kathryn A. Mikells","So a couple of things I'd say just in terms of new pieces of information. So a, we had certainly expected that we were going to have more from acquisitions in the fourth quarter. And so while the pipeline looks rich, I think deals are maturing. We had hoped we'd be able to close things sooner than is occurring. And so that's, I'd say, a near-term headwind, but certainly one as we look out to 2014 that we don't expect is going to continue to occur. The other thing I mentioned is on the one hand, we, I think, did a terrific job in terms of standing up MMIS systems and the Nevada health insurance exchange. That has caused some near-term pressure. I mean, those things are not easy to stand up, and so we're making more investments there. Those are a couple of things. I also mentioned in my prepared remarks that we're seeing a little bit of volume decline on the telecom side. And so we had a major telecom customer that got acquired by another company. And as a result of that acquisition, they're taking a little different approach. We're seeing some volume decline. So those are specifically the things I'd say if I backed up 90 days that I didn't have completely in view. And I'd also say that as I look at all of those things and I look forward into 2014 and beyond, I view them as transitionary and temporary factors.","Ursula M. Burns","And Keith, as far as leadership goes, we have an experienced team. We bring in on a regular basis new executives into the fold that could help us to refine our implementation and refine our approach to the business, and we're doing that every month, every day. We have 2 new executives that are particularly promising. I won't say their names because then they'll believe they're promising as well. But -- so I think that we actually have -- I have a very, very good view on weaknesses and strengths of our Services leadership team. And where we have weaknesses, we try to augment it or -- and move forward. So I am actually confident in our Services leadership.","Kathryn A. Mikells","And then the last -- sorry, the one more thing I wanted to add is you mentioned kind of weak signings in the quarter. We already mentioned that on the renewals. We just had not many renewal opportunities in the quarter. And so renewals were light just because we didn't have many opportunities. But year-to-date, overall Services signings are up 30% and BPO signings are up 40%. So I think the underlying trajectory there is very positive.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. For my follow-up then, could you just talk a little bit about what investors should anticipate directionally or any kind of dimensions with Q4 signings? So if you have some idea how signings look for the year.","Kathryn A. Mikells","Yes. We expect Q4 signings are going to be modestly positive year-over-year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.","Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Digging into the Affordable Care Act a bit more, can you remind us of your exposure here across Xerox and help us quantify it a bit better? Because we obviously get a lot of questions on this. And I'm trying to deconstruct your comments a bit. Is 2014 a year where you really start to see the steady state net benefits from this exposure?","Kathryn A. Mikells","Yes. I mean, overall, our health care business, kind of across our health care business, is about $2.5 billion in revenue, just to give you an overall sizing. As we look forward, it is one of the fastest-growing areas that we have within BPO, and we expect that to continue to take place. We've always been and are #1 in terms of MMIS. As we look at the opportunity of standing up the Nevada health insurance exchange, I think that's an area where as states look to move from the federal system and implement their own exchanges, that's a great area of growth and participation for us. We also participate in private exchanges. So as companies look to move to, I'll call it, more of a defined contribution approach to how they support health care for their employees and trying to give their employees then a lot more freedom of choice for what they choose to then purchase. We're also participating in that market, and I think that's clearly another area of growth. And some of the things we bring to the table there is both our ability to stand up for somebody, I'll call it, a portal for employees to come to and choose, an ability to kind of go in and look at their employees' demographics and actually choose providers then that will kind of go into that network that are a good fit for their employee base. And then we put all of the support around that as well. So I think those are a couple of different areas where we have really good growth opportunities. And we continue to be really bullish. I mean, we participate, really, across this industry. We come at it from a bunch of different ways. That gives us a lot of insight. I think we've been in this business for a long period of time. We've got a lot of expertise that we bring to the table, and we think it's going to be a very good area for us for years to come.","Ursula M. Burns","And one of the things that the previous questioner asked is something important to note. As Kathy said, we participate across the board. If you look at our pipeline, our signings, our pipeline, if you look at the percentage of our BPO and ITO business that is actually focused on health care, it's all positive signs, which is good. We kind of surround this from government payer, provider, employer. It's a good participation. It's hard to do. It's hard to stand them up. I'm very pleased that we've actually been able to stand up exchanges and an MMIS system actually operating, taking customers' calls, et cetera, et cetera. It cost a little bit more than we thought. It would cost -- and that's one of the pressures that we saw in the third and we'll see a little bit in fourth. But we have done it now. And so the bulk of the investment won't have to change. We have to modify for every engagement a little bit of the system, but not as big a modification as before. And that's one of the things that we are learning. I think other people are learning it as well. So I'm actually pleased with health care. It's a big piece of our business, and I think we have some proof points that will show it will be good on a go-forward business as well.","Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","If I could just have one follow-up, another area of Services. Looking at Document Outsourcing, you guys have had a leadership position here in the past. But the competition is getting pretty intense, and we're seeing some pretty good numbers from some of your smaller competitors, suggesting they're starting to gain share at a fairly rapid clip. Given that this is such an important part of the Services business but also an important secular counter to what's going on in the Technology business over time, can you talk about how you're looking at your market share momentum here and what you could possibly do to -- to reaccelerate it from here?","Ursula M. Burns","I'm just going to start and then I'll have Kathy answer some of the details. We are extremely pleased with Document Outsourcing. The last 3 quarters, last 2 in particular, it actually outperformed even our expectations. The external market actually sees us as a market leader, independent assessors do. And our growth would dictate that we're a market leader as well. And I don't think that your statement that competitors are gaining share at a pretty rapid clip is actually true vis-a-vis us. Actually it's not so at all. So...","Kathryn A. Mikells","Yes, I think importantly, right, we're the folks who invented Managed Print Services. As a result, we've been in this business for a longer period of time. I think we're much more evolved. And we have a bigger base of business that we're growing off of. So rather than having a business that's in its relative infancy, where kind of in the beginning, you get really big growth rates because you're growing off a very small base. We have a much more sizable business here to start with, and we've been very pleased with our growth rate. One of the things Ursula just mentioned in terms of third parties taking a look at our offering and putting us against our competitors and really feeling like we're incredibly strong positioned, recently, Gartner came out with a study showing us that in their metric [ph] quadrant, which is where this Managed Print Services Document Outsourcing resides, that we actually gained some distance on our competitors recently. And so that's in part because we have a very fulsome vision and really, really good execution in this area. And as we look at, I'll say, the synergies between our Services business and our Document Technology business, this is really one area where we're continuing to evolve, right, into workflow from our Document Technology side of the business through Managed Print Services and Document Outsourcing. And that's a natural adjacency then over to our Services business, right, where we have Business Process Outsourcing. So that's where those 2 businesses meet. We've been at this for a long period of time. We've got deep vertical expertise. We feel great about this area of our business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.","Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I wanted to ask a couple of follow-up questions on topics that were covered earlier, specifically around the margin impact from renewals and new business signings. How did those 2 factors come into play as we think about 2014 margins in Services?","Kathryn A. Mikells","In this area, I would say it's normal course of business. We always know as we renew business that we're typically giving some level of discount. It isn't as if the pressure that we're seeing is any more or less than -- we always understand that, as we're heading into this business. It's all about we stand up new business, we get more productive and efficient over the course of the contract period, preparing for the fact that we're going to have a price decrease as we renew that business. So there's nothing new or different in that.","Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","When I listen to the puts and takes around Services margins heading into next year, it sounds like there's a lot more puts than takes. So maybe can you clarify, do you think margins will be flat or up or down in Services in 2014?","Kathryn A. Mikells","Certainly, I would say with regard to the fourth quarter of this year, I'd agree there's more puts than takes, which is why we're expecting to see a year-over-year margin decline. We're going to talk more about 2014 at our Investor Conference, but I would not at all conclude that we'd see more puts than takes as we head into 2014. And I'd specifically refer to a big opportunity that we have, which is to shift more of our labor mix offshore, right? So that's a very big opportunity for us and an opportunity that, from an execution basis, is a bit still in its infancy today, takes some planning, takes some time to implement, but it's certainly something that we're looking to do in a very aggressive way and in a way that we think will be impactful in 2014. Another thing I would just point to that we're doing, where we get secondary benefit from more offshoring, is we entered into a strategic relationship with Cognizant, who helps us on platform development implementation. And it's kind of a secondary way for us to get a little bit more offshoring exposure because they obviously bring a lot of that to the table, as well as great expertise that's helping us to successfully stand up some of these new platforms.","Ursula M. Burns","So just so we're not confused on the puts and takes because I'm a little bit confused on which one is the put and which one is the take or what you mean by it. I think just so that we're clear on the call, I would expect we'll get into significantly more detail on this in November at the investor conference. But we expect not margin expansion, margin improvement to be in the range of 10% to 12% in 2014. I don't know if you'd consider that a put or a take, but that's what we expect to be.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And a lot of the questions have been focused on the Services, which I think is very warranted, given what the stock is reacting in the big change there. So I'm going to again focus on that because I think that's the real struggle. I understand how you're talking about the trailing 12 months of Services, but this quarter, the signings took a real big decline year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, and the profitability for both this quarter and outlook appears to be materially below your expectations, now dipping below 10% compared to, you said, 10% to 12% in the lower end of the range of that just a few months ago. So can you give us one more try of clarity of how we can get assurance that this isn't a perpetual trend? And shouldn't it then just rebound pretty remarkably for signings in Q4, if you talked about timing? Or was it just the first half of the year where it was unsustainably too high?","Kathryn A. Mikells","Okay, I'll take a couple of different pieces of it, and if I don't touch on them all, please come back with your follow-up because you had a couple of different things. So a, year-over-year growth in signings for the quarter was down 7%. It was down because we did not have as rich, as high volume renewal opportunity in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, Services signings are up 30%. Okay, so quarter-to-quarter, sometimes, we have a big renewal opportunity; sometimes, we have a smaller renewal opportunity. This particular quarter, we had a smaller renewal opportunity. But year-to-date, our signings overall are up. If we look overall at some of the pressure we're seeing in margin, I'd start with this quarter's margin was 9.9%. We said we expect it to be at the low end of the range of 10% to 12%. That's 10 basis points below the target. Overall for the full year, we said we think we're going to be a little bit lower than 10%, again, a little bit lower. We're now kind of cutting hairs a little bit. But on a year-to-date basis, our margin is 10 -- I'm sorry, 9.8% in Services. So our margin is a little bit lower. We're not talking leaps and bounds here. We're talking a little bit of margin pressure. And as we look towards 2014, as Ursula just mentioned, we're expecting we're going to see margin expansion. Some of the margin pressure that we're seeing are from factors that their nature is they're going to be short term, and we will start to lap them in 2014. The runoff of the student loan business overall is clearly one of those factors. The fact that we haven't had any contribution from acquisitions, which are typically margin accretive, are another one of those factors. We've had a little more pressure on margins as we have stood up some of these new platforms. That's not unusual, but these things are now going to become for us repeatable processes, right? We will get better because of experience and we'll get better because of scale. So as I look forward into 2014, I think we've got great opportunities in the health care sector. Overall, our year-to-date signings growth has been really positive. The weak quarter of signings is really just because we didn't have a big renewal opportunity. So overall, I think the underlying factors here continue to be really solid, and we're looking forward to margin expansion and our growth rate picking up next year.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And as a quick follow-up, so with that expansion next year, I assume that also includes the additional cost of ramps, the additional cost of Affordable Health Care Act that's coming in, and so we are not looking at setting up for 10% to 12% range for expansion. And then coming back with a justification 3 or 6 months down the road of additional costs of ramping. I want to make sure you have involved some ramping costs in that.","Ursula M. Burns","Yes. In a normal quarter, George -- I mean, Jim, we would actually -- if there was ups or downs, I mean, we basically would just cover those in our -- in the range that we have. So for '14, I would expect that we would do that like we do anything. We have some volumes up, we have volumes down, we have start-up costs up, et cetera. This fourth quarter -- this quarter, we actually came in pretty close. I mean, it's, as Kathy said, very, very narrow differences. We came in pretty close to where we expected to come out in margin, in revenue, in earnings, actually a little bit higher in earnings. Fourth quarter, we see headwinds, temporary headwinds. And then in '14, we expect to actually just be in a regular roll, like we are in most of the quarters in '13. And it's important, Jim, as well that you understand the signings dynamic. We've had a couple of quarters since we've brought ACS and gotten deeper into the Services business. We've had quarters where we had low renewals, and we've been trying to be very clear about how to actually look at those. And when you have a low renewal volume, they do have an impact because of the way that we calculate this or the industry calculates this. It has an impact on the signings number. And that's one of the reasons why it's important to not just look at the quarter, which we actually do focus on, but to look at all of the signings for the quarter, the new business signings for the quarter, the renewals that are available and the renewal rate. And so we try to give you all of that data. Signings, renewals, new business, et cetera, should not be a concern. All of the numbers look good from a go-forward basis, from a revenue perspective in Services across all of the businesses.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.","Mark A. Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First, I want to second -- Ben's motion regarding more transparent or cleaner cash flow reporting. I think just given investors are really focused on that dynamic. As far as my questions, kind of along that same line of thought. Kathy, can you just remind us in terms of what your priority is with the Services business going forward? Is it top line growth? Or is it Services margin? Because I think -- I'm just trying to figure out how you really jump start the Services revenue growth profile going forward. Is it going to really be about acquisitions? And if it is going to be acquisitions, doesn't that kind of steal from capital allocation in terms of stock buyback, which has been a big part of investor psychology right now?","Kathryn A. Mikells","Yes. So the focus is profit expansion, and I say that's the focus across our entire business. In terms of how we get to profit expansion, I do think that we have a very good opportunity in getting to profit expansion in the Services business by growth, as well as by margin expansion. So there, I expect to actually see both things occur. With respect to acquisitions, we've been light on acquisitions. The reason I've been talking about the fact that acquisition is a factor because it historically accounted for 2 to 3 points of revenue growth within Xerox business services. And right now, we're not getting any revenue growth or profit growth, for that matter, from acquisition. But I don't expect it at all to take away from our balanced approach in terms of capital allocation.","Operator","Your next question comes from Kulbinder Garcha with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","James H. Lesko","If Kulbinder is not able to pick up, I think we are close to our end time. So I think we should say that's all we have for questions today. And Ursula, do you have anything else you'd like to wrap up with?","Ursula M. Burns","Yes. So thanks, Jim. We covered a lot of ground this morning. So let me bring it up a couple of levels. Q3 results and our continued focus on squarely and effectively implementing a sound and consistent strategy, which is to be Services-led and to grow, profitable leadership from our Document Technology business, cash generating annuity-based business model, to deliver consistent EPS expansion and financial strength to invest in building value for Xerox and in building value for you. That's our focus. I'm confident that we'll deliver, and hope that you can join us or listen in to our Investor Conference on November 12.","James H. Lesko","Thanks, Ursula.

He is joined by Bill Osbourn, Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com\/investor. At the request of Xerox Holdings Corporation, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. Other recording and\/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without the express permission of Xerox. After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which by their nature address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein.","At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Visentin. Mr. Visentin, you may begin.","John Visentin","Good morning and thank you for joining our fourth quarter 2019 earnings call. Last February, we put a three-year plan in place, guided by our strategic initiatives to optimize our operations, drive revenue, reenergize our innovation engine, and focus on cash. 2019 was focused on building a strong foundation that will position us for sustainable long-term growth. And among other things, we expanded Project Own It, our enterprise-wide transformation initiative to optimize our operations, drive investments back into our business, and create a culture of continuous improvement.","We\u2019ve monetized our illiquid 25% stake in Fuji Xerox for over 20 times that asset\u2019s annual cash flow, unlocking significant unrealized value. We implemented a more frictionless, high-velocity supply chain to increase flexibility and customer responsiveness. We invested in technology enhancements and product launches designed to increase revenue in core and adjacent markets, as well as new areas of innovation for future growth.","We stood by our commitment to innovate and put the brainpower of our best scientists and engineers on solving some of the biggest challenges the modern world is facing, and we promoted and attracted new talent at all levels of the organization to elevate our game.","We ended 2019 stronger, delivering full-year results that are ahead of schedule on almost all financial metrics. Our employees are excited about the future and direction of their Company and clients increasingly seek us out for workplace solutions.","Our full-year results position us well to deliver on our three-year commitment of expanding adjusted margins by 200 basis points, growing adjusted EPS annually by more than 7%, generating more than $3 billion of cumulative free cash flow, and achieving flat year-over-year revenue in 2021.","In the fourth quarter, we grew earnings per share, increased cash flow, expanded adjusted operating margin, and maintained the momentum to improve our revenue trajectory compared with the first half of the year. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was $1.33, an increase of more than 40% year-over-year. Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 16.8%, up 270 basis points year-over-year.","Fourth quarter revenue declined 1.6% at constant currency year-over-year. Excluding an upfront payment from an OEM license we granted to Fuji Xerox in connection with the sale of our stake in the joint venture, fourth quarter revenue was down 4.7% at constant currency, slightly better than our expectations.","For the full year, we increased EPS, cash flow, and operating margins year over year. Operating cash flow from continuing operations for the full year was $1.24 billion, an increase of $162 million from a year ago. Full year free cash flow totaled $1.18 billion, up $187 million year over year. We accomplished this while returning more than 70% of free cash flow to shareholders, paying down $950 million in debt and increasing investments in growth areas.","Full year revenue declined 4.7% at constant currency year-over-year, in line with our guidance. Our second half progress reversed the first-half, top-line trajectory, but we have more work to do, and this continues to be an area of intense focus for us.","Adjusted operating margin for the full year was 13.1%, up 180 basis points year-over-year. At the heart of Project Own It is simplification, redesigning seven key areas across the organization so that we can better serve clients, generate savings that can be reinvested in the business, and position Xerox for a return to growth.","The seven areas of focus we laid out are shared services, procurement, IT, delivery, supply chain, real estate, and organizational design. We have made significant progress in each of these areas. For example, changes to our supply chain in 2019 improved our responsiveness and increased our sourcing flexibility.","In June, we expanded our commercial relationship with HP to cover more equipment supplies, software and services in both directions. Then in November, we restructured our relationship with Fujifilm and Fuji Xerox to both monetize an otherwise illiquid asset at an attractive valuation, and establish a more traditional supply relationship, which will ensure we have the ability to source from the partner that can offer the highest value proposition.","We also redesigned our logistics networks and inventory utilization model. By maximizing competitive tension among our sourcing partners and improving the speed and responsiveness of our supply chain, we are better positioned to serve our clients at a lower cost, thereby improving our revenue trajectory and margins. This will remain an ongoing process as we stay current and ahead of trend.","Our investment initiatives under Project Own It are beginning to take hold as well. For example, we now have nearly 200 bots working across the organization in areas such as order to cash, delivery, human resources, and finance. We are on track to double that number in 2020. Automation is key to having a frictionless, high-velocity business. Clients as well as employees increasingly expect an Amazon-like experience, and we are focused on implementing technologies that allow us to deliver exactly that.","As a result of Project Own It, we delivered gross savings of $1 billion on a $9 billion cost base in just 18 months. In 2019, we achieved our target of annual gross savings of $640 million. Due to our disciplined approach to restructuring, we spent approximately $0.35 for every dollar saved. We expect to deliver at least $450 million of additional gross savings in 2020. We are making progress on our three-year revenue roadmap as investments in our business gain traction.","In the second half of 2019, the benefits of revenue-generating initiatives began to flow through, and we expect the rate of revenue decline to continue to improve in 2020. We are focused on capturing growth in core markets, broadening services and software, delivering new technology solutions, and further penetrating the small and midsized business market. We also increased investments in areas such as supplies coverage to improve the attach rate on unbundled supplies sales. With these investments, we saw an improvement in supplies compared to the first half.","Geographically, Europe performed below our expectations. The uncertainty and geopolitical friction within the region continues to create a weaker economic environment, driving fewer deployments of large deals and delaying decisions. To counter the regional dynamics, we are taking targeted actions and making investments such as expanding our presence in the SMB market and investing in our distribution channels.","The investments we made earlier in the year in the Americas continued to flow through the fourth quarter, largely within our U.S. enterprise account, the high-end segments, and the SMB market. In our core technology business, particularly at the high end, the Iridesse and Baltoro HF Inkjet Press, two cut sheet products that are unmatched in the marketplace drove momentum. In the fourth quarter, competitive knockouts and new business accounted for more than a third of Iridesse and Baltoro placements. Tech enhancements we made in the fall also contributed to an improvement in iGen 5 sales. We have new innovations and enhancements in the pipeline for 2020.","Xerox is unique in being able to offer an end-to-end solution that takes clients from document creation to distribution. For example, our free flow core software automates the prepress process on both Xerox and competitive printer products, and is a key differentiator at the high end. And by extending its use to competitor products, we drove double-digit new installed growth for free flow core year-over-year, while opening the door to more competitive knockouts.","In the mid-range segment, PrimeLink, our new light production, color printer offering stands alone. We believe there\u2019s no other product that can match its capabilities at this price point. This new device was a key revenue driver in its segment. We will expand the PrimeLink platform in Q1.","A4s in the low end are commoditized with numerous competitors and limited ways to increase price for margin. Key to growth here is offering a total solution plan that drives more value and simplicity for clients and us, which we will do in the coming months. We will introduce a very simple all-in plan targeted at small and medium businesses, which include a device, digital apps service and supplies for a monthly price.","In January, we expanded IT services for SMBs to all of our Xerox Business Solution cores. Our offering spans hardware procurement, pro engineering, IT product support, and managed IT services. Leveraging our footprint and existing relationships, we believe that there\u2019s an opportunity for Xerox to fill this gap in the SMB market and drive growth. We plan to extend this offering in the UK and Canada in the second quarter.","Software is a key focus for growth with benefits of investments made early in the year starting to flow through. One example is a new SaaS-based version of DocuShare, Xerox\u2019s content management platform that makes work easier and more efficient. This new version accounts for more than half of new business for this product, a strong signal to continue to invest in this area.","While we focus on improvements to our core and adjacent businesses, we are delivering on our commitment to reenergize Xerox\u2019s innovation engine. This year, we will celebrate PARC\u2019s 50th anniversary, a reminder of the strong legacy of invention at Xerox that benefits both business and society.","Last year, we outlined four areas of focus in innovation, 3D printing and digital manufacturing, AI workflow assistance, IoT sensors and services, digital packaging and print. Later in the year, we added a fifth focus area, clean technology. We have some of the world\u2019s best scientists and engineers focused on bringing new technologies to market.","In 3D, our acquisition of Vader Systems, about a year ago, is accelerating our go-to-market strategy. We are developing what is likely to be the industry\u2019s first additive liquid metal printer. In a world that\u2019s on-demand, now manufacturing can be too. With this technology, manufacturers will be able to make parts from start to finish in hours instead of days, without sacrificing quality or strength.","We\u2019re on track to deliver a commercially available product this year for AI workflow assistance, focused on addressing some of the most time-consuming tasks businesses face, such as RFPs, an area where companies spend an estimated $60 billion annually.","On IoT, we are expanding the testing of our sensing and analytics technologies with prominent partners across the world, from New York to Australia. Our pilots are demonstrating an improved level of sensing and insight in industrial predictive maintenance applications that were not available before.","On digital packaging, we are engaging select customers to refine the requirements of our technologies and validate our value proposition, delivering greater personalization and operational efficiencies, including new use cases in in-line marking and coding. The team is also exploring a variety of commercialization models and pathways such as licensing to bring these solutions to market.","The significant impact of climate change is front in mind for many of us. We are acquiring business resources to develop new clean technologies that create a more sustainable world. One area we are focusing on is air condition. As the earth gets hotter and more people use air conditioning, there\u2019s a greater need for more efficient cooling technologies. Today, air conditioning accounts for a significant global greenhouse gas emissions. We are working with the U.S. Department of Energy to develop a solution that can reduce energy consumption of air conditioners by up to 80%. Our Powered by Xerox approach allows us to leverage our intellectual property to maximize reach and benefit commercially without having to build the end-product ourselves.","Today, one of the largest 3D manufacturers uses our inkjet printheads. Another example is a recent deal we made with Alcon, the global leader in eye care. Our engineers are working with Alcon to develop new eye care solutions that leverage our existing IP and will help millions of people who struggle with various eye conditions. Xerox has long defined the modern work experience, and we\u2019re investing in key areas that will ensure we do so for many years to come.","Cash is critical to reinvesting in the business in the ways I\u2019ve described. We achieved $1.18 billion of free cash flow in 2019, the high-end of our guidance range and representing 19% year-over-year growth. We ended the year with approximately $2.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, which brought us to a net cash core position of $1.8 billion. In 2019, we returned 72% of our free cash flow to shareholders, exceeding our commitment to return at least 50%. In 2020, we remain committed to returning at least 50% of annual free cash flow to shareholders, and we expect to repurchase at least 300 million of shares.","Before wrapping up, I wanted to discuss our approach to M&A. We have an established M&A playbook that we use to evaluate all deals from tuck-ins to multibillion dollar deals. We have a disciplined approach to valuing and bidding on potential targets. All deal models include fully evaluated ROI and IRR. Revenue and expense synergies are fully analyzed, but deal models only include expense synergies in the evaluation of our returns.","With respect to our proposed acquisition of HP, the value of this transaction goes beyond economics. The printing industry is decades overdue for consolidation, and the first-mover will have a significant advantage.","As laid out in the investor deck we released in December, we\u2019ve identified significant cost and revenue synergies that are only achievable through a combination. A combined company would be both, more profitable and better positioned to diversify into higher growth markets.","Any restructuring that either company undertakes in the interim is simply incremental, and does not diminish the scope or scale of this opportunity for both HP shareholders and Xerox shareholders.","We received positive feedback from HP shareholders we spoke to. They mainly appreciate the industrial logic and believe in the value we can create. With their support in mind, we secured $24 billion in binding financing commitment from three top tier banks in order to remove any uncertainty over our ability to finance the transaction. And we recruited a slate of highly qualified independent director candidates for the election to the HP board. We are pressing ahead with our pursuit of this acquisition and are already working key elements of an integration plan, so that we are well-positioned to execute quickly when and as successful.","Now, I\u2019d like to hand it over to Bill to cover our financial results in detail.","Bill Osbourn","Thanks, John.","We delivered a strong finish to the year. In the fourth quarter, we exceeded our expectations for EPS and revenue, and we delivered cash flow and adjusted operating margin in line with our expectations. Overall, we are pleased with the quarter and resulting full year performance. On a full year year-over-year basis, adjusted operating margin expanded 180 basis points, adjusted EPS was up 23%, free cash flow grew 19% and we saw improvement in the rate of revenue decline in the second half of the year as investments in our business began to gain more traction, and we expect this momentum to continue in 2020.","Before going into details of our income statement, I want to remind everyone that in the fourth quarter, we completed a series of transactions to restructure our relationship with Fujifilm, which included the sale for more than 20 times related to cash flows of our 25% equity interest in Fuji Xerox, as well as the sale of our 51% partnership interest in Xerox International Partners, XIP, which was fully consolidated. Consequently, the financial results presented here are from continuing operations and exclude the financial results attributable to our former equity stake in Fuji Xerox and our XIP business, which are now presented as discontinued operations.","Also, I\u2019d like to point out that the reported numbers include the benefit of an upfront OEM license fee of $77 million we negotiated from Fuji Xerox, which was received in the fourth quarter in connection with restructuring that relationship.","This benefit was included in our updated 2019 guidance measures filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Form 8-K on December 3, 2019. That reflected adjustments resulting from the transactions with Fujifilm.","Looking at the income statement. Total revenues in the quarter declined 1.6% in constant currency and 2.2% in actual currency, including the impact of the OEM license fee, which is reported in post sale. Excluding this fee, total revenue declined 4.7% in constant currency, in line with the prior quarter, and as I mentioned, slightly better than our expectations. I will discuss revenue in more detail shortly.","Turning to profitability, adjusted operating margin of 16.8% in Q4, improved 270 basis points year-over-year. A significant portion of the improvement came from SAG, which improved 120 basis points year-over-year, driven by productivity improvements from Project Own It, and the impact of a $10 million write-off recorded in the prior year related to the termination of certain IT projects.","Gross margin of 41.6% improved 160 basis points year-over-year, including the impact of the OEM license fee and an improvement in services post sale margin, which were partially offset by the lower equipment and supplies margins, as well as transaction currency. RD&E was 3.8% of revenue, unchanged year-over-year.","Below operating profit, other expenses net of $8 million was $136 million better than the prior year due to lower non-service retirement-related costs and a prior year contract termination costs related to an IT services arrangement, as well as lower non-financing interest expense resulting from lower debt and higher interest income from a higher cash balance, which includes $2.3 billion of proceeds from the sale of our interest in Fuji Xerox, and XIP to Fujifilm in November.","Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 25% compared to 27.7% in the prior year, and contributed approximately $0.03 to our fourth quarter EPS. Adjusted EPS of $1.33 was up $0.39 compared with Q4 2018, including a $0.25 benefit from the OEM fee and benefit from share repurchase, lower net interest expense and lower taxes, while the benefit from the IT write-off in prior year was offset entirely by the costs associated with incremental tariffs.","GAAP EPS of $1.17 was $0.80 higher year-over-year, including the aforementioned $0.39, plus an additional $0.41, primarily from lower non-service pension related expense, the prior year costs related to the termination of an IT services arrangement, lower restructuring related costs, and the income tax on those adjustments. In Q4, we recorded $53 million of restructuring-related costs, bringing the full year restructuring costs to $229 million, roughly in line with our expectation of approximately $225 million. For 2020, we expect restructuring charges of approximately $175 million full year.","Moving now to slide seven, I\u2019ll discuss cash flow. In Q4, we generated $398 million of operating cash flow from continuing operations, which contributed to full year operating cash flow of $1.24 billion, a growth of $162 million year-over-year, and within our full year guidance range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. Full year free cash flow was $1.18 billion, up $187 million compared with 2018 and was at the high end of our guidance range, driven by strong operating cash flow and slightly lower than expected CapEx of $65 million for the year. We expect the level of CapEx to increase to approximately $100 million for full year 2020, which includes planned investment in IT systems.","The increase in full year operating cash flow reflects higher profit, including the OEM fee, better net working capital of approximately $25 million, driven by improvements in inventory management, and approximately $30 million of cash from finance assets.","Cash from finance assets was primarily due to lower sales of equipment on operating lease, which more than offset a reduction in cash from finance receivables, which was less of a source year-over-year. Restructuring payments for the year were $158 million, less than expected as certain restructuring-related payments in EMEA are expected to be made in 2020. For 2020, we expect payments for restructuring of approximately $175 million.","Investing cash flow included acquisition spend of approximately $42 million, including a 3D acquisition at the beginning of 2019 and two tuck-in XBS acquisitions. For 2020, we expect approximately $100 million of tuck-in acquisitions.","Lastly, within financing cash flows, we returned $292 million to shareholders in the fourth quarter, consisting of $60 million in dividends and $232 million in share repurchases. For the full year, we completed $600 million in share repurchases and spent $243 million in annual dividends for a total return of capital to shareholders of $843 million, or approximately 72% of 2019 annual free cash flow.","We also reduced debt by approximately $950 million full year, $550 million of which matured in the fourth quarter. And we ended the year with $4.3 billion of debt, and approximately $2.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash on our balance sheet.","Let\u2019s turn now to slide eight for more detail on revenue. Fourth quarter revenue declined 2.2% or 1.6% in constant currency. Excluding the impact of the OEM fee, Q4 revenue declined 4.7% in constant currency, which was in line with the third quarter and contributed to a second half rate of decline that is approximately 170 basis points better than the first half of 2019.","Geographically, the improvement is in the Americas, which was down 3.3% in constant currency, driven by growth in equipment sales, particularly in our U.S. large enterprise accounts, as well as a continued stabilization in our XBS channel compared to the first half.","In EMEA, the rate of revenue decline deteriorated slightly compared to the third quarter, with fewer large deal deployments in the quarter. We also continue to experience delayed decisions and see fewer large bids in the region, reflecting continued weak and uncertain macroeconomic conditions. Last, certain regions within EMEA were impacted by the rollout of Project Own It initiatives that occurred in the second half. We expect the modest disruption in operations resulting from this to begin to stabilize early in 2020 and have targeted actions to improve performance in the region, including deal management process changes and targeted product programs.","Equipment revenue was down 1.5% at constant currency, which is a significant improvement compared to the first half and sequentially better. And as I mentioned, equipment sales grew from the prior year in the Americas. From a product perspective, we had a great quarter in the high end in both color and mono. In high end color, we continue to see strong demand for our Iridesse color production system and the demand for our newly launched Baltoro inkjet press exceeded our expectations on a global basis. And we expect this momentum to continue into 2020.","In mid-range, the rate of decline improved significantly from the first half, but was down slightly compared to Q3 as the better than expected performance in the U.S. was partially offset by lower sales in the EMEA region. In the U.S., the improvement came from installs and revenue from the recently launched PrimeLink, a new product in our light production portfolio, as well as from a large account refresh in the U.S. and the ongoing improvement in our XBS business.","And in entry, higher sales in North America were offset by lower sales in developing market regions and EMEA.","Looking at activity, there\u2019s a difference in equipment revenue performance and installs this quarter, particularly in high-end color, where we saw a 12% decline in installs compared to growth in equipment revenue. This is primarily a result of product mix as growth in installations of high-end production color systems such as Iridesse and Baltoro were more than offset by declines in lower end production systems. This mix shift drives a net positive impact on equipment revenues as the higher end of the range systems carry significantly higher price points. We saw a similar product mix impact in mid-range installs with lower installs of MFP devices partially offset by higher installs of entry production devices that are at the higher end of the mid range product category. This in part was driven by the recent launch of PrimeLink which I referenced earlier.","Turning to post sale. Revenue declined 1.7% in constant currency or 5.8% excluding the impact of the OEM fee. This rate of decline was an improvement over the first half but slightly less than Q3, which included a large transactional IT services sale. Contractual post sale was stable in the quarter, while unbundled supplies rate of decline improved, as we continued to see the benefit from the investments made to improve the attach rate of Xerox supplies in unbundled equipment sales.","Services revenue declined 4.5% at constant currency as growth in U.S. large enterprise accounts and improving performance within XBS and Eurasia was more than offset by declines in Latin America and in Europe, where the rate of decline was impacted by a strong fourth quarter in 2018.","Services revenue comprised approximately 36% of total revenue in the quarter, and 30% of services revenue was from SMB. We have focused actions to drive new business growth, which include increasing sales resources and delivery teams and IT services which we expect to benefit 2020.","To summarize revenue, we are pleased with Q4 performance and with the second half performance trend, which contributed to a full year revenue decline of 4.7% constant currency, slightly better than our guidance of down 5%. We expect the investments at our top line will gain more traction in 2020, and we will continue to invest in actions to drive improvement in revenue.","Turning to slide nine. Adjusted operating margin was 16.8% in Q4, and 13.1% for the full year, in line with our full year guidance of approximately 13%. Our Project Own It transformational program was expected to drive at least $640 million in gross savings in 2019 and it did, offsetting the impact of revenue declines and contributing to 180 basis-point expansion in full year adjusted operating margin.","We achieved savings across the seven targeted functional cost areas. And we are continuing to focus on these areas to optimize operations for simplicity. Importantly, the continued efficiencies from project Own It create capacity to be more competitive, such as enabling SMB-focused marketing investments to drive revenue. In 2020, we expect Project Own It will deliver an additional $450 million in cost savings, making further progress toward our goals of delivering sustainable productivity improvements in driving earnings growth.","Adjusted EPS grew $0.39 year-over-year to $1.33 in the quarter, and we delivered $3.55 of adjusted EPS for the full year, which as I mentioned earlier, was a 23% increase year-over-year. Adjusted EPS growth in the quarter and for the year is driven by our cost reductions, which more than offset the impact of revenue declines, as well as benefits from the OEM license fee $0.25 and from share repurchases and other non-operational items, which offset headwinds from currency and tariffs.","Moving on to slide 10, and a review of our capital structure. We ended the year with $4.3 billion of debt, which is approximately $950 million lower year-over-year, reflecting the repayment of two bond maturities in 2019. The majority of our debt supports customer financing activities, and therefore, we break down our debt between financing debt and core debt. Financing debt is allocated by applying a 7 to 1 leverage to our finance receivables and equipment on operating leases, which together comprise our total finance assets. Core debt was approximately $1 billion, which is well inside our targeted core debt level of less than 2 times annual free cash flow. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash, which puts us in a net cash position of $1.8 billion when netting cash against core debt.","In 2020, we have approximately $1 billion in bonds maturing, and believe we have access to capital resources sufficient to handle upcoming debt maturities. Our liquidity position is strong with approximately $2.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash and a $1.8 billion bank revolver, which is undrawn.","As of December 31, 2019, our net unfunded pension liability was $1.2 billion, which is comparable to the net balance at the end of 2018, as the increase in pension obligation as a result of lower discount rates was offset by asset returns and contributions. The net balance includes approximately $815 million of unfunded pension liabilities for plans that by design are not funded. In 2019, we contributed $140 million to worldwide pension plans and expect a stable level of contributions going forward.","Last, on slide 11, I will review our 2020 guidance. As both John and I stated earlier, we made significant progress in 2019 against our three-year plan presented last February. We are seeing the impact of our investments in revenue and the savings from our Project Own It transformational program, which contributed to significant earnings, strong cash flow generation, and an improvement in the rate of revenue decline in the second half. We returned 72% of our annual free cash flow to shareholders in 2019 and repaid approximately $950 million in debt. In addition, by selling our equity interest in Fuji Xerox for over 20 times annual cash flow, we monetized an illiquid asset and increased flexibility to manage our business and the future of Xerox.","Now, let\u2019s look at our guidance for 2020. First, our full year revenue guidance is a decline of approximately 4% in constant currency, and we expect minimal impact from translation currency in 2020. Our revenue guidance excludes the impact of the $77 million OEM license fee from Fuji Xerox in 2019, so as to provide a better measure of the year-over-year progress against our strategy. The improvement in the rate of revenue decline in 2020 is attributable to investments in our top-line supporting our SMB growth strategy and expansion of integrated product solutions.","We will continue to span sales coverage and programs and have new product launches and refreshes planned through the year. I should also note that we expect revenue declines to be more balanced throughout 2020; that is the rate of improvement will be more gradual through the year as compared to 2019.","For adjusted operating margin, guiding to approximately 13%, a 60 basis-point improvement compared to full year 2019. When excluding the impact of the OEM license fee, as Project Own It savings are expected to continue to deliver margin expansion.","For adjusted EPS, we\u2019re guiding to a range of $3.60 to $3.70, and $2.80 to $2.90 for GAAP EPS. This results in adjusted EPS growth of approximately $0.35 compared to 2019 when excluding the $0.25 benefit from the OEM license fee from 2019. The difference between GAAP EPS and adjusted EPS includes our normal adjustments around restructuring and related costs, non-service retirement related costs, transaction and related costs and amortization of intangibles.","We continue to expect strong cash generation and our guiding free cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion, which assumes approximately $100 million of CapEx and is approximately $75 million higher than 2019 when excluding the impact of the OEM license fee. We will also continue to retarget returns to shareholders of at least 50% of our annual free cash flow, which will include dividends and at least $300 million in share repurchases. Last, we will evaluate the use of unallocated cash as we progress through 2020.","We will now open the line for questions. Anne?","Ann Pettrone","Before we get to the Q&A with John and Bill, I will point out that we have in the appendix to our materials additional supplemental reconciliations and posted on our Xerox Investor Relations website a full set of earnings materials. Operator, please open line for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt Cabral of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Matt Cabral","Thank you. John, on the HP acquisition, you touched on this in your prepared remarks, but I\u2019m wondering if you could dig a little bit deeper into what you see as the biggest benefits of industry consolidation? And just what gives you confidence in at least $2 billion of incremental cost takeout created through the combination?","John Visentin","Yes. Matt, we\u2019ve -- when we looked at the combination of $2 billion, one thing that\u2019s clear is you only get that -- you only get that $2 billion, if the two companies combine together. And what we did is a detailed analysis per pillar of what we believe would be savings of combining the two companies together, and in our document that we presented to the shareholders, we went into a level of detail that talks about it. So, our confidence in the $2 billion is quite high that we can hit that.","And if you look at our team and our track record of what we\u2019ve done with Project Own It here, we delivered $1 billion over the last 18 months, and we\u2019re on track to deliver the $450 million plus in 2020. So, we have the track record. This document and this -- that we put together, was built by our team, our management team. So, you look at who\u2019s on our management team, and these are a lot of folks that have done restructuring in the past. I can tell you that the shareholders, they see the logic in the proposed transaction. They\u2019ve told us that the combination of the two companies bring tremendous value. Inside of our business case, we only focus and we only use the cost savings, but there are synergies that are detailed as well that we believe we can get by combining the two companies together.","Matt Cabral","Got it. And then now that you\u2019ve exited the JV with Fuji, I\u2019m wondering if you could talk a little bit about what that supplier relationship looks like going forward, and how you\u2019re thinking about opportunity in Asia after the technology agreement ends with them in March of 2021?","Bill Osbourn","Hey, Matt, it\u2019s Bill. So, we look at the renegotiation of the -- our relationship with Fujifilm, and it is clearly a positive from a supplier perspective. Many benefits, a more normal type of relationship now with supplier, customer as opposed to before, we also had to factor in the 25% interest. As far as -- and the -- when we renegotiated the relationship, there are actually benefits in the product or supply arrangements we have with them going forward. There were certain terms that existed in the prior agreements that we negotiated on more favorable terms going forward. And as we\u2019ve discussed before, these product supply arrangements go out from a period of five to seven years and really the earliest, any of them come up for renewal on a staggered basis is 2023.","As far as looking forward, and the impact is we can go into the Asia Pacific market, under -- without -- for products other than xerographic products. For xerographic-related products, we could potentially go in as early as April 2021 under the Xerox name. However, if they choose to extend for two years the use of the Xerox name, we could still go into the Asia Pacific markets with xerographic products but not under the Xerox name. So, more likely, we\u2019d be going in a more significant way, two years later in April 2023.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital. Your line is now open.","Ananda Baruah","Hi. Good morning, John, Bill. Congratulations on the solid results in the second straight quarter of top line momentum. Two for me, if I could, just starting back out -- back with HP, John, what would be Xerox\u2019s next preferred action given the letter with regards to Board level elections that you guys published? Would it be to engage in conversations or would it be to kind of go into the summer with the Board level elections? And then, I have a business model follow-up.","John Visentin","Yes. Ananda, I can say the meetings we\u2019ve had with the HP shareholders have been quite positive. And they understand our transaction, and they believe in the combination. Their concern as is ours is the refusal to engage in a normal course of action at this point in the process. So, we\u2019re hoping to engage with the HP executives, and we\u2019ve offered that to engage with them and have a discussion on how we bring this to closure because we both see the logic of this combination and we\u2019re not where we ought to yet.","Ananda Baruah","That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate that context. And then, with regards to the 2020 guidance and John, you alluded -- or you didn\u2019t allude to it, you made mention of still existing goal of getting to flat constant currency revenue growth in 2021. The 4% guide for 2020, while quite favorable as I think you\u2019re probably trending a little bit ahead of schedule right now, how do you go from -- how do you see footing from the 4% in 2020 to the flat in 2021? And as part of that conservatism -- actually, let me just stop there, and then I have a quick one on the margins and free cash flow for 2020 as well. Thanks.","John Visentin","Yes. Look, we\u2019re confident in the revenue guidance. And if you think of our continued demand for high-end production systems, our strength in the SMB channel, our new product launches that we\u2019re going to be doing, our new investments in 2020, so we\u2019re executing on the strategy. And while transformation is not linear, we\u2019ve seen that there\u2019s been bumps along the way, like we had in the first quarter of last year, but we\u2019re building an organization to respond quickly to this Ananda. And for 2021, our road to flat revenue is just we believe that we can get there, and we\u2019re going to do it by improving the organic revenue, and like I said, the traction on the above topics.","Bill Osbourn","And just to add on, Ananda. In 2020, we\u2019re expecting really minimal impact from inorganic. As you know, last year we did approximately $40 million of tuck in acquisitions, we\u2019ve guided towards $100 million this year, but we\u2019re expecting little impact. But in 2021, factored into getting to flat when you have $100 million target in 2020 and 2021 that that would also have a favorable impact on getting to flat by 2021.","Ananda Baruah","Yes. Got it, understood. And then, Bill, just quickly on the 2020 op margin guidance and free cash flow guidance. I think, you\u2019ve put the part of this to the 13% margin, which is flat and the free cash flow, which is kind of relatively flat. It sounds like the -- at least part of that -- the reason for the flatness is that you\u2019re backing -- you\u2019re sort of saying as you take out the license impact from Fuji Xerox, it actually -- the margin would actually be up in 2020. And I guess, you are pointing out to this slight increase in free cash over 2020. But, can you just sort of backfill for us, particularly given the $450 million of gross cost saves, why perhaps the op margin expansion will be greater and the free cash flow expansion will be greater? And that\u2019s it for me. I appreciate it.","Bill Osbourn","Yes. Great. So, from an operating margin perspective, just taking a step back, we laid out our three-year plan last February. We said, in year one we\u2019d do 100 to 150 basis-point improvement. This year, after you take out the OEM fee, we actually did 110 basis-point improvement going from about 11.3 to 12.4, so on plan with our three-year plan. And we\u2019re also involved -- in taking into account 110, we are also able to make significant investments in our back office and in revenue on our top line and still achieve that 110 basis-point expansion, in line with our 100 and 150 basis-point guidance.","As far as next year, you hit on the main point that taking out that OEM fee, it\u2019s really about a 60 basis-point improvement. And according to our three-year plan, we said 100 to 150 in year one, and then approximately 50 basis points plus in year two and year three, 60 basis points being in line with that and a lot of that continuing to come from Project Own It initiatives, which we\u2019re retargeting $450 million in 2020. So, we think -- we believe that we\u2019re clearly on plan with respect to our adjusted operating margin expansion.","Operator","And the next question comes from Shannon Cross of Cross Research. Your line is now open.","Shannon Cross","John, I was curious, obviously going forth with HP, HP has indicated that the offer significantly undervalues what they believe the valuation of their assets are? So, now that you have your slate of directors out there, is there a willingness to revisit your offer, just how are you thinking about that? And I\u2019m also curious as to -- and this is -- I\u2019m not actually sure what the answer is. I\u2019m curious to how the two boards would work together, post deal. So, do we assume that the directors you put out for HP are kind of short-term to get the deal done, or would you assume you have a significantly expanded board following a combination of HP and Xerox? Thanks. And I have a follow-up.","John Visentin","Yes. I would say our slate is a group of highly qualified accomplished individuals. And they understand what the challenges are of a global enterprise. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ve brought forward as we said, and that was after we got the $24 billion secured. On price, we\u2019re not going to speculate on potential actions. We said many times that we would be willing to meet with HP to begin negotiating a transaction. And we\u2019re asking HP to engage in a constructive dialogue, so that we could explore ways on maximizing value for both our shareholders.","Shannon Cross","Okay. So, if they don\u2019t, then it just -- it moves to the board that I guess you don\u2019t anticipate. Anyway, you\u2019re not going to negotiate on the phone with me. So, that\u2019s fine. I guess, the question I have to -- for Bill is, in terms of cash flow, finance receivables was about $175 million of cash, I think in 2019, which I believe was down year-over-year, but still obviously was a source of cash, but it was used in fourth quarter. I know these things can sort of be -- are not linear by any means. But, that combined with a $58 million in cash that you got from the sale of IT, provides somewhat of a headwind when you look to next year. So, I\u2019m curious how much more benefit you think you can get from working capital? Is there any sort of one-timers we should think about for next year in cash flow, or is the vast majority of it just going to come from the improvement in operating profit? Thank you.","Bill Osbourn","Yes. As far as the working capital improvements for next year, the main thing that we\u2019re focusing on is improved working capital. In particular, we had over $100 million improvement this year in inventory. We expect to have some continued improvement next year in inventory, but as well we think there are significant opportunities in receivables and payables. As far as finance receivables, $175 million source, obviously that\u2019s a source that is not a good source. In fact, we [indiscernible] the source, and it\u2019s part of our modeling for next year with the improved revenues and ESR. In originations, we are in our model factoring in less of a finance receivable source, which is a good headwind to have, means that we\u2019re getting a more ESR and more miss out there.","And you\u2019re right, it\u2019s about $58 million of the one time for the OEM. So, the two of those being headwinds, we expect to still overcome those, mainly through improvements, not only in our cost structure, but also in working capital components of AR, AP. And although we had over $100 million this year improvement in inventory, we still think there\u2019s some improvements that we can get in inventory for next year.","Operator","And our next question comes from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Katy Huberty","Bill, question for you on revenue, the 4% in constant currency decline in 2020. How do you compare that to the 3% decline you talked about at the Analyst Day a year ago? Are those comparable? And if so, how would you explain the difference?","Bill Osbourn","Yes. So, there have been adjustments obviously with the Fujifilm transaction and disc ops and everything. But at a high level, just taking a step back, I think that we\u2019re probably about 100 basis points off where we would have liked to have been. We guided 3%, and lot of it\u2019s due to various reasons. And with the bumpy start at the beginning of the year with the disruptions we talked about on the XBS side, then improved during the second half. And there\u2019s clearly room for improvement, continued improvement in XBS going forward in 2020. But, we believe we have levers in place, rates improvement, still get the blast by 2021. But you\u2019re correct, just taking a step back, it\u2019s probably about 100 basis points less than where we would liked to be at this point.","Katy Huberty","And you mentioned in the slide deck and also on this call that investments are beginning to impact revenue, you saw that in the back half of 2019. Any context for how much incremental revenue you were able to generate in 2019 or what the incremental revenue impact is in 2020?","Bill Osbourn","So, at a high level, those investments played out in various areas, somewhat in ESR. we had significant improvements in the second half of the year with respect to ESR, on the 1% to 2% decline range versus the first half. Q1 was down around 5%, Q2 around 8%. So, investments there, but in the post sale area, in particular and we\u2019ve talked about this quite a bit, in supplies in particular, unbundled supplies. Most of our supplies are part of bundled arrangement, so over 75% of arrangements relate to bundled supplies. But, there are what we called unbundled or unattached supplies. And earlier this past year, we expanded our organization, really created an organization to sell with respect to those unbundled supply agreements. And we saw significant improvement from where we were like, in the first two quarters 9% to 12%, year-over-year declines to significant low-single-digit decline in supplies. So, we saw significant improvement in the second half of the year, based upon our investment in the supplies area, and we started to see some improvement in the IP services area. We\u2019ve made investments in expanding that from where we had 3 of our XBS quarters to 10 by the end of the year and early this year will be pretty much all of XBS selling IT services.","Katy Huberty","Thank you. And then just one last question, separate from discussion around valuation and what you\u2019d ultimately be willing to pay. Any feedback from the banks who provided the debt commitment around whether there\u2019s the potential to take on even more debt or what leverage ratio they\u2019d be willing for you to exit a deal with HP? ","Bill Osbourn","We believe that we have flexibility. We lined up the $24 billion in financing commitment. We believe our arrangements with those financial institutions allow us flexibility if need be.","John Visentin","Yes. And you could imagine, Katy, the amount of analysis that the banks went through before they agreed to give us a $24 billion in financing, the due diligence that they had to go through with us to give them confidence.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Paul Coster of JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Paul Coster","So, a couple of quick ones, just building on Ananda\u2019s questions from earlier on. You\u2019ve explained why operating margins, the improvements is attenuating a little bit in 2020. Can you just talk a little bit about the Own It, so payback on gross savings? Is still sort of $0.65 on every dollar or is that also attenuating as you move into 2020?","Bill Osbourn","So, I think you\u2019re referring to, Paul, the cost of our savings. And we\u2019ve said that our cost to get those gross savings is less than $0.40 of a dollar. It was about $0.35 last year, but it\u2019s a little less than $0.40. Looking to next year, that $450 million of gross savings that we expect a similar type of cost in $0.35 to $0.40 range in order to achieve those savings.","Paul Coster","Okay. So, no change in the payback on those savings, gross savings?","Bill Osbourn","No.","Paul Coster","Okay. Got it. And then, the other question I got is, as you look to 2021, assuming the business as is, you\u2019re looking for 300 basis-point plus year-on-year improvement in revenues. And I maybe missed a little bit of the nuances earlier on. But, can you just talk to us about why the sudden inflection? Is it that these new initiatives all suddenly mature at the same time, or is there some other reason why you have that confidence?","Bill Osbourn","So, if you look at what we\u2019re guiding towards in 2020 versus a normalized 2019, we\u2019re guiding towards about 150 basis-point improvement year-over-year to get there approximate 4%. And that\u2019s minimal inorganic involved in that. As I said, there was a little last year to have a rollover. And, there\u2019s just -- we\u2019re not factoring in that much for this year. We do expect those investments to accelerate. So, that 150 basis-point improvement year-over-year from \u201819 to \u201820 we could see being in the 200 to 300 basis-point improvement in 2021 versus 2020. But, we will also -- part of it, as I said earlier factors in that we\u2019ve allocated approximately $100 million per year of tuck-ins. It can be more or less in any given year. As I said last year was only $42 million. But that we would expect, those come to fruition. And by the way, those tuck-ins, we\u2019re not just looking at the U.S., we are looking in certain countries in Europe and expanding the XBS models to those countries. But, we could see that having a point, 2 points of benefit also potentially in 2021.","Paul Coster","Got it. One quick question, it just popped out, and maybe the high end 8% year-on-year improvement in black-and-white printers was -- that was amazing change there. Is it just simply the lumpiness of that business in the enterprise accounts, or do you think that\u2019s sustainable?","Bill Osbourn","High end has overall had some significant improvement. In the second half of the -- for the full year, we actually grew our high end ESR in the -- for the full year and in Q3 and Q4. But if you take step back, and we\u2019ve talked about a lot of things that the new year -- the relatively new year that product\u2019s been out for about a year or so now, strong demand for that. Baltoro, our high end inkjet machine, cut sheet inkjet, significant demand for that. And our iGen. We refreshed certain features on the iGen, iGen 5, That has also contributed. So, the hand is clearly a success area for us full year, year-over-year growth from ESR and in the third and fourth quarters, 2% to 3% growth from an ESR perspective.","Paul Coster","Sorry. I was referring to the black-and-white segment in particular in high ends. Is that just simply enterprise accounts lumpiness or is that\u2026","Bill Osbourn","You could have still -- on the high-end enterprise, you could still have some of the iGen machines. Yes.","Paul Coster","Sorry. I\u2019m referring to black-and-white, but we can take this offline.","Bill Osbourn","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to John for any closing remarks.","John Visentin","Thank you for your time today. As we start 2020, Xerox is positioned to make further progress against our three-year plan. We\u2019ve built a strong team and even stronger foundation. We will continue our efforts to achieve success someone thought was impossible at Xerox. So, we\u2019re moving forward. Thanks, everybody.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."],"23033":["Xerox (NYSE:XRX) Q2 2012 Earnings Call July 20, 2012 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Ursula M.

She is joined by Luca Maestri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com\/investor. At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and\/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without expressed permission of Xerox. [Operator Instructions]","During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements which by their nature address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein. At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns, you may begin.","Ursula M. Burns","Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. We'll get started on Slide 3 with a review of the strategic imperatives that define our business and align with our financial performance.","First, accelerating our Services business. We're operating in a market that is rich with opportunity, especially as more and more enterprises and governments seek efficient and productive ways to manage their operations. We're taking full advantage of our experience and expertise by diversifying our offerings, aggressively pursuing opportunities in key growth areas like e-discovery, HR outsourcing, customer care, transportation and health care and expanding globally. During the first year of this -- during the first half of this year, revenue from Services grew 8% in constant currency, tracking very well with our expectations.","Second is maintaining our leadership in Technology. We're continuing to take a disciplined and practical approach to managing our Technology business for a sustained benefit to our bottom line. That means providing the industry's best technology, delivered through a cash-generating business model and focusing on building our business in color, SMB and across developing markets. During the first half of this year, installs of Xerox products were up 5% and in particular, our color MIF, that's machines in the field, was up 14%. Install and MIF growth is a good indication of future annuity revenue, reflecting our continued market share leadership and, in particular, the share that we're taking from competitors.","Third, we're driving operational excellence across our enterprise. This means adjusting our cost model so that we're competitively advantaged and have the financial flexibility to adapt to changing marketplace needs while scaling in key growth areas. Operating expenses are down, which is indicative of our disciplined approach to managing our cost base. And in Services, we delivered sequential improvement in operating margins. By executing well on the first 3 priorities, we are very focused on the fourth, which is creating value for our shareholders, doing so by delivering solid earnings and allocating capital in the areas of acquisitions, dividends and share repurchase.","The economic uncertainty has created more pressure especially in Europe, and especially impacting our Technology business. We benefit from offering a diverse portfolio that allows us to aggressively pursue areas of higher growth and to manage for improved profitability in more mature markets.","The quarterly numbers give one picture, but I'm just as closely managing the progress that we're making to be increasingly differentiated and advantaged in the marketplace. We're winning customers' trust and helping them simplify how work gets done in ways that may surprise you.","Please turn to Slide 4 for some examples of what I mean. Key to our Services growth is investing in those markets where we already have respected expertise and where we see potential for market expansion. The discovery process for the legal industry is a great example. It's a complex area and one that can be incredibly costly if left to more manual processes. We've built a competency in e-discovery through advanced software tools and services, and we just strengthened our advantage through the acquisition of Lateral Data. Its software helps firms and helps legal departments manage the entire discovery life cycle in simple and affordable ways.","We're also taking this customized approach to the mobile phone market by acquiring U.K.-based WDS, which provides technical support to the world's largest wireless telecommunications brands. Through its proprietary cloud-based platform, WDS analyzes millions of technical support interactions across thousands of mobile devices. It then uses this data to help clients adjust any systematic problems, all real-time, fast and in productive ways.","Productivity is also the benefit of advancing Technology and Services for health care. While the headlines this past month were all about what's next for the Affordable Care Act, we were already moving far ahead through our established relationship with health care payers, providers and government agencies. This includes Q2 announcements for developing Nevada's Health Information Exchange and enhancing New Mexico's Medicaid reimbursement services, to create a cloud-based portal that gives Florida business owners more health insurance choices, as well as being selected as the BPO provider for NIH. Xerox is exceptionally well positioned as a trusted provider for the business of health care.","That's a quick glimpse of the stories behind the numbers. And we'll share more with you each quarter. And hopefully, they help to reframe your perception of Xerox to showcase the amazing opportunity that's in front of us and to better explain the evolving nature of our business mix and model.","So now let's look at how this translates into our financial results. Turn to Slide 5. I'll provide a top-level review, then Luca will take you through the detail. And I'll close with our expectations for quarter 3, and then we'll take your questions.","In the second quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.26. On a GAAP basis, earnings were $0.22 per share. This includes $0.04 related to the amortization of intangibles. Earnings are in line with our expectations and reflect the investments that we're making to grow our business.","Total revenue of $5.5 billion was down 1% and up 1% in constant currency. Demand for our industry-leading Managed Print Services led to a 6% increase in revenue from Document Outsourcing. ITO revenue was up 9%, a significant improvement from prior quarters. And revenue from Business Process Outsourcing grew 8%. Revenue from our Technology business declined 4%. This was impacted by the continued weak macroeconomic environment and by clients increasingly shifting to Xerox's Managed Print Services, which is reported in our Services segment. I remain quite pleased with our across-the-board progress in Services and the benefit that it brings to our top line.","Strong revenue from Services, our growth driver today and in the future, gives us financial flexibility and helps minimize the impact from our slowing Technology business. We continue to make the appropriate investments in our Services business, which includes incurring startup costs to ramp new contracts.","So as a result and as expected, we're facing near-term pressure on margins. But also as expected, we made sequential improvements in quarter 2. Operating margin of 9.7% was down 0 year-over-year and up 1.2 points from quarter 1. And that was driven by a 1.3 point sequential improvement from our Services business.","Q2 gross margin of 32% was down 1.4 points, improving 1 point from quarter 1. This is in the range of our expectations for the first half of the year, and we balanced our investments by continuing to improve RD&E and SAG, which is now at 19.4% of revenue. We generated $228 million in cash from operations, again in line with expectations and reflecting the need to make higher cash pension contributions during the first half of the year. We remain confident in our ability to generate $2 billion to $2.3 billion in full year operating cash. And we are continuing to use available cash for acquisitions and share repurchases.","Please turn to Slide 6 for a closer look at our top line results. The metrics of these charts tell 2 different but key messages. First, reiterating the importance of Services in the total picture of our business. A year ago, the revenue coming from Services and Technology were about -- were evenly split. Now Services makes up 51% of the total, up from 48% a year ago. Second, a reminder of the significance of our annuity-driven business model. As you see here, 85% of our revenue is annuity, and it's up 2% in quarter 2. We remain focused on increasing profitable annuity-based revenue across our portfolio. We manage our services business for growth, building our pipeline, increasing signings of multiyear contracts and investing in acquisitions to strengthen our competencies.","In addition to winning major BPO and ITO deals, we continue to lead with our Managed Print Services, which are in demand as enterprises look for ways to operate more efficient workplaces. For example, we recently signed a 6-year MPS contract with Boeing to consolidate its printers, copiers and fax machines and to implement a global printing framework based on price, energy, efficiency and ink use.","We also strengthened our annuity stream through the installs of Xerox equipment. Our approach is to lead in color, so Xerox ink is being used to generate color pages printed in workplaces and print shops of any size. During the quarter, our color MIF was up 14%. Equipment sales revenue was down 6% in constant currency. And this is where we're seeing the largest impact from economic weakness, especially in Europe. In fact, 2\/3 of the equipment sales revenue decline came from Europe. Equipment sales revenue was the most -- has the most volatility in our business right now, and it represents just 15% of our total revenue. We're managing it by being very disciplined with our cost base while expanding distribution to capture the opportunities in SMB and developing markets.","In summary, we're clear-minded about the dynamics of our 2 businesses based on market opportunity and the macro environment. And we're managing our operations to align with the changing nature of both. In Services, again, our emphasis is on growth and making the investments to scale so that we can serve our clients in diverse, reliable and efficient ways anywhere around the world. And in Technology, we're sharply focused on streamlining the cost base. Our emphasis is on nurturing our resilient business model in ways that maintain market leadership while generating cash and supporting our bottom line.","Considering the economic uncertainty, we now expect that revenue from technology will continue to be weak. As a result, we are revising our full year earnings expectations. They're based on continued strong year-over-year revenue growth from Services, lower revenue from Technology and the ongoing benefit from operational efficiencies.","So let me turn it over to Luca. And I'll be back to wrap up and open the call to your questions. So Luca?","Luca Maestri","Thank you, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. Overall, I believe we performed well in a weak economic environment to deliver 1% constant currency revenue growth and EPS within our guidance. Services, as expected, has strong growth, and we are confident this will continue for the balance of the year. Technology revenue improved sequentially, down 4% year-over-year versus down 5% in Q1 at constant currency. But this was helped by an easier compare. And we expect equipment revenue will continue to be pressured, given the challenging macro conditions.","We were pleased with the margin performance despite being down from last year. Sequentially, gross margin improved 100 basis points to 32% and operating margin improved 120 basis points to 9.7%. Year-over-year, gross margin was down 140 basis points driven by Services and mix. Like Technology, gross margin was actually 20 basis points better. The drivers of the decline are generally consistent with what we saw in Q1. Services margin saw good sequential improvement, but as anticipated, we had margin compression due to new contract ramp-up costs. And this remains the largest driver of year-over-year margin decline. Also the increasing services mix continues to impact gross margin, but is fairly neutral to operating margin. The gross margin on our Services business is 1\/2 that of our Technology segment, so the strong growth in Services has direct impact on overall gross margin.","We again saw good progress in expense efficiencies with SG&A improvement of 50 basis points. As a result, operating margin was down 70 basis points year-over-year. We continue to expect operating margin to show year-over-year improvement by Q4. Restructuring of $29 million was $38 million higher year-over-year and it is important to note it is fully reflected in our adjusted results. Tax rate of 22.4% was lower than prior year. The EPS impact from higher restructuring and lower tax rate offset each other on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted EPS of $0.26 was down $0.01 from 2011, with the only adjustment to reported EPS being the amortization of intangibles.","Moving on to segment performance. Let me start with Services. Services revenue was up 7% in Q2. The growth rate was somewhat lower than Q1, driven by BPO. This reflected some timing of revenues and some lower volumes in areas such as transportation and customer care. ITO showed good revenue acceleration and was up 9%. New contracts signed in recent quarters are now beginning to ramp. And we have about 3 points of growth related to intercompany services as this business is taking over more of our own IT infrastructure. We, of course, eliminate this intercompany growth within total Services.","Also Document Outsourcing continues to show a good pace of growth, up 6% at constant currency. Given the neutral economic environment, we believe this overall performance confirms the strength of our diversified Services portfolio. We expect growth in Q3 will be in line or better than Q2. It is worth noting that the Q2 growth was almost entirely organic. But clearly, we will continue to support Services growth with tuck-in acquisitions, the latest examples being the WDS and Lateral Data acquisitions that Ursula just highlighted.","Signings in Q2 were lower year-over-year and down 1% on a trailing 12-month basis. The year-over-year decline is caused by less renewal potential this year despite a strong 89% renewal rate for the combined BPO and ITO business. New business signings on a trailing 12-month basis are up 13% and continue to drive our revenue performance.","Services margin of 10.6%, while down year-over-year, showed a 130 basis point sequential improvement. We continue to expect that by Q4, Services margin will show year-over-year improvement and will be within our 11% to 13% target range for Services.","Let's now turn to the Technology segment. Technology revenue was down 4% and document-related revenues, which includes Document Outsourcing, were down 2% at constant currency. Despite the sequential improvement in Technology revenue, it is fair to say we saw increased pressure on our results from the macro environment. Equipment, in particular, was lower than anticipated, driven by weakness in Europe and the continued success of our partner print services offering, which results in some revenue shifting from Technology to Services.","The sequential improvement in revenue was driven by unbundled supplies, which was up 5% versus down 7% in Q1. Unbundled supplies represent a little less than 20% of our Technology revenues and is predominantly aligned with entry products. It can be volatile, given channel inventory dynamics, which is what we saw in Q1 and in Q2.","Looking at product [ph] segments. Part of the weakness in equipment revenue was mix. We saw a rebound in entry, thanks to the new products and OEM sales. High-end showed very strong color install growth, but this was driven primarily by the entry production products. And mid-range was impacted by the migration into Managed Print Services. We are planning for equipment revenue to continue to be weak in Q3, and therefore for total revenue declines to be down mid-single-digits for Technology.","Segment margin of 11.3% was down slightly from 2011 but reflected continued cost and expense control and was above our 9% to 11% target range for Technology. There are obviously a number of different dynamics at play in the market. And as we move to the key metrics slide, I would like to give some additional insight into how we view and how we're managing our different businesses.","Let's look first at Services. The company has gone through a transformation over the past 2 years, with Services now accounting for over 51% of total revenues. And we clearly expect this trend to continue. A few important points to make regarding our position in Services and future expectations. We are a leader in a number of very attractive and growing Services segments, including health care, both government and commercial; commercial BPO areas, such as human resource, outsourcing and transaction processing; as well as transportation.","We have strength in 3 very important capability areas: ITO, customer care and document management, which we leverage across all of our lines of business. And we have a tremendous opportunity to increase our capabilities, leverage innovation to build greater differentiation and expand globally. This should lead to greater operating leverage and value add, which will improve not only revenue but margins over time. Services will be the growth driver for the company and also will make us a more valued partner to our entire customer base.","In terms of Technology, I want to address how we're managing the continued impact of a weak macro environment. First, we have been gaining market share for several quarters, and we do not have significant exposure in some of the areas of greatest secular pressure such as consumer and single-function devices. For instance, when you look at the metrics on this slide, they're generally stable and in some cases positive. Second, we continue to selectively invest in areas where we see the greatest growth opportunities such as small- and medium-sized business, Managed Print Services and color. And third, we have realized sooner than many, that there are specific areas of secular pressure such as transaction state [ph] in printing that impact us. As a result, since the end of 2008, we have proactively worked to make our business more annuity-based, our cost base more flexible and our investments more focused.","Our document-related business remains attractive. It has a very large annuity stream and good cash dynamics, limited capital requirements and committed revenue streams. We are the global market leader, have great technology and strong customer relationships, and we can leverage these characteristics to strengthen our Services business further.","If we now turn to the next slide, I will take a moment to review Q2 cash flow. Cash from Operations was a source of $228 million, which compares to a source of $347 million in 2011. Through the first half, cash flow was $213 million versus $317 million in 2011. This is fully in line with our expectations as the driver of the year-over-year decrease is the timing of pension contributions. Cash contributions through our global pension plans in Q2 were $158 million, which was $80 million higher than 2011. We now expect second half contributions of approximately $150 million versus $303 million last year.","We spent $115 million on CapEx, which is consistent with our annual forecast of around $500 million, and we decreased debt by $455 million. Dividends paid was $63 million, and we repurchased $306 million of stock. This was an acceleration compared to our original plan, and we continue to plan to repurchase between $900 million and $1.1 billion for the year, weighted towards the end of the year. Finally, we remain on track for $2 billion to $2.3 billion of operating cash flow for the year.","Let us turn to the next slide to review our capital structure. Our Q2 ending debt balance decreased to $9.2 billion. In May, we retired $1.1 billion in senior notes, which was the only term debt coming due this year. From a maturity standpoint, we maintain a well-balanced debt ladder, with just about $1 billion coming due annually. During the course of the year, our debt balance may change moderately, given timing of cash flows, but we continue to plan for $8.6 billion for year-end debt. The vast majority of our debt is in support of our financing of customer leases. Of the $9.2 billion debt balance, $5.6 billion can be associated with the financing of Xerox equipment for our customers. The finance that is calculated assuming a 7:1 leverage of our finance assets of $6.4 billion. These finance assets represent committed revenue streams from our customers.","In Q2, as I said, we made good progress on share repurchase, $306 million or 41 million shares. We have said all along that our repurchases will be back half-weighted, given timing of cash flows, but we are maximizing what we can do in the near term, given the share price opportunity.","In summary, we continue to be focused on growing and improving the profitability of our Services business while maintaining our profitable leadership in Technology. We are seeing the impact of macro weakness, but believe we are well positioned to have steady revenues and profits through this time. In terms of capital allocation, we remain committed to using our strong cash flow to return value to shareholders through share repurchase, dividends and accretive tuck-in acquisitions.","With that, I will hand it back to Ursula.","Ursula M. Burns","Thanks, Luca. Let me quickly wrap up so that we can get to your questions. Our results in the second quarter reflect consistent progress. Growth in Services, increase in annuity revenue, a steady pace of increasing installs and color MIF, sequential margin improvement in Services, disciplined cost management and on-track performance with cash generation and capital allocation all delivered to build value for our stakeholders and more value in our business.","Our guidance on cash remains unchanged, and we remain committed to investing in share repurchase throughout the year. For the third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings of $0.24 to $0.26 per share, and we now expect full year adjusted EPS of $1.07 to $1.12, which comprehends the continued revenue weakness that we're expecting from our Technology business.","With that, I thank you again for joining us today. And as we get to your questions, I know that you want to dive deeper into trends, especially in our Services business. So we have in the room with us today Lynn Blodgett, who's the President of our Xerox Services business. Now let's open it up to your questions, and I'll field them and ask either Lynn or Luca to chime in as well.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research.","Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC","I guess, the first question, Ursula, is can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of the pressure on the Technology side, whether you'd see if this is a cyclical issue, clearly, Europe is weak from an economic standpoint, or more of a secular trend? I think you've talked about it some in the past. So I'm curious if you've seen any changes in maybe the rate of decline on the secular side. Just any clarity you can give us there would be helpful.","Ursula M. Burns","It's a good question, I think, one that many people have, so we're going to spend a little bit of time talking our way through this. First, let me start with secular -- the secular trends that we're seeing in the marketplace. We see a growth in color almost across-the-board, so mid-range, high-end places that we participate. We see that in color MIF increasing and color pages increasing. We see a shift, a decided shift, towards Managed Print Services away from single-function devices. We don't have a very large business in single-function devices, black and white, or color at the low end. And we took advantage of this lack of participation by driving -- by starting and then driving a Managed Print Services business. More and more customers are pushing towards Managed Print Services. There is no doubt about it. All of our competitors are now engaged in Managed Print Services. We have been engaged for a long time, and we're leading. That's the second secular trend. We see growth in small- and mid-sized businesses everywhere around the world, U.S. and in developing economies particularly. We see a move away from, which we've seen for quite a few years now, high-end black-and-white transactional pages. That move is continuing and has not slowed down. It's -- the momentum is there and we have recognized that and baked that into our business model and our guidance on a go-forward basis. We have not seen a slowdown or a shift in those secular trends at all. If you look at the macro environment, and then I'll bring it altogether, we have seen a considered slowing of business in Europe. We saw this a little bit later than most. But in the first -- and in the first quarter, we definitely started to see the pickup. We have seen acceleration of that softness in the second quarter, towards the end of the second quarter. That's the reason why we've adjusted our guidance downwards. We're now assuming and planning for mid-single-digit declines in equipment revenue in the Technology segment. This is revenue in Technology segment. This is a big change from where we were in the first quarter. We were thinking that we could hold that to flat to low single-digits. Now I think that's not a realistic expectation. So secular trends haven't changed. I mean, we haven't seen a change. If you look at North America and DMO, we still see pickup in color, move to MPS, a slowdown in high-end black-and-white printing, a pickup of SMB businesses. So that's still there. And on a macro side, we are definitely seeing a weak Europe. I hope that answered it.","Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC","Yes. No, that was helpful. My next question is for Lynn actually or Ursula, or whoever wants to take it. Can you talk a bit about what's going on in the health care side in your Services business. Opportunities, challenges, given Obamacare and all that sort of developing right now?","Ursula M. Burns","I'll have Lynn take it. We are pleased, really pleased and very excited about health care. But I'll have Lynn dive into it. It's a real winner for us. Lynn?","Lynn R. Blodgett","Shannon, as you know, we are very well positioned in all of the aspects of health care. Our health care business has grown and is now a significant part of the overall portfolio. And we have Services in the private sector, both in the payer and the provider side and on the government side. And so this -- the whole effort around Affordable Care is something that we feel we're very well positioned for, as well as just the continued evolution on the private side. So we feel very, very good about our position in health care.","Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC","But can you give us some idea of how big it is?","Lynn R. Blodgett","It's right now about $2 billion of the portfolio, so about 10% of the overall portfolio, and it's growing nicely.","Ursula M. Burns","And that $2 billion is just for the health care provision in BPO and ITO. We have obviously in our Technology side, we have support of the health care as well. But for the Services business, BPO and ITO, we are definitely a leader here. We also have just recently won some new business throughout the States, and you'll be seeing that in the next quarter.","Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC","Great. And then my follow-up question for Luca, we've been hearing more about sort of questions about the leasing business, your thoughts on how big of a leasing business you need to maintain, given your mix to a -- or your migration to Services. So can you talk a little bit about how you think about the leasing business strategically?","Luca Maestri","Well, the leasing business is directly related to our equipment revenue. We support our customers by financing those leases. 85% of all the equipment that we sell is financed by ourselves to our customers. You would see that the size of the portfolio has come down a bit, in line with the decline in equipment revenue. It is really a part and parcel of our go-to-market strategy. It is a great differentiator for us in the marketplace, particularly at times when credit becomes difficult. So it's a business that we like because it's very profitable and it's very much bundled together with the rest of the Technology business. It will follow -- in terms of the sizing, it will follow very much the progression in our Technology revenue and particularly equipment revenue.","Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC","Is this something that you need to keep in the same size you have? Or is it something where you can look for partners,though [ph] over time?","Luca Maestri","Well, again, it's a profitable business. Of course, if we can find more efficient ways to run it, we will do so. At this point, again, it's a very profitable business, and that's the way we're keeping it right now.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Barclays Capital.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wanted to ask you if we should be concerned about Services bookings down 26% in the quarter after being down 27% year-over-year the prior quarter on some pretty easy compares and the dropoff in the renewal rate.","Luca Maestri","So Ben, let me start with the renewal rate. Renewal rate was excellent during the second quarter, we're at 89% with the top of our range of 85% to 90%. The drop in bookings, very much driven by less renewal potential. Less renewal potential is not necessarily bad. It means that we got long-term contracts. And in this given quarter, we didn't have much link [ph] to renew. And as you know, renewing contracts tends to bring some compression in margins. If you look at our new business signings and you look at it on a trailing 12-month basis, actually we're up 13%, very good. And by the way, we have seen some level of delays in decision-making during the quarter, particularly in Document Outsourcing. Our pipeline is now -- has now grown 10% in the quarter. So new business signings up 13%, pipeline up 10%. So we are not concerned about the progression of signings.","Lynn R. Blodgett","One of the other things, Ben, this issue of renewal, it's a kind of an interesting metric because it actually is better for us. If you consider the risk that's associated with renewals, and as Luca said, with margin compression, the fact that we don't have much up for renewal is a good thing and we renewed a high percentage of that. So we feel very good about renewals and we're glad there wasn't a lot up for grabs.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Yes. With regard to the Technology segment, if you could just kind of talk a little bit more about your positioning. What we're seeing is a rapid dropoff in a lot of the entry level in the inkjet -- some of the inkjet areas for certain players. And I was just wondering if you could talk about your relative positioning among the segments. You tend to call an entry level at a higher level than some of the others. And if you could just talk about your relative positioning there and by the segment and what kind of deceleration you're expecting.","Ursula M. Burns","Right. So there's 2 ways to look at this. First is on the traditional single-function low end, either consumer or very small business, very, very small business market. We are a de minimis player in that portion of the market. We serve those customers through resellers. Any resellers who are interested in taking our products and moving it, we're a very, very small player there. The next segment is a little bit higher up in the SMB place and primarily color and multifunction devices, A4 configuration but some small A3 as well. If you look at our install growth across entry, we've grown installs in all of those places and even in the very, very small color printers, A4 color and A4 Mono. But we are relatively small in this segment and serve it through resellers. The way we participate here is through MPS. And MPS does 2 things for us. One, we can deliver some of our technology into a client's account, SMB and large customers as well. But we also, through our success in MPS, take over pages in clients' accounts that are not done on our technology today. So what we are seeing is definitely a softening of the market potential for the small devices, particularly single-function devices. And we participate in that, not by bringing new technology only but by bringing new offer called MPS. I hope that answered it.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes. And could you just clarify how -- what kind of growth rate now you expect at the high end, considering I think it has a disproportionate share of the EBIT in the segment?","Ursula M. Burns","Yes. We still -- we expect to continue to grow color, high-end color, mid- to high and high-end color installs and activity and revenue, particularly in color. And we expect to continue to see weakness or declines, revenue declines in our high-end black-and-white business. There's no doubt about either those things. Luca -- you want to say something Luca? Because I think that, that's -- yes, so the trends haven't changed. I mean, we're shifting towards color. We're still moving some pages down from offset to color, driven by applications. That's why we're seeing even in weak economic environment some buoyancy in color, the color metrics, and we are definitely continuing to see the move from black-and-white in the high-end.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I'd like to extend Ben's question for a second if I could. On bookings, A, what are you anticipating for the next couple of quarters? The compares certainly don't get any easier. And then part -- well, I'll save part B of that question. But if you could just go over A for a second.","Luca Maestri","We anticipate a sequential progression in signings. We know we signed a lot during the course of the second half of last year. But clearly, we expect the signings acceleration as we get into Q3.","Ursula M. Burns","The pipeline is growing. The pipeline is strong and is growing. It's growing 10% and is growing across the 3 lines of business and in subsegments of the business, so we're not seeing a concentration of pipeline at all and we're seeing expansion in just about all over the line. So we do expect this, as Luca said, for signings to continue to be strong.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. But if I extend that for a second, let's presume for the year because right now, you are down 26% year-over-year first half. So let's say you're down 20% to 25% for the year on your bookings. With that as an assumption, will you still be able to grow Services, say, in the mid-single-digits to high single-digits as you look out over calendar year '13?","Lynn R. Blodgett","Yes. I think that the signings rate that you're looking at is a little bit misleading because of the renewals. And again, if we don't have the challenge of renewing something, that's better than it coming up for renewal because we don't have a reprice and that is skewing the number. As Luca said, we definitely have a difficult compare in the second half. But we expect bookings, new business bookings, which are the things that -- new business bookings and renewal rate are the 2 things -- not renewal volume but renewal rate, are the things that drive growth. And because those are improving, we feel comfortable in maintaining the growth rates.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. Let me ask another on Services. Ursula, for you, the tuck-in acquisitions is identified as being $300 million to $400 million for the full year. Is that a run rate we should be thinking about even as we look at CY '13?","Ursula M. Burns","We haven't given a lot of guidance on CY '13. But I would say that acquisitions across-the-board in both Services -- across-the-board in Services and in Distribution, a little bit less there, are part of the business model for our business. And so tuck-in acquisitions is something that you should continue to see, particularly in Services, for the foreseeable future.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. I'm going to ask one more, then I'll cede the floor. For Lynn, if I could, Lynn, could you just describe how your direct level reports have changed in the last year as the business has changed? And what I'm interested in is the influx of, say, Xerox people or even adding to third parties from Accentures to the IBMs of the world that would help in the consulting side of the business or ITO areas.","Lynn R. Blodgett","Well, I think that we have a very good mix, particularly in my direct report of people who have experience from the private sector and the public sector. We have continued to, over the last year, to align the chief -- the operating officers on a more vertical basis, so we have a commercial health care person, a government health care person and so on. So we think that improves the focus and the subject matter expertise. And we've had nice movement of people from the traditional ACS side of the business over into the Xerox ranks and vice versa. So my chief financial officer, for example, is directly from Xerox and has been a tremendous addition to us. And we continue to look outside. We try to promote from within as much as we can. But we also know that it's -- that you have to have a healthy mix of new talent. A lot of our new talent comes via acquisition. And that's probably the biggest force of influx of new talent. But we, because of each competitor that we have, go through cycles. And when one is having difficulties, we try to take advantage of that and hire talent from those people.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Murray.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","I guess, the first one is for Luca. Luca, can you walk through how much wiggle room, I guess, through the cash flow dynamics for a CFO? And I know you sound like you said you came in line with what you were expecting this quarter. I think it was a little bit lighter than what most folks were expecting. So can you talk through sort of the wiggle room in the reiteration of the guidance for the second half of the year? Sort of, I guess, how comfortable are you now with that guidance, because you didn't lower it, but you're lowering overall P&L guidance, and maybe what some of the influences are in there? And are there any tailwinds that we should be thinking of?","Luca Maestri","Sure. And let me start with that, with the issue of guidance. So we're still comfortable with the $2 billion to $2.3 billion even though we've taken earnings down. When you look at our reduction of guidance in EPS, when you do the math, it translates to approximately $100 million of pretax cash earnings. So that obviously, that's a headwind. What offsets that is the fact that a portion of the reduction comes from equipment. And so also our leasing business will reduce, our leasing receivables will come down, and that will give us a partial offset in cash. And then the other tailwind that we have is that we now expect our pension contributions to be about $50 million lower than we were forecasting previously because of this recent pension funding legislation that was passed at the end of June. So that's why we end up with a similar cash flow as prior quarter. When we look at it in progression, first half versus second half, again, we have delivered exactly the same level of cash flow in 2012 first half versus the first 6 months of 2011, when you exclude the different timing of the pension contributions. So as we look ahead and we know how much cash we have delivered last year, again, we think we can be well within the range.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","Awesome. And I guess, for probably for sort of for Luca and for Lynn, on the Services operating margin expectations for the second half of the year, how does the macro softness -- or does macro softness influence what you guys are expecting from the Services side through the year? Then I have a follow-up to that as well.","Luca Maestri","Yes. In general, Services is much more resilient to the macro, but there are areas of our Services business that -- and we've seen it already in Q2 where, for example, transportation or customer care, that you end up getting lower volumes with lower levels of activity. But as we look at our progression, we said it before, we expect that by Q4, we will be within our target range, 11% to 13% for our Services operating margins. And we were pleased with the progress that we made in Q2. We expect Q3 to be more or less in that ballpark that we've seen for Q2.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division","And Luca -- it's just a follow-up on that. I mean, are the operating margins in Services, have they been tracking relative to your expectations? And do you have any -- is there anything that can possibly offset some of the lower volumes like lower unemployment claims or something like that?","Luca Maestri","Of course, we have such a diversified portfolio that you always get some offset. But again in Q2, we -- our operating margin in Services was slightly ahead of our expectations.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.","Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I have a question on the supplies revenue growth. You had mentioned that it was partially driven by timing of purchases for channel partners. Could you dig into that a bit more and help us understand how much of an impact that had on growth? And then off of that, how should we think about the growth pattern as a result of that in the third and fourth quarters? And then I guess, finally on that, how should we think about macro risks to supplies consumption in coming quarters, given that I think some of your competitors are starting to see some consumption pressure as a result of the macro environment?","Luca Maestri","Yes. So let me start with Q1 and Q2. There were inventory dynamics in Q1. They were kind of negative, so we were down 7%. In Q2, the positive 5%, Bill, is a combination of an easier compare because of the Japan situation last year. And I would say it was about 50-50, some of it was the reversal of some of this inventory dynamics, some of it was the easier compare. As we look at the second half of the year, we expect some slight decline. So when you look at the full year for supplies, down slightly for the full year, which is exactly what we said last time around. And of course, some of it is around macro weakness.","Ursula M. Burns","And you asked about the supply consumption and what -- how they tie to macro. Remember that these supplies that we're reporting here is not all of the supplies that we actually sell in our business. Most of the supplies are bundled in our contracts. This is about 20% of the supplies, and as Luca said, is volatile given our channel partners buying at certain times versus pricing, et cetera, and their cash flow needs. But on the major portion of our business, the supplies are trending towards the macro environment, which is a move towards color, a move towards MPS. So all of the things -- and a move away from black-and-white at the high-end. That is in the business model and incorporated in how our supplies are being consumed.","Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then one more question. There's been quite a bit of variability on share count estimates for you guys, particularly as folks try to fine-tune the timing of the buybacks. Just so we're all level set, can you help us understand how you're thinking about the diluted share count dynamic in the third and fourth quarter and as we exit the year?","Luca Maestri","Yes. So Bill, we provided on Page 20 of our deck, we provided you with the fully diluted shares as of June 30, right? That we are at 1,366 million. And then you need to think about it in terms of the different dynamics. We're going to be buying back shares throughout that quarter, I would say relatively consistently. And we will be issuing some minor amounts for stock compensation plans. And then you need to do the average of the 3 months. And then you'll come out with an -- weighted average shares for adjusted EPS for Q3. And then you take whatever is the ending point and that would be your starting point for Q4. I hope it's clear enough. But clearly, we can give you much more detail, if you want, separately.","Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Well, I guess, just to clarify the variability, particularly is on the fourth quarter. Some folks have a pretty significant decline in the share count because of buyback assumptions. So specifically if you could help us understand how we should think about that sequential move with the back-end-loaded nature of your buyback.","Luca Maestri","No. Right. You're not going to see it. You're not going to see the full impact, right, because it's going to be a weighted average of the 3 months of Q4. So for the purposes of EPS, it's obviously a limited impact. You will have the full effect only starting in January of 2013.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.","Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question is more high-level. Just curious here, Ursula or Lynn, if you're starting to see some folks pull forward purchases because they're worried about decreased purchasing power owing to currency fluctuations down the road. So are you worried that maybe the forward quarters are maybe being mortgaged here in the very near term because of some currency issues?","Ursula M. Burns","Not at all. We are not seeing -- that dynamic is an interesting one that you just said. We're not seeing that. We see a healthy mix of people telling us that they're going to wait, people buying now and people -- we don't see a lot of people saying, \"Please, I want to buy earlier.\" We're seeing a normal business mix here, particularly on the Services side. On the Technology side, what we are seeing is people saying, \"For any large equipment purchase, let me think about it a little bit more.\" And for -- and therefore, sweating their assets a little bit more. And therefore, what we see, equipment sales revenue softness with that. That's primarily happening in Europe, but we're also seeing in the United States a mix down. So people are buying, particularly in color, for example, they're -- our color install growth and activity growth was at the lower end of the high segment of that market. And so you see a huge activity growth, but it doesn't always translate to revenue because the number of devices -- the sizes of the devices are smaller. But we're not seeing people move forward stuff and therefore putting pressure on our go-forward.","Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then the other question here, either for Luca or Lynn, just kind of curious here in terms of the Services business. You're definitely signaling, it appears, that the gross margin improvement in Services are sustainable. And I'm trying to figure out how that impacts the cash flow. Are we getting to the point now where you're going to finally see later this year and early 2013 that positive inflection point, where the start-up costs of a lot of these Services engagements starts to fade, and thereby you start having better gross margin but also better cash flow? And is that supporting the cash flow reiteration for 2012?","Luca Maestri","So first of all, on gross margins. And I think you're asking about operating margins on the Services side as well, right? Let me repeat, we expect to see -- to come out of 2012 at an operating margin level for Services which is better than 2011. And obviously, we believe that, that will carry forward in 2013 and give us some tailwind. Regarding capital use and the ramp-up of these contracts, clearly, the investments that we've made for the contracts that we're ramping up are declining because we've now ramped up these contracts. But we want to continue to grow this business. And depending on the profile of the contracts that we're going to be signing, there's going to be capital requirements. And certainly, we're not going to shy away from growing the Services business because it requires some capital investment upfront. From an operating cash flow perspective, I'll just repeat what I just said before. We are comfortable with our guidance. And it includes the type of investments that we need to make for the Services business. This year, in general, the Services business has fewer megadeals than we've seen in 2010 and 2011. These megadeals typically requires additional capital. So when you do a compare year-over-year, there's less use of capital on the Services side for new contracts.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.","Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I wanted to ask about the competitive environment on both the Technology business and the Services business. Ursula, on Technology, in your prepared remarks, you indicated you're gaining some market share, so I was hoping to flush that out a little bit. Where are you seeing market share gains, against which competitors and in which segments? And then secondly, as it relates to Services and the deferral of activity that you referenced, are you likewise seeing an increasing competitive environment or pricing environment on those new contracts?","Ursula M. Burns","Okay. I will take the share, and then I'll have Lynn chime in on the pricing environment of Services. So on competitive environment in Technology, we are absolutely gaining share, publicly reported, externally reported positioning, we gained share in all -- we've gained share in all segments of the business in North America and in developing markets. And it's kind of hard to tell what's exactly happening in Europe. It seems like we're gaining share there as well, but we also have some share weakness in certain segments. So potentially, yes, we're gaining share.","Lynn R. Blodgett","If I can just interject on -- just trying to help you, Ursula, that's all. In terms of the deferral of opportunities that was just alluded to, that, first of all, is not substantial and it's not driven by a change in competition. It has much more to do with people just being a little more cautious in their decisioning process. We're always asked about the change in competition or are we seeing a significant shift from one competitor to another. Because we're in so many different markets, we deal with competitors, a very wide set of competitors. And in general, we haven't seen any sort of a material shift in the competitive landscape.","Ursula M. Burns","Let me go back to Technology, I'm not choking anymore. So as I said, we are gaining share particularly in the United States and in key markets in developing markets. We are gaining in most segments. And the competitors that we're taking from are other traditional competitors. I mean, there is Ricoh, who has some challenges that they're working their way through in 2012. There's HP, there's -- I mean, normal places, different competitors, different segments. The most competitive segment right now is the high end of the color printing business. It's probably the most competitive segment, and we're holding our own there, and in certain places, winning share.","Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","My follow-up is around R&D and your commitment to R&D. On a year-on-year basis, R&D is down 8%, on a 2-year basis, it's down 17%. Is this level of R&D sustainable over time? And can you continue to cut R&D and remain competitive in both Tech and Tech Services?","Luca Maestri","Important to keep in mind that when you look at our R&D number, they're only a fraction of what we spend, right? Our R&D activities are coordinated with Fuji Xerox in Japan. And when you combine the R&D spend of the 2 companies, you actually conclude that our R&D investment in Technology is very healthy. There are some areas of R&D, particularly the noncore areas, where obviously, we're looking for cost efficiencies and we look for outsourcing opportunity in that space. But those are again, I repeat, the noncore portions of R&D. We feel very well -- very good about our product development capabilities, as is reflected in the fact that we've been gaining market share for several quarters.","Ursula M. Burns","And innovation in Services shows up in a shift that we're making in our core R&D that you see reported. But also other innovation in Services happens in a way that doesn't come out, it's almost in the operating expense line of the business. So we're very focused on R&D, on innovation, very focused on innovation. We are coordinating with Fuji Xerox and we are absolutely not stepping away from being a market leader in all of the areas that we said were focus for us. That's Services, all lines, small- and medium-sized business, so we have a lot of efforts there, color for sure and MPS, spending a lot of money in those areas. And we'll continue on a go-forward basis.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Alban Gashi with Credit Suisse.","Alban Gashi - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess, my question is as the Technology business comes down throughout the year, given the equipment downturn, how does that impact the Technology margins as you get higher supply side? And then just a quick follow-up for Lynn on Services.","Luca Maestri","No. Obviously, without a doubt -- and that is the reason why we've reduced guidance on EPS. Without a doubt, a slowdown in equipment and a slowdown in Technology revenue, in general, has an impact on margins, so we're going to see some lower margins on the Technology side. The way we deal with it is the way we've been dealing with it for many years, which is really relentless focus on cost management and trying to grow those areas of the business that provide some growth opportunity. But that's fundamentally, Alban, the reason why we've taken EPS down.","Alban Gashi - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess, Lynn, on the Services margin. As you get back into your target range of 11% to 13%, can you put into context some of the drivers of between the mega contracts maturing, overall operational improvements, and then just revenue growth and mix, sort of ranking them?","Lynn R. Blodgett","Well, I think that the biggest contributor would be the ramping of the megadeals. But as Luca said, we haven't had as many megadeals this year as last year so that in and of itself should provide us some relief. But we also want to continue. We never want to shy away from an opportunity that has a reasonable return associated with it because of the start-up expense. And so we're -- we think it will come from the lower megadeals, where as we implement, we improve operational efficiency. So you have that investment that happens when you're starting up, and then you have a natural improvement in productivity just as the contract matures so that will also contribute. But we hope that our bookings will continue strong, and so that will counterbalance that to a certain extent.","Alban Gashi - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And I guess, just as a quick follow-up to that. As you end the year in the fourth quarter, you said you expected to be higher year-over-year than the fourth quarter of last year. But I guess, where are you expected to be within the 11% to 13% range?","Luca Maestri","Within that range.","Alban Gashi - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Lower, higher end?","Luca Maestri","Yes. Solidly within the range.","Ursula M. Burns","Solidly within the range. And we'll give you more -- we have an investor conference in November, and we'll be able to give you more detail about the Services business and the progression that we're making there, which is very strong, very good on just about every operational line. And the Technology business, where we still have a very strong position, we'll be able to lay out in more detail what we expect for 2013 and beyond at the investor conference.","So thanks for your time and for your interest and please enjoy the weekend. Thank you.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference call.

He is joined by Bill Osbourn, Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com\/investor. At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and\/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without the express permission of Xerox. After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which, by their nature, address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein.","At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Visentin. Mr. Visentin, you may begin.","Giovanni Visentin","Good morning and thank you all for joining our Q1 2019 Earnings Call. Today I'm going to give you a progress report on how we're executing on our strategy, starting with our financial highlights. Our transformation initiatives are yielding results, which gives us confidence to raise our full-year earnings guidance despite revenue declines. We are investing in our core business as well as new technologies that create value for our stakeholders and positions Xerox for the long-term growth.","Overall, we saw improvements in margin, operating cash flow and earnings per share as compared to the prior year period. Adjusted operating margin was 11.3% up a 140 basis points year-over-year. Margin expansion contributed to us delivering adjusted earnings per share of $0.91 up $0.23 or 34% year-over-year. We generated $226 million of operating cash flow, an increase of $10 million from a year-ago. Free cash flow was $211 million up $13 million year-over-year.","While we drove improvements in these three key measures, revenue in the first quarter was down 7% at constant currency year-over-year. As a result, we are increasing investments in near-term revenue directed initiatives, which we expect to see benefits from as we move through the balance of 2019. The anticipated benefits of these investments together with the relative stability of our underlying page volume trends give us confidence to maintain our revenue guidance of approximately 5% down for the year at constant currency.","Given our results in the first quarter, we are raising our guidance for full-year adjusted EPS from $3.70 per share to $3.80 per share to $3.80 per share to $3.95 per share. At our Investor Day in February, we discussed the key drivers of Project Own It, our enterprise wide initiative to simplify and streamline our operation and still a culture of continuous improvement. This year we expect Project Own It to deliver at least $640 million in gross savings and the results already delivered by Project Own It enable us to increase EPS guidance for the year while also increasing investments in our business.","In the first quarter, we accelerated building a more efficient shared services operation, which we anticipate will deliver at least $90 million in savings this year, while making it easier for clients to do business with us. We also began standing up and automation center of excellence and implementing rule-based robotic process automation across many of our repeatable work streams such as invoice processing.","By automating invoice processing, we increase accuracy, reduce processing time, and improve client satisfaction all while reducing costs. The rationalization of our real estate portfolio is another area where we made significant progress. We consolidated 83% of our targeted sites, which enables employees to co-located and increased collaboration while we reduce our costs.","Lastly, we are starting to see benefits of work we put in with our suppliers to increase the velocity of our supply chain and improved pricing. As for revenue, it will take time to change our trajectory and we took that into account when we developed our plan for the year and provided our full-year guidance.","In the first quarter, two factors, primarily led to a larger decline in revenue despite relative stability in underlying page volume trends. The first was timing of both equipment sales revenue and transactional post sales revenue. Second, we saw a slowdown in some areas impacted by changes made to the business.","We implemented several key actions under Project Own It in Q4 2018 and early Q1 2019. And we don't want to minimize the risk of disruption that change brings. But in each case, we chose to implement these actions now because we know that they are best for Xerox in the long-term. And we already have plans and action investments underway to help ensure the disruption is temporary.","We are seeing growth trends in certain key areas. Clients are signaling that they believe in our strategy, products and services by rewarding us for renewals and some large competitive win backs. These trends together with our revenue directed investments and the relative stability of our underlying page volume trends gives us confidence to maintain our guidance of approximately 5% down for the year at constant currency.","Our entry level category expanded and we are starting to see traction with our A4s. To help support growing both our A4 and A3 replacements, we are investing in programs that target competitive equipment and expand our distribution channels.","In the high-end category, we are now nearly flat with continued momentum from the Iridesse production press. The Iridesse is the only digital press that can print up to six colors in one single pass with excellent accuracy and the ability to embellish with decorative inks like gold, silver, clear and white.","Iridesse performed well in Q1 and continues to attract new customers and knockout competition with a strong value proposition, while also protecting our critical machines in the field. In the first quarter, 40% of our placements came from competitive trade-ins and new business.","Within services and software, we are investing in our portfolio of next-generation offerings and we are seeing momentum. We have secured several multi-million dollar, multi-year deals and key renewals with clients such as Delta Air Lines and Morrisons, one of the largest retailers in the UK.","Services and software is an area where we expect to see additional improvement throughout 2019. We are investing in our expanded portfolio of services and software solutions in healthcare, insurance, public sector and retail as well as cross-industry solutions, such as accounts payable and campaigns on demand. We are leveraging our core competencies and intellectual property to diversify revenue mix move into adjacent markets and offer end-to-end solutions.","For instance, our intelligent workplace services, elevates traditional managed print services and offering Xerox Pioneer and continues to maintain its leadership position in. With intelligent workplace services, we have added advanced analytics and security features to create this next-generation offering which adds further differentiation and value for our clients. Two additional areas where we are investing include growing our direct sales force and expanding our channel business.","Next month, we will bring partners together for our first ever Global Partner Summit to introduce them to our new product portfolio and roadmap. We have made progress on our innovation roadmap, which includes four focus areas; 3D printing and digital manufacturing, digital packaging and print, sensors and services for the IoT, and AI workflow assistance.","Vader Systems, the Liquid Metal Jet 3D printer manufacturer, we recently acquired has now been integrated into our R&D organization. By pairing our expertise with Vader\u2019s IP, we are looking to apply this technology to a broader set of materials, while lowering the run rate cost for our clients.","Next month, we will be exhibiting our 3D capabilities for the first time at RAPID + TCT, one of the largest additive manufacturing trade shows in North America. We are actively identifying strategic partnerships and additional early customer adopters for additive manufacturing initiatives.","Similarly, beta testing has expanded for our SaaS-based AI workflow assistance that support knowledge workers with authoring proposals and other business development documents. We are now testing it within Xerox and at a few small and mid-size clients and Fortune 500 companies","There is strong potential for this technology to disrupt the RFP process an area, where companies spend an estimated $60 billion annually. Our innovation efforts aren't just about investing in these longer-term opportunities. We are also investing in and advancing our core printer business.","In Graphic Communications, we revealed the Xerox Rialto 900 MP Inkjet Press, a roll-to-cut sheet platform designed to deliver maximum productivity per square meter. This new model increases output by 33%. The Rialto 900 MP will be available in Q3 2019 globally.","In Workplace Solutions, we enabled mobile on-the-go print services with the Xerox Instant Print Kiosk. What's unique about our kiosk is that it offers an array of self-serve document processing capabilities with the ability to charge on a per job basis providing our clients an additional opportunity to drive revenue.","Cybersecurity is a central challenge for our clients. At our Security Summit held in Washington, we announced that Xerox AltaLink MFPs are now embedded with security technologies that can detect and neutralize cyber threats instantaneously. This kind of rapid response is critical when seconds means the difference between an effective threat response and a compromising breach.","These are types of security features that have helped us stand apart from our competition and have earned this recognition from industry analysts like IDC. We continue to take a disciplined approach to investing in innovation to ensure we leverage our capital efficiently.","Operating cash flow in the first quarter was $226 million, an increase of $10 million year-over-year and free cash flow in the first quarter was $211 million, up $13 million year-over-year. We repurchased $103 million of our shares, distributed $62 million in dividends and repaid $406 million in debt in the quarter. As a result, we ended the quarter with $723 million of cash on the balance sheet.","Before wrapping up, I want to directly address some of the most frequent questions we get. We are seeking shareholder approval of a holding company, reorganization at our Annual Meeting scheduled for May 21. This is a common structure used by technology companies to gain more flexibility to structure long-term investments. It does not change our business operations or our overall strategy and its adoption is not related to or in contemplation of any specific transaction or opportunity.","We are also evaluating strategic alternatives for our leasing business. We've said all along that this is a good business, but it may not be the most efficient use of our balance sheet. It is possible that there may be no transaction. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and ensuring our clients continue to have excellent service.","With strong margins and EPS expansion driven by Project Own It, we are increasing investments in our business beyond the $0.32 of EPS, we originally forecasted for the year, with a continued emphasis on revenue related investments. We expect to see the benefits of these revenue related investments through the balance of 2019 and into 2020.","Now I would like to hand it over to Bill to cover our financial results in detail.","William Osbourn","Thank you, John. As John reviewed, we saw good progress on costs and productivity from Project Own It that drove margin improvement, which coupled with higher equity income and lower shares resulted in strong adjusted earnings expansion, up 34% and enables us to raise our full-year adjusted earnings guidance to $3.80 to $3.95, from a range of $3.70 to $3.80. This was all also demonstrates the current positive earnings expansion set up that we have while we build the foundation to turnaround revenue.","I will now review in more detail the income statement. In total, revenue declined 7% in constant currency and 9.4% at actual currency. This below trend was largely driven by two factors, lower transactional revenues and a decrease in activity in certain areas as we implemented some of our transformational actions.","I'll cover these factors in more detail when I review revenue. However, it is important to note that we saw relative stability and underlying page volume trends and anticipate revenue rates of decline will improve each quarter as we move through 2019.","Turning to profitability. Adjusted operating margin of 11.3% improved 140 basis points year-over-year and drove $7 million in operating profit growth is the decline in revenue was more than offset by Project Own It\u2019s driven improvement in gross margin of 50 basis points and in SAG as a percentage of revenue of 100 basis points.","RD&E was 4.2% of revenue which was 10 basis points higher year-over-year due to lower revenue as well as reductions in sustaining engineering there were partially offset by investments within our research centers and incubation programs in support of our growth initiatives.","Below operating profit adjusted equity income of $57 million increased $46 million year-over-year from one-time adjustments in the prior year as well as benefits to Fuji Xerox from the recent cost actions. Adjusted other expenses net of $26 million was $21 million worse year-over-year driven by lower gains on asset sales while the adjusted tax rate of 26% decreased 2.3 points year-over-year.","Overall adjusted EPS of $0.91 was up $0.23 from the first quarter of 2018. On a GAAP basis we had $0.55 of earnings per share, which was up $0.47 from the first quarter of 2018. The largest drivers of the difference between GAAP and adjusted we're transaction costs in the prior year of $38 million associated with the terminated Fuji transaction and a $35 million credit in 2019 associated with the U.S. Tax Act. The difference between GAAP and adjusted EPS also includes our normal adjustments around restructuring and related costs including those for Fuji Xerox, non-service retirement related costs and amortization of intangible assets.","To quickly touch on restructuring and related costs; in Q1 we had $112 million of charges in line with our plan. In addition to normal course restructuring this amount included $50 million of asset impairment and other facility related charges as we consolidate and decommission facilities as well as $38 million related to severance costs that we are contractually required to pay our employees transferred as part of the shared services arrangement we recently entered into with HCL. We continue to expect approximately $225 million of restructuring related costs for the full-year.","Before moving on to our discussion of cash flows, I wanted to cover one other guidance update. We believe our stock at these levels represents a good value and return on investment. Accordingly, we are increasing our full-year expectations for share repurchase to at least $600 million from at least $300 million. With the expectation that the incremental repurchases will be weighted toward the latter part of the year.","Moving now to cash flow, operating cash flow was a source of $226 million, up $10 million year-over-year and free cash flow was $211 million up $13 million. This represents a good start to the year and what historically is our seasonally lowest cash flow quarter and puts us on track to deliver our full-year operating cash flow guidance of $1.15 billion to $1.25 billion and free cash flow guidance of $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion.","Key cash flow drivers in Q1 included a higher use of cash from accrued compensation, $73 million in Q1 2019 versus $32 million in Q1 2018 as we move the timing of the payment of 2018 annual bonuses into Q1 this year. A use of cash, within working capital of $45 million as the decrease in cash flow from accounts payable due to the timing of supplier and vendor payments as well as lower spending more than offset a lower used or improvement in inventory.","Restructuring payments of $33 million and defined pension plan contributions of $34 million both were lower year-over-year driven in part by changes to our policies and benefits. Finance assets or a source of $110 million reflecting both seasonality was a source of $93 million in 2018 as well as lower originations and the move we have seen over time of sales to channels with lower internal financing penetration.","CapEx in the quarter was a use of $15 million, which was modestly under the $18 million in 2018. We continue to expect approximately $150 million of CapEx for the full-year. Lastly, within financing cash flows, we returned $165 million or 78% of free cash flow to shareholders through $62 million in dividends and $103 million in share repurchase, representing 3.3 million shares at an average price of $31.05 per share.","If we turn to the next Slide, I'll review in more detail, the revenue dynamics in the quarter. As referenced earlier, first quarter revenue declined 9.4% or 7% in constant currency, and included a negative one point impact from the OEM business that has been running off the loss of a large customer. This negative impact will decrease to only about half a point starting in Q2.","Overall, the revenue decline was below our full-year expectations are down approximately 5% in constant currency, driven by two unique factors. First, timing within transactional revenue streams both ESR and within post sale. And second, a slowdown in some areas where we made organizational coverage changes.","Looking forward, we expect the rate of decline to improve each quarter sequentially on a year-over-year basis, getting us in the range of an approximate 5% decline in constant currency for the full-year. Currency impact to lesson during the year, but still slightly more than 1% negative full-year impact.","This improvement comes from moving beyond some of the Q1 headwinds, as well as from expectations, that benefits will begin to build from investments we are making to drive revenue. Our Q1 profitability allows us to increase our planned revenue investments through the year.","Turning for a closer look at revenue streams, starting with equipment. Although down 10.2% or 7.6% in constant currency, results were actually mixed. Entry once again showed growth and was up 3.2% in constant currency driven by indirect channels, high-end improved from recent trends and was relatively flat year-over-year in constant currency with positive mix dynamics, driven by strong sales of the Iridesse production press as well as good activity in the high-end inkjet driven by our Brenva press.","Offsetting these positives were declines in mid-range, which was down 7.2% in constant currency. As we saw a slowdown in sales in some areas as we implemented organizational changes and where within XBS, we transitioned a significant number of accounts from U.S. enterprise.","Post sale in the quarter was down 9.2% or 6.8% at constant currency. This was off trend of down 5% to 5.5% in constant currency. However, I would like to highlight that the underlying page volume trends while still declining were broadly stable, which gives us confidence in Q2 should begin to show improvement.","Within Q1 results were softer in the two areas we highlighted. First in the more transactional post sale streams, declines were higher driven by lower unbundled sales of paper and supplies and developing market regions following a strong Q4, and within XBS, the timing of larger third-party IT hardware sales. In XBS, we have direct line of sight to a significant third-party IT hardware deal already for Q2.","The secondary related to a slowdown in areas where we have organizational changes. For instance, there were higher declines in the accounts recently transferred to XBS, so as to gain better coverage alignment and where new account management is still ramping up.","To close out our revenue discussion, services which we previously termed Management Document Services or MDS comprised 39% of revenue and declined 2.9% in constant currency. We continue to see growth in SMB services, which comprise approximately 29% of services revenue. However, results here were also impacted by the factors mentioned earlier.","Overall, we expect improvement in services as we gain traction from the recently announced new offerings and coverage investments and recover from lower signings in prior periods.","So to reiterate, we expect improving trends in revenue. However, as we indicated last quarter, we have realistic expectations around the path to improvement and our earnings and cash flow guidance in 2018 do not rely on better revenue trends as was demonstrated with the adjusted EPS guidance increase we announced today.","Shifting now from revenue to profitability and earnings. Adjusted operating margin of 11.3% increased to 140 basis points year-over-year, while adjusted EPS of $0.91 increased $0.23 or 34% year-over-year, which represented our strongest EPS growth in some time. Both very positive results, the point to the progress we're making in transforming our operations.","Looking at the drivers year-over-year, the adjusted operating margin expansion of 140 basis points more than offset the impact of the revenue declines and resulted in $7 million growth in adjusted operating profit. Within our operations as John covered, we are seeing the flow through benefits of Project Own It.","These actions span the enterprise and we are confident in achieving at least $640 million in savings we targeted with the large majority of those savings coming from actions that have already been put in motion. This also puts us on track to deliver our guidance of 100 to 150 basis points improvement in adjusted operating margin for the full-year.","Overall, our operating results coupled with the growth in equity income and lower shares drove our strong earnings. So very positive results on profitability and earnings, which we expect will continue, although I should note that we don't anticipate equity income to provide as much of a benefit in Q2 given the seasonality of Fuji Xerox this fiscal year where our Q2 is their Q1.","I will now finish up with a discussion on capital structure. We ended the first quarter with $4.8 billion of debt and $723 million of cash on the balance sheet. We breakdown debt between financing and core by first calculating the financing debt by applying a 7:1 leverage to our financing assets, financing receivables and equipment on operating leases with the remaining debt assumed to be in support of the core business.","In Q1, this calculation resulted and assumed financing debt of $3.3 billion and core debt of $1.5 billion. As the debt ladder reflects, we repaid our March senior note and have one December maturity of approximately $600 million. Our core net debt was $700 million as of the end of Q1 which was consistent with our 2018 ending core net debt.","Our core leverage at the end of the quarter was less than 2x free cash flow and thus, we do not see any immediate requirement to reduce our core net debt levels. We have access to a number of capital sources as well as ample liquidity to handle upcoming maturities.","Another important element of our capital structure is our pension assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2018 our net unfunded position was $1.2 billion, which compared to $1.4 billion as of the end of 2017 and $2.2 billion as of the end of 2016, and it included approximately $775 million of unfunded pension liabilities which by design do not get funded.","From a funding perspective, we continue to expect contributions of approximately $140 million in 2019 and believe we are well positioned to have a stable level of pension contributions over time. We know there are questions around what our capital structure could look like if we have a transaction for our leasing business, and while this premature for us to provide any specifics, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet, which is important to our business.","I will now hand it back over to John to summarize before we move on to Q&A.","Giovanni Visentin","Thanks, Bill. Last quarter, we said we were executing against our strategic initiatives, which would position us to accelerate our transformation in 2019. With our first quarter results, we are now in that position. Our brand, our people the investments we are making and the improvements to our operation that come from Project Own It gives us confidence to raise our adjusted EPS guidance and maintain our revenue guidance for the year.","We will now open the line for questions. Jennifer?","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks, John. Before we get to the Q&A with John and Bill, I will point out that we have in the appendix to our materials additional supplemental reconciliations and posted on our Xerox Investor Relations website, a full set of earnings materials.","Operator, please open the line for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, ma'am. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Matthew Cabral","Yes. Thank you. Bill just wanted to start off, wonder if you could help us bridge the EPS guidance just between expected underlying operational improvement for the balance of the year versus the Q1 upside that you saw particularly given the contribution from Fuji Xerox, and I know previously you hadn't included share repurchases in your full-year expectations. Just curious if that's part of the increase as well.","William Osbourn","Hey, Matt. Thanks. Yes, so a few points. First of all as John and I stated on the call, we're very pleased with the progress of Project Own It and what it's doing for us from a performance \u2013 operational performance perspective. And just if you look at the first quarter, we are up 140 basis points and adjusted operating margin year-over-year. So obviously, we're comfortable with reiterating our guidance of 100 to 150 basis points.","But with that said, we also said in the prepared remarks that we are \u2013 we have planned for investments during the year, we said during the Investor Day and during fourth quarter earnings call $0.32 and we're continuing with those and we're looking to based on Q1 results to increase those throughout the year.","So the components are you hit on them a little bit from the share repurchase, the original guidance assumed more towards the latter part of the year. As you saw, we purchased a little over $100 million in Q1 and so that will have more of an effect that was originally anticipated. And then we added sort of $300 million which will be, as we go throughout the year we\u2019ll have to work through the first remaining 200, the first 300 and then the second 300 be the latter part of the year.","So both those will be positive and then you know, as I mentioned on the comments also the Fuji Xerox, we expect to be less of a year-over-year favorable effect. They had some one-time accounting items in the prior year, but it really is a combination of the timing of the share repurchases and the benefits from Project Own It.","Matthew Cabral","Got it. And then on post sale you spent some time on this in the prepared remarks, but just wondering if you could dive a little bit deeper into what's driving some of the weakness that you're seeing. And just help us understand the initiatives you have in place to drive improvement and how we should think about the trajectory of post sale for the balance of the year?","Giovanni Visentin","Yes. So in post sale, you will allow our post sale is bundled as we've talked about over a 80% of our post sale is related to bundled contracts and we saw the underlying page volumes being consistent with some prior quarters which drives a lot of that bundled post sale, but there is a portion that is more transactional in nature and can be \u2013 won't be specifically unbundled supplies in the developing markets. We had strong Q4 and it was not as strong as in Q1. We do expect that is a timing issue and we do expect to see that come back.","Another part of the post sale, that's more transactional in nature is paper. It's not a high-margin area, but it's in the developing markets, we still sold paper in particular Mexico was down year-over-year. That may not come back as much, but it is a low-margin items. And then the other item to call out from the transactional perspective and post sale is the IT hardware reselling which several of our XBS course do and that can be lumpy and the year-over-year there that was a decline in Q1, but we do have line of sight to specific transaction in Q2 and Q3 that we will improve that.","But overall, as I said in my comments that we look throughout the year. We're confident based upon our updated forecast, the revenue, constant currency decline that Q1 7% will be the worst and will be improving throughout the remainder year, sequentially each quarter will be better than the next.","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks, Matt.","Matthew Cabral","Thank you.","Jennifer Horsley","Operator, could we have the next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is now open.","Ananda Baruah","Hi guys, good morning. I appreciate you taking the question. I'm going to start with revenue, but before, I'll say, congrats on the solid start to the year. So John, Bill you sound pretty confident that you have your arms around sort of what led the revenue weakness in the areas in which they were softer during the March quarter. Can you just speak a little bit more specifically to what gives you confidence that you have your arms around that? And then if you could also just give a little bit more detail into the areas in which \u2013 the specific areas into which you're increasing the revenue investment. And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.","William Osbourn","Hi, Ananda. Look, I would say if we think what we've done in the last three, four months, we've implemented changes. We reduce layers, we increased spend, we reconfigured our go-to-market, we split DMO between the Americas, we transfer 28,000 accounts from U.S. enterprise XBS, we consolidated our real estate.","So we think of everything we talked about, we optimized our workforce and while we don't ever want to minimize the risk of disruption that created by all these changes, but in each case we made these changes because we know what's best for Xerox in the long-term.","I personally met with over 300 of our managers and I can tell you that while there was some disruption they are all excited about the future because we are investing in the long-term. You've heard me talk a little bit about the areas we're investing in which is in the service of the software, our equipment, our security, the summit we\u2019ve had and in the future and innovation.","So while we knew that this was going to cost some disruption in execution in the early part of the year. It still gives us confidence to increase EPS for the year and it gives us confidence to \u2013 for our guidance of 5% guidance for the years.","Giovanni Visentin","Yes, Ananda, I would just say on U.S. and for some specifics in some of these are programs that we already had in place and our $0.32 and we're just expanding upon them and putting dollars behind them and some of more additional programs, but we are building on our supplies management team to increase attach rates of supplies with additional supplies management sales folks.","As John mentioned in the software sales area, we're adding a significant number of sales specialists. Just to deal with software sales that we didn't have before we have specific targeted programs in the A4 and A3 areas specific targeted marketing programs in those areas and in the eCommerce area.","We're expanding, what we're doing there and we have an SMB attack plan. There's a lot of different initiatives. The dollars are going into those initiatives that we talked about originally, the $0.32 of EPS, we're reinvesting and we are expanding upon those investments as we move throughout this year as the Q1 results allow us to do.","Ananda Baruah","That's really helpful context, but you guys, I appreciate that a lot. Quick follow-up just on the leasing business exploration. Can you share a little bit about the dimensions upon what you're evaluating it? Is it just straight return on capital? Are there some more subjective dimensions as well. And thanks, that's it for me.","William Osbourn","Yes, Ananda. There is a few things we're looking at. One thing is \u2013 I know we've talked about this I brought up of configure discussions that from a balance sheet perspective just look at our leverage in the optics of net debt that is supported by these financing assets. I think it's, we get screened out by certain investors because of that. That's one thing that you look at, you look at our peers and most of our peers and competitors do not have an internal financing business anymore. We also look at it from a simplicity perspective.","This is a core competency that we need to have internally versus externally and naturally we will look at it and say, are we do we believe we're getting the right value for it. And each transaction and that clearly will be evaluated. But you look at just the optics of how it impacts our balance sheet and whether this needs to be a key competency that we have internally within the Company.","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks Ananda. Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Jim Suva","Hi, one clarification question pretty easy, probably more for CFO, the more risk strategy question for CEO John. On the financial question. It might correct that in your prior guidance for the full-year, you did not include any stock buyback and now you are or might just hearing things a little confused today.","And then the strategy question was the expense side, it looks like to own it is having a pretty good material impact and giving great traction. But what are some examples of some revenue items you're doing different that Xerox, potentially could improve upon because in the past, it seems like the story has been again and again about revenues not coming in where you want and we're already starting off the year that way and it looks like the back half of the year, we'll have to see a hockey stick improvement?","Giovanni Visentin","Yes, Jim. So first of all, regarding the EPS guidance that we laid out that we are going to at least $300 million of share repurchase at the Q4 call and then on the Investor Day, but we specifically said that as far as our guidance for the year that was weighted towards the back half of the year, are the latter part of the year we have limited impact to the guidance numbers that we were providing to the extent that was moved up to earlier in the year, which we've been doing this is demonstrated by the $100 million or so repurchase in Q1 that obviously would have an increasing impact on our EPS.","Jim Suva","Yes, very clear. I got it. Thanks.","Giovanni Visentin","And Jim, we're doing a lot. So I talked a little bit about what we've done in terms of reducing layers, moving organization, simplifying our business, and specifically what we've done is, while all the organization has gone on in the last quarter, we've also invested in areas.","So in a competitive win back programs, we've invested heavily in sales organizations, in tools and offerings, if you think of the offerings that we've announced that \u2013 whether it is our security offerings, whether it is our services offerings that we're focused on. All of that is going on in the last month and ready for prime time and all our teams are being trained and ready to go on that and we're starting to see some positive out of it.","I would tell you that. Yes, well, first quarter back to first quarter, I never take disruption lightly, but we knew we made the decision that we were going to do a lot of these changes early. The teams we got, great teams, great leadership team that I've personally met with that have accepted these changes, now we're off and running. So we're confident in maintaining our 5% guidance.","Jim Suva","Thank you.","Jennifer Horsley","Great. Thanks, Jim. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Paul Coster","[Indiscernible] these organizational changes might be in North America, [indiscernible] difference between the two regions. Is that the case and is restructuring \u2013 is the change in the sales now done such that you can get this 5% trajectory over the course of the year.","Giovanni Visentin","We\u2019ve got the second. Paul, we got the second half of your question. The first part will \u2013 you were...","William Osbourn","Yes. You have to go back. I think we have in a bad connection on the first part. I think it say something about organizational changes in the Americas, et cetera. But the second part regarding the disruption and your one key point to look at and thinking about the degree, we did know that we are doing a lot, when you think, there were things we had to do from a restructuring perspective and we said let's get what we can get done as soon as possible.","And if you just look at our restructuring dollars spent in Q1 as a percent of the full-year, that's kind of an indicator that you were targeting still this $225 million or so, a full-year restructuring. We did $112 million in Q1. So a biggest part of the disruption, we do believe is now and is behind us, it's Q4, Q1. There is changes still clear would be made that will be working on throughout the year, but we do believe that the biggest part of the disruption has occurred already.","Giovanni Visentin","Yes.","Paul Coster","Okay. Well, you just did a great job of interpreting my garbled commentary there, but the other part was really the difference between Europe and North America. It looks like the disruption been greater in North America than in Europe, is Europe yet to come?","William Osbourn","Well, I would say that Europe went through changes over the last year. And if you think of what we've done is we've taken areas from Europe and transferred it to North America like LatAm. But having spoken to the leaders and I'll be in Europe in the following month or so and having spoken with all the leaders, everybody is excited about the changes we're making and excited about moving forward.","Paul Coster","Okay. And one last question, you've chosen to some of your cash for repurchasing shares instead of making tuck-in acquisitions that might accelerate the turnaround in revenues, can you just comment on that, John?","Giovanni Visentin","Yes. Look, we're not going to \u2013 we're never going to comment on the potential targets. But we're focused on building a deep M&A pipeline that will support our revenue roadmap, but that pipeline will include tuck-in acquisitions that will help us grow our SMB market and also acquisitions like we just did in an innovation like Vader, a small 3D metal print company that I spoke about earlier. But in each case, all we're going to take a disciplined approach and the investments that will drive the highest IRR. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on.","William Osbourn","And just to remind you, if you look at our full-year capital allocation. There was a significant unallocated $450 million and $550 million. The incremental 300 share repurchase still leaves for the tuck-ins. As John mentioned, we evaluate those on a case-by-case basis and what type of IRR providing us.","Paul Coster","Okay, thank you.","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks, Paul. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Your line is now open.","Shannon Cross","Thank you. I just wanted to go back to the question about acquisitions and I'm just curious, I mean, ASI is in a go-shop right now, clearly from our knowledge of the industry, it would make a lot of sense to layer on. I realize you're focused on share repurchase and you've got a strong dividend. I think John, how you think about if you're going to get to flat revenue in a couple of years and then some growth, is that something you can do with the existing technologies you have whether it's at Park or within Xerox or is it something where you really think you might need to have a bit bigger of an acquisition.","Giovanni Visentin","Shannon, I would reiterate what we said at the Investor Conference where we're going to focus on innovation and we've decided what the four areas of innovation are. And then even inside of the areas that we're in today, we'll look at areas like 3D and digital packaging, and how do we disrupted both in a Xerox inside attitude or in us disrupting the whole industry. On M&A or potential targets, we're not going to comment publicly on it. But like I said earlier, we are taking a disciplined approach and the investment needs to drive IRR for us and look for the strength of Xerox in the future.","Shannon Cross","Okay, thank you. And then just \u2013 because obviously there's been a number of \u2013 a lot of discussion around the leasing business and potential for what might happen to the proceeds. Can you just define for investors what a strong balance sheet means to you? I think you gave some metrics at the Analyst Day, but if you can say at this point where you're at in terms of your definition of the strong balance sheet? Thank you.","Giovanni Visentin","Yes. Hey Shannon, so a couple of things, first of all, and I say this before many times on these calls that we believe that we\u2019re currently our balance sheet is investment grade. We were downgraded towards the end of the year, not because of the state of our balance sheet but because our requirement of our topline being at least flat to growth, but we currently \u2013 with investment grade.","We have a goal of getting back as a company to investment grade, our store actions have been those of supporting a strong balance sheet, we paid down debt. Over time, we funded our pension plan and it's important to us, just from whether it's attracting and retaining significant customers whether they're in the government or elsewhere to have a strong balance sheet and not going to put a specific, number on it, but just know that we believe we are currently investment great quality balance sheet although we were downgraded obviously below that because of our topline performance and we have a goal of getting back there.","Shannon Cross","Great, thank you very much.","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks Shannon. Operator, we have time for one last question.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question will come from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Katy Huberty","Thank you. Good morning. As you pointed out, supplies revenue was particularly weak this quarter despite a fairly constructive business environment and stable page volume trends. Some of your competitors have also seen weakness in supplies. So wondering whether you think that third-party competition is an issue at all in the business and if not, if you can talk a bit more about what you think drove the pull-in of transactional deals into the fourth quarter?","William Osbourn","Yes. So thanks Katy. So you kind of hit on a lot of the points there, but from a supply perspective, the majority are most of ours and we believe it differentiates us from a lot of our competitors are bundled contracts, the tide underlying page volumes, et cetera, and we've seen stability although declining very consistent rates in those page volumes in recent periods and it was more the lumpiness to specifically the unbundled supplies to smaller portion for us and a lot of our peers in the developing markets.","There are \u2013 from time-to-time, there are incentives to pull things to make sales in certain periods and Q4 was strong and supplies. It was up a couple of percent in the unbundled supplies area in Q4. And just looking at the timing of those sales going forward, we believe that they will be coming back in future quarters.","Katy Huberty","Okay. And then just as a follow-up, if I assume a $100 million a quarter of share buyback in the first half, $200 million a quarter in the back half, it could be anywhere from $0.10 to $0.15 of EPS impact for the full-year versus not assuming much last quarter. Is that a fair characteristic of how much you've added to the EPS outlook from share buyback?","William Osbourn","So share repurchase is a part of the guidance and the increase and also the expanding of the range sort of goes to the timing of the share repurchase, where we are $0.10 range or $0.15 range. But naturally you would get to the earlier you purchased the higher \u2013 the later maybe for that range. We're assuming that the incremental $300 million would be more in the latter part of the year.","Katy Huberty","Okay, thank you.","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks Katy. John, anything to wrap up?","Giovanni Visentin","No. Thank you very much. With our transformation initiatives are yielding results, giving us confidence to raise our full-year earnings guidance, while maintaining revenue guidance for the year. Thank you all for joining us today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This does conclude today's program and we may all disconnect. Everybody have a wonderful day."],"22945":["Xerox Corporation (NYSE:XRX) Q4 2018 Results Earnings Conference Call January 29, 2019  8:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Jennifer Horsley - VP, Investor Relations","John Visentin - Vice Chairman and CEO","William Osbourn - EVP and CFO","Conference Call Participants","Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital","Shannon Cross - Cross Research","Jim Suva - Citi","Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to the Xerox Corporation Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Release Conference Call, hosted by John Visentin, Vice Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. He is joined by Bill Osbourn, Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the Web at www.xerox.com\/investor. At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and\/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without the expressed permission of Xerox. After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which, by their nature, address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein.","At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Visentin. Mr. Visentin, you may begin.","John Visentin","Good morning and thank you all for joining us for our fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. This morning we will give you the highlights for the quarter then talk about the progress we've made on our four strategic initiatives and last show you how our results and our strategy position us for 2019 and beyond.","Overall, our fourth quarter results demonstrated improvements across a number of key measures. We delivered adjusted operating margins of 16.1% for the quarter, up 180 basis points year-over-year. This is primarily the result of project Own It, an enterprise-wide initiative we launched in mid 2018 to simply and streamline our operations and instill a culture of continuous improvement. Our margin expansion contributed to us delivering adjusted earnings per share of $1.14 for the quarter, up $0.11 or 10% year-over-year.","On cash flow we overachieved our full-year expectations. We generated $398 million of free cash flow in the fourth quarter, an increase of $101 million year-over-year and we delivered $1.05 billion of free cash flow for full year 2018, which is an improvement of $183 million over 2017. We returned more 92% of that free cash flow to our shareholders in 2018 through share repurchases and dividends, exceeding our commitment to return at least 50% of the free cash flow to shareholders. And we ended the year with $1.1 billion of cash on the balance sheet.","Revenue in the fourth quarter was down 6.1% at constant currency year-over-year, which was in line with our expectations. Bill will discuss the Q4 revenue dynamics on his remarks, but we have developed a three-year roadmap for revenue growth that we will take you through in detail at our Investor Day next week. We continue to progress on our four strategic initiatives; to optimize our operations for greater simplicity, to drive revenue, to reenergize our innovation engine, and to focus on cash flow to drive increasing shareholder returns.","Over the last two quarters we have focused on creating a simpler, more agile, and effective organization to enhance our focus on our customers and our partners, instill a culture of continuous improvement and improve our financial results. When I addressed you last quarter, we had just completed the design phase of project Own It, with the overarching goal to drive end-to-end transformation of our systems and processes to create greater focus, speed, accountability and effectiveness.","These efforts are critical to making us more competitive and giving us the capacity to invest and grow and maximize shareholder returns. Key opportunities under project Own It include establishing more effective shared service centers, nationalizing our IT infrastructure and real estate footprint, creating greater velocity in our supply chain and unlocking greater productivity in our supplier base.","To create a more effective go-to-market organization model, we've restructured the way we serve our customers globally into two units, the Americas and EMEA. We realigned Mexico, Central and South America from our former international operations unit into the Americas, joining the U.S. and Canada and we combined Europe, the Middle East, Africa and India to create EMEA. This geographic alignment creates a more efficient operating structure to support our customers, to streamline our supply chain and to open up greater revenue opportunities.","We have also taken steps to align our SMB business into and under Global Imaging Systems, which we rebranded Xerox Business Solutions, XPS. This will enable us to better leverage the successful model for serving SMB customers. XPS is an important part of our overall growth strategy. We believe their best practices will help us grow share of the SMB market and across our business. We will also benefit from synergies across technical services, e-commerce, marketing and IT which will simplify the way we work and improve how we serve our customers.","Given XPS' success in servicing their SMB customers, we recently shifted over 28,000 of our small and midsized government healthcare, education and graphic communication accounts to XPS. This move offers a high touch, locally accessible model to ensure that these customers are aligned to the route to market best equipped to grow our business with them. To provide best-in-class services we have implemented a common global delivery model with the goal of creating a consistent customer experience that will promote customer loyalty and create greater revenue opportunities for Xerox worldwide.","This is all part of the culture of continuous improvement that gives us confidence to accelerate our transformation in 2019 and drive growth in the long-term. We will go into more detail at next week's Investor's Day.","In the fourth quarter we continued to see some positive results from our Workplace Solutions driven by sales of our ConnectKey products where we once again gained equipment revenue market share in the A3 product category increasing 3 points year-over-year. And we remain poised to gain share in A4 by expanding our indirect and digital channels. We've also seen good momentum in the high end with Iridesse. Overall, there is still more opportunity to capture market share across all our core segments and we will address our strategy to do so at next week's Investor Day.","Our value to customer derives not just from our core equipment products, but from the software and services that support our customers work processes which we embed in and build around our products. IDC recently named us the clear leader in document services and we won the Document Imaging Software Line of the Year award from Keypoint Intelligence-Buyers Lab. These awards reflect our leadership position in our broad portfolio of software and services solution to deliver unique and differentiated value to our customers.","An example of this differentiated value is with Purdue University, where we are delivering end-to-end solutions that cover their entire production lifecycle. We are not only managing the entire fleet of devices across their campus, we are also providing production prints and communication marketing services including document design, consultation and optimization services to help them more effectively communicate with prospective students and important function and support of recruiting top students.","Another key focus is to lever industry-specific assets and integrate them with our core technology to create industry solutions. An example here is our recently developed digital insure offering. On boarding new insurance customers is challenging, especially from one-time insurance buy by travel insurance.","Our offering provides personalized and customized real-time cross media communication with that customer to ensure that they get the right offering delivered with an outstanding digital customer experience. The customer can initiate the process in a variety of ways, from a QR code scanning to chat box and will receive communication in whatever format they desire, digital or print.","For the insurer our service offers secure storage of customer interaction including digitally signed contracts from the customer and we make it easy for the insurer to deliver attractive personalized cross media communications with that customer. Expect to see us expand our service offering with many integrated vertical offerings like this that leverage our ability to connect the digital and the physical.","Growing software and services is a key component of our revenue growth strategy. We have created a dedicated business unit focused on driving end-to-end solutions including software and services to increase our portfolio and extend further into our client base. We will share more detail at next week's Investor Day.","Our expertise in technology and printing uniquely positions us to the leverage innovation to move into adjacencies that go beyond core technology requirements. We have prioritized four areas for innovation; disrupting digital packaging and print, AI workflow assistance for knowledge workers, 3D printing, digital manufacturing, and sensors and services for the Internet of Things. We have a long history of disrupting industries through our technology and innovation and these four areas present long term commercial opportunities for us.","Just this past quarter, we were recognized with and IDTechEx Technical Development Materials award for the Printed Methane Sensor we developed at PARC, which can detect methane leaks in oil and gas wells that contributes significantly to global warming, a real world problem for those in the oil and gas industry that we can potentially help address through our sensors technology.","In the critical area of security we recently introduced new software enhancements to our flagship line of AltaLink Multifunction Printers, which allows companies to monitor critical security setting and automatically remediate unauthorized changes without having to reboot the device. It is a proactive step in stemming security breaches and a critical component in maintaining device uptime.","Our leadership position in this area was recently highlighted by IDC as part of our broad range of security services designed to help businesses identify security risk, remediate current vulnerability gap and provide for ongoing management of and adherence to corporate security policies and guidelines.","You are going to hear us talk a lot more about innovation and you'll get a chance to see firsthand how we are unlocking value by integrating innovation with our core assets at our Investor Day next week. We have further heightened our focus on cash with increased executive oversight and more direct accountability across the organization and it has reflected in our results. We had a strong fourth quarter with free cash flow of $398 million and $1.05 billion of free cash flow for the year. We ended the year with $1.1 billion in cash after returning to shareholders 92% of our free cash flow for the year.","Between completing the $300 million balance of our $1 billion share repurchase program that was authorized in 2018 and continuing to pay our quarterly dividends, we expect to return at least 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders in 2019. Also our Board authorized an incremental $1 billion share repurchase program. The flexibility afforded by this additional authorization, our current cash position, and our cash flow expectations for 2019 will allow us to opportunistically use our cash to maximize IRR. We are executing against our strategic initiatives and beginning to see measurable results which positions us well to accelerate our transformation in 2019.","I will now turn it over to Bill to review in more detail our financial results for the quarter.","William Osbourn","Thank you, John. Overall, we were very pleased with how we finished the year driven by strong margin expansion, cash flow above our expectations, and growth in adjusted earnings per share of over 10% year-over-year. In line with our expectations, revenue declined and faced anticipated headwinds. However, we more than offset this impact to deliver our best results of the year.","I will now begin with a review of the income statement. In total, revenue declined 6.1% at constant currency and 7.8% at actual currency, broadly in line with expectations and the directional commentary we gave last quarter. Total revenue was impacted by almost 1 point from the significant OEM declines we've highlighted in recent quarters as well as headwinds from the benefit in the prior year from the launch of the ConnectKey portfolio and higher licensing revenues, a $20 million year-over-year impact. I'll spend more time on the revenue dynamics in the quarter in a moment when I review the revenue slide.","Turning to profitability, adjusted operating margin of 15.1% improved 180 basis points year-over-year as the decline in revenues was more than offset by cost reductions and productivity improvements. The improvement came from a significant 130 basis points improvement in our SAG ratio driven by our project Own It actions as well as a lower annual performance incentive compensation accrual.","RD&E also contributed 20 basis points to year-over-year margin expansion. We captured cost savings and overhead and within mature product sustaining engineering they more than offset increases in spend within our research centers and incubation programs in support of our innovation growth areas.","Gross margin of 40% was lower by 30 basis points year-over-year, a good result considering the prior year included in approximate 100 basis point combined benefit from the higher licensing revenue and the change in the consumables usage estimate. Also contributing to the improvement in margin was higher equity income which increased $18 million year-over-year on an adjusted basis. Drives of the equity income improvement included benefits to Fuji Xerox from their recent cost actions.","Turning to the below the line items, adjusted other experiences net of $32 million was $3 million worse year-over-year driven by higher currency losses. Adjusted tax rate of 27.9% increased 1.8 points year-over-year resulting in a negative approximate $0.02 impact to EPS. Overall, adjusted EPS of $1.14 was up $0.11 from the fourth quarter of 2017.","On a GAAP basis, we had $0.56 of earnings per share which was up $1.34 as the prior year included $400 million charge associated with enactment of the U.S. Tax Act, a partial offset to the Tax Act charge from a year-over-year compare perspective was a $43 million charge we took this quarter associated with early termination of an unfavorable IT services arrangement. The difference between GAAP and adjusted EPS also includes our normal adjustments around restructuring and related costs including those for Fuji Xerox, non-service retirement related costs and amortization of intangible assets.","Moving on to revenue, in Q4 as anticipated, we faced revenue headwinds associated with a challenging compare. As most will recall, the prior year benefited from the full impact of the ConnectKey product rollout. So while the 6.1% constant currency decline was worse in trend it was in line with our expectations.","I will now breakdown in more detail the revenue drivers. Looking first at the geographic sales channels; North America revenues were down 4.9% in constant currency driven by weakness in large enterprise accounts and high-end sales that were partially offset by growth in Xerox Business Solutions, formally GIS, as well as indirect channel equipment sales growth. International revenue declined 3.2% at constant currency.","Within that, Europe's decline rate improved driven by equipment revenue, while developing markets grew total revenue for the tenth quarter in a row on a year-over-year basis. Although equipment revenue was pressured reflecting in part a very challenging compare. Our highest area of decline was in other, driven by the OEM business which as highlighted at almost a 1 point negative impact to total revenue.","Turning now to a closure look at equipment revenue, the equipment revenue declined 7.7% at constant currency with a negative 3 point impact from OEM. As we indicated last quarter, we anticipated a more challenging equipment revenue compare in Q4 given the strength we saw in Q4 2017 when equipment revenue grew 1.5% driven by the ConnectKey launch and a strong year end within the high-end area.","From a product perspective, Entry equipment revenue made up 11% of equipment in Q4 and was up 0.2% in constant currency driven by growth in Europe and U.S. indirect channels. For the full year, Entry grew 2% in constant currency driven by ConnectKey products. This compared to a decline in 2017 of 0.4%. Midrange equipment revenue comprised 66% of equipment revenue and declined 1.2% in constant currency.","Midrange equipment sales have been an area straight [ph] for the past two quarters as reflected in the 3 points of year-over-year equipment revenue share gain we realized in both Q2 and Q3. And for the full year, midrange grew 1.1% at constant currency. This compared to a decline in 2017 of 8.1%. Midrange or A3 is a key leadership segment for Xerox and we are pleased with the relative strength we have seen in this segment during 2018.","Lastly, our results in the high-end were impressive. High-end equipment revenue made up 22% of total equipment revenue and declined 14.7% at constant currency and for the full year was down 10.5% at constant currency. We continue to see strong demand for our new Iridesse press especially in Europe where 48% of installs were either new business or competitive trade-ins, as well as initial good traction from an upgrade announced in October to our Brenva press that included a 50% speed improvement and resulted in our highest quarterly Brenva installs to date.","This growth however, was not enough to offset declines in other portions of the portfolio including our iGen family. We are actively working plans to turnaround the high-end including building on strong momentum in differentiated capabilities of Iridesse and the recently upgraded Brenva as well as making sales coverage investments and leveraging more effectively unique features and products like iGen with its white dry ink.","Turning now to wholesale. Wholesale revenue comprised 75% of total revenue and declined 5.5% at constant currency or down 4.6% excluding the prior year licensing revenue discussed earlier which is largely consistent with a 4.8% September year-to-date constant currency decline. As mentioned before, it will take time to turnaround the wholesale revenue which tends to move in smaller increments as this is less transactional in nature and thus will we are rebuilding our population of devices including through penetrating more underrepresented areas such as SMB and by expanding our client offerings.","To close out our revenue discussion, Managed Document Services comprised 35% of total revenue and declined 1.7% at constant currency, driven by declines of equipment revenue reflecting lower signings in recent periods. Positives include continued growth in partner print services to the SMB market as well as a sequential improvement in the renewal rate at 85% this quarter. This represented the best renewal rate of the past few quarters and above the 2017 average of 84%, so a good result.","Important to note that despite the better renewal rate we had two factors that drove lower signings in the quarter. First, a lower renewal opportunity, even if we had signed 100% of all deals, renewal signings would still have been down 6% year-over-year in the quarter. This reflects in part greater controls we have put in place around not prematurely pushing early renewals.","Second, within the U.S. we saw a handful of deals with decision delays that resulted in them rolling in 2019. Signings overall are becoming less meaningful measure as MDS growth shifts to the indirect channels and as we transition more territories to XPS, formally GIS, where they have different measurement factors.","A week from today, at our Investor Day we will provide details on the revenue initiatives we are deploying in 2019 to improve the top line. However, it is important to note that we have realistic expectations about the path to improvement and our EPS and cash flow guidance in 2019 does not rely on better revenue trends.","Turning now for a closer look at Xerox's profitability performance. Adjusted operating margin of 16.1% increased to 180 basis points year-over-year, while adjusted EPS of $1.14 increased $0.11 year-over-year, both very positive results that point to the progress we are making and beginning to simply our operations and reengineer our cost base.","Looking at the profitability walk year-over-year, within our operations we were able to more than offset the impact of revenue declines as well as a more challenging compare given the prior year included in approximate 100 basis point margin a $0.9 EPS benefit from one-time items associated with a licensing deal and a consumables usage estimate change that I called out earlier. So, significant margin expansion driven by our second half product Own It actions that John covered. The remaining 70 basis points of margin improvement came from the increase in equity income. This resulted in an approximate $0.07 benefit to EPS.","I would like to note, when I go through the 2019 guidance, you will see that we will be changing for 2019 our GAAP addition of adjusted operating margin to no longer include equity income. We believe this change will give a more accurate view of our operations performance and will be more analogous to how others calculate operating margins.","In terms of unique factors impacting adjusted EPS, there were two worth calling out; a year-over-year negative impact of approximately $0.04 coming from a higher adjusted tax rate of 27.9% versus 26.1% in Q4 of 2017 and a slightly higher adjusted other net driven by exchange losses. More than offsetting this was an approximate $0.07 benefit from lower shares driven by the $700 million of share repurchases we did in the second half of 2018, so very positive results of profitability that I will share in a moment give us confidence going into 2019.","Turning now to cash flow. Operating cash flow was a source of $415 million in the quarter and as John shared, that put us at $1.14 billion for the full year of 2018, a growth of $168 million on an adjusted basis year-over-year and above our full year guidance of between $1.00 and $1.1 billion. Likewise, free cash flow of $1.05 billion for the full year of 2018 increased $183 million on an adjusted basis year-over-year and was above our guidance of $900 million to $1 billion.","To note, the adjustments referenced are to give an inaccurate year-over-year compare. The 2017 cash flow was significantly impacted by a number of factors including incremental voluntary pension contributions and the termination of certain accounts receivable sale programs that resulted in negative full year cash flow on a reported basis in 2017. We have a reconciliation in the non-GAAP section of our materials that shows these adjustments.","So strong 2018 cash flow driven by our second half performance. On cash flow, I believe it's best to view performance on a full year basis given timing factors. Key drivers in 2018 were benefits of working capital from inventory improvements that are on absolute basis were more than offset by lower accruals related to headcount reductions, lowering annual performance incentive compensation, and retiree health. Despite this negative $85 million year-over-year accrual impact, working capital still improved and was less to be used by $13 million versus 2017.","Restructuring payments of $170 million which was lower by $50 million from the prior year's $220 million driven by geographic mix of actions as well as changes to our restructuring policy and benefits. Pension contributions of $144 million significantly lower than the prior year when we made incremental voluntary contribution of $500 million. We believe this year's contribution level is more indicative of what we would anticipate in the future. Finance receivables were a source of $166 million, roughly in line with 2017 and reflects lower originations, and the move we have seen over time of sales to channels with lower internal financing penetration. We anticipate finance receivables will continue to be a source of cash flow of approximately $125 million in 2019.","Lastly, CapEx for the year was $90 million, $50 million lower year-over-year reflecting in part a temporary pause in some investments as new management redirects resources to implement its new strategic direction. We do anticipate higher CapEx in 2019 associated with our project Own It implementation as well as revenue initiatives that we will outline in more detail at our Investor Day next week.","If we turn to the next slide, I'll speak to our capital structure. We ended the fourth quarter with $5.2 billion of debt and $1.1 billion of cash on the balance sheet. We break down debt between financing and core by first calculating the financing debt by applying a 7 to 1 leverage to our financing assets, finance receivables and equipment on operating leases, with the remaining debt assumed to be in support of our core business.","In Q4 this calculation resulted in assumed financing debt of $3.4 billion and core debt of $1.8 billion. As the debt later shows we have two maturities in 2019, one in March of approximately $400 million and one in December of approximately $600 million. Our core net debt was $700 million as of yearend and we target to maintain our core leverage at approximately 2 times free cash flow. We are under that level now and thus do not see any immediate requirement to reduce our debt levels. We have access to a number of capital sources as well as ample liquidity to handle upcoming maturities.","Another important element of our capital structure is our pension assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2018 our net unfunded position was $1.2 billion, which compares to $1.4 billion as of the end of 2017 and $2.2 billion as of the end of 2016, and it includes approximately $775 million of unfunded pension liabilities which by design do not get funded. From a funding perspective, we believe we are well positioned to have a stable level of pension contributions over time.","If we move to the next slide, I will review our financial guidance for 2019. As John indicated, we made good progress at the end of 2018 on our strategic initiatives and we are well positioned to drive improvement in our business in 2019. Let me quickly take you through the numbers. For revenue our guidance is a decline of approximately 5% at constant currency with an approximate 1 point of currency headwind. I want to be clear, we are targeting to do better than the 4.9% decline in 2018. However, we have built our guidance on the assumption that 2019 will be in the same range as 2018.","For adjusted operating margin we expect benefits for project Own It will drive 100 to 150 basis points of margin expansion to put us in the range of 12.6% and 13.1% from the 11.6% adjusted operating margin in 2018. As indicated earlier, these figures reflect the new definition of adjusted operating margin we are adopting in 2019, that will exclude equity income to more clearly reflect our operational performance.","For adjusted EPS, we are guiding to be between $3.70 and $3.80 which at the minimum is a growth of 7% year-over-year. On a GAAP basis, we expect EPS of at least $2.60 and $2.70. The difference between GAAP and adjusted EPS includes our normal adjustments around restructuring related costs including those for Fuji Xerox, non-service retirement related costs and amortization of intangibles.","We continue to expect strong free cash flow and are guiding free cash flow to be in the range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion which assumes approximately $150 million of CapEx. From a capital allocation perspective, we remain committed to return at least 50% of our free cash flow back to shareholders. As such, we are planning for approximately $250 million in dividends which assumes no change to our quarterly common dividend of $0.25 per share and for at least $300 million in share repurchases. We also announced today an increase of $1 billion to our repurchase authorization which gives us the flexibility to opportunistically increase our share repurchases.","As we've said before, the time and pace of repurchases will be dictated by an evaluation of relative returns which leaves between $450 million and $550 million of unallocated free cash flow, the use of which we will evaluate opportunistically as we go through 2018 [ph]. We will provide further context around all of these guidance figures during our Investor Day in a week as well as our three-year 2019 to 2021 financial expectations.","I will now hand it back to John for some closing comments before we go into Q&A.","John Visentin","Thanks Bill. To wrap up, we closed the year strong, growing adjusted EPS 10%, expanding adjusted operating margin 180 basis points and delivering over $1.05 billion in free cash flow, 92% of which we returned to shareholders. We've laid a good foundation for 2019 and we look forward to our Investor Day on February 5th where we can share more details on our strategy and longer term financial plans.","We will now open the line for questions. Jennifer?","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks John. Before we get to the Q&A with John and Bill, I will point out that we have posted on our Xerox Investor Relations website a full set of earnings materials, as well as supplemental schedules to provide you with an overview of our fourth quarter earnings. Operator, please open the line for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, ma'am. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from a line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is now open.","Ananda Baruah","Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question and thanks for all the information. I guess a few from me if I could, at least a couple, I'm trying to not to take too long, but could you guys just quickly go through what you saw in the marketplace with regards to impact from macro it sounds like Bill, you hinted there may have been some push outs, and then just would love to get your context now what the competitive marketplace looks like as well, just to start off and then I have some specific \u2013 specific questions? Thanks.","William Osbourn","Thanks Ananda. Just a couple of points, we did point to there were a few large new business signings that were pushed out into Q1. We expect those to still be signed within Q1 from an overall marketplace perspective when thinking about terms the impact of the government shutdown for the 30 plus days has some impact on us obviously from our government accounts. About a third of our government accounts were impacted.","We estimate that the post sale revenues under our management services, consumables, et cetera, was about, would be about $4 million a month on post sales. So it's a number, not a big number, but it would have had some impact. But overall, we gave our guidance and expectations as far as you know going into 2019 our revenues, guidance being down mid single digits are 5% to constant currency. And our other guidance measures are not dependent upon the significant improvement in revenue year-over-year.","Ananda Baruah","And with the deals that got pushed out where those A3 deals, did those include high-end deals as well?","William Osbourn","Both, the ones I was primarily referring to were large managed print services deals that include significant amount of A3s and then, like so we fully expect those to be signed in Q4. I mean Q1, sorry, Q1 2019.","Ananda Baruah","Okay, great I appreciate it. And then I'll just do one follow up here, just could you, I know you're going to talk about this next week, but just to kind of set this up, with Own It could you just kind of give us some context around the order of operations for the various kind of transformation initiatives, how should we expect you guys, I know you're already underway, but like how are you layering into it kind of combination of revenue initiatives and cost initiatives, supply chain, and which will come sort of more towards the front end here and which will be the ones that you'll get to kind of as you go through it later on? Thanks.","John Visentin","Ananda, we'll do - Ananda it\u2019s John. So we'll detail it next week and we'll show you the whole project Own It on all the different areas of how we're redesigning all our different layers, all our different organizations and what you're going to see next week is what the outcome will be, not only for 2019, but also for 2020 and 2021. So you'll get a lot more detail next week at our Investor Day.","Ananda Baruah","Okay, great. I appreciate it, thank you.","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks Ananda. Operator, can we have the next question?","Operator","Our next question will come from the line of Shannon Cross of Cross Research. Your line is now open.","Shannon Cross","Thank you very much. I guess my first question John is, can you talk a bit about your thoughts on cash usage and not necessarily just 2019 and I know we're asking all these questions you're going to address next week, but we have to try. So, when you look at the cash flow, obviously Xerox is a high cash flowing business, it doesn't appear that you need to spend that much in terms of restructuring next year and I think it was like $225 million at least in terms of the EPS bridge. So are you looking to acquisitions, are you looking for a way to sort of reverse the revenue decline inorganically as well as organically? I guess I'm just trying to figure out you can squeeze for so long on the cost side but then how do you sort of right the ship in terms of the top line?","John Visentin","So what I would say Shannon is, what you'll see next week is not just the cost side but also where we will be making investments. And clearly cash is one of our clear focuses and we've already signaled that we will be over a $1 billion in 2019 and you'll see our 2020 and 2021 guidance as well. And look, we're going to use our cash on what gives us the best IRR and we're looking at all different options and next week we're going to detail on our revenue where we will be doing investments and where we see revenue in terms of growth and all that in the next three years.","Shannon Cross","Okay, and then can you talk a bit about the leasing business, I don't know, Bill if you want to take that, but just in terms of your thoughts on leasing how core is, and I know you'd been sort of looking at options around it, and it looks like there's going to be some financial receivable runoff that benefits cash flow this year, so just curious as to keep it solid, expand it, how are you thinking about it?","John Visentin","Yes, so we don't specifically comment on anything regarding strategic alternatives, but the leasing business in particular, we're pleased with. It's a profitable business for us. It's integrated, it's part of our offerings to the customers. Even though we were downgraded below investment grade we're still able to operate the business efficiently and profitably and overall we're very pleased with it.","Shannon Cross","Okay, thank you. Look forward to next week.","John Visentin","Thanks Shannon.","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks Shannon. Operator, next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Jim Suva with Citi. Your line is now open.","Jim Suva","Thanks very much. Thus far on the call in the slide you talked a lot about Project Own It which sounds quite compelling. A lot of focus and maybe it's just my hearing was more on the cost side and then even if it was on the revenue side when we look at the revenues, it looks like there's literally no stabilization from the past two years by your actions. So can you help us understand about why the focus isn't on revenues or any improvement at all on revenues?","John Visentin","Yes, I would say Jim, first and foremost we have a full court press on driving revenue. For our 2019 guidance, we're not relying on revenue to actually guide on the EPS and the cash flow on the other the margins and the other numbers. That said, what you're going to see next week is a detailed strategic plan on revenue and revenue growth and how do we get there and what are the plans we've put in place. Project Own It, what Project Own It allowed us to do is not just simplify our business, but it also allowed us to have the space to reinvest in areas that can help us with driving revenue and growth and we're going to take you through all that in detail next week.","William Osbourn","Yes, I would only add that you know Jim clearly we want to improve the revenue trajectory on a constant currency basis, the last you know '17 and '18 and in our guidance for '19 are you know in the zone of the 4.5% to 5% range. So it's stabilized to that 4.5% to 5% down in constant currency, but it\u2019s clearly we want to change that trajectory going forward.","Jim Suva","Great, thanks so much for the details.","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks Jim. Operator, next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Katy Huberty","Thank you, good morning. If you included the indirect channel what would signings have been in the quarter in terms of rate of decline, and how should we think about the weaker signings in 2018 translating into revenue trend for that business this year? And then I have a follow up.","William Osbourn","Thanks Katy. Yes, so the indirect channel it is actually hard to get accurate data on that, because actually we are dealing with partners, we have some internal measures that we get is that we're not comfortable enough in disclosing that on a regular basis, but that's part of the reason why we look at it is signings a meaningful number going forward to continue disclosing it, primary represents our enterprise business which is the more mature part of the Managed Print Services which has been declining. But from our internal measures, the SMB part which includes a lot of MPS business through indirect channels is growing upwards of low double-digits in recent quarters.","Katy Huberty","Okay, thank you. And then just a couple clarifications on the EPS guide, it looks like you're not assuming a share count reduction in the EPS range. Is that because $300 million of spend just offsets dilution or should we expect that ultimately share count should come down in the year? And just as a followup, same line of questioning, what are you assuming in terms of debt pay down and any interest expense reduction in the EPS guidance if anything?","William Osbourn","Okay, share repurchase a couple things, so we will have the flow through effect of the $700 million of share repurchases done in the second half of \u201818 and the benefit of that flowing through to \u201819. And you are correct that these $300 million that we said we would do as part of our proposed capital allocation for 2109, we did not include that benefit in the adjusted EPS guidance says. The timing of it, the amounts could be lumpy, could be weighted towards the back end, so we did not include that potential benefit in our EPS guidance for 2019.","As far as the debt, we will be refinancing the $1 billion of debt that's coming due during 2019, $400 million in March, another $600 million in December. Our liquidity that we have, whether it's the cash on balance sheet, the $1.8 billion revolver allows us flexibility and timing. As far as interest expense with the downgrade from investment grade, we've estimated that, that probably specifically because we had one debt issuance, they had coupons steps in it and also it causes our undrawn revolver to cost more to be about $5 million or so more on a full year basis of debt cost.","Katy Huberty","That's perfect. Thank you.","Jennifer Horsley","Great thanks Katy. Operator, is there any other questions?","Operator","Ma\u2019am, that was our last question. Oh, I'm sorry, we actually just had Paul Coster from JPMorgan queue up.","Jennifer Horsley","Thank you.","Operator","You're welcome. Paul, your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi this is [indiscernible] on for Coster. Thanks for taking my question. On the midrange you had a tough comp there, but it performed pretty well. What's driving the momentum there? And then on the high-end same thing, but did you see more push outs in that segment relative to others and then are you seeing more competition on the high-end?","William Osbourn","Yes, hey Paul, it\u2019s Bill. So on the midranges we are very pleased with our market share and we've increased by 3 points each of the last couple of quarters and significant market share improvement really since the ConnectKey launch that occurred in the second half of 2017, so we're very pleased there.","On the high-end we are still the market leader, are market leader there in market share and we're very pleased with that, but it's an area that we clearly believe there are parts we could improve upon. We do have some products, enhancements that are going to be announced later in the year that we believe will help and specifically Iridesse has done really well for us, but it just has not been enough to offset other parts of the high-end portfolio.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, and then my follow ups on restructuring charges, looks like they're on track for $200 million again for the fourth consecutive year. So when can we expect the drop off on these kind of recurring charges longer term? Thank you.","William Osbourn","So a couple of comments on restructuring charges. First of all going back to \u201818 it was around $170 million which was a decline from 2017, but the company is looking to in the restructuring charges, we actually given the geographies and the change in our restructuring severance policies et cetera, that we were able to do more for the lower dollar amounts in 2018. There is a fair amount planned efficiencies that we have, coming forward, so we've estimated continued $200 million. We\u2019ll go out to the outer years and we'll talk with that further at Investor Day next week, but $200 million is our best estimate at this point for 2019.","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks, Paul. John, do you have any last comments to close?","John Visentin","Yes. Well, thank you everybody, and look at our Investor Day next week. You'll hear more about our overall strategy, our long term financial outlook, and our plan to stabilize and grow revenue in new and existing markets. You'll also see firsthand some of the innovations that will enable us to expand beyond our core technologies. So I look forward to hosting you at the event next week. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today's conference. This does conclude our program and we may all disconnect.

He is joined by Bill Osbourn, Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com\/investor. At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and\/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without the express permission of Xerox. After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which, by their nature, address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein.","At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Visentin. Mr. Visentin, you may begin.","John Visentin","Good morning, and thank you for joining our Q2 2019 earnings call. This quarter, we delivered improvements in earnings per share, adjusted operating margin and free cash flow, largely underpinned by our enterprise-wide transformation initiative Project Own It. These results have enabled us to increase planned investments for the second half of the year to advance our revenue roadmap. We expect to see returns from these investments over the near-term. But in light of the performance in the first half, we believe it is more prudent to adjust our full year revenue guidance down to approximately 6% at constant currency, while maintaining all of our other full year guidance measures.","Adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 12.7%, up 170 basis points year-over-year. Margin expansion contributed to adjusted EPS of $0.99 in the quarter, up $0.19 or approximately 24% year-over-year. We are pleased with our cash performance. We generated $313 million of operating cash flow in the quarter, an increase of $78 million from a year ago. Free cash flow in the quarter was $297 million, up $94 million year-over-year. While we continued to see improvements in these three key areas, revenue for the quarter was down 7.2% at constant currency year-over-year. Results were due to weaker economic conditions in Western Europe and certain developing markets and continued operational impacts in the United States, we identified last quarter, albeit improving as the quarter went on.","Our strong margin expansion year to date has allowed us to increase the level of investments we plan for the year from approximately $0.32 of EPS to approximately $0.40 cents of EPS. These increased investments will primarily be in support in of revenue generating initiatives. With anticipated annual growth savings of at least $640 million, Project Own It is offsetting some of the impact of revenue declines. This initiative is helping us to simplify our business, drive a culture of continuous improvement and free up capital to reinvest in the business.","Planning has begun for 2020 programs that we'll continue this focus. We are on schedule with transitioning our shared services operations to a managed service provider, which will reduce costs and make it easier to do business with Xerox. With a large scale transformation like this, we anticipated there would be some impact on operations, but we remain focused on responding to and mitigating risks associated with this transition.","We are on track to stand up our automation center of excellence to leverage robots to streamline repetitive tasks such as responding to breakfasts requests via the call center. Today we have 150 bots and have plans to add more by year end. One other key components of Project Own It is rationalizing our supply chain. Our supply chain operations have become more efficient and inventory levels have improved, but there's more work we can do here.","We are making several upfront investments to grow our market and wallet share in large accounts and within the small to midsize business market. We see a significant opportunity for IT services within the SMB space. Today, three of our Xerox Business Solutions cores offer IT services to clients such as the 10th largest school district in the United States. With the competition fragmented and often regional XBS is well positioned to capitalize on this growing market.","We are wrapping up our operations and capabilities to expand IT services to about a third of our XBS cores by the end of the year and we will roll it out to the rest of the cores and Europe in 2020. This month we started working with American Express to market to their small business card members through the AmEx Offers program and other channels to further increase our penetration of the SMB market. This multi-month multi-channel digital program focuses on increasing business owners awareness of DocuShare, XMPie, ConnectKey apps and workplace multi-function printers.","In June we announced a multi-part agreement with HP, which opens up additional revenue opportunities and new routes to market. Starting in 2020 HP will make DocuShare Flex, Xerox's cloud-based content management platform available on PCs and tablets sold to SMB in the United States. Another component of this agreement will allow us to source toner, which will add volume to our toner plants. Growing our software and services business is key to reversing our revenue trajectory for the long-term. And we are gaining traction with several new clients such as Morgan Stanley and Motorola with additional major deals in the pipeline.","With Morgan Stanley, we offer the bank a unique value proposition to help drive their digital transformation with intelligent workplace services, which advances traditional managed print services with the suite of tools including analytic, digitization and ConnectKey technologies that boost efficiency, security and productivity. As the only OEM provider with fed ramp authorization, Xerox continues to lead the industry and security. This differentiator is a driver of new opportunities, particularly with public clients like the County of San Diego and Commonwealth of Massachusetts.","This momentum with the public sectors carrying over into the third quarter with large contract renewals, which client such as the State of Texas already secured. This quarter we announced several new products that increase our ability to capture incremental volume and expand our presence in the emerging markets. We launched an embellishment kit for our high A3 products in EMEA.","What is unique about this technology is we can turn a standard office printer into a device that can print materials with metallics similar to the more advanced Iridesse. It allows us to offer this technology at an aggressive price point. We have a big install base, which allowed us to upsell our clients and drive incremental volume. This add-on kit allows them to charge a significant premium over traditional print. We will continue to leverage our first mover advantage on other surrounding products in the coming quarters.","Last week we introduced a new suite of black and white multi-function printers, which features similar to our high end office devices. These products enhance small office mobility without compromising image quality, security or the user experience. We continue to lead in market share in the high end production category. The momentum we built with the Iridesse Production Press and Brenva HD Production Inkjet Press carried through from the first quarter, enabling us to remain nearly flat for the quarter.","Cut-sheet Production Inkjet remains an attractive category for us. At the end of June we announced our newest inkjet press, the Baltoro HF, which replaces the Brenva. We engineered and manufactured this press from end to end. Our Baltoro, we believe, leapfrogs the competition. It is half the size, uses half the power consumption and significantly reduces client's total cost of ownership. It also is the first press in its class to leverage automated intelligence and deliver true HD image quality.","We remain focused on our innovations for the future, which includes 3D printing and digital manufacturing, digital packaging and print, sensor and services for the IoT and AI workflow systems. Some of our innovations such as IoT sensors have moved into demonstration phase. We started working with Con Edison to pilot using our fiber optic sensors on transformers in Queens, New York. These sensors allow companies to monitor assets and determine maintenance needs, reducing the need for costly physical site inspections.","We are testing similar technology on bridges with VicTrack, the owner of the Victorian government\u2019s rail transport land in Australia. With infrastructure deteriorating across significant regions of the world, we are looking at ways to scale this technology and use it on critical assets. We are now working to identify and prioritize high value target application with the broader strategy and building our focus business cases to define the areas where we will target IoT sensors that deliver a transformative data insight.","Our heightened focus on cash is driving results. Free cash flow in the second quarter was $297 million, up $94 million year-over-year. Our June year to date free cash flow was $508 million, an increase of $107 million from the prior year. We repurchased $197 million of our shares in the quarter and distributed $60 million in dividends. Year to date, we have repurchased $300 million of our shares consistent with our plan for the first half. We expect the repurchase at least $600 million of our shares for the full year with the remaining share repurchases to be weighted towards the end of the year.","Over the last year, we have strengthened our balance sheet, which enabled us to look at additional M&A opportunities. While we don't comment publicly about potential targets, we have a broad M&A pipeline that is designed to support our strategic initiative. That pipeline includes, tuck-in acquisition to help us penetrate further into the growing SMB market like the two multi-brand dealer acquisitions we announced last month. We also are continuing to evaluate strategic alternatives for our leasing business. We said all along that this is a good and an important part of our business and there may be no change. However, we are evaluating options to make even better use of our balance sheet. We are taking our time to get this right for us, for the business and for our clients.","Now I'd like to hand it over to Bill to cover our financial results in detail.","Bill Osbourn","Thanks, John. Looking at our financial results. We continue to see improvements in adjusted operating margin, free cash flow and earnings per share. Margin improvement reflects the progress from Project Own It initiatives that are now mature programs delivering the results we expected. Combining adjusted operating margin improvement with benefits from higher equity income and lower shares resulted in strong adjusted earnings per share expansion of 24% year-over-year year. While revenue for the quarter was below expectations, as John discussed, given our first half results we are adding to planned investments this year from the initial plan $0.32 in EPS to approximately $0.40. The majority of these additional investments are targeted to improve our revenue trajectory for the balance of 2019 and beyond.","Importantly, we are maintaining our full year adjusted EPS guidance of $3.80 to $3.95 and annual free cash flow of $1 billion to $1.1 billion, although we now expect full year revenue to be down in the range of approximately 6% at constant currency. Let me emphasize that we remain focused and committed to transforming the business and are making investments for the long-term, while sustaining a profitable business in the near-term.","I will now review the income statement in more detail. Total revenue declined 7.2% at constant currency and 8.8% at actual currency. The constant currency decline was in line with what we experienced in the prior quarter but as mentioned was below our expectations. We saw areas that performed well, such as high end color systems fueled by continued demand for our Iridesse Production Press and areas where our new revenue initiatives are starting to gain traction, such as in our software and services business and our win rate for new business signings improved in the quarter.","However, we did see continued impact from the ongoing organizational changes as a part of Project Own It transformation actions, which we discussed the last quarter, as well as some weakness in EMEA and certain developing markets. I'll discuss revenue in more detail in a moment.","Turning to profitability, adjusted operating margin of 12.7% improved 170 basis points year-over-year, and drove $14 million in adjusted operating profit growth as the decline in revenue was more than offset by benefits from Project Own It and other investments as well as higher prior year one-time costs associated with the termination of an IT project and the accelerated depreciation associated with the exit of a surplus real estate facility.","Gross margin of 39.2%, declined 70 basis points year-over-year with approximately half of the decline attributed transaction currency and the remainder due to lower midrange equipment sales as well as targeted price actions on certain large multi-year contracts, where initial years are less profitable. These impacts were partially offset by costs productivity. Project Own It drove 130 of the 220 basis points improvement in SG&A year-over-year, while the aforementioned prior year one-time costs contributed to 90 basis points of improvement.","RD&E was 3.8% of revenue, which was 20 basis points lower year-over-year. The decline was partially due to timing of projects that are expected to ramp later this year. Below operating profit, equity income of $34 million increased $15 million year-over-year, primarily reflecting benefits to Fuji Xerox from restructuring actions.","Other expenses net of $38 million is $1 million better than the prior year, primarily as a result of $15 million of a lower pension expense in 2019 in our retiree health plans, which was offset by the impact of $16 million gain on an asset sale in the prior year. The lower pension expense was excluded from adjusted EPS performance and the prior year asset sale gain was included in adjusted EPS.","Overall, adjusted EPS of $0.99 was up $0.19 from the second quarter of 2018 due to improved operations, share buybacks, higher equity income, and a lower tax rate. GAAP EPS of $0.77 was $0.35 or 83% higher compared to the second quarter of 2018, reflecting the higher adjusted EPS as well as lower transaction related costs in 2019.","We adjust GAAP EPS for restructuring and related costs including restructuring related to Fuji Xerox, amortization of intangible assets, transaction costs and related costs associated with the terminated Fuji transaction, non-service retirement-related costs, and the tax on these adjustments. In Q2, we reported $37 million of restructuring and related costs, bringing the first half total to $149 million and we continue to expect approximately $225 million of restructuring charges for the full year.","Moving now to Slide 7, which is our cash flow. Last quarter, I told you that we got off to a good start in cash and I\u2019m again very pleased with our strong cash performance this quarter. We generated $313 million of operating cash in the quarter, which is up $78 million year-over-year and free cash flow was $297 million, up $94 million.","Key cash flow drivers in Q2 included, a lower use of cash from accrued compensation, a $11 million in Q2 2019 versus $69 million in Q2 2018, as we moved the timing of our payment of the 2018 annual bonuses into Q1 this year, whereas this was Q2 event last year, and $18 million source of cash from working capital reflecting lower use of cash in inventories which more than offset the decrease in cash flow from accounts receivable. Lower inventories reflect lower sales volumes and improved inventory management and the decreasing cash from accounts receivable is due to timing of collections.","Contributions to defined pension plans of $36 million was nearly flat year-over-year and we had a higher use of cash for restructuring and related payments including $48 million of restructuring-related payments reported in other current and long term liabilities, which were primarily related to severance payments associated with the shared services arrangement recently entered into with HCL.","Restructuring and related payments were $70 million in the quarter, or $32 million higher year-over-year. We continue to expect approximately $200 million of restructuring and related payments in the full year. Through the first half of 2019, we generated $539 million of operating cash flow and $508 million of free cash flow.","CapEx of $31 million through June is lower than initially anticipated and is likely to be less in the $150 million originally guided for the full year. Accordingly, we are likely to be in the higher end of our free cash flow range of $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion full year. Lastly, within financing cash flows, we returned $257 million to shareholders in the second quarter, consisting of $60 million in dividends and $197 million in share repurchases.","Through the first half, we returned $423 million to shareholders, including $300 million of share repurchases and expect the repurchase a total of at least $600 million of shares in 2019. Important to note that we expect the incremental $300 million of share repurchases to be weighted towards the end of the year in line with our free cash flow generation. We ended the quarter with $776 million of cash, which reflects the use of cash in Q1 to repay approximately $400 million in bonds.","Let\u2019s turn now to Slide 8, and I\u2019ll review the second quarter revenue dynamics in more detail. Second quarter revenue declined 8.8% or 7.2% in constant currency and included a negative 0.6 point impact from the OEM business. Results reflect continue to impact from the operational changes as well as weaker macroeconomic conditions in Europe in certain developing markets.","Looking at details this quarter. I\u2019ll start with equipment, which was down 10.2% or 9% in constant currency. The decline was driven by lower sales of our entry and mid-range products, which are the product categories most impacted by the organizational changes particularly in our XBS organization. As we discussed last quarter, we took actions in late 2018 and in Q1 2019 to make the organization more agile and better fit to serve the SMB market, both our current customers and the market opportunity to expand at SMB.","While the actions continued to negatively impact Q2 revenue, we are seeing some stabilization in the operations evidenced by improvement in the rate of revenue decline in the latter part of the quarter. In addition, weaker economic conditions in EMEA and certain developing markets impacted sales in mid-range devices in those regions, where we experienced delays in large deal closings.","In the high-end, we saw continued demand for our Iridesse production press and higher installs of our Brenva Inkjet cut-sheet system. We very recently announced a new system for the Inkjet cut-sheet space, the Baltoro HF Inkjet Press. That has already been well received and we expect it to be a tailwind as we move through the second half of this year. The growth in these areas partially offset the declines in black-and-white installs, which is consistent with market trends as well as the pressure on iGen.","Wholesale revenue declined 6.6% in constant currency, which was a slight improvement over the rate of declining Q1. Within post sale, we saw the contractual component declining on trend and similar to the rate of the decline in Q1, reflecting the impact of lower page volumes, prior quarters equipment sales declines and higher mix of lower usage products.","We also saw transactional supplies revenues declining at a rate similar to last quarter by higher than the trend the prior year. The declines were mostly in our developing market regions and in our indirect channels in the U.S., and reflect the lower page volume trends as well as the timing of sales within our two-tier distribution channel.","Services revenue which is included as a part of both equipment sale and post sale revenue streams declined 4.1% in constant currency and is impacted by the factors mentioned above. We expect improvement in services as we continue to invest in coverage and new offerings. To wrap up on revenue, it is important to understand why the second half performance will improve.","As I mentioned earlier, the rate of decline improved in the latter part of the quarter and we expect this trend to continue as we make progress toward fully stabilizing the business following the implementation of important strategic initiatives to transform the company for the long term. Also within EMEA, we expect certain deals that were delayed in Q2 will be finalized within the second half of this year. And high-end production, we have continued demand for our Iridesse production press and just launched a new press, the Baltoro HF.","We also expect OEM will be less of a drag for the second half of the year at around 0.5 point. Importantly, we are making investments in future revenue. John reviewed several of the investment areas and highlighted partnerships, new products and programs that underpin the path to improve our revenue in the second half and beyond.","Turning to Slide 9 as mentioned earlier, adjusted operating margin of 12.7% increased 170 basis points year-over-year, while adjusted EPS of $0.99 increase $0.19 or 24% year-over-year, another strong quarter. This positive trend reflects the progress of Project Own It programs which are on track to deliver $640 million of savings in 2019, and to deliver our guidance of a 100 to 150 basis points improvement in adjusted operating margin for the full year. And planning has already begun for 2020 programs, so we\u2019ll continue the focus on delivering growth.","For the quarter, our operating results coupled with the growth in equity income and lower shares, drove our strong earnings. We do not expect equity income will be as favorable year-over-year in the second half compared to the first half due to accounting adjustment charges at Fuji Xerox in Q1 2018. We are pleased with the trend in profitability and earnings, which we expect will continue as we see continued flow through for Project Own It and benefits from the investments we are making on the top line.","Last, I review our capital structure. We ended the second quarter with $4.8 billion of debt, which is down approximately $400 million compared to the year end as we repaid a March bond maturity with cash, and we had $712 million of cash on the balance sheet at quarter end. We breakdown debt between financing and core by first calculating the financing debt by applying a 7:1 leverage to our financing assets, financing receivables and equipment on operating leases, with the remaining debt assumed to be in support of our core business.","In Q2, this calculation resulted in assumed financing debt of $3.3 billion in core debt of $1.5 billion. Our core net debt was approximately $700 million as of the end of Q2, which was consistent with our 2018 ending core net debt. Our core leverage at the end of the quarter was less than two times annual free cash flow and thus, we do not see any immediate requirement to reduce our core net debt levels.","As the debt ladder reflects, we have a December bond maturity of approximately $600 million. We have access to capital sources as well as sufficient liquidity to handle upcoming debt maturities. Another important element of our capital structure is our pension assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2018, our net unfunded position was $1.2 billion which compared to $1.4 billion as of the end of 2017 and $2.2 billion as of the end of 2016. And it includes approximately $775 million of unfunded pension liabilities, which by design do not get funded.","From a funding perspective, we continue to expect contributions of approximately $140 million in 2019 and believe we are well positioned to have a stable level of pension contributions over time. Last, I just want to briefly talk to our leasing business, this is a good business. Xerox has financed customers for decades, but as a part of our transformational programs we are evaluating every part of the business to ensure we are maximizing value for our shareholders.","At this time we are still evaluating options for our customer leasing business and it is premature for us to provide any specifics or speculate on how it will impact our balance sheet. We remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet, which is important to our business.","I will now hand it back to John to summarize before we move to Q&A.","John Visentin","Thanks, Bill. In summary, we see strong sign in our long term strategy is gaining traction and that the hard work of many people across our company, it\u2019s paying off. Xerox is getting stronger and more focused on developing and delivering the technology that businesses large and small, will need for years to come. ","We will now open the line for questions. Ann?","Ann Pettrone","Thanks, John. Before we get to the Q&A with John and Bill, I will point out that we have in the appendix to our materials additional supplemental reconciliations, and posted on our Xerox Investor Relations website a full set of earnings materials.","Operator, please open the line for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from the line of Shannon Cross of Cross Research. Your line is now open.","Shannon Cross","Thank you very much. So I guess I just want to understand a bit more about what\u2019s going on in the top line. What you saw toward the end of the quarter? How quickly you think some of the incremental investments you\u2019re making will start to run through the model? I guess because at some point, obviously, you can\u2019t sort of offset the top line declines with all the cost cuts. So when we look out a year or two, do you still feel comfortable with what you laid out at the Analyst Day? I don\u2019t know, John, if you can just sort of talk to your thoughts sort of top line?","John Visentin","Yes. Hi, Shannon, we\u2019re still focused on the trajectory that we laid out in February. And if you think on the revenue side, we\u2019re doing a lot of things, whether it\u2019s expansion in channels. I talked about what we\u2019re doing with American Express, even with HP, both on the DocuShare side, some of the large accounts we\u2019ve done. We\u2019re building more e-commerce capabilities. We\u2019re hiring software sales specialists, some of it\u2019s tactical. We\u2019re expanding on our IT as servicing \u2013 services. And these investments, while we\u2019re reporting them in the place now, some of these will take time, like we had discussed back in February, but it will provide top line benefits near the end of 2019, but also we\u2019re expecting the returns to come in 2020 and 2021 on these.","Bill Osbourn","Yes. Just to add on, Shannon, the investments John mentioned, we will see, and certain of those, some impact in the second half, but a lot more in 2020 and beyond. But some other things, specifically related to the second half, we brought it up on the call, I can\u2019t emphasize enough, the rate of improvement we saw later in the quarter, particularly at XBS and the rate of decline and the lessening of the impact of just all the transition that we\u2019ve gone through in the company in connection with Project Own It.","So that is key, and we saw that improvement coming later in the quarter, particularly in June, and we expect that to continue. That gives us confidence in improvement in the second half. There were some certain large deals that were delayed in EMEA that we expect to close in the second half to have a favorable impact, and we\u2019re expecting continued strong demand for Iridesse and the just launched Baltoro to help.","And then finally, the OEM business, I know we\u2019ve talked about it for a lot of quarters, but it is lessening the impact and the first quarter \u2013 first half was about 0.8%, and we expect that to be closer to about 0.5 point. So there are various things that give us the confidence in the improvement in the second of revenue trajectory and it\u2019s well ahead \u2013 the investments we\u2019re making in the revenues area is starting to have some impact in the second half.","Shannon Cross","Okay. So all of that is \u2013 you started to see as the quarter has \u2013 your \u2013 it\u2019s July 30, so through the first month of the quarter, you\u2019re feeling comfortable?","Bill Osbourn","Yes.","Shannon Cross","Okay. And then just curious, John, you had mentioned in the talk, I think, initially on leasing to make better use of the balance sheet. So I am curious as to what you mean by that? I understand you\u2019re not going to talk a lot about the leasing business because you\u2019re still analyzing what to do there, but what kind of views are you thinking about? And obviously, acquisition \u2013 sorry, share repurchase and dividends have been a big focus. How are you thinking going forward? Thank you.","John Visentin","Yes. So Shannon, we\u2019re not going to comment publicly on it. But what I would say is, we\u2019re focused also on M&A pipeline that\u2019s going to support our strategic initiatives. And we\u2019ve done a few tuck-ins. We\u2019ve also done the acquisition of Vader on a 3D metal print. And in each case, we\u2019re just going to take a disciplined approach that will drive the highest IRR. That said, again, we\u2019re not going to comment on x-ray, and we\u2019re not \u2013 we cannot provide details on what that would look like because we haven\u2019t set a deadline for making a final determination. It\u2019s an important decision, and we\u2019re taking a methodological approach that\u2019s focused on doing the appropriate amount of due diligence on it, so and you know\u2026","Bill Osbourn","And just to reiterate, I mean, it is premature, there may or may not be a leasing transaction. Use of proceeds was the key question. If there were to be one, that would be addressed appropriately. But we are committed, as we said in our prepared remarks, to maintaining a strong balance sheet for the company. It\u2019s important for us and our growth plans from a top line perspective.","Shannon Cross","Great. Thank you very much.","Ann Pettrone","Thanks, Shannon.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Matt Cabral","Thank you. Just on the partnership you announced with HP in the quarter, wondering if you could talk a little bit more about how the agreement came to be? Just what you see is the biggest benefit? And just how we should think about the ramp of the relationship from here?","John Visentin","Yes, I would \u2013 look, this is a multifaceted arrangement and it\u2019s really going to \u2013 and it helps us unlock growth opportunities. So if you think of what we\u2019re doing, we\u2019re diversifying our supply chain. We\u2019ll source the A4 and the entry three products from HP. We\u2019re adding volume to our toner operations, which we have. We\u2019re broadening our IT portfolio because we\u2019ll become a desk specialist in HP\u2019s Partner First program and we\u2019re expanding our software presence where they will make DocuShare Flex, our cloud enable contact, available for all their SMB PCs. So we\u2019re looking at this as a new channel of opportunity for revenue, while diversifying our supply chain. I wouldn\u2019t read in \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t read more than that into it. It\u2019s really just - it\u2019s a partnership that made sense for us and made sense for HP.","Matt Cabral","Got it. And then on free cash flow, so you\u2019re up about $100 million through the first half of the year versus last year. I think even at the high end, though, you\u2019re still guiding for less than that on a full year basis. Just wondering if you could help us think through the cadence of cash flow in the second half? And just why we shouldn\u2019t expect the pace of year-over-year improvement to continue?","Bill Osbourn","Yes, Matt, it\u2019s Bill. So as you\u2019re well aware that our strongest cash flow quarter of the year is the fourth quarter, so we are expecting the strongest cash flow in that quarter. With that said, when you\u2019re comparing, we\u2019re similar in line to last year in cash flows that we guided to, the $1 billion to $1.1 billion this year similar to the approximate $1.1 billion last year. The second half of last year did have some unusual cash flows that came back in related to the Fuji Xerox transaction.","So you don\u2019t have \u2013 it makes it a little bit tougher compare year-over-year. But we\u2019re also \u2013 it goes back to the investments we\u2019re talking about making in the company. And we want to do it right, but those investments not only cause an EPS hit, that we talked about, the $0.32 being up to approximately $0.40, but it also \u2013 there\u2019s cash associated with those investments. And overall, as we said, we\u2019re comfortable with reiterating our guidance and given the CapEx rate of spend being towards the higher end of the range.","Matt Cabral","Thank you.","Ann Pettrone","Thanks, Matt.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is now open.","Ananda Baruah","Hi, good morning, guys. I appreciate all the detail of transactions, that\u2019s really, really helpful. So I appreciate that. A few, if I could, just starting out with just kind of the EPS. I just want to understand \u2013 make sure that I understand the mechanics. So the $0.08 of incremental investment in the sales initiative, is this straightforward of saying that $0.08 that comes out of whatever EPS would have been? And so is that\u2019s the right way to think about it? And then I have a couple questions on just how to think about the second half of the year as well. Typically, historically, let\u2019s say, September quarter has been a little bit softer from an EPS perspective. But the last couple years, you\u2019ve actually seen \u2013 seeing relative to Jerry, the last couple of years, though, we\u2019ve actually seen improvement Q-over-Q in EPS. So how would you like us to think about September this year, meaning this quarter, number one, in light of sort of the dynamics the last couple years, and then also in light of the $0.08 that you\u2019re incrementally spending? And I have a couple of follow-ups. Thanks.","Bill Osbourn","Yes. Ananda, it\u2019s Bill. So, yes, we are very pleased with clearly the Q2 and the year-to-date adjusted EPS performance, especially on a year-over-year basis. With that said, we\u2019re holding our guidance at $3.80 to $3.95 in spite of \u2013 we don\u2019t give specific quarterly guidance on adjusted EPS. There is consensus numbers out there and this compares favorably to that. But the thing is and that is the reason why we haven\u2019t upped the full year guidances, specifically for what you mentioned, to a certain extent that we do plan on reinvesting some of these savings that we\u2019ve been able to achieve from Project Own It and the overachievement in EPS in the first half. We plan on investing those smartly, we\u2019ll do it in a smart way in various revenue-generating investments in the second half. And Q3, Q4, typically, Q4 is the strongest quarter of the year, as you\u2019re familiar with, though we don\u2019t really give quarter to quarter EPS guidance, but full year, we\u2019re still very comfortable with our range of $3.80 to $3.95.","Ananda Baruah","And I just wouldn\u2019t want people to \u2013 I mean, to be honest with you, I\u2019ll have to take this offline with you and myself, but I feel like right now we could all be \u2013 September quarter, there could be like a $0.10 range that people could set at $0.05 down from the $0.99 to $0.05 up and I just wouldn\u2019t want incentives. Whatever \u2013 I mean, I think, whatever it should be, we\u2019d like to get some visibility to it, like see it. Intellectually, people could set it anywhere in that range, I think, similarly\u2026","John Visentin","Well, I mean, other factors, we mentioned, people can go through and calculate what the impact of the share repurchases are on our EPS. Therefore, we said the incremental share repurchase, the $300 million, will be weighted towards the latter part of the year. So it won\u2019t have much of an impact on this year nor Q3. And you\u2019ll start also lapping the share repurchases that started in the second half of last year.","Ananda Baruah","Okay. And let me just ask a quick follow-up here, on your leasing business context. Guys, to what extent are you also taking into consideration what the impact to \u2013 of simplifying the story is? And so what the multiple to the stock could be, if you were to do something? I\u2019d just love to get your view on that. And then to the extent you are considering those types of things, how are you going about actually sort of gathering the information, which you use to sort of \u2013 in these considerations? And that\u2019s it for me. Thanks.","John Visentin","Yes, I think we said, we\u2019re considering optionality with the leasing business. There\u2019s nothing definitive. But there are a couple of factors at least. One is simplifying our business. As this is a core area, we need to be and operate and it has been a good area. And we may still continue staying in this business, but this is something that we have to have as a document technology company. Clearly, many of our peers do not do this in-house, so that\u2019s something we\u2019ll have it.","The other thing you bring up is that we do believe that the debt associated with this is often from an investment thesis perspective will get screened out because of that debt related to the leasing business and that is a consideration and whether we would do a leasing transaction or not.","Ananda Baruah","Got it. Okay. Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Ann Pettrone","Thanks, Ananda.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Jim Suva","Thank you very much, John and Bill. The question I had was regarding the incremental investment that you\u2019re doing. It sounds like it\u2019s going into your sales force, your sales channel, your go-to-market strategy, something like that. Can you help us understand like maybe some specifics on where this incremental investment is going? Because you had a very good grasp on the earnings and the cost synergies and reducing costs, but the story of Xerox being revenue-challenged has been a persistent theme under several managements\u2019 tenure. So can you help us understand what specifically some of these actions are, so we can have a little more confidence and conviction of your ability to improve the sales trajectory? Thank you.","John Visentin","Yes, so Jim \u2013 good morning, Jim. I would say that, first of all, it\u2019s the investments we\u2019re making in different aspects. So if you think what we announced, whether it\u2019s with American Express or HP, our focus on channels, our focus on new types of channels to get to our clients, those are all investments we\u2019re making now that will bring benefit in the future. And some of these that we\u2019re talking about, we\u2019re not expecting a lot of revenue in 2019, but helps us with the growth. So it\u2019s really part of our driving revenue that we talked about even back in February.","You know we\u2019re improving in our core technology business; our offerings, you\u2019ve heard some of them that we just came out with and more to come; our direct sales coverage, yes, we\u2019re adding specialists not only in the sales force, but we\u2019re also adding specialists that can help us continue to grow in some of our areas and software and services. We talked about our channels. SMB is a big play for us not only in the U.S., but also in Europe and in other areas. We\u2019re looking at a innovation in new business in M&A and the innovation pipeline, we\u2019re starting to move the innovation pipeline that we\u2019ve talked about and we give an example of one of the first ones we\u2019re looking at, which is the sensor electronics and we\u2019re seeing how and what are the business cases to possibly get this to commercialized now that we\u2019ve had it implemented in a few pilot clients, if you\u2019d like or in few of our clients, and how do we go about bringing that in.","All of that takes now investments to assure that in the future we can go get the revenue trajectory. That said, that said, that\u2019s why we\u2019re confident in keeping \u2013 maintaining our guidance, but at the same time, we thought it\u2019d just be prudent to bring revenue guidance down. It\u2019s not easy, it\u2019s not short term, it\u2019s not going to happen in a quarter, but we want to see improvements in all these areas as we move forward.","Bill Osbourn","Yes. Just to point in a little bit more detail. I mean some of the investments, I mean we are hiring individuals and the software sales area specialists to help us grow our software sales revenue. Our \u2013 expanding our IT services offerings, we had a few cores within our XBS operations that we\u2019re already selling this. We\u2019re going to be expanding it over the second half of the year to over a third of our \u2013 or approximately a third of our XBS operations. There\u2019s costs in getting people trained and hiring people on to offer those services.","So there are real costs being incurred as we ramp up. And the other area \u2013 another area specifically that we\u2019ve actually built up in the first half and pay folks on is the transactional supplies area. We have a transactional supplies focusing on getting better attached rate \u2013 attachment rates on bundled contracts and we\u2019ve invested in personnel in that area also.","Jim Suva","Great. Thanks so much for the detail. That\u2019s greatly appreciated.","Ann Pettrone","Great. Thanks, Jim.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Paul Chung","Hi. Thanks. This is Paul Chung, on for Coster. Thanks for taking our question. So first just on mid-range declines. Can you give us a sense of what you think demand in sales would have been kind of excluding some of the impacts from some of the sales transition and order changes? I know you had a tough comp there, but how should market share held up and just your sense of overall industry health there in the mid-range would be helpful.","Bill Osbourn","Hey, Paul, it\u2019s Bill. The largest impact on mid-range really came from, we talked about, the XBS area year-over-year and they did have a strong Q2 last year, so it was a tough compare. With that said, it\u2019s hard to say what would have been exactly without versus the installs being down 12%. But certainly I think without any impact, we would have expected it to be more in the mid-single digits, down and worse, but we clearly saw improvement in XBS in June. We expect that to continue and they are one of the key drivers in mid-range. You also have some of the deals over in Europe that were delayed that we expect to close into the second half that will also help improve the mid-range area.","Paul Chung","Got you. And then just a follow-up on the post sales revenue kind of given your equipment sales declines kind of accelerated in the first half. Just obviously impacting your overall installed base, but what are the leverage you can kind of pull to stem some of the pressure on post sales? And then any update on some of those growth initiatives you presented at Analyst Day, anything becoming more material. Thank you.","Bill Osbourn","Yes. From a post sale perspective and the causals of what happened in the second quarter, I think, of it really in two parts. First of all, there is a transactional part of post sales supply \u2013 the unbundled supplies, paper, some of the IT services sales. And we did see weaker revenues in the transactional side, particularly the indirect sales channels in the U.S. and EMEA and in certain of developing markets where we saw a slowdown due to economic uncertainties.","In the contractual side, the service rental, other outsourcing, a lot of it was dependent on page volume, clicks, et cetera, we saw a similar rate of decline to Q1, which was above the 2018 pace, but it still was similar to Q1. And there are several factors, which we\u2019ve discussed in the past, that contributed to this, whether it\u2019s slower machines and field, higher mix of lower usage products, lower enterprise signings in recent quarters. And we\u2019re attacking this specifically as a part of our strategy, but we know that this area isn\u2019t something that turns around quickly, but it is an area that we\u2019re attacking.","And specifically when you\u2019re looking at post sale, and we believe it can do better in the second half than the first half. I talked about earlier the investments we made in the supplies area. We have a specific group that\u2019s looking \u2013 that is working to get higher attach rates on the unbundled contracts and there are certain things in the post sale, there is IT services, contracts that we can look to that are happening in Q3 and into Q4 that give us confidence in improvement in the rate of decline in the second half versus the first half.","Ann Pettrone","I think we have time for one last question.","Operator","Yes, ma\u2019am. Our last question will come from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Katy Huberty","Yes. Thank you. What did you bake into the second half outlook as it relates to the weakening macro data points? It sounds like there were some sale cycle delays in 2Q that clearly could continue into the back half, so that you are able to close the deals that delayed, there could be continued delays in 3Q and 4Q. So just wondering does your outlook bake that in or do you need a stable macro demand environment to hit that second half outlook?","Bill Osbourn","Yes, Katy, it\u2019s Bill, I\u2019d say there\u2019s two main things, one thing and probably the largest thing that gives us the confidence that the second half is the trend at XBS that we saw in the latter part of Q2 and just what XBS has been able to achieve historically. We know the changes that we made from Project Own It respective are good for the company for the long term, but still adjusting to those changes in the short term had some impact and we\u2019re confident that XBS can get back to levels of recent quarters prior to the first two quarters of this year.","As far as the delay deals, there is some \u2013 we are expecting some of those to close in the second half, it will have some favorable impact, I would say the bigger impact is really coming from the better responsiveness to the organizational impacts of Project Own It on the XBS side.","Katy Huberty","And as you look into 2020, the $450 million of incremental savings that you\u2019ve earmarked, where did those savings come from relative to the $640 million in 2019?","John Visentin","Yes, Katy, it\u2019s a little bit \u2013 we showed some of it when we did the February Analyst Day. But if you think about it, we have more work we can do on the supply chain side. On our infrastructure, we\u2019re investing not only in robot, we\u2019re investing in cloud-enabled solutions. So there\u2019s a lot of back office, if you\u2019d like, that we have more investments to do that take time, some of these take time. And then there\u2019s always optimization that we continue to do. So it\u2019s still in the same areas.","Katy Huberty","Great. Thank you.","Ann Pettrone","Great. Thank you, Katy. That\u2019s all the time we have for questions today. And we really appreciate the interest of everyone who has participated. John, anything to wrap?","John Visentin","Yes, I just want to say thank you to everybody. Our transformation continues to drive improvements in EPS, operating margin and free cash flow. The investments we are making in our business is setting us to improve our revenue trajectory, which gives us confidence in our ability to return Xerox to growth over the long term. Thank you again for joining us today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation on today\u2019s conference. This does conclude our program and we may all disconnect.

He is joined by Bill Osbourn, Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com\/investor. At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and\/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without the expressed permission of Xerox. After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.","During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements. Which, by their nature, address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein.","At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Jacobson. Mr. Jacobson, you may begin.","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","Good morning, and welcome to Xerox's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. During today's call, we will provide an update on our financial progress in the quarter as well as our expectations for 2017. Let me begin by saying that overall, I am pleased with our start to the year. Our operational performance delivered revenue, operating margin and cash flow that were all in line with our expectations for the quarter. Additionally, we made progress on our strategy to pursue the growing segments in the market. Recognizing that this is the first quarter out of four, and we still have a lot to do, our performance laid the foundation for us to deliver on our full year commitments.","Let me walk you through an overview of our first quarter financial results. The first quarter was a good start to the year. We delivered GAAP EPS of $0.02 and adjusted EPS of $0.15. Our earnings were impacted by a charge related to our 25% equity ownership of Fuji Xerox resulting in the $0.03 reduction in our GAAP and adjusted EPS. If this charge was excluded, our first quarter EPS was in line with our expectations for the quarter. Revenue of $2.45 billion was down 6.2% year-over-year or 4.3% on a constant-currency basis consistent with 2016. We experienced softness in Europe which was offset by improvements in our developing markets.","We saw a rebound in equipment sale revenue. While down 7.4% or 5.7% at constant currency it was better than the declines of 10.1% in the fourth quarter and 8.7% during the full year of 2016 in constant currency. High-end products recovered and we had better results in entry products driven by developing markets and early benefits from newly introduced color products. Post sale revenue was 80% of total revenue, and declined 5.8% or 3.9% at constant currency. Most post sale revenue stream trends were stable, but we did see a deceleration in Managed Document Services revenue. This was partially driven by lower signings in prior quarters.","We have high expectations for this business and we are taking actions and making investments to drive improvement. Our newly launched products will allow us to be more competitive and our channel expansion initiatives will make our industry-leading Xerox Partner Print Services offering available to more partners. We expect to begin to see benefits in the second half of the year.","Adjusted operating margin excluding the impact of the Fuji Xerox charge was 11.4%, an improvement of 90 basis points year-over-year despite a 110 basis point headwind from currency. We continue to realize productivity benefits from our strategic transformation initiatives, which are helping maintain our profitability and strong margins while offsetting our revenue decline.","Operating cash flow was up $103 million year-over-year driven by working capital, a good start to the year, but I would also highlight that our cash flow does not yet reflect higher pension contributions which are expected during the balance of the year. We repaid $1.3 billion in debt during the quarter as part of our plan to optimize our capital structure and maintain investment-grade metrics. Our results are indicative of our ability to operate the business well and to continue to deliver on our productivity and cost savings initiatives as we work to change the trajectory of our revenue.","In December, we shared with you our plan to drive long-term earnings expansion and reverse our revenue trajectory over time. It's a two-pronged approach. We are improving our efficiency and changing the way we work with our strategic transformation program, while aggressively pursuing strategic growth areas in our market. During the first quarter, we made progress on both initiatives. We are now in the second year of our three-year strategic transformation program and are on track to deliver $600 million in gross savings this year. We are driving increased productivity to expand margins while offsetting significant currency headwinds and enabling us to reinvest in the business.","We remain relentless in our efforts to improve our internal processes and systems to capture productivity in our work. Initiatives range small to large, local to global, and here are two examples. We are rolling out a new deal scoring process that includes a dynamic pricing methodology in our proposal and pricing tool. This process provides business intelligence to our sales resources. The expected outcomes are improvements in the turnaround of customer pricing proposals, increases in our win rate and the capture of margin upside to our new signings.","In our supply chain, we completed the transition of our major U.S. equipment warehouse to a third-party logistics provider as part of our optimization efforts. Our global supply chain and field teams work together to make ensure we continue to serve our customers during the transition and ensure all first quarter customer orders were delivered and installed.","Turning to the strategic growth areas. In 2016, 62% of our revenue was in mature markets. So to ensure we can change the revenue trajectory, we are working to maintain our leadership positions in those mature markets, while shifting more of our business into the growth markets.","We've targeted four strategic growth areas to pursue. First is Managed Document Services. We are the leader in this segment and we are building both new offerings, such as customized analytics and personalized workflows, as well as extending our reach to more customers including small and medium-sized businesses, or SMBs.","Second is A4 Entry products. This area includes desktop and multifunction printers, where we are underpenetrated. Pages in this area are moving from single function A4 size printers to higher value A4 multifunction printers, where we are better positioned. New A4 products will strengthen our Managed Document Services solutions and offerings to all our channels.","Third, we are going to leverage channel partners to reach the SMB. We are adding partners that understand this industry, are local experts, are close to the customers and are looking to grow their own businesses and provide great experiences for their customers.","Finally, production color, including inkjet and packaging. We are extending our leadership position in cut-sheet color, building a footprint in the growing inkjet market and creating new solutions that both automate and customize packaging. In the first quarter, 39% of our revenue was in our targeted growth areas, representing a mix improvement of 2 points year-over-year. Additionally, we laid the foundation for continued progress with the launch of new products. The big news in the quarter was the announcement of the largest product launch in our company's history, 29 new entry and workgroup multifunction devices.","The new portfolio is the next stage of the product strategy we started in 2013 when we launched ConnectKey, the first ecosystem-based platform for A3 workgroup devices. We followed that up in subsequent years with a broader range of specialized apps, customizable workflows, and solutions to deliver a better user experience. And now we are increasing the range of ConnectKey-enabled devices to include both A3 and Entry and workgroup A4 with fleet coherency between A3 and A4 devices.","These new products extend the functionality of multifunction printers. They go beyond the base printing, copying, scanning and faxing functions and change the fundamental nature of the connected workplace, with features and the ability to use customized apps that enable a truly personalized experience. The portfolio directly supports three of our strategic growth areas. Each new device is ConnectKey-enabled, perfect for Managed Document Services where a common toolset will make it easier to monitor, manage and optimize a fleet of devices more effectively.","Twelve of the new devices are A4-sized and will give us a significant presence in the A4 market where our participation has been limited. The new A4 products are cost-competitive, cloud-connected, app-enabled, and possess benchmark security, a perfect fit for SMBs that are looking for more than just print, copy, scan and faxing capabilities to help them grow.","Finally, these new devices are ideal for our channel partners. By selling existing apps or creating custom apps, dealers can achieve real differentiation and stickiness with their customers. A number of new ConnectKey products are available now, others will roll out during the second and third quarters of 2017. We expect to see the impact on our results start to ramp during the second half of the year.","The fourth strategic growth area is production color. As I mentioned, we saw a rebound in equipment sale revenue during the quarter, including high-end color, and we continue to take steps to drive additional activity. We were present in several important trade shows, demonstrating our inkjet technology among others, and during the first week of April we launched three new production color products: the Versant 180, Versant 180 performance package, and Versant 3100 presses with many new features that exceed what's currently available in the market and complement our growing line of production print engines. My thanks to the Xerox team for their efforts to improve our business, bring new products to market, and serve our customers well during the quarter.","I'll now turn the call to our CFO, Bill Osbourn.","William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.","Thanks, Jeff. Before diving into quarter one results, I want to highlight a few changes we've made to our reporting beginning in 2017. As we previewed last quarter, post the spinoff of Conduent, we have streamlined the management of the business along geographic sales channels and, therefore, now have one reportable segment. We are at the same time enhancing our disclosures to provide additional insight on our results. Around revenue, we are providing additional details by geographic sales channel, by product grouping for equipment sales revenue, and will continue to provide line-of-sight to our document outsourcing, or what we now call Manage Document Services revenues, as well as progress on the shift over time of our revenues toward our strategic growth areas.","On profitability, we'll be providing gross margins for both equipment and post sale revenues. On cash flow, we're providing some commentary around our expectations for normalized operating cash flow after we get past near-term higher restructuring payments and pension contributions. We believe these reporting changes will give greater context to our results and perspective of our business model. I'll talk more about them as we go through the presentation.","With that, let's start with the review of the income statement, which I'm going to mainly talk to on an adjusted basis that excludes non-service retirement-related costs, restructuring and related costs, and amortization of intangible assets. In addition, this quarter, we had two other discrete items that we adjusted for, and that essentially offset, a $13 million charge related to the extinguishment of debt and a $16 million benefit from the remeasurement of a tax matter related to a previously-adjusted item. Revenue, which I will cover in more detail on the next slide, was down $161 million, or 6.2% in actual currency, or 4.3% at constant currency, which is consistent with full-year 2016.","Looking at the cost ratios, savings from our strategic transformation program more than offset the impact of revenue declines and a negative transaction-currency impact of 110 basis points, resulting in gross margin expansion of 20 basis points and an improvement in SAG as a percentage of revenue of 20 basis points. Within our definition of operating income is equity income, which was down year-over-year due to the Fuji Xerox receivable write-off that Jeff mentioned.","As Fujifilm recently announced, they are reviewing the appropriateness of accounting practices related to certain sales of leasing transactions involving Fuji Xerox New Zealand. Our first quarter results included charge of approximately $30 million within equity income, representing our share of the current Fujifilm estimated adjustment for this review. Although the approximate $0.03 impact of the Fuji Xerox New Zealand receivable matter is included in our adjusted EPS, we are modifying our definition of adjusted operating margin to exclude this matter in order to present a more normalized view. On this basis, overall adjusted operating margin expanded 90 basis points and adjusted operating profit was up $6 million. So, from an operating perspective, overall good cost management offset revenue declines consistent with our expectations.","Turning to the below-the-line items, other expenses net of $41 million was $4 million better year-over-year as lower interest expense roughly offset the gain on sales of assets in the prior year. The tax rate of 27.5% was within our full-year range of 25% to 28%, and was higher by 6.1 points year-over-year, an approximate negative $0.01 impact year-over-year to adjusted EPS.","Overall, adjusted EPS of $0.15 was down $0.03 from Q1 2016 driven by the higher tax rate and the Fuji Xerox matter. GAAP EPS was $0.02 in the quarter. The difference between GAAP and adjusted EPS includes our normal adjustments around restructuring and related costs, non-service retirement-related costs and amortization of intangible assets, as well as the two discrete items I described earlier.","Turning to the next slide, I will drill down more on revenue. Starting with total revenue, from a geographic perspective, North America was down 4.5%, or 4.8% in constant currency, and represented 60% of our revenues. International represented 35% of total revenue, and reflected higher declines in Europe that were partially offset by growth in developing markets as we saw a turn there and overall improvement off a weak Q1 2016. The remaining 5% of our revenues are in other, which includes our OEM business, sales of Fuji Xerox and licensing.","Within total revenue, equipment sales were down 7.4%, or 5.7% in constant currency. From a product-offering perspective, entry equipment sales was down 6.4%, or 5.5% in constant currency, an improvement in trend reflecting the rebound in developing markets, as well as early benefits from new products offset by continued higher OEM equipment declines.","Mid-range was down 8.6%, or 7% in constant currency, so relatively weaker, but anticipated given that none of our recently-announced new mid-range workplace products were available in quarter one. Lastly, we saw better performance in high-end equipment sales, which were down 6.1%, or 3.7% in constant currency, an improvement from the fourth quarter.","A couple of points to highlight in the high-end. First, color equipment grew 1% in constant currency; and, second, the growth was driven by the higher end of the portfolio, continuous feed and iGen products. Entry production color products were down year-over-year, as we have yet to benefit from the new Versant products we only just announced.","Moving on. Post sale revenue was down 5.8% or 3.9% in constant currency. This compares to a decline of 2.9% in 2016. The higher Q1 post sale decline was driven by Managed Document Services, which essentially is our previously reported document outsourcing revenues now expanded to include Managed Print Services within Global Imaging. In Q1, Managed Document Services was 33% of our revenues. It was down 2% in actual currency and up 0.4% in constant currency. This compares to 2.6% constant currency growth in 2016.","The slowdown can be attributed to lower signings in recent quarters within the enterprise space, as well as a challenging compare in Q1 as Q1 2016 Managed Document Services was up 4.9% in constant currency driven by strong equipment growth.","I'll now shift to discuss our key performance metrics, a view which I have already touched on. Strategic growth areas in the first quarter grew 1% in constant currency and comprised 39% of our total revenues, a 2 point mix shift from the year ago period. The growth of 1% did not reflect benefits from our newly launched products and compares to growth of 2% in 2016 with the trend change coming from the Managed Document Services component I just discussed. Jeff highlighted earlier that we made progress in Q1 laying the foundation to drive improvement in strategic growth areas with a target to shift the mix by approximately 3 points this year.","Turning to installs, as expected, color was stronger than black and white. We saw improved performance in entry, although a weaker mix given the better developing markets performance where units tend to weigh towards the lower end of the portfolio. Mid-range installs likewise were dampened as expected by not benefiting yet from the newly launched products. And high-end installs were weaker than equipment revenue performance I described earlier as mix improved the stronger performance in the higher-end products like continuous feed and iGen, offsetting install declines in entry production products given product launch timing.","Signings in the quarter of $532 million were down 6% year-over-year and down 5% on a trailing 12 months basis at constant currency. With that, we did see improvement in new business signings which were up 1% year-over-year at constant currency. Signings, as Jeff mentioned, is an area where we are making investments in sales coverage and taking action to drive better results. I should note that we only have a line of sight to signings in the lower growth large enterprise areas. So broadly speaking, total Managed Document Services revenue growth outperformed signings as the higher market growth is coming from the SMB area.","The last key measurement I'd like to cover is strategic transformation. This is a critical program to drive both expanding margins and enabling investments to improve revenue trajectory. We have many projects underway spanning the company and we continue to target $600 million in gross savings for 2017. We took, as anticipated, a fairly large restructuring charge of $120 million in quarter one to position us to achieve our full year gross savings objectives. There are headwinds related to revenue declines as well as currency that partially offset these savings, but net-net we anticipate continued margin expansion for the full year.","Before moving on to cash flow, I'd like to take some time to cover the trends we're sitting at a high level and how we expect them to play out as we progress through the year. The total revenue decline of 4.3% in constant currency was consistent with 2016 and an improvement over Q4. We continue to expect full year constant currency revenue declines in the mid-single digits with about 2 points of negative translation currency.","From a calendarization perspective, Q2 will face the most challenging year-over-year compare and we won't see a full quarter's benefit from the new product launch. So net-net, we'd expect higher declines in Q2 with moderating declines in the second half driven by improving equipment revenue trends.","Operating margin is seasonally weakest in Q1 so we expect improvement in absolute terms as we move through the year supported by our continued focus on our transformation and productivity initiatives. Transaction currency is dampening some of that improvement and was a negative 110-basis-point year-over-year impact to margin in Q1. At current rates, we expect a slightly higher negative impact in Q2 and more moderate impacts in the second half.","Lastly, and looking at the trends for adjusted EPS, we are continuing to guide for full year adjusted EPS between $0.80 and $0.88, which compares to $0.88 in 2016. The drivers of full year 2017 adjusted EPS as we highlighted last quarter are currency and the higher tax rate partially offset by lower interest expense. These factors impacted our first quarter results and while we're not giving guidance for the second quarter, we expect EPS to decline year-over-year in Q2 before we get into the second half where compares should ease as currencies should moderate at current rates and benefits from our recent product launches should begin to flow through.","I will now shift to discuss cash flow. Operating cash flow generation coming from continuing operations in the quarter was $190 million, up $103 million year-over-year and free cash flow was $164 million, up $109 million year-over-year. So a good result driven in part by working capital timing as inventories were a smaller use year-over-year given product launch timing and payables were also a source. As we indicated last quarter, our operating cash flow guidance of $700 million to $900 million will be about $200 million lower this year than normalized operating cash flow of about $1 billion driven by higher restructuring payments and pension contributions.","Q1 operating cash flow reflected the higher restructuring payment expectations, $60 million versus $21 million in the prior year. The pension contributions of $23 million were only a small portion of our guidance of $350 million for the full year. Investing cash flows were a use of $35 million and included CapEx spend of $26 million and $11 million related to a small GIS acquisition. Cash used in financing was over $1 billion and reflected $1.3 billion in senior note repayments and $87 million in dividends, both common and preferred.","Turning now to the capital structure slide I will spend a few minutes on debt before handing it back to Jeff. We ended Q1 with $5 billion of debt, which is lower than 2016 ending debt of $6.3 billion reflecting the $1.3 billion of senior note debt repayments I just highlighted. Two elements made up the repayments. The first was the repayment of $1 billion associated with two senior notes that matured.","In addition, in the quarter we exchanged $600 million of certain senior notes due 2018 through 2020 for $300 million in cash and $300 million in new senior notes due 2022 with a fixed coupon rate of 4.07%. This transaction in essence allowed us to early retire $300 million in debt and extend out the term of an additional $300 million.","Of our $5 billion in debt, $3.7 billion is allocated to financing debt calculated by a fine of 7:1 leverage to our customer financing assets of $4.2 billion, which are comprised of $3.7 billion of finance receivables and $472 million of equipment on operating leases. This financing debt is adjusted out in one form or another by rating agencies when calculating our core leverage.","So, to summarize, overall a positive start to the year with most operational metrics in line with expectations, putting us on track to meet our full-year guidance.","With that, I will hand it back to Jeff.","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","Thank you, Bill. During the quarter, I made several international and domestic trips to meet with customers, partners and employees; it's one of the most important parts of my job. It enables me to have an unfiltered view of what is occurring in our operations, while having direct discussions with our stakeholders. Our customers are always candid in their assessments of how we are doing. They have told me they are pleased with our renewed focus on the document technology market and the new products we've introduced, and that we can never let up on our efforts to serve them better and bring innovations to market that make the way they work easier; they depend on Xerox to keep them at the forefront of technology.","Our partners and potential partners provide a great perspective on their local markets. They continue to challenge us to be better and our team has stepped up with new products, tools and support to make us the partner of choice. And employees, the heart and soul of our company, are engaged and excited about the opportunities we have before us.","We understand the realities of the market and the needs of our customers and partners, and we are laying the foundation to deliver what is needed to win. I feel good about the new products and offerings being launched, our strategic direction and our operating discipline. The strategic transformation program remains a critical focus to continue to drive strong margins and cash flow while we work on reversing the revenue trajectory.","All in all, we made good progress in the first quarter. We have more work to do and the team is intensely focused on delivering on our full-year commitments.","We will now open up the line for questions. Jennifer?","Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.","Thanks, Jeff. Before we get to your questions for Jeff and Bill, let me point out that we have a number of supplemental slides at the end of our deck which provide more financial details to support today's presentation and complement our prepared remarks. For the Q&A, I would ask participants to limit follow-on and multipart questions so we can get to everyone. At the end of our Q&A session, I will turn it back to Jeff for closing comments.","Operator, please open the line for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Shannon Cross of Cross Research. Your line is now open.","Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC","Thank you very much. I wanted to ask first about cash flow. It seems like you're a little bit more positive in terms of the normalized cash flow at $1 billion. So sort of what's getting you there? What are you seeing in terms of opportunity on the working capital side? Again, I understand this year you have puts and takes with more restructuring and that, but when you get into 2018, can you talk a little bit about how you are thinking about cash flow? And then if you can talk a bit about how you are thinking about cash usage, if anything has changed and where you plan on sort of targeting it? Especially given the stock at this point is down in \u2013 at $6.73 you could probably buy back a fair amount?","William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.","Yeah. Hi, Shannon. This is Bill Osbourn. I'll touch on that. So, cash flow, as we talked about at the year-end earnings call, it's really the same thoughts or similar thoughts that \u2013 both 2017 and 2018 would be below what we would think our normalized cash flow would be, about $1 billion. And the two primary items which you mentioned are the higher pension contributions over that period of time being approximately $100 million-plus higher each given year. And then also, we were going to have higher restructuring payments each of those two years as we were doing our strategic transformation. We would expect those to normalize and have a $200 million-plus benefit versus to get to a more normalized $1 billion cash flow in 2019 and beyond.","So similar to what we said at year-end both 2017 and 2018 would be dampened by approximately $200 million. We are working continuously to improve our working capital both from an inventory management perspective, managing receivables, payables, timing, et cetera, and we have some specific projects in place to really focus on inventory management, but the primary things impacting the normalized cash flow are the higher restructuring payments this year and next year, and the higher pension contributions. As far as your second part of your question regarding the uses of cash, similar thoughts to year-end.","Given the $700 million to $900 million of operating cash flow we're expecting this year, and our cash on hand on the balance sheet at the end of the year, we projected to have about $1 billion to $1.2 billion in cash available. We're going to pay down incremental $300 million of debt, which we did during the quarter; dividends around $280 million, CapEx we're guiding about $175 million and M&A in the $100 million range. That left, if you're doing the math, about $100 million to $300 million that we're evaluating the best uses of, whether that's paying down additional debt, whether M&A opportunities come along, et cetera.","At this point, although we continually look at it regarding share repurchases, we're not planning on making any share repurchase at this time, but as you state, we'll look at the market and factors, share price, and we evaluate it, but at this point our goal is to invest in future growth opportunities and maintain the quality of our balance sheet.","Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.","Okay. Great.","Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC","Thank you. And then just one quick follow-up.","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","Yes.","Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC","Jeff, can you talk a bit about what you're seeing in terms of pricing environment and specifically as the yen has moved between JPY 100 and JPY 120 in the last few months, and now it's sort of in the middle, how are you sort of thinking about, and seeing, from the Japanese competitors, their reaction in terms of being able to use the yen for pricing or perhaps pulling back a little bit? Thank you.","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","Yeah. Hi, Shannon. How are you? Yeah. We've seen pricing being very stable in our market. If we look at the last few quarters, extremely stable both certainly in equipment as you've seen from some of our Japanese competitors. They've actually made some public statements about trying to manage their businesses more for profitability. So, we've seen relatively stable market dynamic as we go through.","Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.","Great. Thanks, Shannon. Operator, next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Tong of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I'd like to dig deeper into the transformation savings program. You provided some examples of efficiencies you've achieved including better sales force, business intelligence, better supply chain management. As you look ahead, can you elaborate on what additional actions are required to unlock the remaining strategic transformation savings to get to your $600 million gross savings target this year?","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","Yes. So, George, how are you? This is Jeff, and then I'll let Bill supplement. We have a really diligent process, where literally the team goes through this on a weekly basis. It's a cadence of literally hundreds of projects from the way we deliver products, the way we build into our technical services group, remote connectivity, remote call assist, what we do in manufacturing, as I talked about we outsourced our warehouses.","So when you look at the supply chain procurement, what we're doing in delivery, what we're bringing down \u2013 or doing to bring down our unit manufacturing costs, and certainly the area that we will continue to hit hard will be G&A. So as we move forward and we delayer the organization and continue to reduce the number of layers and our spans of control \u2013 actually, increase our spans of control, I think, we'll be seeing G&A come out even more. We're looking at things in our IT of how we can become more efficient in IT. I think, G&A is certainly an area where we can do a lot more work.","William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.","Yeah. Just to follow-on, I was going to say the same thing. G&A, clearly, we're looking for areas to cut costs, where we are not going to be impacting future revenue growth, and G&A is one of those areas. We've done benchmark analyses and have identified areas that we plan on reducing costs in certain G&A sectors, and that will be clearly an area of focus.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it, and as a follow-up, some of those strategic savings will be reinvested back into the business. Can you talk about which areas of the business are priorities for reinvestments? And how to think about the timing of reinvestments and the implications from the cadence of margin expansion as we move through the year?","William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.","Yeah. There are \u2013 the reinvestment, clearly is \u2013 part of it is offsetting various headwinds from currency transactions, et cetera, but we are also utilizing these savings to reinvest in the business. Couple examples would be in \u2013 people may not think about it this way, but we are planning on and have been selling more A4s as part of our new product launch, and those have lower margins upfront. It's really investing in the business, because you get higher margins over the life of the product due to the post sale revenues, but it is actually an investment getting those machines in field, or MIP, out there, and our goal is to \u2013 this year to increase our volume of A4s of our new product launch. That is one example in particular.","We are investing in systems, as Jeff mentioned, the delivery area. There are costs there. Some of it is CapEx, some of it's OpEx, and in some of our back-office IT infrastructure, we're also doing investments to be able to do things more efficiently and cost effective.","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","Yeah. And, George, this is Jeff, as Bill hit on it, some of the investments is certainly going into the revenue generation to change the revenue trajectory. So Bill mentioned the product launch. If you look at channel expansion and just bringing on new partners, whether they're mono-branded, multi-branded, there's demand generation, there's training required, one of the areas that Bill talked about we did grow a little bit in signings on new business generation, but we have a concerted program to hire what we call new logo hunters, just going after non-Xerox accounts that we have today. That's an area of focus. So, in some cases, where we're making trade-offs on G&A, we're investing it back into the S part of SG&A, for the selling, because we want to change that revenue trajectory.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.","And about the timing of reinvestments?","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","Yes. I mean, they're ongoing as we go. So what we do is we try not to get out ahead of our headlights, but if you look at it and you say basically our margin expansion was up 90 basis points offsetting the 110 basis points of currency that Bill talked about, but we're still investing in the business in a judicious way and a prudent way to change revenue trajectory. So it's ongoing.","Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.","Great. Thanks, George. Operator, next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Paul Coster from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Paul J. Chung - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks. This is Paul Chung on for Paul Coster. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the new product launch, how is the firm dealing with older products, whether in existing inventory, or in the channel? Are there any promotions going on for existing inventory?","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","Yeah. So, Paul, good question. We try to balance that all the time. So what we try to do is manage the inventory, manage the obsolescence, so there's no question. We do try to give some incentives, so that we can clear out the existing product line, but not in an excessive rate by any means, well, I'd say a prudent rate to clear out the existing inventory as the new products are going \u2013 coming in.","So, I mean, if you were to look, for example, at our high-end business that from an equipment standpoint was down 3.7% in constant currency, which was an improvement, you might misjudge things if you were to look at the installs being down. The reason was, as Bill mentioned, we had good performance at the high-end with our production inkjet, with our iGen, which is the higher production devices of the high-end. But if you look at Versant basically orders were down a little bit from that standpoint because we were just introducing the three new Versant lines. So we manage that pretty diligently and our supply chain team does a great job.","Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.","Thanks, Paul. Operator, next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva of Citi. Your line is now open.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you very much. And I just got to say the additional details provided in the slide and stuff are greatly appreciated, so we sincerely appreciate that. On the reported earnings, I think, they were about $0.15 and if I do the math correctly it looks like that includes the cost of the Fujifilm of about $0.03, and you're keep \u2013 if you can confirm that, and you're keeping the full year EPS unchanged. So in essence when you include Fuji costs, are you raising your full year because now you have Fuji costs or the investigation that's going on, or is that something that you're kind of always anticipating and maybe just now it's more communicating to us? And then I have a follow-up.","William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.","Yeah. Hey, Jim. It's Bill. Hey, great question. As far as the Fuji Xerox, just to confirm it is a $0.03 impact in our adjusted EPS, so the $0.15 adjusted EPS does include that $0.03 or $30 million charge, or we would have been say it another way, $0.18 without it.","Clearly, we did not know anything when we gave guidance back in January about this charge when we were setting guidance for the full year. With that said, when you go throughout the year, and we update and we do detailed analyses internally projecting for the rest of the year, there are puts and takes that occur and I'm not going to go through all the details of those but one example of that is we give guidance at the beginning of the year and factor in a certain amount of transaction currency headwinds for the year. Updated based upon current foreign currency rates, we see that being a couple of pennies less for the rest of the year and that would be something that we factor in to our updated overall guidance analysis.","So the $0.03 clearly was not expected; however, it is factored into the full year updated guidance now and when we look at other puts and takes that come into play as we update each quarter end and we're reaffirming the $0.80 and $0.88 and knowing that that $0.03 charge is in the Q1.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. And then my follow-up is regarding this $0.03 charge, is that the full EPS impact of the estimated liability or is that like the cost quarter-to-date or expected investigation cost or how should we think about is there still more risk of additional write-down or a $0.03, $0.05, $0.10 in future quarters?","William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.","Yeah. We're not going to go into really details regarding the Fuji Xerox matter other than what they have disclosed. Fujifilm put out a press release last week that specifically cited a \u00a522 billion receivable adjustment. This is our calculated estimate of the impact of that adjustment on our earnings. Fujifilm has stated that they are in the process of an investigation. The \u00a522 billion is their current estimate that they put out there. With that said, as we made in our note in our disclosures that could change, but we are not aware of anything additional at this point other than the \u00a522 billion, which we've calculated to have a $30 million impact.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Thank you so much for the details. That's greatly appreciated. Thank you.","William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.","Okay. Thanks, Jim.","Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.","Great. Thanks, Jim. Operator next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Thank you for the question. Just a couple really, on the strategic part of your business, I think the $0.01 growth rate at constant currency. Am I right in thinking that accelerates in the back half driven by the product announcements? And then the second clarification I had, you mentioned the difficulty (42:54) you have in Q2. What is specifically the (42:56).","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","Kulbinder, how are you? This is Jeff. I was having a little difficulty hearing your question, but I think it had something to do with the strategic growth areas growing at 1% at this point. We were overall relatively pleased with where we were from a revenue standpoint.","So, if you go back to our beginning of the year guidance of mid-single-digit decline, coming in at 4.3% down was what I would say good for the first quarter, especially if you consider that we had a 90-basis-point impact from our OEM business and our CMS, which was a higher deceleration rate than we had last year.","So if you back that out, we would've been at about 3.4% where instead of the 90 basis points we declined about 40 basis points last year on that rate. So that was really without the benefit of any of the new products. We did get four of the A4 products in towards the end of the quarter, so we got a little bit of a boost there. But what we've been saying consistently all along, as we bring the vast majority of the products out in the second quarter, a little overhang of the remaining A4 products into the third quarter is that we'll start seeing this ramp much more in the second half of the year. We did get the 2 point year-over-year movement from the 37% to the 39% into the growth markets. So we're pretty much on track for where we thought we'd be.","Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you.","Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.","And, Kulbinder, I think there is a second part to your question that we may have missed, if you want to repeat it?","Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yes. Just in Q2, what is causing the difficult compares you mentioned?","William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.","Hey, Kulbinder. It's Bill. Yes. A couple of things really from a difficult compare perspective, we're expecting a little bit bigger headwind in Q2 from a transaction currency perspective. Also, if you're looking at Q1 last year, we had not fully ramped up our strategic transformation, our restructuring process. By Q2 that had ramped up; it was in full swing. So we now have full ramped-up strategic transformation this year in Q2 and in last year in Q2, so that creates a little bit tougher compare. And we won't fully benefit from all the products being out in Q2. Most of them will be out in Q2, but it won't fully be there yet.","So, with that said, we don't give \u2013 we're not giving formal quarterly guidance on adjusted EPS, or anything. But I think, historically, if you do the math, Q2 has been around 25% of the full year, and it looks to be in that zone for this year. The headwinds are really that transaction currency in Q2 this year, which we do, by the way, expect to moderate in the second half of this year.","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","Yeah. And, Kulbinder, also just to supplement from a revenue standpoint, last year, if you remember, we had the iSeries launch in the second quarter, so our equipment revenue was down at 4.9%, overall revenue was down at 3.4%. So that was our best quarter from a revenue standpoint in terms of relative decline. So just a little tougher compare. As Bill said, tougher compare top-line and a little more transactional currency in the second quarter, which will become a better story in the second half.","Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you.","Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.","Great. Thanks, Kulbinder. Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks. Good morning. With new business TCV growing again in the first quarter, albeit slightly versus the declines last year, can you just talk about where you are in terms of putting in place the sales force to chase new logos, and then just general ballpark of where you would want the new business TCV to be growing say exiting this year?","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","Yes. Hi, Katy. How are you? This is Jeff. So if we go back to last year, last year was not a great year for us on new business signings. We were down for the total year actually at 18%. And I think one of the things that's important, as we talk about signings, we're actually referring to them now as enterprise signings. So about 80% of our Managed Document Services business today is in the enterprise. We really don't track signings for Global Imaging and for our Xerox Partner Print Services, which are more in the SMB arena where we expect to see the growth.","So, again, just to look at the marketplace, $13 billion is the Managed Print Services market. $6 billion of that market, which is growing at about 2% is in the enterprise, where we're really looking to capitalize on the growth of the $7 billion of the SMB Managed Print Services space, growing at 7%. We did grow at 1% on new business signings. We were down at about 12% on the renewals but, again, those were in the enterprise. The new logo hunters we're starting to bring on now, those two take time to ramp.","So from the time they come, if you think about hiring somebody from the outside, calling on new accounts that would be a ramp. We expect to get better ramp from the expanded channels, getting new partners, and certainly when the new products come and then, obviously, increasing our renewal rate, which was at about 81%. So we think the biggest benefits will come in the second half of the year really with the new product launch.","Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And then just as a follow-up, you saw recovery in high-end equipment sales still spotty in some of the other segments just given the product launches but most of that is now in the field. And so, do you have line of sight as to when you would expect equipment sales to stabilize and\/or grow again?","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","Yes. So we were not dissatisfied by any means with the 5.7% decline in equipment revenue. If you look at the second half of last year, we were a little over 10% in constant currency declines in the second half and 8.7% for the full year. So the 5.7% was an improvement and, again, that was up without really getting the benefits.","With the Versant launch, which was three new products, if we go back to whenever we've launched Versant in past years, we did get a nice bump. It's just coming in in April. So we would think, believe and hope and certainly in May and June we should start seeing the benefits of that.","If I look at entry from an ESR standpoint, down 5.5% and if I look at the install, color installs were up 15%. Part of that was the nice bump we got towards the end when we did bring in four of the A4 products. Midrange really didn't help us. We didn't bring out any new products but in Q2 we will be bringing out all 17 of the mid-range A3 products, and again, I think that will help us much more in the second half of the year.","Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.","Great. Thanks, Katy.","Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you very much.","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","Thank you, Katy.","Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.","Operator, I think we have time for one last question.","Operator","Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Matt Cabral of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. I kind of wanted to follow up to that last question. I guess, given that the product launch hit at the end of the quarter and it was pretty well telegraphed that you guys were going to do it. Can you just talk about either quantitatively or even just qualitatively about the amount of demand hesitation that you saw just ahead of these new products hitting the market?","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Matt. That's a good point. You always see some of that. I mean, so that's why if you were to look \u2013 that's why you really have the disconnect, I'll say, between our installs on high end and the negative 3.7% actual equipment revenue recognized at high end. We had very positive mix with our inkjet installations as well as our iGen installations. Those are higher volume, higher-priced product or higher-priced products where the Versant, which is more of a volume type of play, what I'll call more of the entry production color. In anticipation of that, those installs were down significantly year-over-year. So, to your point, we always see that in our business that until the new products actually hit the supply chain that's when you'll see the orders start coming.","Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And, maybe, Jeff, just on that same point thinking a little bit more about the mid range, given the A3 launch that you had, was there any demand hesitation there that you saw as well?","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","Yeah. I mean, I think we would attribute that to being down to negative 7%. Certainly, the black-and-white that was down 24%, color was flat. So I don't think there's any question about that.","When you look at our order flow and backlog, I think there definitely was that hesitation and as it starts hitting our supply chain, the normal course it would be to see it starting to flow better. And again, I think we'll get those benefits in the second half.","Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.","Great. Thanks, Matt. And that's all the time we have for questions today. Thanks for everyone's interest. Jeff, anything more to wrap up?","Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.","Yes. Thanks, Jennifer. Just thank you all for your questions. The first quarter was a positive beginning for the new Xerox. We are keenly focused on the work ahead of us and we are confident in our ability to meet our commitments. We look forward to updating you on our progress as we go along and I want to thank you all for joining our call.","Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.","Thanks, Jeff. That concludes our call today.

She is joined by Kathy Mikells, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com\/investor. At the request of Xerox Corporation, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. Other recording and\/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without the expressed permission of Xerox. After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which by their nature address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein.","At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns, you may begin.","Ursula Burns","Good morning and thanks for joining our call. Today, we reported our third quarter results and provided an update on the fourth quarter and full year outlook. During this call, we will update you on our strategy, provide details on our third quarter results, and share the actions that we are taking to improve our business. So, let me begin with a look at our priorities.","In Services, our goal is to lead an attractive segment of the business services market and throughout the year, we have taken steps to strengthen this business, including acquisitions to build our commercial healthcare offerings and the divestiture of ITO. As we announced two weeks ago, we are also taking action to improve our future financial performance and significantly reduce the volatility of our results with the update to our government healthcare business strategy. With these strategy changes to our government healthcare business, we are more clearly focused on the most profitable segments of our Services business.","In Document Technology, our efforts are focused on continuing to lead the market. We maintained our number one market share position in equipment sales revenue for the 23rd straight quarter, closing in on 6 years, a solid record of leadership and we are seeing good demand from small and midsized businesses, an important growth segment through Global Imaging Systems and with the growth of our partner print solutions sold through our channels. Also in the third quarter, we launched our new communication platform, Work Can Work Better and we are pleased with the reactions so far. Our new advertising and digital content highlight how we are enabling businesses and governments to achieve better results by helping them work better.","For our shareholders, we have returned more than 50% of our free cash flow to them over the last four years and we are on track to do even more this year. Through September, we completed $1.3 billion in share repurchases, achieving our full year expectations. Although we have already taken steps to accelerate cost reductions and prioritize investments to drive improved revenue, productivity and margins, we announced today that the Xerox Board of Directors have authorized a comprehensive review of structural options for the company\u2019s business portfolio and capital allocation with the goal of enhancing shareholder value.","Now, let\u2019s look at the third quarter performance. During the third quarter, we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.24, that\u2019s in line with our guidance, which excludes $0.05 related to the amortization of intangibles and $0.23 from the previously announced health enterprise charge. Because the circumstances in health enterprise are unique, I will speak to our adjusted results in the quarter, which better reflects our underlying operating performance.","Total adjusted revenue was $4.4 billion, down 4% in constant currency. On an adjusted basis, Services revenue was consistent with the same period last year and we delivered sequential improvement in our Services margin. Document outsourcing continues to perform well overall and BPO was down 1%, which was consistent with previous quarters.","There are a few highlights in Services that I would like to share. Acquisitions remain a key aspect of our portfolio management strategy. And in the third quarter, we acquired RSA Medical and iPas, expanding our suite of healthcare related offerings. Our new go-to-market teams are establishing leadership roles in their industries. As examples, our retail team convened top clients and thought leaders at Xerox Retail Industry Summit, and Xerox Analytics were demonstrated at the grand opening of MCV, the University of Michigan\u2019s one-of-a-kind test site for connected and automated vehicles and a number of services offerings received external recognition. We retained the top position in Quocirca\u2019s managed print services market landscape report for the sixth consecutive year. And for the third year running, Everest Group rated Xerox as a leading service provider for contact center outsourcing BPO.","Now, moving on to Document Technology, Document Technology revenue was down 9% in constant currency, which is lower than we had expected and mostly was driven by increased pressures in developing markets. Excluding the impact of the developing markets the revenue trends in Document Technology remains stable. Document Technology margin of 12.8% was strong and within our guidance range of 11% to 13%. Some additional Doc Tech highlights, we are seeing the benefit of recent product launches with strong demand for our new entry production color devices and we showcased the best of team Xerox at Graph Expo, the largest U.S. tradeshow for the graphic communications market, including two new Xerox digital production color presses, the Xerox iGen 5 press and the Xerox Rialto 900 inkjet press. We also rolled out FreeFlow core cloud, which is the latest release in our leading Workflow Automation portfolio.","In total, the company generated operating cash flow of $271 million and we returned $774 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Then now I will turn it over to Kathy to provide more details on the quarter. I will be back later to share fourth quarter guidance and wrap up. Kathy?","Kathy Mikells","Thanks, Ursula and good morning everyone. I will start with an overview of our financial performance before moving into a more detailed discussion of the segment. As announced two weeks ago, this quarter we reported a pre-tax charge of $389 million or $241 million after tax, reflecting that we no longer expect to fully complete the health enterprise platform projects in California and in Montana. This decision will improve Xerox\u2019s future financial performance as these implementations were generating losses and will remove an element of risk and volatility in the business. Accordingly, I will provide results and growth rates, adjusting for the charge to give better visibility to the underlying business performance in the quarter.","Our bottom line results were within our third quarter guidance with revenues a bit softer and profitability generally in line with our expectations. Total revenue in the quarter was down 7% at actual currency and 4% at constant currency. Services was flat at constant currency as growth in document outsourcing offset a 1% decline in BPO. Document Technology declined 9% at constant currency and was impacted by increasing weakness in developing markets. Gross margin of 30.9% was down 130 basis points year-over-year, driven by a lower technology equipment gross margin as well as the greater mix of services, which carries the lower margin.","RD&E was slightly lower year-over-year. SAG in absolute dollars was down 9%. SAG as a percent of revenue was better by 40 basis points helped by currency and on our ongoing productivity initiatives as well as lower compensation and benefit expense. Our third quarter operating margin of 8.7% decreased 90 basis points year-over-year and operating profit declined 16%. Over 40% of the operating profit decline was driven by currency and developing markets.","Moving down the income statement, adjusted other net expense was $8 million lower year-over-year driven by lower restructuring costs. Equity income was $40 million in the quarter, down $4 million year-over-year, driven in part by the continued impact of negative translation currency. Our third quarter adjusted tax rate of 24.6% was at the low end of our guidance range of 25% to 27%. Our third quarter adjusted EPS was at the top of our guidance range at $0.24.","I will now move on to discuss our operational performance in Services. Services revenue declined 3% and was flat at constant currency. BPO was down 1%, consistent with the second quarter, reflecting the headwind from last year\u2019s larger contract losses, lower inorganic contribution as well as lower new contract ramp from softer signings in previous quarters. Good growth continues in document outsourcing up 3%, driven by strong Xerox Partner print services growth as well as good equipment revenue growth in enterprise accounts from recent strong signings.","Total signings in the quarter were down 7%, but are up 5% on a trailing 12-month basis. New business signings were down 9% year-over-year as growth in document outsourcing was more than offset by declines in BPO. Our go-to-market investments and move to industry business groups are beginning to result in good growth and shorter sales cycle offerings such as customer care, but we have yet to see a pickup in higher value longer sales cycle offerings. Our renewal rate in the quarter was 89%, which was at the high end of our target range of the 85% to 90% and reflects continued overall good customer retention.","Turning to margin, segment margin was 8.1%, in line with our expectations for sequential improvement from 7.5% in the second quarter. Margin was down 100 basis points year-over-year, reflecting investments in resources and in our new Services operating model, negative business mix within BPO as well as higher overhead as we work to lean out cost following the ITO divestiture. We continue to expect productivity from operational initiatives and our recent restructuring to yield increasing benefits in the fourth quarter.","I will now turn to Document Technology. Document Technology revenue in the quarter was down 9% at constant currency. Developing market weakness, including negative currency accelerated in the third quarter contributing more than one-third of the constant currency revenue decline. Also contributing to the decline in the third quarter was high end revenue. After good equipment growth in the second quarter, high end was weaker in the third quarter, reflecting in part timing of product launches, including our recently announced iGen 5, which had helped us drive improvement in the fourth quarter.","From a total printing perspective, combining Document Technology with document outsourcing, revenue has been fairly stable, down 5% in the third quarter and down 4% year-to-date at constant currency. Turning to activity, we saw a strong growth in entry A4 color, driven by new products, relatively stable results in mid-range, but weaker installs and mix of products in high end. Document Technology margin of 12.8% was down year-over-year, but within our full year guidance of 11% to 13%. Year-over-year drivers include negative equipment mix given better A4 results and the anticipated higher pension expense, partially offset by lower compensation and benefit expense. We continued to actively manage our cost base to ensure alignment to revenue trends. So in closing, Doc Tech revenues were slightly lower than expected, but profitability remained strong.","Turning now to cash, cash flow from operations was $271 million in the quarter, which was lower than prior year cash flow of $595 million. The decline year-over-year reflects lower profits in Document Technology with the two largest drivers being continued negative currency impact and developing market\u2019s weakness, lower profits in Services driven by margin decline as well as the expected loss of cash flow from the ITO business following the divestiture. Additionally, working capital was the use of cash due to timing of vendor payments as well as lower demand and timing of shipments impacting inventory. The health enterprise charge in the third quarter had a negligible impact on cash in the period and we anticipate the approximate $225 million of cash outflows will be spread over time.","Moving down the cash flow statement, investing cash flows were $206 million use, driven by $65 million spent on CapEx and $153 million on acquisition. Cash flow from financing was an $888 million used which included $691 million spent on share repurchases and $90 million used for preferred and common stock dividend. And our cash balance at the end of the quarter was just over $800 million. So cash flow in the third quarter was impacted by lower operating profit as well as working capital timing.","Now I will review our capital structure. We ended the third quarter with $7.6 billion in debt. Applying seven to one leverage on customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt at the end of the third quarter was $3.9 billion, leaving core debt of $3.7 billion. In the fourth quarter, we are now anticipating an additional $200 million debt reduction, which will bring our year end debt level to approximately $7.4 billion, a $350 million debt reduction for the year. This reduction will help to offset the impact to our credit metrics from lower earnings and the reduction in our financing assets. Overall, we continue to manage our capital structure to maintain credit metrics consistent with our investment grade rating.","I will now hand it back to Ursula to discuss capital allocation and guidance.","Ursula Burns","With less than a quarter left in the year, we can be more definitive on our remaining uses of capital. As Kathy just mentioned, we have spent about $200 million on acquisitions year-to-date and we don\u2019t anticipate closing any large acquisitions before year end. We now expect to deploy an additional $200 million of capital towards debt reduction. We will spend $300 million on dividends. And lastly on share repurchase, we receive \u2013 we reached our full year target of $1.3 billion in quarter three, this represents 115 million share reduction \u2013 reduction in shares year-to-date and a 10% reduction of our share count this year.","I will now discuss guidance. Starting with revenue, we expect improvement in the four quarter, but considering current trends we now expect full year revenue will be down approximately 3% at a constant currency, in line with year-to-date results with Services flat to up 1%, and Document Technology down 6% to 7%. From a margin perspective in Doc Tech, we expect continued strong margins with quarter four and full year margins in the middle of our full year range of 11% to 13%. In Services, we anticipate sequential improvement and for margins to be approximately 9% in quarter four. So we are making progress in Services, but we do not expect to get to 8.5% margin for the full year. And for earnings, we expect quarter four adjusted EPS to be between $0.28 to $0.30 and for the full year we anticipate being at the low end of our previously guided range of $0.95 to $1.01.","Lastly, we expect free cash flow in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion with modestly lower operating cash flow of between $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion and CapEx that is now also expected to be lower. So in summary, for the third quarter we achieved adjusted earnings in line with our guidance, but we will \u2013 we have come through the 9-month point and we are not satisfied with our performance. We are sharpening our focus on execution across the enterprise. We continue to lead an aggressive agenda to strengthen our offering portfolio and target segments where we are best positioned to compete and differentiate. And across both services and technology we are prioritizing investments, taking actions to improve revenue and margin and managing cost in Doc Tech to maintain our profitability. And as previously mentioned we are reviewing structural options for the company\u2019s business portfolio on capital allocation with the goal of enhancing shareholder value. As we undertake this activity, we are focused on the execution of our strategy and remaining fully committed to our customers, partners, suppliers and employees and to delivering strong financial results.","Finally, before we go to Q&A as you know this is Kathy Mikells last earnings calls. I would like to thank Kathy for her financial leadership and contributions to Xerox during her time with us. Leslie Varon will be stepping in as the interim CFO, a position that she has held previously. Leslie has deep experience and great connections throughout the business, so I know we won\u2019t miss a beat on \u2013 with this transition.","With that, let me turn it over to Jennifer.","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks Ursula. Joining Ursula and Kathy today is Bob Zapfel, Head of our Services business, as well as Jeff Jacobson, Head of Technology. Also, let me point out that we have supplemental slides at the end of our deck. They provide more financial detail to support today\u2019s presentation and complement our prepared remarks. For the Q&A I would ask participants to limit follow-ons and multi-part questions so that we can get to everyone. At the end of our Q&A session, I will turn it back to Ursula for closing comments. Operator, please open the line for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Shannon Cross from Cross Research.","Shannon Cross","Thank you very much. Ursula, can you talk a bit \u2013 your Services and Doc Tech business have been under pressure for some time. So, I am curious as to what specifically is behind the decision to look at structural options. And as Chairman and CEO, can you talk a bit about what types of actions you would say would constitute a structural option?","Ursula Burns","Thank you, Shannon, for the question. The Board and the management, we look at the business portfolio at the company strategy on a continuous basis. We consider a range of opportunities regarding new business and the operations and it\u2019s always focused on increasing shareholder value. So, this type of activity, for example, led us to look at ITO and to divest of that and to take a fundamental change in our government healthcare strategy, particularly around health enterprise. So, the structural options that we are looking at, is both portfolio and capital allocation options and it\u2019s at an early stage. So, I really can\u2019t get into more details about that \u2013 about what is happening, because we haven\u2019t really progressed it that far.","Shannon Cross","And I guess what made the change like in your minds looking at how the business is \u2013 what made it happen or be announced at this quarter versus prior? Is there anything significant that changed or how did this sort of come about?","Ursula Burns","Yes, I think that the Board decided \u2013 and I am a member of the Board, obviously, the Chairman of the Board, we decided to make it public. We decided, as a group, to make it public. I think that the review process though is an important thing to keep in mind. It is a fairly broad-based review. It is not \u2013 one of the things that we have not \u2013 we are not currently considering is the sale of the company, but all other options are \u2013 will be looked at as we progress through this review. We are not going to actually speak a lot about timing of it. We are not going to make a lot more public statements about it. So, I understand that there is a lot of questions, but we have to kind of go through the process and we have to go through the process before we can say anything more.","Shannon Cross","Okay, thank you. And then just one other question, you have taken down 2015 cash flow guidance a bit given some of the pressures in emerging markets in that, how are you thinking about 2016 as we look forward? Sort of just maybe even if you can\u2019t give us specific high level puts and takes on how we should think about cash flow?","Ursula Burns","Let me start with the top line. Let me start with revenue and then I will turn it over to Kathy and myself to talk about cash flow. I think that we will see continued pressure in developing markets. I don\u2019t expect to see any turnaround there and maybe even a little bit more headwind than we have seen so far there. Doc Tech margins, we expect them to remain strong. We are going to do a whole review of what\u2019s happening in 2016 at our fourth quarter earnings call in January. So, these are just high level comments. Why don\u2019t you go into cash?","Kathy Mikells","Sure. And so other things I would just point to, currency has been a huge headwind for the company this year. If we had to call currency today, which by the way, we don\u2019t, but if we had to call it today, we would call it looking fairly neutral in 2016. Another driver overall of cash flow is pension and our approach there really hasn\u2019t changed. So, I wouldn\u2019t expect any kind of big changes year-over-year in terms of what we are trying to do in pension. And then obviously one of the big things that we have got to continue to execute on is just managing working capital. That was a particular headwind for us in this quarter and something that we would expect actually we would improve on as we get through our fourth quarter and something we will be very mindful of as we look forward to 2016. And then the last thing I would mention, Shannon, is we sold these pieces of our financing portfolio in 2012 and 2013. The impact of that diminishes over time. And so that gives us a little bit of a natural uplift in \u201816.","Ursula Burns","One last point, on the health enterprise charges that we took for \u201816 \u2013 actually for the fourth quarter and \u201816 we will have a little bit of headwind in revenue the first half of \u201816. It will reduce our volatility, which is one of the things that we really suffered from in 2015. So, that\u2019s the good news there and we should be able to see some improved profitability as these contracts were at a loss. That\u2019s the other thing we can see in \u201816.","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks, Shannon. Operator, next question.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray.","George Tong","Thanks. Good morning. First off, Kathy, we wish you well in your new endeavors.","Kathy Mikells","Thanks very much.","George Tong","I guess, Ursula, can you discuss whether you see strategic value in having the services business together with the Document Technology business?","Ursula Burns","The answer is that our \u2013 my position on that hasn\u2019t changed to date. And that\u2019s the strategy that we are executing on, which is, yes, we do see to-date strategic value in having these two businesses together. As you go through the review, that\u2019s one of the things that we will validate.","George Tong","Got it. And Bob, in the government healthcare space, can you give us an update on New Hampshire, Alaska, North Dakota and New York and what implementation milestones and costs might be coming up?","Bob Zapfel","Sure. So, the first three, New Hampshire, Alaska, and now North Dakota are all live. We went live in North Dakota, two weeks ago, early October. So, they are in operate mode, so we would not expect them to have new development expenses where we have had the unpredictability that been an issue in both California and Montana has been on new system build as opposed to operate. In New York, we are building the new system. As you will remember, the big difference with New York was it was bid after the move to \u2013 after the move to the system. We are already implemented in New Hampshire. So, we were not building from scratch. They were buying something that the health enterprise platform that we had built and we are still in the front end of that development, but optimistic that we will be able to drive that within the cost that we have modeled.","George Tong","Great, thank you.","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks, George. Operator, next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan.","Tien-tsin Huang","Great, thank you. Kathy, I also want to wish you the best in the next gig. I just want to I guess, Ursula, just obviously lots going on with the CFO transition and then you mentioned the review in the capital allocation and portfolio retrenching in government as well. I think you said you don\u2019t have a timetable, but I am curious how do you expect to \u2013 I guess, address and update us on some of these big items?","Ursula Burns","Yes, I think that any normal operational item, we will update you on quarter calls like we generally do. As far as the portfolio \u2013 business portfolio and capital allocation review that we don\u2019t intend to give updates to the process. So, we are not even sure. We are not even assuring that there will be any outcome of that process that\u2019s something that will make public. So, I think what we have to do is when we are ready to speak to you about it, if and when we will speak you about it business update, normal business and operational updates you will get \u2013 you get through interactions with us on a normal basis.","Tien-tsin Huang","And then timetable on the CFO transitioning, yes?","Ursula Burns","As far as the CFO transition goes, it\u2019s always unfortunate to see a CFO leave, particularly someone with the quality and caliber of Kathy. So, we are wishing her well as you guys do, but we are disappointed in that transition. The good news is that I have a compatriot who has been with me for \u2013 has been with me in this company for 30 years or more who has done this acting CFO thing once before. The community knows her outside the company. The community knows her and loves her inside the company. So, I don\u2019t expect miss a beat at all.","Jennifer Horsley","Great. Thanks, Tien-tsin. Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal.","Keith Bachman","Hi. I also want to start at the strategic level. If I think back about what\u2019s happened this year, the buyback has been call it over $1.3 billion and the M&A has been a couple of $100 million. And so the portfolio has actually decreased or it really hasn\u2019t increased through M&A and the company has been buying back aggressively on stock. And I am just wondering how you are thinking about that as you look forward. In other words, the stock really hasn\u2019t done much. It\u2019s down a little bit this year, down actually a decent amount, yet you have been buying back and really haven\u2019t added to the Services portfolio. I am not suggesting that you go out and buy aggressively at any price, but the capital allocation strategy combined with weak markets really hasn\u2019t seem to create value. And I am just wondering how you are positioning that as part of your strategic decision making process here as you look out over the next couple of months?","Ursula Burns","Yes. I think that for the remainder of this year as I said in my remarks, we don\u2019t expect to actually to complete any significant M&A at all. So I think where we are on M&A is where we are and we have already met \u2013 reached the share repurchase hurdle that we had set for the full year. So I think that both share repurchase and acquisitions, M&As kind of done for the year or maybe a little bit more.","Keith Bachman","Yes. I am thinking about more over the next 6 months to 12 months?","Ursula Burns","Yes. So let me go forward, I just wanted state that. Thank you, Keith. On a go forward basis, our strategy remains to return at least 50% of our available cash to shareholders and we will continue to do that through share repurchase and through dividends in 2016 as the current plans. We will update you more on that in the fourth quarter earnings in January. And as far as M&A, it\u2019s one of the integral pieces of the expansion of our Services business. And so we will continue to look for accretive tuck-in acquisitions in Services, particularly around the areas where we see differentiation and strength in transportation and commercial healthcare, these areas. So we will continue to look for M&A in 2016 and we will continue our return to shareholders strategy in 2016. If anything changes from that, we will update you when appropriate.","Keith Bachman","Okay. If I could just sneak in a follow-up then, as you think about strategic alternatives on the printing side of the business, is there more that could be done and more could have many definitions, but associated with your partner in Japan, Fuji to leverage that relationship?","Ursula Burns","I think that as we look at structural options for the company\u2019s business portfolio and capital allocation, we will look at all available levers there. I am sure the company will do that \u2013 the Board will do that.","Keith Bachman","Okay. Thank you. Best of luck.","Jennifer Horsley","Operator, next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex from Morgan Stanley.","Brian Essex","Good morning and thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if I could pose a question to Bob. I guess given the recent announcement that you are deciding to shorten the contract implementation dates for both California, Montana, I was wondering if you could maybe highlight a little bit what to expect on the margin front and how much shorter those contracts could potentially be. And I guess what I am getting at is realizing that you have an operational overhang as you are implementing those contracts, might we see a little bit better margins sooner and what might that timeframe be once those contract implementation processes end?","Bob Zapfel","Yes. Look, if I can all start first by explaining kind of where we are in both California and Montana and then I will try to be on point with the question. So really in both states, we and they, this was a mutual process, looked ahead and said, given everything that it changed in terms of what they would want and where we were on the development that there was still a long way to go and it was better to kind of call inaudible [ph] than continue to kind of develop the systems. So what \u2013 and they and we were with those and for us to stay in a substantive long-term role as a fiscal agent operator, which is the primary component of our operating revenue in both states. Now, what that will mean to us going forward is we will have as Ursula briefly mentioned, we will have some revenue pressure. It\u2019s about a point on the Services segment revenue dynamics for the next three quarters. And it was also roughly a point \u2013 not quite, but roughly a point last quarter. So that\u2019s a little bit of downside. The upside is that we had been very unpredictable. As you know, our Services margins have not been \u2013 we have not been as consistent as we need to be because we have been recognizing more costs to development would kind of hit the period I&E because of percentage of completion accounting. So because of the change that we have made with them, we expect to take that unpredictability out of our model. And we should have year-to-year improvements in 2016 because we were losing money, but we are not already laying out next year\u2019s segment model until the January earnings call. So sorry about the long answer, but hopefully that\u2019s\u2026","Brian Essex","Okay. No, that\u2019s very helpful. And so if I were to take California and Montana contracts, is there any way to outline the revised timeline for those contracts, it sounds like California ending after stage two, is that relatively close. And then Montana, I know that was a pretty far away completion timeframe?","Bob Zapfel","Both of them from a \u2013 again, separate the new system development from the ongoing operations. The ongoing operations, we expect to have for an extended period. The new system development in both cases will be inside 12 months and maybe inside a much shorter period of time.","Ursula Burns","Right. And the financial implications of that, Brian is that have been comprehended in the charge that we took in a couple of weeks ago. So we are \u2013 we have kind of captured towards the best of our ability and knowledge of the financials, including the balance sheet impacts. We did that in \u2013 a couple of weeks ago. And we will then implement that \u2013 the end of that, those development activities with the states in the next couple of quarters or so. Yes.","Brian Essex","Right.","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks Brian. Operator, next question.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citigroup.","Jim Suva","Thanks very much. I have two questions and I will just mention them at the same time. So first of all, on the announcement you made about the Board of Directors of authorizing review, can you confirm that it\u2019s just your Board of Directors internal doing it or did you hire somebody external or plan to external. And the reason why I ask this isn\u2019t the Board of Directors supposed to always review the company\u2019s business and capital allocation. And so if it\u2019s internal, you kind of really wonder what type of meaning this information is. Second question is \u2013 the follow-up is, during this review process, does your stock buyback or capital allocation, you put on hold until you get the conclusion of it? Thank you very much.","Ursula Burns","As far as your first statement about the Board\u2019s interaction with strategy development etcetera, etcetera. You are correct that this is a continuous activity with the Board. This is \u2013 they have talked \u2013 we have talked about it all the time with the Board, our strategy and as well as our operations. This \u2013 we have told you that what we are doing here is we are looking at structural options for the business portfolio and capital allocation is something that they always do. We have just decided to announce this to you this time and we are not disclosing any advisors with you, if we have advisors of who they are.","Jennifer Horsley","Great. Thanks Jim. Operator, next question.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah from Brean Capital.","Ananda Baruah","Hi guys. Thank you for taking the question and Kathy, good luck in your future endeavors. I guess, really I have a question and a quick follow-up. Really for Ursula and Bob, I guess in the context of how you talked about your capital allocation going forward, but given also the new context about looking at strategic options. Philosophically, how do guys think about doing not tuck-ins, but larger Services deals. And it sounds like you are going to have the $700 million left over after capital allocation of generative cash annually to do deals, I don\u2019t know that that could get you without levering up something significant. But clearly, there is some sort of intent behind making this announcement the way that you guys have announced it. So, I\u2019d love to just get your thoughts on philosophically your view on making the larger services deals. And then really, I would love to get your broader take on did you really what you think that actually is necessary given the fragmented nature for the BPO market, I will actually just leave it there. That will be my question. Thanks.","Ursula Burns","Okay, great. By the way, I didn\u2019t answer the second part of Jim\u2019s question, which is basically the first part of your question, so sorry, Jim and Ananda I will capture that. Our capital for this year, we have essentially completed our share repurchase activities. We have \u2013 as I said earlier and we are still active in the market in M&A, but we have a pipeline and that pipeline doesn\u2019t lead to anything significant for the remainder of this year. So, from a capital allocation on those two items, I think that we are really pretty much settled. CapEx, we talked about the fact that it\u2019s coming in a little bit lighter that will help us \u2013 we are focused on remaining investment grade that\u2019s one of the things that you know that we think that we need for both our services and tech business and we will continue to make sure that we manage our capital to assure that we fall inside there. That\u2019s one.","Second is the fragmented nature of the services market and our, therefore, M&A activities for the future. I mean one of the things that we will continue to need to do in the services business is to consolidate some of this fragmentation, particularly in areas that we have strength and I would suspect \u2013 I would plan to and you should expect that we will continue to do that type of activity as we go forward in the business as usual kind of a manner. I didn\u2019t quite get to the $700 million that you got to, because we haven\u2019t quite done 2016 yet, which I think is what you were looking towards when you were making those numbers those projections, Ananda, but as I said earlier, I don\u2019t think that we see in the business as usual, a lot of change in returning value to shareholders to an M&A structure that continues to strengthen our services business and to a debt structure that allows us to remain capital investment grade. So, those are the three kind of tenants that we are sitting on right now and that\u2019s why I intend to come out as well. We will see if there is anything that changes as we go forward. We will tell you about it, but it won\u2019t be before January \u2013 the January call. I hope I answered everything that you had. It was kind of a long question. I hope I got all of it.","Ananda Baruah","It was. But that was very helpful, Ursula. I guess just one quick follow-up is, do you think you can accomplish the kind of I guess consolidation in those key BPO areas that you want to continuing with sort of the small tuck-in approach as opposed to stepping into doing some larger deals and getting some bigger scales? That will be it. Thanks.","Ursula Burns","Yes, I think \u2013 it\u2019s something that \u2013 it\u2019s a great question, Ananda and it\u2019s one that it\u2019s going to be hard to answer, not for any reason except that we have been trying to do the small tuck-ins and we find some good ones and they come when they come. We compete for them and we win some. You saw iPas and RSA this last quarter and we will continue to try to push on that area. We still have the same disciplined approach. We have a great kind of re-op in that approach with the hiring of a great executive who is kind of M&A expert. So, we will continue to look at that type of M&A for sure. And then when we look in that type of M&A, if we find something that\u2019s even more exciting, we are not going to close our eyes to it, but that\u2019s not \u2013 we are not looking for massive companies to buy. We are trying to actually stay in the ranges that we have been talking about, little bit bigger than small, but definitely smaller than large.","Bob Zapfel","And trying to stay where we are really looking at the places where we think we are advantaged, so that we are not looking broadly across the whole BPO portfolio. But on a select set of areas where we think we can even further differentiate the firm for our clients.","Ursula Burns","One of the areas that we didn\u2019t get into at all, but I think it\u2019s good to bring up now is that we are heavily concentrated. We have a heavy concentration and strength in customer care and in call center operations. And we have a problem right now with the business mix. It\u2019s one of the challenges that we had in the third quarter and that we are working hard to try to overcome as we go forward. As we mix more towards customer care it\u2019s a lower margin business. We are trying to mix up towards more \u2013 towards higher margin, more innovative solutions while we try to actually innovate in customer care. So, the reason why I bring it up is our M&A strategy is going to be towards these types of areas where the margins are stronger, where we don\u2019t continue to \u2013 where we want to stay leader in our customer care. We don\u2019t want to walk away from that business. But we just are not selling enough of the higher margin businesses \u2013 business areas and that\u2019s one of the things that we have to fix and we haven\u2019t quite cracked that nut yet. So, we are going to continue to acquire in those areas, so that we can actually move away from the more commodity-based customer care implementations.","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks, Ananda. Operator, I think we have time for one last question.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question for today comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha from Credit Suisse. Mr. Garcha, your line is open. Could you check your mute button please? He has not responded.","Jennifer Horsley","Alright. So, that\u2019s it. We will wrap up. Thanks for your interest. Ursula, anything more to wrap up.","Ursula Burns","Yes. I just want to close with a thank you for listening. And while the third quarter adjusted earnings were in line with our expectations, we know that we have a lot of work to do. I talked about some of the areas, mix is one. We have to make sure we manage our cash well for the remainder of the year and we will be focused on that. So, thank you for joining our call today.","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks, Ursula. That concludes our call today. If you have further questions, please contact me or any member of our Investor Relations team.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect.

She is joined by Kathy Mikells, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com\/investor.","At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and\/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without express permission of Xerox. [Operator Instructions]","During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which by their nature, address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein.","At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns, you may begin.","Ursula M. Burns","Good morning, and thanks for joining our call. Today, we're reporting our fourth quarter earnings that are largely in line with the expectations that we communicated last quarter. We managed the anticipated impact of headwinds in a handful of businesses while we continue to build in the areas of strength and future profits.","Let's begin with the review of the strategy. Our shift to a services-led company requires us to constantly enhance our offerings and deliver unique Xerox solutions to our customers. They partner with us because we help them take the complexities out of their business processes. For example, we're simplifying services in government health care with Enterprise, our system for Medicaid. And we're creating smart parking solutions like Merge, a real-time analysis-based technology that addresses urban parking challenges.","Our Managed Print Services have been awarded highest honors for global market leadership by industry analyst firms, a distinction that validates the strength of our Document Outsourcing business. In our Services business, we are continuing with the implementation of the 5-plank strategy that we reviewed at the November investor conference, which includes improving our cost structure while supporting investments in areas where we see opportunity and differentiated benefits for our customers. We're maintaining our leadership in Document Technology and effectively managing this profitable business with strong cash characteristics.","With a robust portfolio, we're capturing market share with new products like ConnectKey. We're transforming the Graphic Communications business with new workflow and digital automation services and we're growing our channels operation to expand our reach to small and medium businesses.","And across both segments, Services and Technology, we have a keen focus on profitability. Delivering on these strategies will enable consistent earnings expansion and strong cash flow, which we are committed to deploy in a balanced way that will enhance shareholder value.","Here is a closer look at Q4 results. We reported adjusted EPS of $0.29 and GAAP EPS of $0.25, with the difference being the amortization of intangible assets. Total revenues were down with Services flat, as the student loan runoff continued and we saw no benefit from acquisitions in our revenue. Services operating margin was lower than we planned. And although they were driven by known issues, which is an area where we need to make more structural progress, is a constant focus for us.","Services signings were up 20% for the year, BPO and ITO renewal rates were at 92% and above our target range of 85% to 90%, both positive results that position us well for 2014.","In Document Technology, revenue stabilized with positive results in Global Imaging and Graphic Communications, offsetting weaknesses in developing markets and Europe. Segment margins remained strong and above our target range, reflecting strong cost management and expense management.","In total, operating margin was down 130 basis points year-over-year. A decline in margin was anticipated, given known headwinds, but nonetheless emphasizes why we are undertaking our margin improvement strategy in our continued need for a disciplined focus on operational excellence.","Cash flow from operations came in at the high end of the full year range and we ended the year with $700 million of share repurchases. As we look to 2014, I'm pleased with the strategy that we've got in place to expand earnings. I'm confident that we have all that it takes to move our business forward and deliver value to our shareholders.","With that, let me turn it over to Kathy, then I'll wrap up and we'll open up the call for questions.","Kathryn A. Mikells","Thanks, Ursula. And good morning, everyone. Much of Q4 played out as we expected, with the exception of Services margin, where we had more work to do. We hit our EPS and cash flow guidance and got a bit more done on share repurchases.","We feel good about the continued positive trends in leading indicators, our strong cash flow and the progress we're making implementing our Services initiative to accelerate growth and improve margin in 2014.","Let's start with a look at overall earnings. Revenue was down 3% or 4% at constant currency, with Services flat year-over-year or down 1% at constant currency and Document Technology down 6%. For the full year, Services was up 3% and Document Technology was down 6%.","Document Technology declines were roughly in line with the full year and Services revenue growth decelerated as we faced a number of known headwinds that we guided to last quarter. Gross margin of 30.7% declined 130 basis points year-over-year, driven by a continued pressure on Services margin from startup of health care platform projects, student loan runoff as well as from volume declines, with higher pension settlement costs impacting primarily Document Technology.","Our ongoing productivity initiatives drove improvements in RD&E and SAG, in line with the decline in revenue. This resulted in operating margin of 9.3%, down 130 basis points year-over-year, consistent with the decline in gross margin.","Adjusted other net was $96 million, down $74 million year-over-year. There's a couple of drivers here. Within OID, there's a gain of $29 million associated with the sale of a portion of our Wilsonville, Oregon asset and product development resources. This was a win-win arrangement that enabled us to right-size our resources and further strengthen our 17-year relationship with 3D Systems.","Notably, we retained our intellectual property, as well as capabilities in ink and print head development. The gain enabled us to do a greater level of restructuring in the quarter, with restructuring of $56 million coming in about $20 million higher than what we originally guided to and $35 million lower year-over-year.","Our adjusted tax rate of 24.5% was in line with our guidance and modestly higher year-over-year. Adjusted EPS of $0.29 was down $0.01 from 2012 and in the middle of our guidance range of $0.28 to $0.30.","So in summary, we were pleased to deliver our EPS guidance but need to make more progress to fully overcome near-term headwinds and deliver sustainable earnings expansion.","With that, I'll move to the Services segment slide to review in more detail the drivers there. Services revenue growth was flat with Document Outsourcing up 4%, ITO up 2% and BPO down 3%. Growth rates have decelerated and are playing out as we expected, with Document Outsourcing showing stable mid-single-digit growth and ITO growth tapering, consistent with the slowdown in signings.","BPO growth has temporarily gone negative, reflecting no inorganic contributions, the toughest compare for student loans, as well as lower volumes than anticipated in customer care. We expect Q1 to show modest improvement in growth, driven by BPO. As compares improve, signings continue to ramp and we begin to see some inorganic contribution.","Signings in Q4 were once again positive, with new business signings up 5%. Total contract value for all signings was flat due to less renewal opportunity in the quarter compared to the prior year. BPO total contract value was up 28% in the quarter, with strong growth in health care payer, health care provider, finance and accounting, as well as in Europe. For the year, BPO also had strong signings, with new business up 9%.","Document Outsourcing overall signings were weaker in Q4 due to less renewal opportunities, but new business signings were up 1% and for the year were up 23%.","ITO had lower signings as we continue to see trends toward smaller contract sizes and our focus remains executing on previous large deals and improving our margin. Renewal rate was also positive at 92% in Q4 and full year, which was 7 points higher than the full year 2012. Our new business signings, combined with our strong renewal rate, yielded total contract value growth of 21% for the year. The leading indicators are strong coming into 2014.","Shifting to profitability. Segment margin was 9.6% in Q4, down 160 basis points year-over-year and a little lower than the roughly 10% we were targeting. The year-over-year drivers were largely anticipated, reflecting the effect of student loan runoff which peaks this quarter and caused us 60 basis points on margin and 1.5 points on revenue. It continued pressure from our new government health care Medicaid platform and health care exchanges and volume pressure in wireless customer care. That said, margin was a little lower than expected as a result of technology customer care volumes ramping up slower than forecasted and health care platform expenses coming in above our original forecast, as we've had to put even more resources towards improving our operational performance there.","At the same time, we're in the early stage of implementing our 5-plank strategy in Services that we had outlined at our November investor conference. We expect benefits from these actions to build throughout 2014, improving trends in revenue growth and margin.","Turning to Q1 guidance. We expect a modest improvement in Services revenue growth to approximately 1%. Our margin will be seasonally lower and we expect it to be at about the same level as the prior year margin of 9.3%.","For the full year, we continue to expect at least a 50-basis-point margin improvement, with the greatest improvement coming in the second half of the year as near-term margin pressure dissipates and the impact of our margin improvement actions accelerate.","I'll now turn to Document Technology. Revenue in Document Technology was down 6% at both actual and constant currency for both the fourth quarter and the full year. Equipment sales revenue was down 4% year-over-year in Q4, as relative strength in the U.S. and mid-range and high-end was more than offset by weakness in developing markets.","The price revenue also declined in Q4 and was down 9%, with almost 1\/2 of the decline the result of actions that we took to reduce channel inventories. Additionally, our previous finance receivable transactions negatively impact annuity revenue growth.","High-end continued to perform well and had positive equipment revenue growth in the quarter as Color growth more than offset the Mono decline. We are gaining share in this segment and expect that positive momentum to continue.","Mid-range had another solid install activity quarter. We had seen strong activity growth for the ConnectKey class of products since launching it last year and we continue to receive very positive customer and industry feedback.","Finally, entry revenue was weak, driven by the continued weakness in developing markets, as well as the impact of channel inventory reduction. Overall, Document Technology margin was quite strong at 11.7% and although down 60 basis points year-over-year, reflected the ongoing benefits from cost and efficiency savings and a currency benefit from the weak yen.","The 2 drivers of the margin decline were lower gains from finance receivable sales and higher pension settlement expense. On an absolute basis, this quarter's finance receivable transactions resulted in a $15 million gain, contributing 60 basis points to Technology segment margin. However, the gain was $6 million lower year-over-year.","Higher pension settlements activity resulted in $36 million in higher expense for the company, the majority of which is in Document Technology. So overall, in-line performance for Document Technology for the quarter. Looking to Q1, we expect Document Technology to have revenue down mid-single digits and margins up year-over-year.","With that, let's turn to cash flow. Cash flow from operations was at the high end of guidance, with close to $1 billion generated in Q4 and $2.4 billion for the year. Free cash flow was $1.9 billion for the year, with CapEx of $427 million.","Our cash flow results include a net benefit from finance receivable sales of approximately $130 million in Q4 and $300 million for the year, resulting in underlying cash flow from operations of $2.1 billion for the year, which compares to underlying cash flow of $2 billion in 2012.","The $100 million year-over-year improvement was mainly due to lower pension funding as working capital was roughly flat for the year. It should be noted that working capital timing was purposefully smoothed out in 2013 and thus, we have less of a benefit in Q4 than prior years.","Looking to 2014, we're maintaining our operating cash flow guidance of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion. This reflects our expectation of no finance receivable sales, with underlying cash flow of $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion. The drivers of underlying improvement include Services EBITDA growth as well as working capital gains. Consistent with our normal seasonality, we expect Q1 operating cash flow to be the lowest of the year, with forces roughly offsetting uses.","Moving down the cash flow statement. Investing cash flows were a $53 million use in the quarter. We spent $111 million on CapEx and had proceeds of $33 million from the 3D Systems transaction and $15 million from the Europe paper deal. We had no acquisitions in the fourth quarter and spent $155 million on acquisitions for the year.","As previously communicated, acquisition spend was tracking below our full year plan of $300 million to $500 million. In December, we announced the Invoco acquisition, which expands our European customer care presence, but it just closed last week so it will be in our Q1 results.","Cash from financing was a use of $100 million and included the issuance of $500 million in senior notes, $71 million in common dividend and $524 million in share repurchases, which put the full year repurchases total at approximately $700 million and resulted in a 36 million net reduction in shares for the year.","Moving to the next slide, I'll walk through our capital structure and capital allocation plan for 2014. We ended the year with $8 billion in debt, which is $500 million higher than our September ending balance, driven by our early December $500 million senior note offering. Given attractive rates, the offering was $200 million higher than originally planned, which will prefund a portion of the roughly $1.1 billion senior notes that comes to maturity in May of this year.","Applying 7:1 leverage on financing assets, our allocated financing debt is $4.4 billion, leaving core debt of $3.6 billion. Our financing debt continued to decline, driven by the finance receivable transaction and lower originations.","Our capital allocation plan is as follows: on debt, in light of the $200 million prefunding, we expect to refinance about $900 million of the $1.1 billion in debt that comes due in May; on share repurchase, we continue to plan to do at least $500 million in 2014 and expect those repurchases to be more evenly spaced through the year; on acquisitions, we expect to spend up to $500 million. With the recent Invoco acquisition, we're off to a better start than in 2013 and I feel good about the quality and progression of the deals in our pipeline. And finally, for dividends, we're announcing today a 9% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.0625 per share. This will result in spend of approximately $300 million, which is only modestly higher year-over-year, as share repurchases have served to help self-fund the increase.","Strong 2013 operating cash flow, combined with the lower level of acquisition spend and larger December debt offering, resulted in a year-end cash position in excess of $1.7 billion, providing upside to our capital allocation plan.","So in summary, we enter 2014 on solid footing. Document Technology is performing well, with stabilized revenue declines, a strong market position and continued good profitability and cash flow. In Services, we're well underway in implementing our 5-plank strategy that includes not only cost initiatives but also active portfolio management to drive growth and direct investments towards our higher-margin, more differentiated offerings. And we feel good about our cash position, cash flow and ability to continue to drive shareholder return through balanced capital allocation.","Looking at Q1, at a consolidated level, we expect revenue will still be somewhat pressured and down low single-digits, with Document Technology down mid-single digits and services growth modestly improving to roughly 1%. And for margin, we anticipate it will be seasonally lower, with Services roughly flat and Document Technology up year-over-year. As a result, we expect earnings per share of $0.23 to $0.25 for the first quarter, which includes approximately $0.01 for restructuring.","With that, I'll hand it back to you, Ursula.","Ursula M. Burns","Thanks, Kathy. Our performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year reflected our ability to deliver bottom line results while we continued working to strengthen our operational delivery capabilities for the long term.","Services signings are growing as we continue to win in the marketplace and strive to differentiate our offerings to deliver state-of-the-art platforms and innovative world-class solutions to customers around the world.","On Document Technology, business is stable. We're gaining market share, we're keeping cost down and we're delivering advanced products in key areas of the printing industry. Both of these contribute to a healthy annuity stream that will benefit our long-term performance.","Throughout 2014, our focus will be on executing our Services strategy. This strategy is designed to promote revenue growth and improve margins. We continue to plan for at least 50 basis points of margin improvement in the Services segment. We'll capitalize on the most advantaged segments of the Document Technology business to maintain our leadership position in the industry. And we'll continue to deliver healthy cash flow during the dynamics of our attractive recurring revenue business model.","With this in mind, we are reaffirming our 2014 guidance and we announced today a $0.02 increase in our annual dividend rate to $0.25 a share. I'm confident that we have the right strategy, the competitive strength, the dedicated workforce and the disciplined focus on execution to build on our progress.","Thank you. And now, I'll turn it over to Jim.","James H. Lesko","Thanks, Ursula. Also, let me point out that we have several supplemental slides at the end of our deck. They provide more financial detail to support today's presentation and complement our prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] At the end of our Q&A session, I'll turn it back to Ursula for closing comments.","Operator, please open the line for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citi.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","A quick question on the Services. It sounds like that you had to invest a little bit more for the health care. If indeed that is correct, if you can confirm it. And I assume it was probably just you wanted to make sure it pulled off without any bumps. And that being said, can you let us know going forward, it sounds like the 50 basis points improvement is still indeed intact. As we look forward to 2014 in the Services areas, are there any more roll-offs or headwinds? I know student loans, I think, is going to impact by about 25 basis points, but anything else like more renewals, more large contracts, more that could impact pricing? Or do you pretty much have a pretty firm grasp on what's going on with the Services now as 2014 rolls out?","Ursula M. Burns","I'll start with the health care investments and then I'll turn it over to Kathy for the -- to answer the rest. Health care, you are correct. We actually made a conscious necessary decision to invest more particularly in the roll-off of the health exchange -- of our health exchange platform in the state that we are heavily involved in, that's one investment. We had already expected, which we actually communicated last quarter, to invest a little bit more, but we actually went even beyond that to assure that we respond to any needs that the clients in the state had. We'll continue to do that. I think it will be less necessary as we go forward, if you know what I mean. We're at a level I don't think we have to go very much above. This is an area that for quarter four we made sure that we didn't step -- we didn't fall any further behind and that we actually serve the client on the ground very well. Kathy will talk about the 50 basis points in additional headwinds.","Kathryn A. Mikells","And so, Jim, at this point, I think we have our headwinds very well understood and recognized. And if you look at where we had guided to a quarter ago and talking about what impacts we thought we were going to see, I think we were roughly in line there with the only additional pressure that we saw, really, as Ursula just mentioned and as you mentioned, looking to put more resources behind, standing up successfully those health care platform implementations that we had.","If I look at the progression for improving 50 basis points in 2014, as we talked about on our investor conference, it's naturally back-end loaded as you look at the known pressures and how those known pressures will dissipate during the course of the year. So a good example of that is I've mentioned that as a result of the implementation of our new Enterprise MMIS platform, we're drawing amortization now. We will lap that beginning in the second quarter and so that year-over-year impact in pressure will start to dissipate.","With respect to student loan, right, which caused 60 basis points of the pressure in the quarter and 1.5 points of pressure on revenue, when we get to the fourth quarter of next year, we actually lap the government piece of that business just going away. And in terms of that margin pressure, you're absolutely correct. It lightens up year-over-year. And again, that's a little bit more back half end loaded, which is why you're going to see the progression of our margin improvement throughout the year.","And I'd say similarly in terms of the pressure we're seeing on revenue, we feel great about forward indicators and our ramp, basically bringing BPO revenue growth coming back kind of beginning towards the end of the first quarter and then building into the year. So that gives you a little bit on the puts and takes for what we think the progression is going to look like.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Great. And as a follow-up, for this year, any both size or quantity of renewals coming up we should be aware of? Like more than last year or any potential, Hey, in Q3, we have a lot more than normal or 5 mega deals coming up for renewal. Anything we should just be aware of, conscious of for 2014?","Kathryn A. Mikells","So yes, the only thing that I would flag is we had a really strong first quarter of 2013 in terms of total signings. I think the number is $3.7 billion. And so we have a tough compare in the first quarter. But there's really nothing else going on in that. I spoke to, a little bit in my prepared remarks, the overall kind of composition in terms of mix. One of the things that we talked about at our investor conference was really a focus on improving mix, both taking resources and making sure that we're adequately putting resources where we have high-margin business.","We're trying to accelerate growth, data analytics obviously being a component of that continued innovation. But as you look at kind of the mix of new business and as you look at the overall mix of signings, it is skewing towards places where we do have high margins. And so that, again, over the course of the year, is going to help us to actually mix up.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross from Cross Research.","Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC","So my first question is on restructuring. I mean, you took over $100 million of the restructuring charges this year -- or, I guess, in '13. You're planning on taking, I think, at least that amount in '14, probably. What -- can you give us an idea of exactly where those dollars are focused, how we're seeing the benefit even if not necessarily in margins because of other things that are going on within the business, but if you can just sort of give us an idea of what you sort of focus on in '13 and how you're going to shift the dollars and focus in '14? So we get an idea of sort of what support level might be behind some of the margin improvement.","Kathryn A. Mikells","Sure. I'll speak to the fourth quarter in terms of the restructuring we did in the fourth quarter. A fair amount of that was targeted towards the U.S., targeted towards back office. And then we're starting to see more restructuring within Services and expect that as we progress into 2014, in part associated with looking to shift a greater percentage of our total labor base towards low-cost countries.","On the technology side of the business, restructuring is really normal course. It is what we have to continue to do in responding to the overall pressure of that business to ensure that we're maintaining strong margin. And so I feel really good about what we see coming in on the bottom line as a result of that restructuring. And that is a good portion of the total dollars that we spend because restructuring is more expensive on the technology side of the business than it is on the services side of the business. But we will continue to see that.","And when we talked about it at the investor conference, we said that we expect to have at least as much restructuring in 2014 as 2013. And obviously, we've guided to $0.01 of restructuring expected right now in the first quarter. We did a little bit more restructuring in the fourth quarter. We started out with guidance of $0.02, we ended up doing $0.03. But that's going to continue and we feel good about the savings that, that drives.","Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC","Okay, great. And then, Ursula, maybe if you can talk a bit about what's going on within both technology and DO in terms of underlying trends. It sounds like U.S. is relatively stable but emerging markets are weakening. Your low-end printers were under pressure but you had strength in color. So if you can just frame sort of what you're hearing from your customers, what specifically is going on, why annuity was down 6%? Anything you can provide there would be helpful.","Ursula M. Burns","Yes, let me give you a -- thanks, Shannon. Let me give you a kind of run around the world from a technology standpoint and then by the line of business, and then I'll give you a wrap-up on services. What we're seeing in the U.S. in enterprise accounts is a little bit of uptick, a little bit of uptick, primarily focused around our Document Outsourcing offering. If you look at the signings there, we are seeing no signings, U.S. signings increase. And I think that's a little bit of a bright spot for us.","We still have to stand them all up, implement them, et cetera. So and then in small- and medium-sized businesses in the U.S., we're seeing a pickup, and that's primarily because of our partner in print services as well and also because we have an unbelievable channel there, a channel that's doing extremely well and taking share, that's our Global Imaging business. So U.S., pretty much par for the course, fairly normal and working very well in technology and fairly well in services.","Europe, you may see a twinkle of light in certain areas, but it's pretty much the same. Business, we haven't seen a significant change in the European marketplace, up or down, throughout 2013. And our outlook for 2014 is pretty much the same. We are going to increase our focus on operationalizing some of the cost reductions that we have there. Some of the restructuring that we have is focused on that area, counting on the fact that we're not going to have a big upturn in the economy. We're just going to continue to drive through efficiencies, so we can keep our profitability in that portion of the market strong.","Developing economies is the place that we saw, primarily Russia and Eastern Europe, are the places that we saw a significant change in trend quarter 3 to quarter 4 significantly. We saw a change in trend quarter 3 to quarter 4. Some of that was driven by us. We literally, as we've talked about in the third quarter change and try to drive down our channel inventory actually to protect ourselves to make sure that we actually don't leave a lot of things stranded in the channel. So we've moved down our channel inventory, which dampened our revenue. But also we saw just market weakness in Russia and Eastern Europe. It's a big market for us, it's a very profitable market for us. We are still very successful there, but just the general overall market activity is lower there.","In Services, we are seeing strength in signings in Europe, which is a good leading indicator for us. We started to sign more in Europe, signings are up about -- over 20% in Europe, which is really good. We have a good base. We put in place some activities a year ago, a little bit more than a year ago and they're starting to come to fruition. And the rest of the globe is pretty much normal from a Services standpoint.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Barclays.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I wanted to ask about what some of the positives could be to margins during the year. Is there an incremental benefit you're going to see on the cost side from the yen? And can we also just talk a little bit about, on the Services side, a little bit more the timing when the -- when like student loan reverses and then what quarters that could be a year-over-year benefit and whatnot? We talked about some of the hits, I think, in detail in the beginning of the year and if we could talk about the positives as we flow through, that would be helpful in both divisions.","Kathryn A. Mikells","And so overall in terms of just positive impacts on margin, one of the things I talked about at the November investor conference was an expectation that we were actually going to get some relief on the pension side of the house. So I mentioned that pension settlement expenses were up $36 million in the fourth quarter. And a big part of that cost was we printed the discount rate that's used to determine people's pension benefits in August and that was sort of -- I'll call it a blip of an upturn in August. And so that caused people rightfully, who are trying to I say optimize their economics to choose to take their pension at the lower discount rate in December.","And so we had a lot more activity in terms of people coming into what I call the cash register to cash out their pension towards the end of the year. So we continue to expect we're going to get margin uplift in terms of just overall lower pension expense next year. We also expect that we'll get some benefit in terms of yen flowing through to gross margin in the technology business. It's going to be, I'd say, not quite to the same degree as we got this year.","In total this year, we got about a $60 million benefit. We expect that next year is probably going to be roughly $40 million. So those are some upsides. And then as you just talk about other activity that's going to assist us in margin, the slowing of ITO growth relative to BPO growth over the course of the year helps us to naturally mix up.","The signings that we're now ramping up and implementing are more heavily weighted towards higher-margin businesses. So if I went back to the bubble chart that I talked about at the November investor conference, those bubbles that are -- they're naturally higher-margin businesses starting to pick up a higher gross rate as a result of positive signings activity. So those are some of the puts and takes.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. On the buyback side, too, is that more front-end loaded? Maybe you said that. I am sorry if I missed it.","Kathryn A. Mikells","Yes, I said today and I certainly said at the investor conference, we have an expectation to do share repurchases throughout the year, right? If you looked at our activity in 2013, we did a little bit in the third quarter and then we did a whole lot in the fourth quarter and that isn't exactly what we would like to see. So we're already repurchasing shares this year. To date, as we sit here today, we've done about $45 million worth of share repurchases. But what you should see is more of a steady progression over the course of the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman from Bank of Montr\u00e9al.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I have 2 questions. The first is on a scene we've brought up before and it's labeled, \"consistency in services.\" So it doesn't seem like it's changed much, in that your Analyst Day was on November 12 and you talked about 10% operating margins there and it came in at 9.6%. And then I don't think any investors saw it during the quarter, certainly from leaving that meeting or any time during the quarter, that Services revenue growth would be down 1% in constant currency for the quarter. So my question is what is Xerox doing to improve the consistency, particularly of the Services when -- you have 45 days left in the quarter, I think investors would generally say that they're disappointed with the performance of Services relative to the message communicated at the investor event.","Kathryn A. Mikells","So a couple of things. I'd start with we said that we thought we'd get to roughly 10% margin for the quarter. At Investor Day, I said I thought full year would be anywhere between 9.8% and 10% for the full year. We're obviously at the low end of that. And we actually guided to Services overall revenue being about flat for the quarter and so it was flat on an actual basis. So we're little bit off, I would say. I wouldn't say that we're a lot off.","And overall in terms of the trajectory as we go forward, there is a lot that we are changing to improve the overall trajectory of Services. But there's a number of things that are one-time, right? And not, I say on a long-term basis, systemic to the business. So when you look at the revenue pressure that we're currently facing, student loan and the reduction in wireless coming largely from a single customer account that was very large is a temporary transitional issue. Similarly, M&A, which last year in the fourth quarter, gave us 2 points of revenue and this quarter gave us nothing and starting to now see that activity pick up this year, is again a transitory issue.","If we look at what we're doing in terms of executing our 5-plank Services strategy, I'd say our forward indicators look good in terms of improving our mix in business kind of clearly starts part of that strategy. M&A is off to a better start. We've got a very keen granular focus and higher level of engagement in terms of really managing the KPIs around the strategy execution.","We're continuing right now to put more resources behind areas of growth. A great example would be WDS, which we've talked about does analytics in our customer care telecom space, investing more there, more heavily in R&D in order to build additional platforms so that we can go into additional verticals. So I'd say we're doing a whole lot in terms of really actively managing our strategic execution to ensure that we get the improving trajectory that we talked about in 2014.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. Well, that relates to my follow-up, Kathy. And at Analyst Day, you had talked about growth in '14 of 0% to 2% consolidated. And I just want to revisit on your conviction around those numbers. But as part of that, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about how we should be thinking about M&A contributing to that number. And specifically if you could talk about how much the deal that you already completed will help in the March quarter?","Kathryn A. Mikells","So the deal that we completed, I'll give you what we spent on the deal and then I'll help you to roughly size it. It was a $60 million deal. With regard to the overall trajectory of M&A, we're starting from 0, right? We obviously expect the positive contribution and we expect that to ramp over the course of the year.","We have a fair amount of conviction about not continuing to underspend in M&A, with a focus and discipline around ensuring that we do high-quality good deals that are going to drive good returns for our shareholders. So we feel good about that and making sure that we're focused strategically. And that we're looking at deals where we're going to have synergies to help us be more competitive on price pressure. Our pipeline continues to be pretty robust as well, kind of up mid- to high single-digits. And so we feel good about the leading indicators in Services.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray.","George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","So yes, I saw some fairly healthy metrics in the Services segment over the past 12 months around signings and retention rates and in pipeline growth, particularly in the BPO segment. So looking out in 2014, what areas are you targeting in terms of penetrating growth opportunities? And how should those metrics translate into Services revenue performance?","Kathryn A. Mikells","And so if you look at services revenue performance and the fact that we were, on an actual basis on top line, flat for this quarter, guiding to about 1% growth. In the first quarter, we're expecting to see a positive progression from there as we continue to ramp up the positive signing numbers that you referenced, as well as start to pick up on M&A activity with one deal already over the finish line right now.","And as I mentioned earlier, the composition of the new business that we've been booking and if you look at the composition of total signings, it's really skewing more towards higher-margin businesses, which should start to give us some tailwind as opposed to a headwind in terms of overall margin. So payer provider overall, retail, federal government, U.S. transportation, these are all businesses that are already at very good margin. And the fact that those growth rates should increase relative to other businesses like ITO, as an example, really should help us in overall margins.","One of the things that I mentioned at Investor Day is 2\/3 of our BPO portfolio is already at a 10% or above margin. So by continuing to look to accelerate growth of the higher-margin businesses, we should really start to give ourselves a little bit more help during the course of the year.","Ursula M. Burns","And when -- we were not at a 10% margin, George, government health care is an area that we're not -- we're making progress. We're really focused, as I said, in responding to the first question on making sure that we get this right. And we do not, like I said, put any additional risk or pressure on any state. But as we do that, we are stabilizing more and more. And so throughout 2014, this significant investment that we're making -- that we made in '13 and is a trail on with '12 should start to pay off with more accretive performance, accretive results to the company. I'm very confident of that. We have a lot of energy around it. And it's not totally visible to -- the detail is not totally visible to the investors, but there's a lot of energy behind it to make sure that we get it right and that we don't, like I said, risk our customers.","Kathryn A. Mikells","And the one other thing I would just add on government health care is we stood up a lot of things in 2013, right? So we implemented a new MMIS platform in New Hampshire. We implemented one in Alaska. We obviously have the lead on the Nevada health insurance exchange and we supported a handful of other health insurance exchanges at other states. So that's a lot of things to stand up in government health care in a given year. And as I look forward to 2014, we have one MMIS customer that we're standing up. But on a relative basis, year-over-year, it is nothing in comparison to everything that we had to stand up this year.","George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","That's very helpful. And as a follow-up question, do evolving costs to stand up health care contracts alter the individual components of your bridge to get to 50 basis points of margin expansion? And if you can also give us an update on how Project Compete is tracking according to plan?","Kathryn A. Mikells","Yes. And so it really doesn't, I'd say overall, alter the bridge that I talked about at Investor Day. I'd say with regard to the progression on government health care, I'd already taken into consideration, I talked about the amortization of the platform, which has a big expense and the fact that we'll lap that year-over-year. Sorry, to the second part of your question, George?","George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Project Compete.","Kathryn A. Mikells","Yes. So Project Compete is well underway. I mentioned it a little bit earlier that we're very engaged in ensuring that we're driving kind of KPIs down to the lowest level in the business. A great example of that would be Ursula and I were on a call with, I'll call it, 25-ish folks across the Services organization earlier this week, really walking through their KPIs across all of the metrics we're tracking on strategic execution. Obviously, Project Compete is one piece of how we intend to get labor costs as a percent of revenue down. That's about Project Compete. It's also about just getting more efficient and more effective, implementing technology and automation tools across our customer care centers and the like to just drive overall productivity. So we feel good about the overall program and are very engaged to ensure that we're well executing there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha from Credit Suisse.","Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","The question I have -- both questions actually on Services. The first one is if you guys are spending so much on M&A, your organic growth rate in Services this year is very close to 0. Is that roughly right or will it actually grow? And what percent of long-term revenue growth rate we should think about in that business once you've gone through this transition period?","And then on the margin from Q1 to Q4, let's say, as we go through this year in Services, actually, I wanted to understand that Q1 will be the trough, it sounds like. And then the ramp is a combination of the runoff in offsetting some of the cost initiatives and just standard leverage. There's nothing else that has to happen to you to, let's say, do a 11% or slightly above that margin in the fourth quarter in Services? Is that the right way of thinking of it?","Kathryn A. Mikells","Yes, it is. So I'll start with the second part of your question. That's all it is, is the ramp over the course of the year and that's exactly how you should think about it. Obviously, with the guidance of our margin in 1Q being roughly the same year-over-year, it suggests that we've got to get to reasonably above 10% for the remainder of the year. But my expectation in terms of the year-over-year ramp is that it's going to start out slower in terms of year-over-year gains and obviously, it's going to be second half of the year loaded.","If I then flip back to your first question, which started with, hey, with all of the spend on M&A, I mean, I'll kind of start there and say we -- it isn't as if we've had a lot of spend on M&A and we certainly didn't guide to a different overall target number, really, than we've been trying to execute to previously. So historically, M&A has given the company 2 to 3 points in revenue growth. We're not expecting that we're going to get a wildly different answer in terms of overall growth from M&A. We're just looking to get M&A activity back up to where it's been historically.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah from Brean Capital.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","And I guess 2 from me. The first one would be, can you give us a sense of how we should expect BPO revenue to ramp, I guess, through this year and into '15? And kind of what the components and the timing of those components are, even if the components are the removal of headwinds like student loan runoff, kind of the government and commercial as we go into '15? And should we expect or is it your expectation that BPO get back to mid-single digits in '15 or, I guess more specifically, entering 2015. And then I have a quick follow-up.","Kathryn A. Mikells","Sure. So overall, I'll start with the last part of the question. BPO will get up to mid-single digits, but that's not where it's going to start at the beginning of the year, obviously. If you look at where we ended 4Q overall in terms of Services, right, when BPO being down year-over-year and first quarter, BPO may be down kind of marginally still but kind of quickly then ramping up to be positive. So some of the factors in terms of how we lap some of the pressures that we're currently facing, right? In the fourth quarter, the student loan pressure on revenue, 1.5 points. That's the worst quarter we're going to see.","Overall, the way that progresses in 2014 is it gets much lighter when we hit the fourth quarter because that's when we hit the compare in terms of the federal government piece of the overall student loan business going away. Right now in the fourth quarter, the wireless volume pressures that we talked about in customer care caused about 1 point decline in the fourth quarter on revenue. That will dissipate over the course of the year. So when we get to the back half of the year, that pressure, basically, falls away. And then M&A, which year-over-year was a 2-point decline on revenue, no contribution versus the prior quarter of about 2 points of revenue. We would expect that will ramp over the course of the year.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. And then, I guess, actually this is my follow-up. Then as we get into '15, are we -- what are the headwinds that remain in '15 of the ones [indiscernible]?","Kathryn A. Mikells","Yes. So the only headwinds are the things that we talked about that we'd expect in 2015 is student loan is 2 pieces. And I just talked about the government piece, which when we get to the fourth quarter of '14, we totally lap that business going away. So overall, student loan portfolio will continue in slow decline, so we will still have a negative impact when we get to '15. But it's not going to be anything near the numbers that we've been talking about. So we're calling attention to it, obviously, because it's having a big impact right now. By the time we get to 2015, yes, there will be an impact but it's nothing near what we're talking about now.","Ursula M. Burns","All right. In addition, and by the time we get to 2015, a lot of the contracts that we signed in '13 and '14 will have ramped. We're seeing that benefit today, just early portions of it. Particularly, our technology customer care business that's actually doing very, very well. That's going to ramp. And by the time we get through 2014, it will be at the ramp stage.","Kathryn A. Mikells","Yes. And we're obviously focused talking about BPO or BPO\/ITO. With respect to Document Outsourcing, Document Outsourcing, new business signings were up 23% this year as well. And strategically, we're incredibly strong -- strongly positioned there. I've talked about previously the fact that Gartner has put us in a \"Magic Quadrant.\" We've got a new leader, which is well positioned there. So that also will assist us on the Services segment.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz from JPMorgan.","Mark A. Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Is Lynn Blodgett on the call right now?","Ursula M. Burns","No, he's not. He's dealing with personal medical situation. We expect him back on the next call.","Mark A. Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, good. I'll hope the best for his recovery there. The reason I ask, I just think it's just been pretty point-blank here today about how important Services is. I was just hoping we could ask a few questions of him, but we'll wait until another day on that. But maybe I can just talk a little about the Services M&A ambitions here because it was definitely absent last year and that was always kind of one of the hallmarks of ACS in terms of the M&A funnel or activity. What has changed now? You're feeling a little more confident we can move forward with acquisitions. Did it have to do with just given that the cost structure in order or the balance sheet in order? Or do you guys have to assemble a new team under Kathy's leadership around M&A and integration and all that stuff? I'm just kind of curious what's changed in that. Why you're feeling a little more confident about making M&A.","Ursula M. Burns","I'll have Kathy respond to the actual operational piece and how she does it. Let me just make sure that I make clear what did change in M&A from a strategic standpoint when we acquired ACS. We are significantly more pointed about what we want to acquire. Margin accretive, global expanding, innovation-based acquisitions are what we are after. That selection funnel, obviously, makes it harder than before we have that funnel. So I think based on history of ACS and what we know about the margin progression and growth progression of this business, that funnel is the right funnel. Kathy will talk about the pipeline that we have in M&A better. Let me get it over to her now.","Kathryn A. Mikells","Yes, so I started we have one deal over the finish line [indiscernible] that I spoke about. We spent $60 million. That's already a level that's higher than what we did last year because while we did 3 deals, they were all quite small. When I first joined the company, I would have told you that the pipeline was light. And as you know, M&A just kind of ebbs and flows. Our pipeline has built over that period of time. It matured. We obviously have 1 deal that's over the finish line. We've actually added resources into that M&A group.","And then I'd say the other thing we're doing is working really closely with the businesses in trying to generate what I call non-brokered deals. And so looking for our pipeline to also have a number of deals that we have been through the business kind of courting over a period of time to just improve our success rate.","Mark A. Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And then just a follow-up, if I could. Can you help us, Kathy, understand for 2014 in terms of EPS guidance, how much is predicated on the increase in offshore in -- of labor within the Services business? Is that a big part of EPS in terms of the support or a backstop or is that more for 2015?","Kathryn A. Mikells","Certainly over the course of the year, we expect overall, looking at our labor costs as a percent of revenue, to give us a fair amount of help in EPS. A piece of that is clearly moving our footprint more towards low-cost centers. But another piece of that is just getting more productive and more efficient. And we do that both by literally shifting work into low-cost countries and also through attrition, just hiring up in low-cost countries and trying to shift that without necessarily incurring restructuring charges. So for sure, it's meaningful, but it is not the only piece that we're focused on in terms of getting our labor costs down.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Bill Shope from Goldman Sachs.","Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. I have 2 questions actually on the Technology segment. Could you give me -- give a bit more color on the developing markets comments you made earlier? And given the volatility we're seeing in some of these regions, can you comment on whether or not we should think about just adding any material lift to the stabilization process we've seen in the Tech segment as we progress to 2014?","Ursula M. Burns","I would say not material and not continuous. We have a long history in developing economies in general. That history shows us that it does come and go. The good news is that we have a big base of business in many different areas around the developing economies, you know them all. This quarter, second half of this year, this has been pressured in Russia and Eastern Europe. Our fundamentals are good there and we're not losing share. We're participating in a fairly [indiscernible] where as the economies start to improve, we expect -- or the regulations start to improve or whatever drives the changes in Russia and Eastern Europe starts to improve, we'll participate, as we normally do, which is in a leadership way.","Kathryn A. Mikells","And the only other thing I'd say is DMO developing markets as a percent of total Tech revenue is not really high, call it between 12% and 13%. And we have a quite good history of managing profitability there when we see revenue decline.","Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then my last question would be a bit more clarity on the supplies inventory situation. Was that -- I'm not sure if I misunderstood this. Was that primarily because of the DMO weakness or was that a broader-based inventory correction? And then, I guess, off of that, are you comfortable that you're fairly done with that process now?","Kathryn A. Mikells","Yes, so we're comfortable we're fairly done with that process. I mean, we were working towards it in the third quarter. And so in the fourth quarter, we had a bigger impact. It shows up in DMO and also in indirect channels, so that's where the inventory change takes place. And then DMO just, overall, was a little bit softer.","Ursula M. Burns","I think this is something that we initiated and it's, I think, it's is a good business practice for us to be on, given the volatility that we see in general and in the world. And so we just wanted to make sure that we didn't have a lot hung up through our partners. And so we made the decision to pull this back. And it definitely did impact the SMB segment and DMO, but I think it's a good business decision to make.","James H. Lesko","Thanks, Bill. And that's all the time we have for questions today. Thanks for your interest. And, Ursula, anything more to wrap up?","Ursula M. Burns","Yes, let me just wrap up with 2 points. Thanks for joining us today. It was good to hear from you. I said this earlier but I think it's worth repeating. We are focused on delivering on the strategies that we've outlined, which enable consistent earnings, expansion and really strong cash flow, cash that we are committed to deploying in a balanced way and enhance the shareholder value.","James H. Lesko","Thanks, Ursula. That concludes our call today. And if you have any further questions, please contact me or any of our Investor Relations team. Thanks very much.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect.

She is joined by Kathryn Mikells, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com\/investor.","At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and\/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without expressed permission of Xerox. [Operator Instructions]","During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which by their nature, address matters that are in the future and uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein.","At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns, you may begin.","Ursula M. Burns","Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. During the second quarter, we delivered results that reflect consistent progress on our strategy, and we improved on the key metrics that shape the future of success of our business.","First, our shift to a Services-led growth portfolio is paying off. Services revenue represents 55% of our total revenue. That's up 3 points from the end of 2012. It's growing at a steady pace, contributing to annuity revenue stream that represents 84% of our total business and grew 1% this quarter. We're taking a disciplined approach to improving operating margins, so that our bottom line benefits more from top line growth in Services.","In Document Technology, we're effectively managing the business as a profitable, cash-generating operation. We're maintaining our leadership in Document Technology by holding and growing share. Through the launch of our ConnectKey platform earlier this year and by offering more advanced color digital presses, we're maximizing our strength across the business, plus we're maximizing our profit by lowering the cost base. Margins trended better this quarter compared to Q1.","All up and all in, we exceeded our EPS guidance for the second quarter and generated strong cash flow. We're making the decisions to invest in growth and in building shareholder value. I feel good about our progress through the first half of this year, and I'm confident that we're positioned very well to deliver on our full year expectations.","Now here's a closer look at Q2 results. We reported adjusted EPS of $0.27. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.23, which includes $0.04 related to the amortization of intangibles, and as I mentioned, exceeded our guidance. Revenue of $5.4 billion was up 1%.","During the first half of this year, we announced the sale of our North American and European paper businesses, so we've moved financial results from these businesses to discontinued operations.","Total revenue growth came from our Services business, which was up 5% in the quarter. Services operating margin improved sequentially and is in our range of 10% to 12%. Our clients are increasingly expanding their relationships -- their partnerships with us to improve the effectiveness of their operations.","As a result, we had one of our strongest year-over-year growth rates in signing and in the absolute TCV of deals. Renewal rate in BPO and ITO was an impressive 95%, and -- then the pipeline is up double digits. So in Services, we had solid across-the-board results.","Revenue from Document Technology came in where we expected, which was down 5%. It's a significant sequential improvement and reflects a benefit from the full rollout of our ConnectKey platform of printers and multifunction devices.","We also signed and began installing our largest order ever for a fleet of Xerox iGen color presses. It was a huge win for our graphic communications business and an indicator of the continued strength of our leadership in this market.","Segment margins also improved sequentially in Document Technology, coming in at the high end of our target range of 9% to 11%. In total, margin came in as expected, up 2 points sequentially. It's good progress, but we have much more work to do, and we have several initiatives underway that will deliver margin improvement.","Cash from operations was quite strong this quarter, and we're on track to deliver $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion in full year operating cash flow. It was a quarter of steady progress, all the performance improvements align very closely with our growth strategy and resulted in EPS expansion.","During quarter 2, we also welcomed Kathy Mikells as our new CFO. She's a quick study and already a strong contributor to our business. So let me turn it over to Kathy. Then I'll wrap up, and we'll open the call to your questions. Kathy?","Kathryn A. Mikells","Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everybody. I'd characterize Q2 as a very solid performance. Overall, Services performed in line with our expectations, and Document Technology came in a bit better. Our leading indicators were positive and cash flow was strong.","Let's start with a look at overall earnings. Revenue was up 1%, with growth driven by Services, which was up 5% or 6% at constant currency. We also had a positive contribution from equipment sale revenue, which was up 1%, our highest growth since Q3 2011.","Our gross margin of 31.4% was down 120 basis points, driven mainly by mix. The relative growth of our Services segment naturally dilutes gross margin.","We also had some negative impact from business line mix within Services and equipment versus supplies and financing mix within Document Technology. I'll cover this a little bit more when we hit the segment slides.","RD&E and SAG were both lower year-over-year, benefiting from productivity initiatives, as well as the greater mix of services. Operating margin trends improved, up 200 basis points sequentially, with year-over-year margin contraction slowing to down 50 basis points versus down 110 basis points in Q1.","Margin benefited from greater leverage on higher revenues, as well as productivity improvements. There's clearly more work to do, but we were pleased with the progress that we made this quarter, and we understand what's needed in order to keep up the positive trend.","Adjusted Other net of $98 million and equity income of $36 million were both modest contributors year-over-year. Within adjusted Other net, there's $33 million of restructuring, which is in line with our guidance and up slightly year-over-year. As part of our ongoing productivity actions, we anticipate a similar level of restructuring in Q3, which is fully incorporated into our adjusted earnings guidance.","Our tax rate came in at 24%, which is 2 percentage points higher year-over-year and below our guidance of 28%. Adjusted EPS of $0.27 was up $0.01 from 2012 and above our guidance range of $0.23 to $0.25. Relative to guidance, the overachievement was driven by better operating results, as well as the $0.01 benefit from tax rate below our guidance. So in summary, a relatively clean quarter with good top and bottom line results.","Turning now to Services. Services revenue was up 6% overall, with BPO up 4%, Document Outsourcing up 6% and ITO up 13%. BPO growth of 4% reflects strong growth in Healthcare Payer and Pharma and state government, partially offset by the elimination and runoff of our government and commercial student loan businesses. Document Outsourcing growth of 6% was above expectations, supported by a very strong equipment sales growth, as well as Partner Print Services. Finally, ITO continues to grow at an accelerated rate, driven by the ramp of a couple of megadeals that we had in 2011. We expect ITO growth to taper off and return to low-single digits by the fourth quarter.","Segment margin was 10.2% in Q2, up 90 basis points sequentially and down 40 basis points year-over-year. Margin was essentially in line with our expectations, reflecting the benefits of productivity initiatives, partially offset by the impact of less-rich mix.","As we look forward to the remainder of the year, we expect the pressure from weaker mix to continue, with the largest year-over-year impact from the government student loan runoff occurring in the fourth quarter.","Long term, we're taking a number of actions to improve the mix of our portfolio. We're accelerating investments to build more scale in competitively advantaged businesses, with good secular and macro trends. We're adding to our suite of capabilities to create more value for our customers, thereby enabling higher margin, and we're deemphasizing lower margin and low-return niche and noncore businesses.","Turning to our key performance metrics. Signings were up 40% year-over-year, and on a trailing 12-month basis, turned positive for the first time in 5 quarters. We continue to have shortening contract length and smaller average deal sizes with no megadeals this quarter.","New business ARR and NRR was up 5% year-over-year, and we had good signings contribution across the line of businesses. Our renewal rate was high at 95%, and our pipeline grew 10%, all positive indicators for our future Services performance.","So solid results from Services, which we expect to continue into Q3, with revenue growth in the mid-single-digit and modest segment margin improvement year-over-year to roughly 10%.","Moving on to Document Technology. Our revenue was down 5% this quarter, improving as anticipated from the 9% decline in Q1. We saw a really good pickup in equipment sale revenue year-over-year, which was up 1% for the total company and down only 2% within Document Technology. This compares favorably to down 11% and 12%, respectively, in Q1.","The equipment improvement was driven by the success of our recently launched products in mid-range and high-end and the related strong backlog we had entering Q2.","Within mid-range, our recently launched ConnectKey platform has been very well received and resulted in 16% growth in installs of mid-range color MFPs. ConnectKey refers to a software system that's embedded in 16 new multi-functional printers. It provides industry-leading security, more features for mobile users, as well as the ability to customize the MFP to link into business processes.","High-end also experienced strong growth in both entry and production color, driven by recently launched products. We feel good about the improving trends in this segment, as color continues to become a larger part of the business and begins to offset the declines in black and white.","Finally, in entry, we continue to see good growth in color A4 MFPs. But in total, this segment was down, driven by weaker results in developing markets as well as OEM sales.","Overall, Document Technology margin showed a really nice recovery from Q1, up 200 basis points, and at 10.8%, it was at the high end of our target range. The year-over-year decline of 50 basis points was driven by lower supplies and financing mix, with price pressure largely offset by cost and efficiency savings and a modest currency benefit from the weak yen.","Looking toward Q3, we're exiting Q2 with a strong backlog, albeit not as high as Q1, and we expect revenue growth to be down mid-single-digits, with margins seasonally lower. So overall, good performance from both Services and Document Technology, which we hope to build on next quarter.","With that, let's turn to cash flow. Cash flow from operations was very strong in the quarter. The $533 million in Q2 and $446 million for the first half compares to $228 million and $213 million, respectively, for 2012.","Free cash flow was similarly strong at $426 million in Q2 and $232 million for the first half, which compares to a use of $30 million in the first half of 2012. The Q2 improvement in operating cash flow year-over-year was driven by the following: $105 million was from lower defined benefit pension contribution. For the year, we expect cash pension funding to be about $170 million lower, so we saw the large part of that benefit in Q2.","Working capital was also better this year, driven largely by accounts payable, which is basically intra-year timing differences. We also saw improvement in other assets and liability lines, which reflects some intra-year timing, as well as lower required Services investments. Partially offsetting those positives was a lower source of cash from finance receivables, which was expected, given the $600 million of finance receivables that we sold last year.","Moving down to the cash flow report. Investing from cash flows was a use of $167 million in the quarter. We spent $107 million on CapEx and $81 million on acquisitions. Cash from financing was a use of $427 million and included the retirement of our $400 million senior note in May, as well as $72 million of common dividends, which reflects the 35% increase in the dividend earlier this year.","Given the timing of cash flows and the note repayment, we didn't repurchase shares during the quarter. However, we continue to plan on repurchasing at least $400 million worth for the year.","Given our first half cash flows and the historical cash flow seasonality of the business, we're very well positioned to hit our full year operating cash flow guidance range of $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion.","Moving to the next slide. I'll walk through our capital structure and capital allocation plan. With the $400 million May senior note repayment, we ended the quarter with $8.1 billion of debt, which is down $400 million from the beginning of the year. Applying the 7:1 leverage on financing assets, our allocated financing debt is $4.9 billion, leaving core debt of $3.2 billion.","This debt reduction satisfies our minimum target for the year. We continue to expect $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion of free cash flow, and our capital allocation plan, including the debt reduction that I just talked about, remain the same as follows: share repurchases. We continue to view Xerox's shares as an attractive investment, and we plan to repurchase at least $400 million worth of shares this year.","Acquisitions. Through the first half, we spent $134 million on acquisitions, and we anticipate doing between $300 million and $500 million. Our pace of Services acquisitions has been slower than planned, which puts a bit of a damper on Services revenue. So this continues to be an area that we're focused on.","I feel good about the quality of deals in our pipeline, but I believe it's really important that we remain disciplined in targeting businesses that are a really good fit and at reasonable valuations.","And finally, dividends will be a use of about $300 million of cash, which factors in the Q1 quarterly dividend increase to $0.0575 per share. You can see our capital allocation plans are on track, and we remain committed to using our strong free cash flow to deliver value to our shareholders.","So before I hand it back to Ursula, I just thought I'd take a minute to give you my perspective on the business, with 3 months now under my belt. One of the reasons that I took this job was my perception of the tremendous opportunity that Xerox has in front of it.","In Document Technology, we face a growth-pressured, competitive industry. That said, the industry is very profitable, and we have a good track record of maintaining our advantaged position and maximizing returns.","In Services, there's been significant work done to address cost and execution issues, as well as evaluating our portfolio of businesses to shape our business for the future. So I feel like we're in a reasonably good place today. We understand our strengths and our weaknesses and the work in front of us to further transform Xerox. I'm really happy to be on board, and you can count on me playing an active role to ensure Xerox is a success. And with that, back over to you, Ursula.","Ursula M. Burns","Thanks, Kathy, and here's a quick wrap-up. We saw good improvement in Q2, and I'm very pleased with how the fundamentals of our business are performing. We delivered steady Services growth, improving trends in Document Technology, margins in line with expectations and strong cash flow. That said, our business is still transforming, and we are planning for additional restructuring during the balance of the year to create a leaner, more flexible business model.","At the same time, we'll continue to take a balanced approach to our capital allocations, investing in future growth and continuing our share repurchase program, high priorities as we build a sustainably successful business.","Considering our first half results, there may have been an expectation that we raise our full year guidance. However, as I mentioned, we're planning for additional restructuring in the second half of this year. We believe that we'll face other headwinds, including a higher tax rate, so we're taking a prudent approach to 2013 guidance.","For third quarter, we expect adjusted EPS of $0.24 to $0.26 per share. This includes approximately $0.02 of restructuring. And we continue to expect full year adjusted EPS in the range of $1.09 to $1.15. By growing revenue, improving margins and controlling costs, we're confident that we'll consistently expand earnings per share and generate strong cash.","That's a good place for me to end. Before we open it up for questions, let me turn it over to Jim Lesko, who's the Head of our Investor Relations.","James H. Lesko","Thanks, Ursula. Joining Ursula and Kathy today are Lynn Blodgett, Head of Xerox Services; and Armando Zagalo de Lima, Head of our Document Technology business.","Also, let me point out that we have several supplemental slides at the end of our deck. They provide more financial detail to support today's presentation and complement our prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] At the end of our Q&A session, I'll turn it back to Ursula for closing comments. Operator, please open the line for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Barclays.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I think you said that, for the year, you're thinking Services margins of 10%, and I think that's at the low end of your range. And if you could just confirm that, for the year, that you think Services margins will be in that range. And when do you think you can at least get to 11% and maybe the higher end of the range now based on these new restructuring actions?","Kathryn A. Mikells","Sure. This is Kathy. So when we look at Services margin, if you look through the first half of the year, year-over-year, we're down about 20 basis points. And so as we look at the back half of the year, clearly, we're targeting to make that up. On a year-over-year basis, I'd say we're still striving to try and be up a little bit year-over-year. Clearly, in the third quarter, we have an easier compare. And we will be up year-over-year, and we're looking to maximize that benefit. But overall, if you look at the range for this year of 10% to 12%, we'll be at the low end of the range, still targeting to try and get a little bit of improvement year-over-year. As you look forward to the different things that we're doing to really try and improve overall margin performance, I talked a little bit about the fact that we're focused overall in our portfolio and making sure that we're putting resources where we have advantaged businesses with good tailwinds and we bring good competitive advantage to the table. We're building additional capabilities, so pointing to things like the acquisition of WDS. We did a couple of small acquisitions this quarter, Customer Value Group, as well as an e-learning-based acquisition. Those things are both in areas where we have good margins, and we're building capabilities to add additional value that we bring to our customers. We've also talked a little bit about the fact that we're continuing to look at offshoring and I'll call it right-shoring even within here in the U.S., where we do work to get a better balance and a little bit lower-cost labor overall, and that work continues. So we have a number of different things underway. Clearly, those things aren't going to take us to the higher end of the range overnight. It's going to take us a couple of years to get there. But we're very confident that we're on the right path, and we're confident with our overall guidance for the year.","Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So you said it's -- that was my follow-up is it -- it's a couple of years to get to the higher end of the range or the middle of the range, right? I mean, you don't give guidance for next year, but I think everybody on the call would probably like to see it at least go up 1 point next year.","Kathryn A. Mikells","Yes. We will give next year's guidance at our investor conference in November, so I think I gave you a little bit of color about what we're working on. And we'll give you more about 2014 when we get to November.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross of Cross Research.","Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC","Can you talk a little bit about the Technology business, in terms of the strength in equipment sales? Obviously, you had the backlog going into the quarter. I'm curious as to sort of linearity during the quarter, and then if you could talk at all about sort of geographic areas of strength and weakness.","Ursula M. Burns","Yes. We saw the improvement in Document Technology throughout the quarter. As you recall, we exited Q1 with a strong backlog, and we started to benefit from that backlog immediately throughout the quarter, even at the tail end of quarter 1. And we're pleased with that. We expected that to happen, and it actually delivered as we expected. From a geographic perspective, I would say you should expect -- we can characterize it as pretty much the same. So we continue to see a weak but steady U.S. environment. We see Europe weak but not weakening, and our developing economies are pretty much -- they slowed a bit, but they're the strongest of the 3. We did see a bit of a slowdown in Russia. We started to see that in Q1 and it continued in Q2, but we're managing that. So geographies are like that. The high end of our business, particularly in the U.S. but even in Europe, the high end of our business is doing very well. So we're seeing that strength with new products and just good focus on the business and good competitive wins. So from a line of business, that's where we see the improvement.","Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC","Okay, great. And then I was curious, Kathy, when you think about mix of revenue, how are you thinking about balancing it from a margin perspective, especially in Services? Because obviously, ITO's a lower margin sale. I mean, are you putting in place, I don't know, programs with the sales force or what-have-you to make sure that if you sign a BPO program, then you can maybe do a little more ITO? Or how can we kind of stabilize some of the margin there and maybe just even in the overall portfolio?","Kathryn A. Mikells","Yes. So I'm going to take that a little bit in 2 chunks. I'm a big believer that at the end of the day, we create mix. Mix doesn't just happen to us. Obviously, changing mix kind of takes a little bit of time. If you look overall at ITO, yes, the growth has been a little bit higher there. That's coming from things that we signed in 2011 that we've just continued to implement. And as a result, we've seen that tick up. ITO is a place where we're not a huge player in the market. We really participate there, I think, very selectively, and we're pretty disciplined in terms of what we go after. So as we look at the overall portfolio of business, we're really focused on putting our resources and energy most in the areas where we bring competitive advantage to the table, we bring scale to the table, we bring capability to the table. We can move up the margin chain by penetrating and radiating at customers. And that's where we're really focused over the long term. I'd also tell you, tactically, right, we're doing better blocking and tackling. I think when we talk about our confidence in terms of overall Services revenues -- I'm sorry, margins, we're really seeing that. And that's work that's got to continue. And so day in and day out, making sure that we're doing everything we can both to reduce costs and to execute well. Because we know, especially on these larger contracts, if it takes us too long to stand them up, then we see margin pressure. So those are all the different things we're working on.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.","Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","On BPO specifically, what factors should we think about to potentially see some acceleration in growth here over time? Is it simply a matter of getting past the student loan program running off by 4Q? Is it highly dependent on your picking up the pace of acquisitions? I mean, how should we think about some of those factors?","Ursula M. Burns","Good question, Bill. I think that there are 2 things. I'll start, and then I'll have Kathy or Lynn comment. Clearly, we have to pick up the pace of acquisitions. Without those acquisitions, we'll probably hover in the mid-range of the guidance that we gave and mid-single-digit revenue growth, so we are focused on acquisitions. We haven't not been looking. The good news is that we have been looking, but we are being very disciplined on both capabilities that we get, but also price that we're willing to pay, particularly in this kind of turbulent environment. So we'll get them. Kathy's focused on it, Lynn is focused on it, we'll get them. The second thing which you mentioned which is important is the student loan runoff. It is a big piece of the portfolio. We -- by the way, it's not new news, we knew it was coming. It's a hurdle that we have to overcome. It's very profitable. At the tail end of this deal, the profitability is very high. And so we'll -- we're going to have to manage our way over that, through that hurdle. And after we get through the compares on that, clearly, we'll see a growth in revenue and in profitability just because we won't have the negative on a sequential basis -- sorry, on a year-over-year basis because we won't have that negative compare at a headwind for us. So those 2 things are important, but why don't Lynn actually say a little bit more.","Lynn R. Blodgett","Yes, I think, as Ursula said, the acquisitions are really important to us. We're looking at -- as we determine whether or not to do an acquisition, we're evaluating its benefit from a geographic standpoint. So does it -- does it further our global strategy? Does it meet our requirement in terms of higher-margin Services, like data analytics? And so we're being careful and making sure that the acquisitions move us forward in those areas. And in terms of other growth and margin expansion, health care is an area of focus for us. It typically has -- after we get deals up and running, those things [ph] tend to be healthy-margin businesses. Transportation, we had good activity in the same local last quarter. And those are all areas that, over the long haul, will increase margins.","Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then just as a follow-up on the student loan issue, I want to make sure I fully understood this. I believe you said that the pressure on the margins is most intense in the fourth quarter. So is that the case? And could you clarify how material that is? And how we should factor that into how we think about the margin path from the third to the fourth quarter?","Kathryn A. Mikells","Sure. So yes, you heard us right. Overall, the margin impact has more year-over-year impact in the fourth quarter. But overall for the full year, let's call it 35 to 40 basis points in negative margin impact, with that being a little bit heavier in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Could you talk -- you mentioned bookings and pipeline. Could you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about bookings growth in the second half of the year?","Lynn R. Blodgett","Yes. We expect that -- we had a good -- we felt good about the bookings in the second quarter. We think third quarter, we're going to be strong. It'll probably not be -- we expect them to not be quite as strong as they were in the second quarter, but we expect healthy bookings to continue. Renewal rates were very high, and those -- that effectively has the same kind of impact as a good booking quarter. The fact that renewals were high. We expect that to return back more into the normal range of our 85% to 90% for the second half. So...","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Lynn, would you expect bookings to be up 5%, 10%, any kind of -- I mean, I'm not expecting. I don't think the investors are expecting a sustained 40% year-over-year growth. But will they have 5%, 10% kind of year-over-year growth as we look at the second half? Any kind of calibration?","Lynn R. Blodgett","I think that's a reasonable range.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then, Kathy, maybe for you, on the technology margins. Could you give a little of color there? I would have expected Technology margins to be a little bit stronger than I think you characterized, given the yen, number one; and then number two, I would assume that mix tilts a little bit more in your favor. You had a lot of equipment that you did this quarter. I would assume that supplies and other kicks up a little bit in the second half of the year, but maybe just kind of revisit why Technology margins, what you think the puts and takes there, and what investors should expect in the second half of the calendar year.","Kathryn A. Mikells","Sure. So I would actually start by saying I was pretty pleased with where the Technology margins came out. I mean, 200 basis point sequential improvement so, overall, relative to what our expectations were, I feel like the Technology segment performed quite well in the quarter. So as I look towards the back half of the year, clearly, on a full year basis in 2012, we beat the range that we provide for Technology. So we have tough year-over-year compares. We didn't have the kind of product introductions last year that we have this year. Obviously, that takes a fair amount of investment on our part in kind of priming the pump as we're launching those things. So we have tougher compares. I expect seasonally to be a little bit lower kind of Q3 relative to Q2. But overall, I was pretty pleased with the performance.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","But how should we be thinking about the change, though, Kathy, year-over-year just if we look at calendar year '12?","Kathryn A. Mikells","If you look, we have exactly the same compare in Technology as we produced in 2Q. And so I'd say we expect to be seasonally a little bit weaker, which is what we would typically see.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","First one, Kathy. So should we think of the core business operations tracking a little ahead of the original guidance at this point? I can appreciate kind of the restructuring remarks for the second half of the year not sort of -- as a reason not to raise the overall guidance. But it seems like you're tracking ahead, from cooperations offsets a little bit. From the restructuring, there's numerous operational positives and not many operational headwinds, and you get to the end benefit in the second half. And then I guess -- and then I have a follow-up.","Ursula M. Burns","I think that you should look at the quarter not for the quarter but combine it with the first quarter and look at the half. And I think that we would -- I would not characterize it as operating ahead. I think we're kind of operating on where we expect it to be when you average the half. We caught up in Document Technology. We actually expanded our margins in Services. We stabilized revenue, and revenue came in on the average basis where we would've expected it to, which is in our range of flat to 2% up. So I think that you can look at it as the first half being kind of what we would've liked to have happened. We did a little bit more in the second quarter than we did in the first to average that well. For the rest of the year, I think you should look at us continuing that disciplined pace. Quarter 3 will be weaker in margin, it generally is. Quarter 4 will be a little bit weaker in revenue because we have some compares to come over in Services. But I think on average, the second half will come out pretty much like that first half, and it's easier and better to look at it on a half basis than it is on a quarter basis. Anything else, Kathy?","Kathryn A. Mikells","Yes. All I'd add to that is we feel really good about the middle of the range of the EPS guidance that we provided. Obviously, we'd like to come in better than that. We've only got 6 months under our belt. I think when I look at all the gives and takes, we're being very prudent.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Great, that's really helpful. And then my follow-up is just on share repurchase potential for the second half of the year or the guidance. You have the greater sign in front of the $400 million, but it seems like you could have significant upside potential, depending on how the second half of the year comes in. So I just wanted to get a sense of how aggressive you might be willing to get if you don't get -- if the acquisitions come in at the lower end of the $300 million to $500 million. I think you had a couple of hundred millions of unallocated dollars entering the year as well.","Kathryn A. Mikells","Yes, So I think everything that you said was correct. Right, you started with an, if the second half of the year comes in, because we are a second half of the year cash flow producer. We clearly started out by saying we expected to do at least $400 million worth of share repurchases for the year. Cash flow comes in better than that, we would certainly be looking to do more. We continue to look at our overall share price and feel like that's a good place for us to put capital, clearly looking to drive value for shareholders. But at the end of the day, we are a back half of the year cash flow producer. But at this point, I feel really good about our overall cash flow guidance for the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.","Mark A. Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I want to kind of build off that last question just around capital allocation and the focus on acquisitions. So Kathy, how should we think about, over the next year or so -- you guys talked about some restructuring here in the second half. I presume there's going to be more thereafter as you really try to focus on the better performing assets. And I guess, the question is really around the cost savings. How would they be redeployed? And if you could kind of give us a sense in terms of apportionments toward acquisitions versus increased stock buyback versus growing the dividend versus just dropping it to bottom line.","Kathryn A. Mikells","So that was a lot. I'll try to tease that apart a little bit. I'm going to start with acquisitions. Look, we said we desire to do kind of $300 million to $500 million, clearly through the first half, we're tracking at the low end of that. We'd like to see more, but they have to be good deals, right? I mean, we're disciplined. They've got to fit with our portfolio. They've got to be strategically aligned to places where we think we're going to get good synergies. So at the end of the day, valuation also matters, and this is a little bit hard for us to predict. When you take that into consideration and look overall in terms of our cash flow production so far, and we're very comfortable with the guidance that we've provided, if cash flow comes in well, we're very happy to do more than the $400 million worth of share repurchases. If you -- you talked a little bit then about restructuring. I think clearly, we pointed to both within the Technology business and within the Services business, the need for us to continue to work on productivity and efficiencies. That's what the restructuring dollars are targeted toward. I talked a little bit about what we refer to as Project Compete and making sure that in the Services business, we've got kind of people where they're optimized from a labor cost perspective, both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. We did a little bit of restructuring this quarter. I'd certainly like to see us do and expect that we will do more during the remainder of the year. So I look at that as really looking at kind of our overall income statement, kind of core operating results and wanting to reinvest a portion of that to make sure that we're continuing to get the restructuring we need, to get the productivity that we need. And certainly, that's absolutely the case on the Technology side of the business, and expect it will continue to be that case over time.","Mark A. Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And just a follow-up for Lynn. Lynn, could you talk about the conversion rate? Obviously, the signings are starting to show some signs of life again. But just kind of curious if you can give us your kind of view in what you're seeing with respect to rescoping or focusing on back to kind of negotiate the cost takedowns with deals that were signed previously. Are you seeing any sort of headwind there? Or is it where you're actually seeing better improvement in terms of full conversion?","Lynn R. Blodgett","I think that the phenomenon that we saw 1.5, 2 years ago where people were coming back and renegotiating out of cycle. We haven't -- that -- there's always some level of that, but I would say not as much as we saw a couple of years ago. The ramp, as far as -- the ramp up proportions are pretty typical. And we're seeing the first year contribution from bookings is pretty consistent. One of the things that should actually work in our favor is that in the bookings, we haven't seen -- haven't signed any big Medicaid deals, and Medicaid deals typically ramp slower. So those were things that negatively impacted us. So I would say to that extent, we're going to see a little better ramp-up.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Tong with Piper Jaffray.","George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","So Services signings this quarter were up an impressive 40% after being up 64% in the first quarter. How do you see this translating into revenue performance in the second half of the year, especially factoring in the expected deceleration in ITO growth and student loan runoff?","Lynn R. Blodgett","Well, as Kathy said, the headwinds that we're facing, as you just pointed out, in ITO, we're lapping the ramp-up of those megadeals that we signed in 2011. They're performing very well, so we're really happy with it. But as we said on the last call, we have not seen the kind of megadeals that we would like to see. Bookings are -- the positive of that, is that we're seeing smaller deals that tend to ramp quicker. So those things are positive. I think the other headwind, as Ursula pointed out, was the student loan runoff, and so those things are not trivial. And we're in this -- those runoffs tend to be more light switch. When you lap a contract, that's -- you see that impact immediately. And the student loan thing, that will be a bit of a light switch that we'll see at the end of the year. So the ramp-up of the new bookings will feather in, whereas those are things that tend to drop off more quickly. So that's why we're being careful in terms of our revenue guidance for the second half. Even though bookings are strong, and we're pleased with that.","George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","That's helpful. And as a follow-up, can you give us a bridge of what actions will drive additional sequential margin expansion in the Services business this year, particularly given the negative impact from mix that you're seeing?","Kathryn A. Mikells","Look, I think we talked a little bit about those already, so we're acknowledging the negative impact of mix. We obviously knew about that at the beginning of the year. So while we're pointing it out, just so you understand the year-over-year compares, we're not suggesting, as a result of that, that we're not confident in getting to our full year guidance in terms of overall margins there. We had an easier year-over-year compare there for the third quarter, and so we talked about the fact that we obviously have an expectation, given that easy compare, that we're going to see favorable year-over-year there. And really, I'd say execution and continuing to really work at getting costs down, getting G&A costs in the near term are things we're very focused on in ensuring that we're going to hit the guidance that we just talked about.","Ursula M. Burns","So you have some tactics, which we are well into. You've heard about us talk about Project Compete, it's all about cost management tactically. And then more strategically, it is about driving advantaged positions in places in the portfolio and being a little bit more directive or selective about where we want to grow our revenues. So that takes a little bit longer to do. You do that incrementally. So that gives us -- the short term gives us confidence that we'll get in the 10% to 12% range at the lower end, and the longer term gives us a little bit more confidence that we'll be able to get to the higher end of the range, and that's how we're managing the business.","Lynn R. Blodgett","I think, too, Ursula, if I can add, we've done a lot of work over the last 18 months or 1 year to 18 months on the portfolio in terms of areas that we should exit, businesses that we should look at that don't fit our long-term growth profiles or margin profiles. And so over time, as Ursula said, you'll see us doing some work in that area, which will help as far as margin.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. First of all, just any comment you have maybe on the Technology side on the pricing environment and where we are on supplies and channel inventories would be helpful. And then maybe a broad question for Lynn and Ursula. It's been a few years now since ACS and, I guess, can you speak about the tangible revenue synergies that exist between Technology and Services? Maybe if you can give some examples of wins you've had over the last year, where it's really coming together. Is there more that you can do here so that in aggregate, you could get both businesses growing one day? Or is that just not the way you see it?","Armando Zagalo de Lima","Okay, so this is Armando. So on the pricing side, we don't see a consistent degradation of pricing in the marketplace in this moment. You always see the odd case, particularly in megadeals where competitors can become very aggressive. But generically speaking, we don't see any consistent degradation there. So in terms of inventory in the channel, there is no benefit that we have had in quarter 2 from an increase of channel inventory. In fact, we are managing to reduce the level of inventories in the channel just as a way to manage our relationship with the channel on a more healthy way.","Ursula M. Burns","And as far as revenue synergies go, some of the tangible examples, I won't give any customer names. I'll give more segments that we've seen this. Most of the synergies kind of clear come in our Document Outsourcing-ITO combination space, which is a space that we're trying to leverage even more as we go forward in both office equipment distribution market. In the personal care company market and in the telecom space are places that we are seeing the most leverage from the relationship between Xerox and the old ACS and ITO and Document Outsourcing, that leveraged together is helping us on position. The other place that we're seeing it is literally in just our brand carrying forward -- our brand in Technology carrying forward the ACS offers. This is a big deal and kind of sprinkled everywhere. Our engagement with the C-Suite is fuller and more impactful across the board when we go together with our full suite of offers. We see that in the United States, and we're clearly seeing that in our expansion outside of the U.S., in Europe as well. We're using our infrastructure, using our reach from a client perspective, and our brand name is helping this expansion. So if you look at our revenue growth in Services, you'll see that prior to the -- on average, prior to the acquisition, we were operating in a certain space, not immediately prior to the acquisition but, on average, prior to it. And we've stepped it up by at least 2 points, so I think that it's clear that we're seeing that -- and our Document Outsourcing business is also doing better across-the-board. So I think that, that's where we see the synergies coming through -- revenue synergies coming through. We're not at the end of this at all, by the way, it's a place that we're focusing a lot. I think both Kathy and Lynn spoke about it is, we have a particular focus on geographic expansion, and that geographic expansion would be almost impossible without the background on the backbone of our Xerox Corporation infrastructure, so that's helping us as well.","Lynn R. Blodgett","I think that if you look at ITO, that continues to have such good growth. The main driver of the growth in ITO are the megadeals that we've referenced multiple times. And those are deals that have occurred precisely for the reason that Ursula described. And I'm thinking of the 2 biggest deals, we just would not have played in those deals prior to having the Xerox brand and Xerox footprint globally. So it's helped us in ITO, areas like finance and accounting, we don't talk a lot about finance and accounting. It's just one of those businesses that runs, has strong growth. And most of the deals that we sign in that area are possible because of the relationship, the Xerox brand and the footprint and infrastructure there.","Ursula M. Burns","I'd say, finance and accounting and HR are the 2 places -- additional 2 places besides ITO.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.","Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I wanted to ask about R&D. If I look at first half R&D, it looks like there's about 9% versus last year. And if you compare versus 2010, looks like your R&D budget will be down about 20% to 25%. A couple of questions on the back of that. First, are you investing enough to maintain your competitiveness from an R&D standpoint in the core Technology business? And secondly, are you effectively becoming more dependent on acquisitions for the development of your IP base in your Services offerings on a go-forward basis?","Ursula M. Burns","So the answer to the -- so let me answer the questions in the 2 pieces. From an R&D perspective in the Technology space, I think you have to look at it in the aggregate of what we invest in R&D here, what we invest in R&D in our -- with our partner in Japan, Fuji Xerox, and the acquisition that we made of the liquidating company, Impika. And that -- so that shows up not as R&D, it shows up as an acquisition which will augment with our R&D. So if you put those 3 things together, I would actually say we're not underspending at all in R&D from a Technology perspective. We're doing it a little differently, so we took a point in time to actually augment with Impika, but we're actually now pouring forward the appropriate level of research and development to be sure that we can continue to expand the capabilities that we have in the markets that are growing. So that's one point. From a Services perspective, the R&D is just different. It's not that -- it requires less -- some of the R&D that we would normally -- that you would normally see in a -- from a technology company gets in the deal buildup, in the deal structure, and we've then platformed that and start to work on that platform from an R&D perspective. So it doesn't show up the same way. I do not believe at all that we are underspending in R&D. We're continuing to be more effective, more efficient and all that stuff. And I keep a really keen eye to ensure that we have the right level of investment in this space. It's not something I take lightly at all.","Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And a follow-up, I wanted to get a sense on the bookings trend. The bookings -- reported bookings number was quite strong. Can you delineate the trend of new business contracts or new wins or incremental business versus renewals for first half? And how is that -- and where have you been seeing success in terms of new customers and new wins?","Ursula M. Burns","I'll just start with the overall, and then I'll get to whoever, Kathy or Lynn, both of you can struggle over this one. New business signings were strong. New business -- so we saw our total signings up 40%, new business signings were up as well. We don't give you the exact number, but they were strong. 6%, I gave you the number just now, so I guess 6%. And our ARR and NRR from deals is also up. So across-the-board, we're seeing stock future revenue participation from all of the areas that it should, from renewals, from new business, from NRR deals. So across-the-board we're seeing strength.","Lynn R. Blodgett","Yes, and when you look at the -- when we report NRR and ARR, those are all -- that's all new business. And then when we talk about renewals, that's the renewal business. So it's -- so we try to give you color in both those areas.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup.","Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I'll squeeze in the last question here, which is kind of a bigger strategy question down the road. When we have the Obama health care item kind of on the horizon, Ursula, can you let us know how you and your team are approaching that? What are the opportunities there? What are the costs? I assume that could result in tremendous more processing. So I don't know as far as pricing and opportunity, does this disrupt other things? Is it all incremental? Do you have to start reinvesting early ahead of it? Can you just kind of help us, as CEO, how you're viewing the Obamacare and the impact potential for Xerox?","Ursula M. Burns","Yes, I think that health care in general, payer, provider, government, infrastructure is an opportunity, almost across-the-board in just about every way you can think about it. And very specifically, Obamacare is one -- it's definitely going to be an opportunity, primarily because it's forcing state governments to actually pay attention to this line item, to this portion of their budget. And they have to actually step back and think about what path forward they want to have. It turns out that not every state is going to -- is going forward the same way, and that's one of the things that we learn is that we have to actually manage it state-by-state. Some people -- some states are standing back and just waiting and doing nothing, but having lots of conversations with us about what other states are doing and how we can help them. Some states are going really fast, and when they're going really fast, we engage in just about every piece of that infrastructure and looking at what they did in the past and providing data analytics, and we're actually standing up with solutions for them. So across-the-board, it's an opportunity. We have to be careful because I think what most people would've expected then on Obamacare passes that everything's going to be running towards a fixed solution. We're not finding that at all. I'll let Lynn put more color on it.","Lynn R. Blodgett","Yes, I think that of course, MMIS, the Medicaid systems are still fundamental to the health care system, exchanges -- we play in the insurance exchanges, and that's an area, as Ursula said, we're seeing the different states take -- some are standing pat, some are moving forward. But that's an area -- a very important area and we play there. We're seeing the transition from fee-for-service to managed care, and that's a very important change because it affects the payers, Medicaid and the private payers, and it also affects the providers significantly. We're seeing a real, an interesting sort of melding of both the private payer and the government payers, where the big private payers are playing now and part of playing with the government and Medicaid contract. Fraud and abuse is a huge area. It's -- we love it because we are -- we have so much transactional data. We're the holders of that transactional data and adding analytics to that data to determine fraud and abuse, for example, is a tremendous value to the -- to our customers, and it's an opportunity for us to capitalize on high-margin work. So an awful lot going on there and, as Ursula said, some of it's easy to see and some of it, we're having to just be careful and be conservative a little bit in what we do.","Ursula M. Burns","And we're definitely doubling down in this area. I mean, there's no -- there's not an area that we can invest in that we have any capability and that we're pulling back. This is a space that we're going after pretty aggressively. We -- as Lynn said, it's fraught with risks, but that's what we do for a living. We try to manage that well, and you've got your abilities to do well. We're across-the-board payers, providers and lots of information, so we're using that as a leverage point for us. Thanks for the question.","James H. Lesko","Okay, that's all the time we have for questions today. Thank you for your interest. And Ursula, anything more to wrap up, please?","Ursula M. Burns","Yes. We covered a lot of ground today, so let me bring it up several levels. Q2 results and our continued focus are creating -- are centered on effectively implementing a sound and consistent strategy. So let me remind you what that is. First, it's Services-led growth: BPO, ITO, Document Outsourcing. Profitable leadership with -- from Document Technology, investing where the markets have investment growth potential; cash generating annuity-based business model; consistent EPS expansion; and financial strength to invest in building value for Xerox and in building value for you.","James H. Lesko","Thanks, Ursula. That concludes our call today. If you have further questions, please contact me or any member of our Investor Relations team. Thank you. Have a good day.","Operator","Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"22734":["Xerox Corp. (NYSE:XRX) Q1 2015 Earnings Call April 24, 2015 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Ursula M.

She is joined by Kathy Mikells, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com\/investor. At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and\/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without the expressed permission of Xerox. After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.","During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which, by their nature, address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein.","Ms. Burns, you may begin the call.","Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, and thanks for joining our call. Today, we reported our first quarter results and provided full year guidance lowering expectations. I'll start with a brief reminder of our direction and then provide an overview of our Q1 performance. Kathy will review the financials and then we'll take your questions. Our diversified portfolio, strong Annuity business and solid free cash flow enabled us to participate and invest in the attractive markets that will drive growth. Services represents 56% of our total revenue and we expect that proportion to continue to grow.","We are the leader in diversified business process services and we are maintaining leadership in Document Technology. Over the last few years, we have taken significant steps to lay the foundation for sustainable, long-term success. We are differentiating ourselves by incorporating greater automation and intelligence in our solutions and products, all with the goal of helping our clients better manage their critical business processes.","As an example, we recently launched the Midas+ readmission forecaster, an advanced analytics healthcare solution to help hospitals drive quality improvement around patient care and reduce Medicare penalties for excess hospital readmissions. Additionally, we introduced our new mobility analytics platform which makes it significantly easier for transport and parking operators to understand and even predict commuter needs. VINCI Park, the world's leading parking space provider, is testing the system in a town in the suburbs of Paris.","Within Document Technology, we retained our number one position in equipment revenue market share for the 21st straight quarter, and we launched eight new products plus workflow solutions, reinforcing our leadership in mobile printing, inkjet technology, and digital color.","Lastly, our solid balance sheet and strong free cash flow along with the proceeds from the pending ITO divestiture will enable us to continue to deliver strong shareholder returns. We have returned more than 50% of free cash flow to shareholders over the last four years and plan to do the same this year by repurchasing up to $1 billion in shares and returning approximately $300 million to shareholders in dividends. At the same time, we will continue to invest in our business organically and through acquisitions. Now let's look at our performance in the quarter.","In the first quarter, we reported total revenue of $4.5 billion, down 6%, 2% in constant currency. And we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.21. Earnings were in line with our guidance, but the performance of our Services business was below our expectations, principally because of implementation issues in certain legacy Health Enterprise platform accounts. It's important to note that many areas of our Services business performed quite well in the quarter, this includes Document Outsourcing and several of our commercial vertical industry groups.","We continue to perform well in Commercial Healthcare. As many of you may have seen, we finalized the New York Medicaid contract that we were awarded last year. We have invested in advance to ensure our good start, and we look forward to working with the state to serve their Medicaid population. That said, in Services, we have more work to do to improve our financial performance. We continue to align our go-to-market resources along vertical industries, and we're investing in sales coverage and training.","At the same time, we're focused on driving more consistent delivery and capturing efficiencies through our new operating model. And specifically within our Health Enterprise accounts, we have taken action to address the issues. We continue to add expertise in the most critical areas of this business. Our operating performance and delivery quality continue to improve, and I'm confident in the Services and Healthcare teams. Kathy will go into more detail on the financials in a moment. And we can have additional discussion during the Q&A.","Our Document Technology results, which included the increased impact from foreign currency, largely met our expectations. It continues to be a business where we generate strong profits and cash. In quarter one, we delivered shareholder value by repurchasing shares, supporting our dividend program, and acquiring Intrepid Learning Systems (sic) [Intrepid Learning Solutions] to enhance our services capabilities.","Now, I'll turn it over to Kathy, who will provide more details on the quarter and cover guidance.","Kathryn Mikells - Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. We delivered Q1 EPS in the middle of our range with solid cash flow of $113 million. However, as Ursula mentioned, the quarter was challenging in many respects. Some challenges have been contemplated such as negative currency impacts, higher pension expense, and, in Services, the timing of investments relative to improved productivities from our global capabilities.","However, we failed to accurately call the incremental financial pressure we're experiencing in our Government Healthcare business from the rollout of our Health Enterprise Medicaid platform. Our delivery quality and operating performance continue to improve, but the financials were a clear signal that we have more work ahead. I'll take you through more details on that when I cover the Services segment, but first let me walk you through the total company results for the quarter.","Total revenue in the quarter was down 6% at actual currency and 2% at constant currency as growth in Services was offset by declines in Document Technology. The negative currency impact of 4 points in the quarter was at the high end of our expectations and reflected the continued strengthening of the dollar within the quarter.","Gross margin of 31.2% was down 30 basis points year-over-year driven by Services. RD&E was modestly lower year-over-year, driven by reductions in Document Technology. SAG in absolute dollar terms was lower year-over-year, driven by currency. However, as a percent of revenue, SAG was up 70 basis points year-over-year to 20.5% as productivity benefits were more than offset by higher pension expense and the investments in Services.","As a result, our first quarter operating margin decreased 110 basis points year-over-year and operating profit declined 18% with the largest drivers being pension expense, the financial pressure from our Health Enterprise implementations and currency.","Moving down the income statement, adjusted other net expense was $5 million lower year-over-year. Within that, lower gains on sales of assets and higher currency losses were offset by lower restructuring costs and lower interest expense. Equity income was $34 million in the quarter, down $8 million year-over-year, driven by the impact of negative translation currency. Our Q1 adjusted tax rate of 24.5% was at the low end of our range and up 4 percentage points year-over-year. Adjusted EPS of $0.21 was at the midpoint of our guidance and $0.05 lower year-over-year, driven by the operating profit decline.","I'll now move to Services segment to review those results in a little more detail. Services revenue declined 3% and was up 1% at constant currency, which was a bit shy of where we expected to come in. Document Outsourcing constant currency growth up 2% was in line with our expectation. BPO growth up 1% at constant currency was a bit light of what we were targeting, with the Health Enterprise platform implementations producing less revenue than we had anticipated. We continue to see good BPO growth in Commercial Healthcare and other commercial industry verticals.","We anticipate our revenue growth rate will improve in the second half as we lap the impact of last year's larger contract losses and begin to ramp the New York Medicaid and Florida Tolling deals. M&A also remains a variable factor to growth depending on timing of acquisitions. Our renewal rate in the quarter was 91%, evidence that overall we're delivering well for our clients. I should note that we are now including Document Outsourcing in our renewal rate in addition to BPO. Overall, it was a really strong renewal quarter.","Total signings in the quarter were down 13%, driven by both lower new business signings and lower renewal opportunities. New business signings declined 26% year-over-year. We mentioned on our last call that we've aligned our sales force to specific industry verticals. We recently moved our Document Outsourcing sales force into the same structure to better enable cross-selling opportunities.","We are continuing to invest in increased sales coverage and training, which takes time to yield results and should positively impact new business signings as we move through 2015. Additionally, our signings did not include the New York Medicaid contract, which was finalized after the end of the quarter; and the new Florida Tolling contract which is still pending. These new signings will reverse the downward signings trend this quarter.","Turning to margin, segment margin was 7.5% in the quarter, which was down 110 basis points year-over-year and well below our objective of modest year-over-year improvement. As referenced earlier, the driver of the Services margin miss was lower revenue and more costs than anticipated with our Health Enterprise platform implementation. California had the largest impact on our results in the quarter. We successfully implemented the first phase at the end of last year, however, recent estimates to deliver the remaining phases are higher.","We also had start-up costs in New York with no revenue offset as the contract didn't get finalized until April. Margin excluding those impacts would have been up 10 basis points year-over-year, so a very modest improvement. We saw margin improvements in a number of lines of business including Document Outsourcing as well as some of our commercial verticals. At the same time, we're continuing to invest in our industry and capability operating model, sales coverage and training as well as some new offerings, which Ursula discussed. As we move through the year, we expect to see our investments mature and produce more value. We should also see further productivity gains as we rollout our initiatives across our operating groups.","Before moving on, I'm going to take a minute to further discuss the financial challenges we're facing in our Health Enterprise implementation. With the exception of the New York Medicaid contract, these deals were signed before we finished development of the core software platform. We had delayed finishing the new platform and meeting client delivery dates resulting in cost increases. In the case of California, as the new project plan was built out further, we recognized that the cost to complete the entire program would increase, which triggered an adjustment in the quarter. In contrast, New York was bid after the Health Enterprise platform was completed and we've been investing ahead to position us for a strong start.","Operationally, the platform is performing well in the states where it's been rolled out and we're progressing on the implementations in other states. However, we have more work ahead to turnaround the financial performance. We're taking a number of additional actions to improve the picture and have adjusted our expectations to reflect what we believe is required to meet our customer commitment. This is the main driver of our revised Services margin guidance, which I'll get to more detail when I review guidance in a few minutes.","Now I'm going to turn to Document Technology. Document Technology revenue in the quarter was largely in line with our guidance with adverse currency coming in at the high-end of our expectations. On a constant currency basis, revenue was down 6% which was consistent with last year's rate of decline. Currency was a 4 point drag on revenue with revenue at actual currency down 10%. While we don't typically include developing markets in our constant currency calculation, we are impacted when currencies devalue quickly. In the first quarter, revenue at constant currency would have been down 5% if we excluded the impact of currency on developing markets.","Relative to our performance in the fourth quarter, we saw some moderation of equipment revenue declines at constant currency as we began to see some benefits from the second half 2014 new product launches. Offsetting this were modestly-worse Annuity revenue declines driven by supplies revenue declines in the Entry segment. Looking at Entry, it continues to be impacted by economic weakness and uncertainty in developing markets, especially Eurasia and Brazil. We anticipate some improvement in the rate of declines as benefit from new products grow but, overall, we continue to expect economic headwinds to weigh on Entry. Mid-range mono and color activity were relatively flat year-over-year and overall mid-range results showed improvement. High-end continues to show good Annuity revenue performance, although equipment was weaker in the quarter driven by the timing of new product launches as well as a couple of deals slipping into the second quarter.","Document Technology margins were down 110 basis points with almost the entire decline driven by higher pension expense. As previously discussed, the higher pension expense this year is a function of higher pension settlement given lower discount rates as well as last year's mortality table change. So overall, core Document Tech business performance continues to be strong and we're focused on improving top line by capitalizing on our growth opportunities in the market.","Before I go through the cash flow, I'd like to remind everyone that while our ITO results are included in discontinued operations pending the sale to Atos, ITO is still in our operating cash flow until we close the transaction. ITO was a use of $13 million in the quarter and a use of $32 million in free cash flow. Overall, cash flow from operations was $113 million in the quarter, solidly positive and reflecting the progress that we've made smoothing working capital impacts over the past couple of years. A couple of highlights to note within operating cash flow.","The add-back for depreciation is lower than last year by about $50 million and reflects in part the write-down of the carrying value of the ITO assets to fair value now that it's being held for sale. Working capital is a use of cash which is consistent with our normal seasonality and largely consistent with 2014. Inventory was a larger use this year, reflecting a higher level of in-transit inventory and timing of sales. Additionally, accounts receivable was a higher use this year, primarily due to the strong fourth quarter collections, particularly in Services.","Moving down the cash flow statement. Investing cash flows were a $98 million use, including $95 million spent on CapEx in the quarter and $28 million on acquisition. Cash flow from financing was a use of $485 million, which included net debt payments of approximately $150 million, $216 million spent on share repurchases, and $76 million used for preferred and common stock dividends.","Now I'm going to quickly go over our capital structure. We ended the first quarter with $7.6 billion in debt. During the quarter, we retired $1 billion in senior notes and issued $400 million in five year notes with a coupon of 2.75% and $250 million in 20 year notes with a coupon of 4.8%. Applying 7-to-1 leverage on customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt at the end of the first quarter was $3.9 billion, leaving core debt of $3.7 billion. We manage our core debt to maintain credit metrics consistent with our investment grade rating. So our capital structure remains pretty stable.","If we go onto the next slide, I'll review where we're at in terms of capital allocation. Our capital allocation plans for the year are unchanged and, as previously communicated, incorporates the redeployment of the expected net proceeds of roughly $850 million from the ITO sale which should close later this quarter. On share repurchases, we spent $216 million in the quarter and continued to plan to spend about $1 billion for purchasing stock this year. We continue to view our shares as attractively priced and a good investment.","On acquisitions, we closed one acquisition in the quarter, Intrepid Learning Systems (sic) [Intrepid Learning Solutions] for $28 million. We continue to look to spend up to $900 million in 2015 and plan to rollover any unspent funds into 2016. Acquisitions are a priority for us as we believe it's an important element of our portfolio management strategy to evolve our portfolio to higher value services as well as supporting BPO expansion internationally.","We're very disciplined in our approach. Our pipeline is strong, and we've actively considered more deals year-to-date than last year. We're working to further build our business development capabilities so we can be more acquisitive and expand our pipeline of potential targets.","Now onto debt. We have one more tranche of debt coming due this year, $250 million in June. We expect debt to temporarily decline in conjunction with the receipt of the ITO proceeds and plan to complete additional refinancing activity as needed in the second half. We continue to expect to end the year at roughly $7.7 billion in debt.","And finally, on dividends, we spent just under $300 million, which contemplates the recent 12% dividend increase we announced on our last earnings call.","Before I turn it back to Ursula, I'd like to summarize our expectations for the second quarter and for the full year. For the second quarter, we expect adjusted EPS in the range of $0.21 to $0.23, with constant currency revenue down about 2 points and currency pressuring top line by another 5 points, reflecting the dollar strengthening a bit from the first quarter. For Document Technology revenue, we expect the constant currency rate of decline to modestly improve from the first quarter with a negative currency impact of 5 points to 6 points. Margin should be within our 11% to 13% range for the year, up sequentially but down year-over-year driven by the increased pension cost and currency.","For Services, we expect the second quarter year-over-year revenue growth to be roughly flat at constant currency, with a negative currency impact of 4 points to 5 points. Slow growth reflects softer signings as well as the timing of new contract ramp versus lost contract runoff and slower acquisition activity. We anticipate second quarter margins will be approximately flat sequentially, reflecting period compare headwinds in Document Outsourcing, continued higher cost to implement our Health Enterprise platforms, and incremental investments not yet fully offset by productivity gains.","Document Outsourcing margins continue to be strong with normal year-over-year compares in the second half. For the full year, at constant currency, we expect Services revenue will now be at the low-end of the 2% to 4% range, no change to Document Technology with revenue expected to decline 4% to 5% and total company revenue now expected to be down about a point year-over-year. We expect currency will have a negative 4 point impact to total revenue for the year. We're maintaining our Document Technology margin expectations but reducing our Services margin guidance to 8.5% to 9% due to higher costs within our Health Enterprise implementation and not as much net benefit from enhanced productivity relative to investments. In total, we expect this to yield adjusted EPS of $0.95 to $1.01.","To conclude, while we are disappointed with the guidance revision, we are making decisions to the long-term to ensure that we're taking the necessary actions to drive sustainable growth and margin improvement in the future.","With that, I'll hand it back over to you, Ursula.","Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Kathy. I want to get to your questions so I'll summarize quickly. Although earnings met expectations, it was a challenging quarter. As Kathy detailed a moment ago, we are lowering our full year guidance. We know we have work to do to achieve sustainable long-term success. I'm confident in our business strategy, our strong portfolio, and our ability to succeed in the many industries that we serve. Going forward, in Services, we are focused on revenue and margin expansion. Improved signings and executing on our new operating model will help us there.","Document Technology continues to execute well and we remain focused on leading in the most attractive segments of the market. Overall, we anticipate positive results from the changes that we've made and I'm certain that the actions that we're taking today will ensure a healthy Xerox for tomorrow and beyond.","So thank you for listening and now I'll turn it over to Leslie.","Leslie F. Varon - Vice President-Finance & Controller","Thanks, Ursula. Joining Ursula and Kathy today is Bob Zapfel, Head of our Services business. Also let me point out we that have several supplemental slides at the end of our deck. They provide more financial detail to support today's presentation and complement our prepared remarks. For the Q&A, I'd ask participants to limit follow-on and multi-part questions so we can get to everyone. At the end of our Q&A session, I'll turn it back to Ursula for closing comments.","Operator, please open the line for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Bill Shope from Goldman Sachs.","William Charles Shope - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, great. Thank you. I have a question on the Services segment in general. The volatility and the unexpected shortfalls we've seen on Services margins has obviously been a problem for some time now for, different reasons for different quarters. But I guess when we look at this quarter specifically and the cost overruns for the California case, what safeguards are being put in place to ensure that we don't see this happen again with other contracts that maybe we can't see from the outside? And why aren't we seeing more substantial restructuring to deal with what appears to be a pretty uncertain margin path of this business overall?","Robert K. Zapfel - Executive Vice President, President-Xerox Services","Okay. Bill, it's Bob. Let me start. So relative to \u2013 actions relative to our Enterprise platform with Government Healthcare, we are taking a number of actions to try to drive improved visibility and predictability there. We're increasing the leadership focus and we've added additional external talent. These are five accounts. So this is not across our broad portfolio. This is the implementation of a new system and in the five states we talked about at the investor conference, we've added project management oversight in each of these projects to try to drive better predictability.","We're working to consolidate the customized instances into a standardized platform that would then be less costly to implement and manage going forward. We're lining up additional partners to help us with software development integration capability and trying to better leverage low cost resources for platform development. And we're pursuing add-on work with a number of these clients to give us some incremental revenue.","Relative to your question on restructuring, we were down 2,000 people from the end of the fourth quarter to the end of the first quarter in our Services business overall. So we're just trying to manage to drive improved productivity broadly across our Services portfolio.","William Charles Shope - Goldman Sachs & Co.","If I could just add onto that, when we look at sort of the metrics you're judging this stabilization by, I mean is this something that you expect by the time we get to 2016 we're back on track? Obviously, we saw your full-year margin guidance, so we get some color on the path you're looking at for this year. But sort of what are you sort of putting in front of you as targets to get back on track and show that some of these safeguards are actually bearing fruit?","Kathryn Mikells - Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","So overall, in terms of some of the incremental actions that we're taking to make sure that we've fully considered what's going to be needed, we've obviously made more room in our margin guidance. So Health Enterprise costs generally expected to also be a year-over-year headwind for us in the second quarter. We've added additional, both financial management resources and expanded the financial teams in this area that sit over the accounts, specifically in California, which is where we had the big adjustment for the quarter.","As we look out to 2016, the most important influence is getting more and more of these implementations under our belt, right? So Bob mentioned, we have five accounts, two have already been implemented, another one will be implemented next year. So getting these implementations under our belt where the contracts were signed, three plus years ago is what we really need to get behind us. And you can see that we've taken big adjustments on California to really reflect the expectation of higher go-forward costs.","William Charles Shope - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's it for me. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross from Cross Research.","Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC","Thank you very much. I have another Services oriented question. Bob, sort of taking a step back because in the last question you discussed a lot on the healthcare side. Can you talk a bit about what you're seeing in the other parts of the business, and how you're sort of thinking about some of those areas in terms of growth and margin opportunity once we sort of get through this healthcare issue? And then I have a question on acquisitions. Thanks.","Robert K. Zapfel - Executive Vice President, President-Xerox Services","Thanks, Shannon. Yes, I would say, as you and others have got good visibility to, we've moved to this new industry go-to-market and global capability model. And I would say that early indications are very positive on both elements of that. So we're finding \u2013 the pipeline data doesn't look great quarter-to-quarter, but we found that from January, February, March, we had an improved pipeline as we put new resources in place. We bolstered up the sales team that we think will drive to improvements in our second-half results. In the global capability model, if you think back to our kind of margin improvement track, we think we're going get very good yield out of that. So overall, I would say that we've got positive signs relative to the model in general. And the customer feedback has largely been favorable.","Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC","Okay. And then can you talk a bit about \u2013 I'm not sure who wants to take it, but from an acquisition standpoint, $900 million, you've talked about you made a very small acquisition during the first quarter. What kind of acquisitions, sort of what size, I mean is this something where we can actually assume it will get done this year because I know you're talking about pushing cash now into 2016. I'm just looking at with the stock down double-digits right now, perhaps share repurchase might be a better use of cash? Or just how are you sort of thinking about cash as we go forward here? Thank you.","Kathryn Mikells - Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Okay. So this is Kathy. Overall, if you look at our activity kind of year-over-year, I would describe us as having more activity this year than last year. Now, activity doesn't always immediately translate into getting things done. But that activity has been more focused on, I think, what I described on our last call, as chunkier-sized deals, right? So we are looking to not just do the deal size of the one deal that we did this quarter, but looking at things that are a little larger which can make more of a difference for us.","We're targeting specific areas. I mean, when you look across our portfolio, we've got a great business in Commercial Healthcare. There are places we'd like to continue to build out that business. Transportation is an area of target for us. We've talked about the continued move into workflow within our Document Outsourcing group; so that's an area. And then as we look to continue to expand internationally, we do need a bigger footprint and acquisitions can help us in that space as well. So they're, as you can imagine, tough to call, it's tough to call in which quarter are we actually going land things. But we're certainly generating more activity and looking to do larger deals.","And then in the second part of your question, so what about share repurchases, we are committed to doing about $1 billion of share repurchases this year. We know M&A timing is hard to call. It's important for us as we continue to look at evolving our portfolio. And so if we don't spend the $900 million, we will roll it over into next year.","Leslie F. Varon - Vice President-Finance & Controller","Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. Just on the healthcare side. I just I guess heard the incremental $30 million in spend. I guess that was on top of the $20 million maybe last year. So I'm just curious in the hindsight here, is this just \u2013 I heard the platform implementation issues you called out. But in hindsight, was it a missed pricing issue just thinking about what went wrong, I get, again, the implementation problems but could this have been resolved if you had priced these contracts differently? And then I just want to pull that forward into New York and just being confident here that you have a good line of sight into the ramp there at the price that you wanted?","Kathryn Mikells - Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. And so if you look at the situation in California which triggered the adjustment that we took this quarter, we had made a decision with the state of California to do this in a staged implementation rather than a single cutover, right, and that caused us to have to basically kind of restage and rework our project plan. As we got into the further details of what that was going to cost, right, the cost for the overall implementation went up. And that triggered us to have to take an adjustment this quarter. So we scrubbed much further what that project plan was going to look like. It's the right answer for the clients and for us to do a staged implementation. It reduces the risk of execution. But at the end of the day, we now understand that it's going to cost more. And this is a contract that was signed years, years ago and in advance of our standard platform being completed.","If I contrast that then because you asked about New York, New York is very different because New York we actually bid a standard contract, right. And in addition to bidding a standard contract, we were awarded this contract last May. We started standing up resources towards the end of the third quarter in order to really get us on a right track with New York, so we're very excited about New York. And it's a different situation than I'll say the legacy implementations that we had pre-New York.","Robert K. Zapfel - Executive Vice President, President-Xerox Services","If I would just add on New York, I think the dominant difference is that we were able to bid an already-working system which as opposed to what we did in the other states we hadn't already completed the core software asset. And as Kathy mentioned, we have been in front of the contract being finalized. We have been investing to ensure a very rapid start, which on the other implementations we didn't start until after the contract was signed. So we're very optimistic that we're well positioned to deliver well both for New York and for our shareholders with that opportunity.","Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We were focused on making sure that California for sure, but New York very specifically in this conversation starts well and we \u2013 before we had revenue, knowing that we were investing before we had revenue, we took that risk because it's really important. The long game here is very important to keep an eye on. And so we took a hit in the quarter for New York as well because we didn't get it signed in the quarter but it's the right thing to do, but we got signed, obviously after the quarter.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just \u2013 no, that's good to know. Just two quick follow-ups just on the Florida Tolling, I know there were some disputes in the past on that. Is that getting closer to being done? Sounds like it could happen in the second quarter. And then just any client feedback on the ITO divestiture in terms of feedback. Just any update there would be great. Thank you.","Robert K. Zapfel - Executive Vice President, President-Xerox Services","Yes. On Florida, it is getting closer. It is not yet complete, but it is getting closer. And on the ITO, the ITO transaction with Atos, the feedback has been very positive. The consent process that both for the pure IT outsourcing clients and for the large volume of clients that we have BPO relationships with that then Atos will become a subsidiary provider has also gone very well. So we're pleased with that.","Leslie F. Varon - Vice President-Finance & Controller","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citigroup.","James Dickey Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks very much. And I know a lot of the question has been on the Services. Seeing how that's the strategy of your company and really one of the key go-forward vehicles, I think it's very appropriate. And so when we think about the new reset to goals of operating margins of 8.5% to 9%, previously you've said your long-term goal is 10% to 12%. Is that still valid? Has that been now you'll have to revisit that altogether? And if so, what timeline should we think? I think most people think of long-term as kind of two years or three years. You can actually reach it. It's not some far-flung dream out there. So can you address that please?","Robert K. Zapfel - Executive Vice President, President-Xerox Services","Well, we're not going to do the \u2013 all of the normal guidance stuff for next year until the November conference. But my view is clearly that that long-term goal is still our target. So I don't add. There's nothing that I've \u2013 we're disappointed with our operating performance, and we've shared that. But I do not have a view that that's not an attainable long-term margin perspective for us with the set of actions that we're taking relative to portfolio management, go-to-market by industry global capabilities. So I don't expect us to change our view on that.","Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And if I may, I'll just add that we're talking long-term in my lifetime. And I mean that really, really clearly. We definitely take a step to the side today and this year, but getting to 10% to 12% is something that we can do in the foreseeable future, in the near-term not in the long-term.","James Dickey Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Perfect. And then my follow up is regarding the margins of 8.5% to 9%, am I correct that folds in the New York, the California, the not-yet-closed Florida but likely to close contract? And is there anything about accounting, Kathy, that we need to be aware of like percentage of completion versus booking upfront costs to invest today that have been in a few quarters just the way you recognize the profitability of it in a couple quarters becomes less risky of another disappointment like we saw today?","Kathryn Mikells - Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, so as much as I don't like to talk about accounting on these calls, I'm happy to take a little bit of diversion to do that. I mentioned we took an adjustment for California. So when we're implementing the platform, we are using percent of completion accounting. Right? And in that case, as we got in and did the more detailed planning for the now phased implementation and costed out that more detailed plan, that's what triggered us to take the adjustment in the quarter. That adjustment in the quarter is not all cash that kind of lands in the quarter. Right? That's a software platform that we'll be delivering over the course of this year and next kind of through these stages. So I would call that a pretty isolated adjustment, not the kind of adjustment that we would expect we'd be taking on an ongoing basis.","And it's part of the reason earlier I talked about the fact that this area gets less risky for us as we complete more and more of these implementations with the states where we signed contracts three plus years ago. Once we get beyond the implementation, right, then the economics move to, I'll call it, the regular Medicaid transaction processing. Right? And in addition to that, we typically, and even in the couple of clients that we've already cut over with the new platform, we typically have the opportunity to then do add-on things and get additional revenue from those clients, which we have been successfully doing and will continue to do.","Robert K. Zapfel - Executive Vice President, President-Xerox Services","And just on other part of your question, so New York and Florida are contemplated then within the guidance that we've shared.","James Dickey Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Kathryn Mikells - Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. A question for both Ursula and Kathy. This last round of investments in Services and prior investments in Services have been predominantly focused on Government Healthcare. Strategically, Ursula, when you think about returns on investment, how do you think about the long-term opportunity in Government Healthcare and when can we begin to see returns from these investments in terms of incremental revenues and profits? And then, Kathy, related to healthcare expenses, how do you think about the staging of expenses related to the New York contract, and in light of potential unforeseen investments, does the updated guidance range build in room for multiple scenarios? And then I have a follow-up.","Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, so the first part of the question is important for you to ask and for us to get out on this call, and just lay a foundation, Government Healthcare is something that, I think, that Bob said earlier, we've been in for more than 40 years. And it is a business that will be around and growing with a lot of focus because of the aging population, regulation changes in the United States, you know, all of the foundational elements. We make, in this business, above average margins. This is above average Services margins in this business. It's important to know that. And that we are very successful and liked by our clients. We do business in many, many states. We service millions of recipients benefit from those states. And it's a very profitable business for us.","Once we get past laying down the platform, which is really complicated, and what we did for good, for better, for ugly, but the facts are that we actually implemented a brand new platform in these five states that readies us for the future of aging and new regulation et cetera. It's been more challenging then even I would like for it to be, but it is one that with many \u2013 with continuous review we keep coming down on the fact that this is a good business, and a business that can be profitable for sure. It is already in the historic counts and we just have to make it that way in the new accounts.","Kathryn Mikells - Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","And I have one quick add and I'll get to your question with regard to sort of staging on the Health Enterprise accounts. Overall, when we talk about investments in Services outside of our Government Healthcare group, we're investing in things like sales leadership, training, tools, new offerings, this shift to our new industry business group sort of vertical approach in adding leadership in there. So when we talk about investments it's clearly outside of the Government Healthcare solution business as well.","With regard to kind of the staging, so clearly the first quarter, we took a big adjustment in California. As I described that's a pretty isolated instance. If I look over 2015 for sort of the pattern of what we're expecting in the Health Enterprise accounts, I would describe this as first half sort of heavy on incremental costs and expecting in the second half that we're actually going to get a reasonable amount of pickup. Now it's still going be a drag on a full year basis. Right? So if you look at the adjustment that we made overall to our margins, originally when we gave guidance back in November, we said we thought we were going to get 25 basis points to 50 basis points largely candidly from these Health Enterprise accounts improving. Right?","I would describe that now on a full year basis embedded in our guidance is taking into consideration we might actually see a little bit of dilution overall on our margins for the year. So we thought \u2013 we think as we've revised our guidance that we've really taken into consideration that some of these things are tough to call. They're pretty complicated projects. And we need to make sure that we have room if there's any changes and we've taken that into account.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","That's helpful.","Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Kathy said in her \u2013 sorry \u2013 I think Kathy said in her notes that without the health accounts in the first quarter we would have been up 10 basis points in margin. And this year, as Kathy said, we don't \u2013 we expected 25 basis points to 50 basis points of improvement so our margin expansion to come from Health Enterprises. As she said again I'm just repeating it, so we can actually get it clear. That will not happen; that 25 basis points to 50 basis points will not happen. It will probably be a little bit of a headwind for us in 2015 not a tailwind. And so the margin adjustment that we've taken for the full company and for Services comprehends that pressure that we're not going to make the progress that we wanted to make in Government Health from a financial perspective. The great news about this operationally is that we are doing fairly well, I think, across all of the accounts, there's some struggles in maybe one, but we're doing fairly well operationally across these accounts.","George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Got it.","Leslie F. Varon - Vice President-Finance & Controller","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman from BMO Capital Markets.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hi. Bob. For you, please. If you could talk a little bit about the new business signings away from New York and Florida, continues to trend weak. And if you could just talk about why you think the new business signings down 26% year-over-year and 17% trailing 12 months. Why they're weak? And what's the plan to try to right that ship?","Robert K. Zapfel - Executive Vice President, President-Xerox Services","Okay. Thanks, Keith. So they're weak for a couple of reasons. I mean, not getting the bigger deals is the primary cause. So you look on a trailing 12-month basis and having \u2013 it's not just not having New York or Florida in the compare, but not having anything that's really substantially large deal, certainly hurts those trailing 12 months compares. Going forward, obviously, we expect both of those, New York being finalized, and Florida, that will help our dynamics through the second quarter.","And I think in the second-half of the year, the changes that we've made relative to the industry go-to-market model, we have been beefing up the sales force, we're \u2013 90% of the key sales positions now filled. That's up from where we were at the time of the investor conference. We expect to get the improvement in the second-half coming from the industry go-to-market model, the investments that we've made in leadership positions and the investments that we've made in increasing our sales capacity.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. The corollary is \u2013 or the follow-on question is, are you becoming more concentrated? If you're relying more on the New York MMIS deal and the Florida Toll roads as you look out over the course of the year, it would seem to suggest more concentration. Therefore, if there's any issues in those contracts or other large deals from a profitability, does it put you more at risk for future margin-related issues because, in fact, you're getting more concentration in your customer base without the new business signings?","Robert K. Zapfel - Executive Vice President, President-Xerox Services","Well, I would say that if you look at having two deals of that size in your overall signings portfolio, that is not an atypical level of concentration. So I mean, again, I think the weakness over a trailing 12-month is not having anything big in that set of signings. When we move and both grow the smaller deal component and have those in what's been signed, that would be to me a more typical kind of mix of signings. So I don't think \u2013 obviously, when you add big clients, then that individual client is kind of a bigger share of your revenue stream. But from an overall signings mix, no, I don't think a portfolio for the year that would include Florida, New York and then the rest of our book of business would be more concentrated than 2012, 2013 kind of what our historical rate's been.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay.","Kathryn Mikells - Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. And I would just add onto that, Keith. I mean, if you put those two aside and we just looked at the composition of our signings kind of up until this point in time, I would describe our book of signings as very diversified across our industry vertical.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay.","Kathryn Mikells - Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","So the addition of these two contracts doesn't really sort of sway things really materially across the portfolio.","Robert K. Zapfel - Executive Vice President, President-Xerox Services","Yeah, both diversified across our industry verticals and across our offering. So maybe wrongly, but this is not a big worry for us at this point in terms of concentration risk of where our signings come from.","Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay.","Leslie F. Varon - Vice President-Finance & Controller","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah from Brean Capital.","Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. And thanks for taking the questions. Just two if I could, Kathy and maybe Ursula. The first one is, could you list order of magnitude on the $0.05 guide down? How much comes from each of the factors from FX and then from Services revenue and from the cost side of the Services equation? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.","Kathryn Mikells - Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Okay. So overall, in terms of the $0.05, I would characterize most of it as coming from the additional costs that we're seeing in the Health Enterprise accounts. With regard to FX, if I look at how rates changed, kind of where we are today versus the last time we were on this call in January, the biggest change that we saw was in the euro, which has weakened by about 4%. It was partially offset by the yen weakening, kind of which helps us a little. And so net-net, I would say, that's a negative, but it's not kind of materially a negative. And then I would say, very modestly, a little bit lighter on productivity relative to investment. So how that ramps over the course of the year for us is a little bit lighter. But the overwhelming majority of the $0.05 move is for the additional costs we're anticipating in the Health Enterprise platform implementation.","Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC","Got it. Thanks, Kathy. That's helpful. And then to that end, just with regards to the dynamic that you're seeing from Health Enterprise platform, Kathy, you mentioned that the biggest \u2013 the best way to sort of handle the situation is just to get the other three stood up and running and normalized. Does that mean that you guys could continue to be at risk? Or I guess what I want to \u2013 the way to ask it maybe is, can you provide us the appropriate context of which to sort of gauge, and how you're gauging, what the risk to the cost side ongoingly has given that you still have three that stand up and that the contract...","Kathryn Mikells - Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Yeah.","Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC","...was signed previously?","Kathryn Mikells - Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Sure. We have one that's cutting over later this year, I mean we're pretty close on it.","Robert K. Zapfel - Executive Vice President, President-Xerox Services","Right.","Kathryn Mikells - Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","And so we're pretty close to the finish line on that one. And the closer you get to the finish line, basically, the less risk you have. We talked about California and we made a big adjustment for California. Last year, we actually made an adjustment for the one other state that hasn't been cut over yet, so we had sort of resized what we thought our cost expectations were going to be. So I would characterize as we've already taken a hit on California, we've adjusted the other state that hasn't yet been implemented and we're close on the one that we're going to cut over this year.","Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And New York doesn't have the same type of risks. So we think that we've gotten most of the ordinary course of business contract rollout costs associated with the rollout comprehended.","Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC","Okay, got it. Got it. Thanks.","Kathryn Mikells - Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex from Morgan Stanley.","Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking the question. I guess I'll pig pile on MMIS for a question. I've seen a number of different comments out in the press about it being on a pretty aggressive timeline. So, first of all, congratulations on getting it finally across the goal line. And then as we think about the schedule going forward and that it may be an aggressive schedule, I guess the question is, how does that timeline compare to, I guess, comparable contracts? And I know you've been pre-spending, but what sort of kind of, I guess, benchmarks do we need to consider going forward, as you finally start to implement the contract?","Robert K. Zapfel - Executive Vice President, President-Xerox Services","Yeah, this is Bob. So let me try to address that. So it is a shorter time line than historic contracts, that's the reason we started investing more than six months into advance. So we \u2013 if you measured the timeline from date of finalization, it's shorter. If you measured the timeline from date that we started pre-investing, it's aggressive, but reasonable. And we think that, again, it's a different situation in our view compared to the ones that we have previously done with the Health Enterprise platform because we are starting from a working code base rather than starting from something that was still in design. So it's a \u2013 it \u2013 while it is a more aggressive time period than you might look at some historical artifacts, the combination of both those two factors, starting in advance and working off an existing software asset, we believe that makes it a timeline that we'll be able to achieve for the state.","Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, Bob, how does that match up with any kind of issues you might have had with previous contracts where you've -maybe you've already had this code base already developed? I mean previously, have most of the contracts been on the application development side? Or has it been on back-end integration? Or what kind of gives you the confidence that in an aggressive time line you can meet those goals?","Robert K. Zapfel - Executive Vice President, President-Xerox Services","Yeah, I'm sorry, Brian. So really the previous contracts we have not yet completed the code base. So there's been a three-year-plus gap between the last one and now in New York. So the book of business that we signed previously, we had some of the code base solidified, but some of it's still, if you will, in design mode. And for New York, it's not as though we don't have some level of customization to do. It's not just taking a software asset and making no modifications or changes to it. But it is largely often existing proven code base that we're running in one of the other states.","Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. Maybe I can sneak one in on the printing side of the business. I guess bookings seem a little weak. And I think you've noted on the previous quarter that we're kind of caught a little bit of a product upgrade cycle. I guess maybe can we put that in context of what to expect for growth there through the rest of the year given the product cycle and that there was only a little bit in last quarter, and bookings seemed a little bit light this Q?","Kathryn Mikells - Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, so what I would say is as you look at that, our expectations as we head into the second quarter is that we'll see a little bit better performance overall on high-end. That was weak in the first quarter. It's a place of, I'd say, generally strength for us from a product offering perspective and we also have other new products coming out in the second half in that area. And we certainly expect, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that Entry's going to continue to be weak. We expect it'll, I'll call it, modestly improve with new products helping but it's a big DMO-centric area. And DMO markets just continue to be weak economically.","Leslie F. Varon - Vice President-Finance & Controller","I think we have time for one last question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question for today comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha from Credit Suisse.","Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you. I know this has been asked in different ways. I just have a broad question on Services which is, if we go back over a long period of time, I think once upon a time Xerox stock just might...","Kathryn Mikells - Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Kulbinder, Kulbinder, I think you need to speak up. It's very difficult to hear you.","Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Can you hear me now?","Kathryn Mikells - Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Yes.","Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hello?","Kathryn Mikells - Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Yes.","Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Sorry about that. My question is over a long period of time Xerox once thought this Services business could do margins of almost 12%. We're a long way from that now. And I guess just is there anything more structural at hand here over the longer term competitive or otherwise, and is there any more kind of deeper strategic view going on so that we don't have these kind of continuous issues whether it's been a gradual step-down over many years, like whether it's addressing the cost base, rethinking the strategies, any of that going on? Or do you see this very much as just a kind of a normal onetime hit in 2015 from the Enterprise Health accounts? Many thanks.","Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, Kulbinder, it's a good question. I think a good last question as well. We obviously spend \u2013 leadership team, the board, we spend a lot of time looking at performance versus strategy to make sure that the loop is continually closed, and that we are on the right stack of mail.","Separating operational challenges are we on the right stack of mail for 10% to 12% margins, revenue growth overall, and being valuable to our clients. And the answer is, yes. We still believe that the fundamental strategy of diversified Services portfolio globalized, which we are still working on doing, that's supported by a good level of acquisitions in the areas that we're in. We are doing portfolio management and trimming out things that we're not great at and investing in areas that we're really good. That strategy still holds.","Document Technology as a good cash generator, good base for us to grow Services from. Also that strategy still holds. So I think with \u2013 we look at it all the time. We look at it against our financial goals and against our capabilities. We can get to 10% to 12% margins for sure. Government Healthcare is a place that we have to continue to focus and continue to improve. And hopefully not talk about a whole lot as we go on. We have to just get this stuff behind us.","New York, we think we have a good start. We have these five contracts et cetera, et cetera. So Government Health is the place that we're spending a lot of time on this call, and rightfully so. But the rest of the mix of the business that we have in the remainder of the strategy is one that absolutely still holds water and still works for us. And so \u2013 and I think it will work for the shareholders over time and that's what we're focused on.","Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","With that, I think I can actually transition to a close. And let me just thank all of you for taking the time to ask questions and listen to the call. We're working hard to advance our business objectives in 2015 and beyond.","Leslie F. Varon - Vice President-Finance & Controller","Thanks, Ursula. That concludes our call for today. If you have any further questioning, please contact me or any member of our Investor Relations team.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may now disconnect.

She is joined by Leslie Varon, Vice President and Interim Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are on the Web at www.xerox.com\/investor.","At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recordings and\/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without the express permission of Xerox. [Operator Instructions].","During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which by their nature address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein.","At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns, you may begin.","Ursula Burns","Good morning, everyone. Welcome to Xerox's third-quarter 2016 earnings conference call. At the beginning of the year we committed to an ambitious agenda that included delivering on our financial goals for 2015 while creating a new path forward that will make our businesses more agile, focused and competitive.","I am pleased to report that we are on track to meet all of these commitments and that we achieved solid financial results this quarter. Our third-quarter EPS was within our guidance range. Cash flow generation was strong, and we realized solid margins in both segments despite a challenging global market environment. At the same time, our strategic transformation and separation activities have accelerated significantly.","I want to emphasize that these actions are not just about delivering for the quarter or the year. Our strategic transformation program and separation are designed to fundamentally strengthen our businesses and align them closely with the demand of our clients and opportunities in the market. We are embedding productivity and cost efficiency into all areas of our business, which will benefit us for years to come. We're driving operational excellence and innovation to meet our clients' evolving needs. And we are establishing the new companies with talent, business strategies and operating models that will enable them to become more profitable and drive growth over the long-term.","You will hear much more about these initiatives and strategies, structures and financial plans of the two post-separation companies at their investor events in December. But I am pleased to have the leaders of our new companies, Jeff Jacobson and Ashok Vemuri, here with me today to answer questions about results in their respective businesses during the Q&A.","Before we turn to financial results, let me share some highlights of our progress towards separation. With two months to go before we complete the separation, we have passed a number of major milestones in the process. The rating agencies released updates on Xerox's credit ratings, which will continue to be investment-grade. Conduent Incorporated is expected to be a high-noninvestment-grade-rated company following the separation. These ratings are in line with our expectations.","Upon completion of the spin, Conduent will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, where Xerox will continue to trade. Additionally, we were excited to introduce Conduent's new logo and brand identity. Ashok selected Brian Walsh as the CFO of Conduent. Brian has 20 years of experience in Xerox's finance organization, spanning both operating and corporate roles, and he is currently the CFO of Xerox Services. He is a great fit for the role.","And last week, we announced seven of the nine directors that will serve on Conduent's board, as well as Conduent's named executive officers. With that, the majority of Conduent's leadership team and Board of Directors is in place. We're in the process of filling the remaining two board seats, and we will make those announcements as they become available.","All of this information about Conduent, along with updated information on its expected capitalization, pro forma financials, compensation plans and governance, was included in several amendments to Conduent's Form 10 registration statement.","For Xerox, Jeff is implementing a new, more streamlined operating model, and has identified the operations leaders for the standalone company, building on our strong, well-established infrastructure and executive team. Jeff continues to focus on filling the remaining executive roles and strengthening the bench, including identifying the right, high-quality individual for the CFO role. In the interim, Leslie Varon continues to provide strong leadership to our finance organization and will remain in her current role until we have a new CFO in place.","I should point out that, beyond senior executive appointments, both Jeff and Ashok have put in place the necessary leadership teams for the major corporate functions. We are now just two days away from what we call our soft separation phase. This involves separating our corporate functions, business infrastructure and IT systems into discrete capabilities for each company. It is a test run at operating independently for the new companies that will help us ensure a smooth day-one launch.","In short, we are moving rapidly toward our separation and remain on schedule to complete it by year-end. The benefits of our three-year strategic transformation program also continue to ramp across both businesses and can clearly be seen in our third-quarter performance. We remain on track to deliver $700 million in annualized savings from productivity and cost initiatives this financial year.","With that, I will move to our third-quarter results. As I said, this was a good quarter. We delivered adjusted earnings of $0.27 per share, which was within our guidance range and in line with the same period last year. Total revenue of $4.2 billion showed a 3% decline year over year, or 4% on an adjusted constant currency basis, which excludes the 2015 charge related to our Health Enterprise strategy change.","Operating margin was solid at 9.2%. We saw strong year-over-year margin expansion in our Services segment, driven by gains across our BPO businesses, while Document Technology margins remained strong.","Cash flow from operations was $370 million, reflecting a $99 million increase from prior year, and we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.4 billion as a result. Overall, our underlying results demonstrated ongoing progress in our productivity and cost savings initiatives and our ability to generate strong cash flows.","In addition, we continued to innovate, deepen our client relationships and extend our capabilities. Let me highlight a few of our achievements during the quarter.","Starting with our Services segment, which had a number of business wins and high-profile recognitions across the portfolio. We were honored to receive Outstanding Corporate Innovator Award from the Product Development and Management Association for automation, analytics and personalization capabilities.","Another notable recognition was by HfS, which named Xerox Healthcare to its Winner's Circle, the highest-ranking in its report on business services for health care payers and providers. In the Public Sector, the state of Tennessee selected Xerox to provide EMV-enhanced benefit cards to over 120,000 citizens receiving child support, unemployment compensation and state pension payment.","Our Document Outsourcing business secured a 10-year contract worth $110 million with the USDA for managed print services. We will be installing and supporting up to 16,000 Xerox ConnectKey-enabled printers and multifunction devices at more than 3,000 USDA locations around the world.","Document Outsourcing was also recognized for its market-leading offerings by prominent industry analyst groups including leadership positions in Quocirca's MPS market landscape report and IDC's MarketScape's document workflow services assessment.","Now turning to our Document Technology business, in September we showcased our portfolio of the latest printing technologies, workflow solutions and business development resources at Graph Expo 2016. This is North America's largest graphic arts tradeshow. We also brought a number of innovative products for small and midsize businesses to market as we continued to expand our offerings in this space.","At the corporate level, I am proud to share that Xerox released its 2016 Global Citizenship Report highlighting our approach to social responsibility. Our citizenship efforts continue to be widely recognized. And during the quarter we were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index, the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for North America and Corporate Responsibility Magazine's 100 Best Corporate Citizens.","I will now turn it over to Leslie, who will provide more detail on our third-quarter results and 2016 guidance.","Leslie Varon","Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. I will start with the earnings slide and cover the rest of the financials as well as our guidance before handing it back to Ursula to wrap up.","Our third-quarter results reflect operational discipline and good progress in key areas that will set the foundation for the two companies post-separation. These include cost and productivity progress from our strategic transformation, resulting in broad-based margin improvement in BPO and solid margins in Document Technology. Overall, Services signings growth, as we renewed 86% in a quarter with high renewal opportunities, reflecting the continued confidence our customers have in us. Strong operating cash generation reflective of the durability of our annuity-based business model.","So, while revenues in both businesses were a bit soft, we delivered overall good results in a somewhat volatile macro environment. Total revenue of $4.2 billion was down 3% at actual currency and down 4% on an adjusted constant currency basis, including 1 point of negative currency. I will be discussing our results on an adjusted basis when making comparisons against the prior year, as the third quarter 2015 included the $389 million pre-tax charge, including a revenue reduction of $116 million related to our Health Enterprise strategy change.","Adjusted gross margin of 31.3% was up 10 basis points year over year, driven by improvements in both segments, partially offset by a greater mix of Services, which structurally has a lower gross margin. There was a modest negative transaction currency impacting quarter three, reflecting the yen's strength against the euro, pound and US dollar, partially mitigated by our hedging and currency risk-sharing with Fuji Xerox. At current rates, we are expecting some additional pressure in quarter four.","Adjusted RD&E was down $10 million year over year and adjusted SAG was down $28 million, driven by productivity and cost initiatives, which were partially offset by higher expenses related to prior-year compensation and benefits reduction.","Overall flow-through from our strategic transformation actions resulted in good margins in both segments and a solid 9.2% total Company operating margin. Adjusted other net expense was down $17 million year over year, driven by lower interest expense.","Equity income of $39 million in the quarter was down slightly year over year. Our third-quarter adjusted tax rate of 25.3% was 1.8 points below last year and just under our guidance range of 26% to 28%, reflecting the geographic mix of our profit. Bottom line: adjusted earnings of $0.27 was in the middle of our guidance range and flat year over year.","Turning to Services, we had another quarter of very good operating profit growth, up $33 million, or 17% year-over-year, as significant margin improvement more than offset modest revenue decline. Services revenue was up 1% at actual currency, down 2% at constant currency and adjusting for the prior-year Health Enterprise charge. Document Outsourcing grew 1% year over year, with growth continuing to be driven by the Xerox Partner Print Services.","BPO declined 4% on an adjusted basis, reflecting our continued focus on profitability, very modest inorganic contribution, as well as forgone revenue associated with the Health Enterprise strategy change. Within BPO, Public Sector revenue grew 3%, as our transportation business continues to perform well and is benefiting from ramping new business. While Commercial Industries and Healthcare declined, driven by headwinds as we prioritized profitability and therefore have stepped away from some unprofitable contracts.","Total signings in the quarter were up 17% year over year and are up 6% for the trailing 12 months. The increase in quarter three was driven by strong renewals, a reflection of both high renewal opportunity as well as a good renewal rate of 86%, confirming the value we provide our customers. Over the past year, we have renewed eight of our 10 top BPO clients.","New business signings have been lower over the past year as we have strengthened our signings criteria, setting the bar higher on price, margins and deal terms.","An important measure of our progress this year is Services margin. This has been an area of intense focus, and the team delivered a quarter three margin of 9.4%, at the high end of our 8% to 9.5% full-year range. This strong performance reflects broad contribution across BPO, a result of both our strategic cost transformation initiatives and increased operating discipline by the team. And as we have said before, Document Outsourcing margin generally is in line with the Document Technology segment margin.","So, key takeaways on Services are consistent with what we said in quarter two. While revenue was a bit soft, Document Outsourcing remains a good performer, and in BPO we are making steady progress improving profitability. There has been a near-term trade-off between revenue growth and margin, but overall it has resulted in strong profit growth and will provide a solid foundation for our businesses as we prepare to separate.","Document Technology delivered strong margins in the face of ongoing revenue pressures within a tough market environment. Revenue was down 9% at actual currency and 7% at constant currency, with equipment down 13% and annuity down 5%. Annuity was an improvement from quarter two, driven by supplies.","Within equipment, trends improved in both Entry and High-end, reflecting new product introductions but, Mid-range lagged due to lower large account sales in the US. When we include Document Outsourcing with Document Technology, revenue declined 5% in the third quarter and is down 4% year to date. Overall, we continue to maintain our equipment revenue market share leadership.","Turning to activity, we delivered good growth across all color activity segments, with particular strength in High-end due in part to the recent drupa trade show. Entry results benefited from better performance in developing markets, where we have lapped economic weakness in some geographies.","Midrange had a mixed quarter, with continued good growth from the iSeries products launched earlier this year, but weakness elsewhere. Document Technology margin of 13.1% was quite strong, up 50 basis points sequentially, reflecting strategic transformation benefit, and was in the middle of our full-year range.","Year over year, margin was down 80 basis points, as gross margin improvements were not enough to offset a higher SAG ratio. The third-quarter 2015 results included materially lower compensation and benefits expense, which we did not expect would repeat. Transaction currency in the quarter was a relatively modest 30-basis-point headwind to margin and at current rates could be about twice that level in quarter four.","So, overall for Document Technology, we continue to manage the impact of revenue decline through ongoing productivity actions, resulting in strong segment margins and cash generation.","And as I wrap up on the segments, I will repeat what I said last quarter. We will manage our strategic transformation focus, and we expect continued good profitability in both Document Technology and in Services as we prepare to separate.","Moving to cash flow, operating cash generation of $370 million was strong, up $99 million year over year, and reflects the underlying cash-generative profile of our business model. From a year-over-year perspective, good working capital performance and solid net income more than offset the impact of this year's unique Health Enterprise settlement and separation payments, which were $39 million and $21 million, respectively, in the quarter.","We have generated $522 million of operating cash during the first three quarters of the year, with all 2016 Health Enterprise settlement payments now behind us. Therefore, we enter quarter four, our seasonally strongest cash flow quarter, well-positioned to deliver on our guidance of $950 million to $1.2 billion for the full year.","Investing cash flows were a use of $69 million and included $73 million spent on CapEx. Cash flow from financing was an $84 million use and includes $85 million for preferred and common stock dividend. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $1.4 billion and continues to provide us flexibility as we move into quarter four and prepare for separation.","Turning to our capital structure and capital allocation, we ended quarter three with $7.4 billion of debt, a level we have been at all year. Applying 7-to-1 leverage to our customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt at the end of the quarter was $3.8 billion, leaving core debt at $3.6 billion.","We continue to manage our capital structure to maintain credit metrics consistent with our investment-grade credit rating. On October 11, we filed an amendment to the Conduent Form 10 that included details of its anticipated post-separation capital structure. We indicated that Conduent expected to be capitalized with approximately $2.4 billion of debt and $400 million of cash, and to transfer $2.05 billion of proceeds to Xerox, which we intend to use to reduce Xerox debt.","Consistent with our expectations, Xerox credit ratings remain investment-grade, and we expect that the Conduent capital structure would result in a high non-investment-grade rating.","And to touch on capital allocation, we have paid $79 million in common stock dividends in quarter three. We completed a $13 million dealer acquisition earlier this month, consistent with our strategy to expand our US Global Imaging Business. And as we have said previously, as we prepare for our separation later this year, we are not planning to repurchase any shares.","Before I move to guidance on the next slide, I want to mention that Conduent will be filing its third-quarter results in the next few weeks. The Conduent carve-out financials will reflect margin improvement, although not to the same degree as the Services segment, since Conduent results include the student loan business, which resides in our Other segment. That business is in runoff and declined profit year over year as anticipated.","I will now share with you our fourth-quarter and full-year expectations. For quarter four, we expect adjusted earnings in the range of $0.32 to $0.35 and GAAP earnings of $0.11 to $0.14. For the full year, we continue to expect total revenues to decline 2% to 4% at constant currency. We are narrowing our adjusted earnings guidance range to $1.11 to $1.14, which incorporates our fourth-quarter expectations.","In Services, we expect full-year revenue will be flat to down 1% and margin will be at the very high end of the 8% to 9.5% range. We expect Document Technology revenues will be at the lower end of the full-year range, and that margin will be in line with our 12% to 14% expectation.","We expect full-year GAAP earnings of $0.45 to $0.48. We continue to anticipate full-year restructuring of about $300 million, including approximately $70 million in the fourth quarter. And our estimate of pretax separation costs remains $175 million to $200 million and $40 million to $50 million in tax-related friction cost.","Turning to cash flow, as I mentioned earlier, our year-to-date performance positions us well for the full year, and we are maintaining our expectations of $950 million to $1.2 billion for operating cash flow and $600 million to $850 million for free cash flow.","And, finally, our capital allocation expectations remain largely unchanged, although we now expect to spend about $30 million to $50 million on acquisition.","So, in summary, despite a somewhat challenging macro backdrop, we are on track and remain committed to delivering our overall revenue, earnings and cash flow guidance.","With that, Ursula, I will turn it back to you.","Ursula Burns","Thank you, Leslie. In summary, we are pleased with our results in the third quarter, which were in line with our expectations and driven by our ongoing operational and cost discipline. We are on track to deliver on all of our objectives for the year and establish two companies that will be well-positioned to drive shareholder value over the long-term.","Before we open the line for questions, I would like to note that today has particular significance for Xerox, as this will be our last earnings call as a combined entity. Next time we report earnings, we will be two separate companies, each on their own path to enhance value for our clients, employees, investors and other stakeholders. I look forward to watching both Xerox and Conduent prosper in the future.","We will now open up the line for questions. Jennifer?","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks, Ursula. Joining us today are Jeff Jacobson, Head of our Document Technology business and CEO of new Xerox following separation; Ashok Vemuri, Chief Executive Officer Xerox Business Services and CEO of Conduent post-separation; and Brian Webb-Walsh, CFO Xerox Services, who will be CFO of Conduent post-separation.","Before we get to your questions, let me point out that we have several supplemental slides at the end of our deck which provide more financial details to support today's presentation and complement our prepared remarks. For the Q&A, I would ask participants to limit follow-on and multi-part questions so we can get to everyone.","At the end of our Q&A session, I will turn it back to Ursula for closing comments. Operator, please open the line for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.","George Tong","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Ashok, first of all, welcome to Xerox.","Ashok Vemuri","Hi, George.","George Tong","Understanding more details will be provided at the upcoming analyst day, Ashok, can you provide or touch on what your top three strategic priorities are to improve growth and margin performance in the BPO business?","Ashok Vemuri","Yes, sure. George, I think the focus for us continues to be to drive profitable growth. We have demonstrated a very strong margin performance. We continue to invest in the strategic transformation to turn the business so that we are invested and investing in areas that are our traditional strengths. We have certain areas where we would like to continue to drive a higher degree of transformation, especially customer care. But we are pleased with the progress that we have made on the margin front, and I think that will give us the momentum to be able to continue to drive the transformation that we seek in our business.","George Tong","Very helpful. And the earnings release this quarter disclosed that work to implement the health enterprise platform in New York has been elongated and could result in material increases in future costs to complete. Can you help frame or quantify the potential cost overruns and comment on your desire to remain in the government health care business given some of the recent difficulties in ramping contracts in the segment?","Ashok Vemuri","Yes, so, we are working in a very collaborative fashion with the state. The good news is that we have learned our lessons and have gained some experience based on our prior implementations. We are working closely with the state. We are making progress on the implementation. And given that these contracts and implementations are usually long-tenor and have changing requirements and ups and downs, I think we are, given all of that, making very decent progress.","George Tong","Thanks very much.","Jennifer Horsley","Operator, next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross from Cross Research. Your line is open.","Shannon Cross","Thank you. I have two questions. The first is for Jeff. How do we think about what's going on the underlying business in the printing business? Equipment was down 13% in Doc Tech, and then combined it was \u2013 I don't know what equipment was down, but overall the printing business was down about 5% constant currency when you add in Document Outsourcing.","So, I am just curious how you see the competitive landscape. The yen has obviously moved significantly. Your competitors in Japan are not reporting particularly good numbers. So, what are you seeing out there as you head into 2017? And then I have a question for Ashok.","Jeff Jacobson","Sure, Shannon. Thanks very much. First, let me address it from a global market and macro standpoint. The global market environment continues to be challenging. As you mentioned, Shannon, there are uncertainties with currencies fluctuating, the yen and the pound. Certainly the uncertainty of the presidential election in the US; Brexit adds a certain degree of uncertainty in the UK and Europe.","But these complexities are obviously what we deal with all the time, and the important thing are the countermeasures. So, what we are doing is we are very aggressive on the productivity measures to drive down our total delivery cost and enhance the operating margins. As you know, what we have done over the last couple of years has been pretty aggressive on productivity, and we are taking that to the next level. We are very focused on innovation and defending our market share, and we are focused on the growth areas.","So, specific to this quarter, what I would say, our revenue was in line and was stable in this challenging market environment. You are correct that we were pressured on the equipment side, and some of that was more on the high end and government bids due to these uncertainties. But we are also pleased with the annuity business driven by supplies. And we were also pleased on the high end. We saw the impact of drupa, which will benefit us for the next couple of quarters. And then at the end of September we obviously had Graph Expo in the US, and we think that will benefit us.","So, overall, in line, good color installs and pressure on more the mono side as we are moving more to color in the macro environment.","Shannon Cross","Great. Thank you. And then, Ashok, can you talk a bit about how you think about the balance between revenue and margin? Because over the last three years Xerox has bounced between wanting a lot of revenue growth out of BPO, but then that is obviously an impact to margin depending on what you sign, versus at sometimes saying, no, we're going to focus more on margin, and therefore, we saw our revenue declines and impact to billings or bookings.","So, just philosophically, how do you think about it? I know it is a balancing act, but what you put more weight to? Thank you.","Ashok Vemuri","Shannon, my philosophy on this is we need profitable growth. Revenue growth is important in order to demonstrate that the investments are in the right place and we are continuing to provide value to our clients.","Margin is an indicator of two things for me. One is the value that our clients perceive that we are bringing to the table and are willing to pay for it. And secondly, it is a report card on management's ability to effectively and efficiently run a business.","So both of these are important for the reasons I just described. And I think even though there is certain degree of elasticity between them, it is important to manage that elasticity in a way that we control on both fronts.","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks, Shannon. Operator, next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan Securities. Your line is open.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Hi, great. Thank you. Just wanted to dig in here, just on the revenue coming in somewhat soft. I know that profitability came in nicely, but just how much of that do you think is macro versus your profitability focus versus maybe, I guess, distractions from the split of the spend? Can you maybe rank those?","Ursula Burns","We will start on the Services side with Ashok and then switch a little bit to the Tech side with Jeff.","Ashok Vemuri","Okay. I think what we have seen in terms of the margin improvement is clearly the flow-through of all of the strategic transformation activities that we've been doing. There is a higher degree of discipline that we have driven. We have balanced some of the revenue reduction because we are being much more selective in terms of the deals we are doing. Deal qualification has improved.","The bars that we have put in terms of pricing and the kind of deals that we want to do, we have raised that. So, margin, as I have said in answer to the previous question, is extremely important for us, but we need to balance that by also driving revenue growth.","Jeff Jacobson","Yes, and I think from the Tech standpoint when you see the equipment revenues, that would tend to be impacted more by uncertainties and the macro issues. We are very fortunate from the standpoint of 75% of our business is annuity, which provides a strong foundation, strong base. We're also very fortunate that the vast majority of our contracts are bundled contracts with supplies, which provide stability for us.","So, yes, what we are doing is we're not getting out ahead of our headlights. We are managing our cost and productivity very strongly, and we are looking for the opportunities of growth certainly in Document Outsourcing, Graphic Communications and in some underpenetrated markets for us such as SMB.","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks, Tien-tsin.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Thanks.","Jennifer Horsley","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah from Brean Capital. Your line is open.","Ananda Baruah","Hey, thanks guys. Congrats on the progress, and looking forward to talking to you guys going forward post the split. Really my question right now, I have one, is really for Jeff and maybe for Ursula on the Xerox side. As we think about where the opportunities for incremental efficiencies could be, as you get post-split, and then as we think about where the opportunity for I guess increased velocity around decision-making could be post-split, how should we be thinking about it? What things have you guys learned about this opportunity so far?","And understanding you probably don't have numbers to give us yet, I guess from a magnitude perspective \u2013 I guess from \u2013 what context in terms of \u2013 how should we think about it in terms of potential to be impactful on the P&L? What is the right context there as well? And that's it. Would love your thoughts there. Thanks.","Jeff Jacobson","Yes, sure, Ananda. Thanks very much, and certainly we will cover a lot more of the details at the investor conference. But the way we look at it is this \u2013 if you look at the strategic transformation we announced over a three-year period as a combined entity, about $2.4 billion, and we said that Tech would be about two-thirds of that.","So, the linchpin to our strategy is driving that strategic transformation very hard, and the reason is this. In past years, basically, we have offset the headwinds of annuity, price erosion and done just enough. What we want to do now is take this to a totally another level so that we can reinvest back in the business, bring some back down to the bottom line and invest in some of the growth areas we see certainly in Document Outsourcing, Graphic Communications and being able to invest a little more into Entry. And we will talk a little bit more about that at investor day.","In terms of the strategic transformation, we're driving it very hard. We are looking at things such as supply chain optimization, technical service excellence with remote call assist, remote connectivity, real estate optimization, how we can design our products with more efficiency, and then delayering and simplifying the organization. So, we have a pretty detailed plan. We are tracking very well towards it, and we are pleased with where we are right now.","Ananda Baruah","That's really helpful, Jeff. I have got a quick follow-up to that, if I could. Are those moves, the nonrevenue moves, the core organizational moves you talked to, are those incremental to business-as-usual Xerox? And if they're incremental to business-as-usual Xerox, would you favor the incremental op profit dollars to be dropped to the bottom line or invested back in the growth, or both of those things? Thanks.","Jeff Jacobson","Yes, one of the things that we message is that there is no business as usual Xerox. So, what we are going to do as we separate our companies, we're going to take all the good things that we bring from Xerox, and there are a lot of great things, but we are going to be a much more simplified, delayered organization. And what we're going to do with the efficiencies we drive in taking strategic transformation to the next level, some will certainly drop to the bottom line and some of it will be invested to improve the revenue trajectory.","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks, Ananda. Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Brian Essex from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Brian Essex","Hi, good morning, and thank you for taking the question. Ashok, I was wondering if I could maybe ask you about the Services performance. And now that you have been there for a little while and you are rolling up your sleeves, how much of the lower guidance is due to the more \u2013 the greater degree of selectivity in contrasts? And I notice the margins are now pointed towards the high end. How much of the margin is due to your strategic transformation versus pricing?","Ashok Vemuri","Well, I think the margin improvements, Brian, are to a great extent driven by the efficiency that we have seen. And remember that this margin improvement that we have seen comes despite our performance in customer care, and I will elaborate more on that as we go into the investor event in December, et cetera.","But, clearly, where our business is actually clicking in and the ones that we are vesting and amplifying, these are coming in at decent margins and actually much-improved margins than previous periods.","But we still have a ways to go in terms of being able to transform some of our businesses, which are core to us. And as we do that, as we get more selective, we drive a much more predictable and sustainable, scalable business. And we have the foundation for it. I think we would be able to see the performance of that in future quarters.","Brian Essex","Okay. And maybe as a follow-up, in terms of transforming the business again, as I think back to conversations that we have previously had with Bob, for example, we have talked about centralizing the legacy relatively distributed nature of the legacy ACS business. How far along from previous initiatives are we? And then how much more room is there to go within that organization in terms of increasing its efficiency? If we can just get a sense of your fresh take on the business and what is new in a way that you view it.","Ashok Vemuri","Yes, the good news is that this is not something that we have just decided or contemplated to do. This is in progress, so we have taken enough initiatives and more, if you will, on transforming the business.","In some places, we have been effective. We clearly have a business which is very widespread, both from a \u2013 the range of business that we do, the range of clients that we have and the geographical spread. So we need to refocus ourselves on those things that we are really good at, amplify those and invest in them. And continue to drive through the strategic transformation initiative, drive this to success.","But I think the important thing is to also understand that this is not something that is going to happen overnight or in a few quarters. This is a transformation. It is going to transition over a period of time. And we will discuss the appropriate metric as we bridge from where we are to where we really want to be.","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks, Brian. Operator, next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Frank Atkins from SunTrust. Your line is open.","Frank Atkins","Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I want to ask, Ashok, what are the major levers that you see you could pull to drive profitability going forward?","Ashok Vemuri","Well, I think the number one, of course, is we have to refocus on our delivery model. Customer care is a big part of what we do. Innovation in that, either through robotics and automation, is a key part of what we do.","There are some internal processes in how we run our sales, which we could use some of those similar processes and tools to make us much more effective and efficient. We have to look for businesses that will provide us profitable growth. We have to exploit and monetize all the assets that we have within the Company, and we have a ton of them, which need to be deployed across the board.","We have to look at businesses and segments and geographies, which will help us meet those profitability goals. And in certain situations we also have to sort of run off businesses that we are deliberately taking a view on running off.","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks, Frank. Operator, next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Cabral from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Matt Cabral","Thank you. I wanted to ask about the proposed Conduent balance sheet. I guess on my estimates it looks like the business will start off with north of 3 times gross leverage, which seemed a little bit high relative to where some of the pure-play BPO competitors are and given the meaningful turnaround that this business faces going forward.","So what gives you the confidence that this is the right capital structure for Conduent going forward? And does this level of leverage still give you room to make either the organic or inorganic investments needed to transform this business ahead?","Brian Webb-Walsh","Matt, it's Brian. As Ursula and Leslie both mentioned, we anticipate being a high-non-investment-grade rated Company. We believe the leverage that we are starting with is manageable. We intend to improve the leverage over time through operational performance improvement. So, again, we will use cost transformation to create run to make organic investments, and the inorganic investments will be timed as we can afford them, but we believe that it is a manageable starting point.","Matt Cabral","Thank you. And then...","Jennifer Horsley","Sorry, Matt. Do you have another question?","Matt Cabral","Yes, I was just going to ask one for Jeff more on the legacy Xerox business. I guess I wanted to ask around the USDA contract, when that was mentioned in the prepared remarks. And, first of all, if there is any help around the ramp of that contract. And then more just taking a step back and looking at that vertical in particular, around US federal, was that an opportunistic one-off win, or is that an area where there might be a little bit more of a robust pipeline, particularly given the pending Lexmark acquisition that is out there?","Jeff Jacobson","Yes, thanks, Matt. Not specific to the Lexmark acquisition, but I think more the USDA win, we are very strong in federal; we are very strong in public sector. Document Outsourcing is a strong and really good business for us. We are the clear market leader, and we continue to see growth and strong margins in that business. It is an area of focused strategic importance to us. And we had a good renewal rate; we continue to. We are very strong in the large enterprise sector. We are always focused on new logos and new customers, and this was a big part of that.","In addition to that, we're going to apply that same expertise, if I can call it that, to the managed print services in the SMB sector as well, where we even have a lot more opportunity for growth there.","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks, Matt.","Matt Cabral","Thank you.","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks, Matt. Operator, next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Steve Schneiderman","Hi, this is Steve Schneiderman pinch hitting for Keith today. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to direct this to Ashok. As we think about getting an update on the sales cycle, signings for the quarter were up about 15%. And I understand this includes Document Outsourcing. But signings were down by about the same amount, as you talked about trying to be more selective on profitable growth.","My question is where are we in the cycle in terms of churning out these low-profit, potential new deals and being able to \u2013 once again, being able to look at it more steady-state, so get signings growth?","Ashok Vemuri","Yes, from our signings growth perspective we grew about 17%, and the bulk of that actually came from renewals. So that is actually good news. We have eight out of our 10 BPO clients actually renewed with us. So, obviously whatever we are bringing to the party, our clients like and they want to continue to do business with us.","The area of concern, if you will, for us is new deal signings. That is down, and that is an area of focus. I called in my go-to-market team in October. We basically sat down to look at the opportunities in the market. In the spaces that we are strong in, there continues to be headroom for growth, and there are opportunities out there which we will selectively pick to drive profitable growth.","Steve Schneiderman","Okay, is this something you think can be resolved mid-2017, or is that about a little conservative or aggressive from that perspective?","Ashok Vemuri","I think it's difficult to put a timeline on this. But suffice it to say that we are intensely focused on driving revenue and driving new business growth while at the same time continuing to respond to the trust our existing clients have placed in us by bringing innovative solutions to the table.","Steve Schneiderman","Okay.","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citigroup. Your line is open.","Jim Suva","Thank you very much. I have two questions, and I will ask them both at the same time. First of all, as you prepare for separation \u2013 and I am sure the ERP or internal IT systems you have are preparing with a lot of effort ahead of that. Are you going to have a need to, say, meaningfully increase your inventory just to make sure that one system doesn't accidentally not talk to another system, or is that inventory management already ironed out?","And then my second question is on the Affordable Care Act and the election, there has been a lot of talk about that and such as well as costs going up on that. Can you help us quantify what that means to Xerox? Or do we know? Or with costs going up, is that bad? Is that good? Enrollees? Is there no impact at all, or how should we think about the election and the Affordable Care Act of what is all going on in the news? Thank you.","Ursula Burns","Jim, I should take that. This is Ursula. Even though I haven't spoken a lot today, that's actually a good feeling. But I will take this question.","First one, on the transition and inventory and how we are looking at that, we are entering something \u2013 I talked about this in my prepared remarks, a phase that we call soft separation. And the reason why that is important for investors is that it is a time that we can essentially practice, do a phased implementation of all the complex separation activities and make sure that we don't stumble when we're actually independent. Including things like the inventory management system.","Independent of the soft separation, we would have very little problem with this area, but I think the soft separation makes it such that we could actually double- and triple-check there. So I wouldn't \u2013 we don't \u2013 we are not managing inventory any differently than we normally would at the end of the year. All we are doing is making sure that as we do a separation we don't have any fumbles, which we don't expect.","As far as cost and the \u2013 health care cost, the impact of ACA or any potential changes to ACA on our internal cost in the marketplace, we actually just don't see any. Internal cost \u2013 we will manage our internal health care cost in the most efficient way possible. We are a good health care provider, payer of services for our clients, our customers. That won't change. And as far as the marketplace out there, we are not really seeing a big set of headwinds or a change in the market dynamics because of any potential changes for ACA.","I hope I answered both of your questions.","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks, Jim. Operator, I think we have time \u2013.","Jim Suva","Thank you very much.","Jennifer Horsley","Operator, I think we have time for one last question.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Jamie Friedman from Susquehanna. Your line is open.","Jamie Friedman","Hi, thank you. I just had a housekeeping question. Leslie, maybe if you could share with us what the time frame is from here. I know you have filed a Form 10 and an amended Form 10. Is there another Form 10 coming? Maybe if you could just update us on the sequence as we go out.","Brian Webb-Walsh","Yes, this is Brian. There will be an amendment to the Form 10 today, actually. And then we anticipate the Form 10 being effective in early November.","Jamie Friedman","Okay. And what is the anticipated date of separation?","Brian Webb-Walsh","End of the year is the anticipated date of separation.","Ursula Burns","Right. As it has been from the time that we started.","Jamie Friedman","Yes, yes, I noticed. All right. Thank you, Brian.","Jennifer Horsley","Great. Thanks, Jamie. I am going to pass it back to Ursula for some closing comments.","Ursula Burns","Thank you for your questions. In the third quarter we made steady progress against all three of our commitments, delivering on our 2016 financial goals, implementing our strategic transformation and completing the separation by year-end. We remain on track to achieve all three.","We look forward to sharing more details about the two companies at our investor days. And thank you, everyone, for joining the call.","Jennifer Horsley","Thanks, Ursula. That concludes our call today. If you have further questions, please contact me or any member of our investor relations team.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you again for your participation. You may now disconnect at this time. Everyone have a great day."],"22731":["Xerox Corporation (NYSE:XRX) Q2 2014 Results Earnings Conference Call July 25, 2014 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Ursula Burns - Chairman and CEO","Kathy Mikells - Executive Vice President and CFO","Jim Lesko - Vice President, Investor Relations","Bob Zapfel - EVP, President, Xerox Services","Jeff Jacobson - President, Document Technology","Analysts","Brian Essex - Morgan Stanley","Ben Reitzes - Barclays","Shannon Cross - Cross Research","Jim Suva - Citigroup","George Tong - Piper Jaffray","Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital","Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs","James Friedman - Susquehanna","Operator","Good morning. And welcome to the Xerox Corporation Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Release Conference Call hosted by Ursula Burns, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. She is joined by Kathy Mikells, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com\/investor. At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and\/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without the express permission of Xerox. After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)","During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which by their nature address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein.","At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns, you may begin.","Ursula Burns","Good morning and thanks for joining our call. Today we are reporting second quarter 2014 earnings that continued to reflect the benefits of our diversified portfolio and strong cash flow. We remain focused on our priorities and we are making progress.","This quarter we saw a return to growth in Services and the business is well-positioned for sustained improvement. Services is now 57% of revenue and we are on track to reach our target of two-third by 2017. This important shift will drive overall revenue growth.","Our Document Technology business drove strong profits again this quarter and continues to be an important for us, generating cash and profits above expectation. We continue our initiatives to improve Services profitability. We are seeing good profitability improvement especially within areas like document outsourcing, our commercial BPO business and ITO businesses, including healthcare and international services.","We know that more need to be done especially in government healthcare, where we continue to stand-up a new Medicaid platform and deal with a couple of challenging contracts. So this remains a top priority.","And of course, both segments, Services and Technology we remained focused on our important stakeholder with the keen attention on supporting our customers, delivering value for our investors and making Xerox a great place to work for our people.","In the quarter we invested $227 million in acquisitions. Welcoming into Xerox the employees and customers of Smart Data Consulting and ISG Holdings. ISG is a leading provider of workers compensation software in the U.S.","This acquisition will expand our significant present in the healthcare payor and insurance BPO markets, and we continue to invest organically in areas where we see good market opportunity, such as in private health exchanges, we have a differentiated offering for large employers through Buck Consultants at Xerox.","We have a business that delivers strong cash flow. This gives us flexibility to not only invest for growth, but also build short and long-term shareholder value through a balanced approach to capital allocation that includes share repurchases and dividends.","To execute on our direction, we have a strong team. Jeff Jacobson was recently named the President of our Document Technology business, taking over from Armando Zagalo de Lima, who is retiring after 31 years at Xerox.","I want to thank Armando for everything that he has done for Xerox. He has put our document technology business on a solid foundation by transforming the organization to be more customer-focused, profitable and well-positioned to adapt to changes in the market.","Here to look our results and my perspective. As I mentioned earlier, there are bright spots and positive trends, but we still have work -- more work to do. We reported adjusted EPS of $0.27, which is at the high-end of the range that we said.","In the quarter we saw improvement in Services revenue growth. Services revenue was up 2%, that\u2019s up from flat growth last quarter and the business is trending well.","Document Technology revenue had higher declines in the quarter as expected given timing of last year\u2019s product launches. It is in the range of expectations for the first half and we are very excited about upcoming product launches.","Our operating margin is up year-over-year, driven by strong margins in Document Technology, the result of continue good operational discipline and focused on productivity.","As anticipated, though, we did see margin decline in Services, due to the pressures that we are experiencing in government healthcare. We took a non-cash charge in the quarter and are making progress transitioning out of some challenging contracts. Kathy will provide you with more details in a few minutes.","We are continuing our activities to create shareholder value, using our strong cash flow, which is up over $150 million for the first half to repurchase shares at a steady pace, supporting a growing dividend and acquiring companies that enhance our Services capability.","We have a talented and dedicated team and we are keeping our stakeholders at the center of all that we do. Our goal is to provide excellent product and services, and deliver the operational results that are expected of us.","With that, I will turn it over to Kathy. Then I will wrap up and we will open the call to your questions. Kathy?","Kathy Mikells","Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. Overall, we feel about our sequential program with the number of the themes from quarter one carrying through to quarter two. We continue to show operating profit growth, driven by strong margin expansion in Document Technology and we had good operational performance in the majority of our Services businesses.","As expected, the government healthcare business continues to pressure Services margin, as we invest in rolling out our Medicaid platform. Additionally, we took incremental non-cash impairment charges, driven by the transition out of the Nevada Health Insurance Exchange. I will cover all of these dynamics in much greater detail when I review segment performance.","First, I'd like to begin by walking through our earnings. Revenue in the quarter was down 2% at actual currency and down 2.5% in constant currency. Segment revenue trends were as expected, with Services revenue growth improving and Document Technology weaker as we face a challenging year-over-year compare due to last year\u2019s product launch timing.","Gross margin of 30.8% was down 70 basis points year-over-year, driven by the Services margin decline, as well as the greater mix of Services. We again saw a significant improvement in both SAG and RD&E as we benefit from productivity initiative, as well as lower pension expense.","These improvements more than offset below our gross margin and resulted in operating margin expansion of 30 basis points year-over-year and 110 basis points sequentially, and enabled higher operating profit year-over-year.","Moving down to income statement, adjusted other net was $14 million higher year-over-year. The increase was split between OID, which was $9 million higher year-over-year, reflecting a real estate gain in the prior year and restructuring which is $38 million was $5 million higher year-over-year and in line with our guidance.","Adjusted tax rate of 27.7% was 360 basis points higher year-over-year and just above our guidance range of 25% to 27%. So, overall, there was a modest year-over-year headwind below operating profit. Adjusted EPS of $0.27 was flat year-over-year and at the high end of our guidance range of $0.25 to $0.27.","Looking at the first half, adjusted EPS of $0.54 was also flat year-over-year, operating profit grew 6% in the first half, despite the pressure we are seeing in our government healthcare business and when combined with lower share count more than offset higher restructuring costs, OID and a higher tax rate. So, all in all, I believe we are making progress, obviously, with more work yet to do.","With that, I will move to the Services segment slide to review those results in a little bit more detail. Services revenue growth once again improved sequentially and was up year-over-year 2% or 1% in constant currency, driven by a pick up in BPO which went from down 2% in Q1, so up 1% in Q2.","Good growth in commercial healthcare and internationally, and better inorganic contribution was partially offset by a negative 1 point impact from the continued June loan run-off, as well as headwinds from lower customer care volume. Trends in document outsourcing up 3% and ITO up 1% were largely consistent with prior period.","Turning to signings, signings were lower year-over-year especially renewal. The combination of a low renewal rate that was below target due to the Texas Medicaid law and the lower overall renewal opportunity resulted in renewal signings contract value down more than 35% in the quarter.","New business signs were better story, up double-digit sequentially, but down 4% year-over-year and flat on a trailing 12-month basis. It should be noted that we did see some contract shift to the second half and we had a couple of large contract awards that won\u2019t be close until later this year.","New York Medicaid, for instance, is not in these numbers. Our new business pipeline remains healthy, up 4% year-over-year and we expect better signings result in the second half. Shifting the profitability, segment margin was 8.6% in the second quarter which was flat sequentially and down 160 basis points year-over-year.","A year-over-year decline was expected but we\u2019re below our guidance of sequential margin improvement. The miss was due solely to the impairment charges we took in the quarter associated with our health insurance exchange platform including non-cash charges related to the Nevada contract.","We didn\u2019t formally adjust out the $20 million net impairment charges, but if we exclude it, our segment margin would be 9.2%, which is in line with our expectation for continued sequential improvement.","So, we\u2019re beginning to get closure on our Nevada HIX contract and will be working with the state to continue to support the 2014 annual release and comply with their decisions to transition to the federal exchange for the next year's open enrollment.","Turning to our Medicaid business, the second quarter performance was largely in line with our expectation as we continue to incur higher cost associated with launching our Medicaid platform and getting it to operational maturity. We\u2019re making progress. We had positive references and we\u2019re winning new business in the market. This is an area where we expect lower margins in the intermediate term as we drive improvements in our other implementation.","Within the rest of services, we\u2019re seeing improved performance. I was very pleased with our margin performance in areas like commercial healthcare, document outsourcing and IPO. So our five-plank strategy and cost initiatives are driving improvements in many parts of the business and should continue to ramp as we move through the second half of the year.","Turning to Services guidance. On revenue, second half growth will be negatively impacted by the losses of the Texas Medicaid contract, which is worth roughly 1.5 points of revenue growth. The rest of BPO improved and will also benefit by greater in organic contribution. We now expect to exit the year with a lower single-digit growth rate.","On margin, our expectations are largely intact. We expect sequential improvement through the year putting aside non-cash impairment charges. The third quarter should coming in above 9.2% and we expect to exit the year comfortably above 10%. In terms of full year Services margin, we expect to come in at the lower end of the 9.4% to 9.8% range, reflecting the non-cash charges that we took in the second quarter.","I\u2019ll now turn to Document Technology. Revenue in Document Technology was down 6% at actual currency and 7% at constant currency. This was higher than last quarter's rate of decline and as we highlighted during our first quarter earnings call, this was anticipated given the timing of last year's product launches. That impact drove the higher rate of decline for equipment revenue with annuity revenue showing a consistent 4% decline in both quarters.","Looking at the first half, Document Technology revenue was down 5% or 6% at constant currency, which is in line with expectations from mid-single digit decline and includes an approximate one point negative impact associated with our previous finance receivable transactions.","From a geographic perspective, trends were generally consistent with our last quarter with the U.S stable, Europe improving and developing markets still weak. Looking at our product group, activity levels were lower as we save the challenging ConnectKey compare and some large wins in the prior year on graphic communications.","In addition, the timing of this year's product launches are more back half weighted, which we believe will position us well later in the second half and into 2015. Planned launches include the recently announced Versant's entry production color product, extension of our ConnectKey platform within our mid range portfolio and into entry as well as a refresh of the number of entry desktop product.","Document Technology margin in the quarter was 14.4%, which was 360 basis points higher year-over-year and continues to run above our long-term expectations. Our strong profit performance reflects ongoing benefits from restructuring and cost initiatives.","In addition, transaction currency and lower pension expenses boosted our performance by 200 basis points. This quarter we also experienced more favorable mix and lower pricing impact. The strong margin performance resulted in operating profit growth of 25% despite a revenue decline. So overall it was a good quarter for Document Technology.","Looking towards the third quarter, we continue to expect Document Technology to have revenue down mid-single digit with good margins although below the first half as we invest in the launch of new products that I mentioned earlier and also expect to have a less favorable impact from mix and some of other variable factors.","With that, let\u2019s turn to the cash flow. Cash flow from operations was strong at $325 million in the quarter following a good Q1 results. Through the first half, cash from operations was $611 million, which was $165 million higher year-over-year.","Underlying cash flow which excludes the impact from prior year finance receivable sales was $437 million in the second quarter and $846 million for the first half. It should be noted that the timing of operating cash flow generation was more balanced between Q1 and Q2 for the first half of this year versus last. And we're continuing to work to smooth out our working capital flows.","The drivers of the higher year-over-year first half cash flow improvement include lower uses of cash for accounts receivable and inventory and higher cash earning. Partially, offsetting this positive is less contribution of cash flows from finance receivable, which reflects the negative impact of the prior-year finance receivable sales.","Moving down the cash flow statement, investing cash flows were $326 million used in the quarter. We spent $123 million on CapEx and $227 million on acquisition. We closed in May on ISG, which complements Xerox\u2019s current business with the top 20 U.S. property, casualty and commercial health insurance company.","The acquisition pipeline continues to look good and our full year expectation to spend up to $500 million in 2014 is unchanged. Consistent with our portfolio management strategy, this quarter we divested truck load management solutions, a small non-core business within services transportation.","Cash from financing with the use of $561 million in the quarter and included $299 million in net debt payment, $204 million in share repurchased, and $79 million in preferred and common stock dividends. Ramping up cash flow we had a good first half and our full year guidance remain at $1.8 billion to $2.0 billion of operating cash flow, with the more event distribution through the year.","Second half cash flow will be down year-over-year as the prior year included $384 million in proceeds from finance receivable sales in the third quarter and $270 million and $247 million in proceeds in the fourth quarter with no sales activities planned in 2014. That said second half underlying cash flow should be more consistent on a year-over-year basis.","Now I\u2019ll walk through capital structure. We ended the quarter with $7.7 billion in debt and in line with our original guidance, we continue to expect to end the year with about 7.8 billion in total debt. Applying 7 to 1 leverage on customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt is $4.4 billion, leaving core debt of $3.3 billion.","We managed our core debt to maintain a leverage ratio consistent with our investment grade rating. Our financing debt has come down the past few years, driven by the finance receivable transactions as well as lower origination. So we feel good about our stable capital structure and if we move through the next slide, I\u2019ll review where we\u2019re at on share repurchases and dividends.","With a strong first half cash flow performance and relatively high beginning of the year cash position, we\u2019ve been able to steadily repurchase shares during the first half for a total of $480 million or 42 million shares. We continue to view our shares as a good investment and anticipate doing at least $700 million in share repurchases for the year.","Our full year guidance for dividend payments remains $300 million in 2014 and reflects our current quarterly dividend of $6.25 per share. When combined with the share repurchases, we expect at least a $1 billion to be returned to shareholders this year.","Before I turn it back to Ursula, I just like to summarize our expectations for the third quarter and the full year.","We were once again pleased with the performance of Document Technology and for the third quarter we expect margins to be at the high end of our target range with mid-single digit revenue declines. Given the strong first half profit performance, we expect full year margins to be at least a point above our target range of 9% to 11%, and up a similar level year-over-year.","Within Services, we expect to make may further gains in the second half. The Texas Medicaid contract loss temporarily flows sequential revenue growth improvement and results in an exit revenue growth rate for Services in the low single digits. We feel good about delivering sequential margin improvement and exiting the year comfortably above 10%. And as I mentioned earlier, we expect full year Services margin to be at the lower end of our 9.4% to 9.8% range as a result of the non-cash charges that we took in the second quarter.","At consolidated level for the first quarter, we expect revenue to decline about two point and adjusted earnings per share of $0.25 to $0.27, which includes approximately $0.02 of restructuring. And for the full year, we\u2019re narrowing our adjusted EPS guidance range to $1.09.to $1.13.","And with that, I\u2019ll hand it back to you, Ursula.","Ursula Burns","Thanks, Kathy. I want to get to your questions. So I\u2019ll summarize quickly. Our second quarter shows progress, growing revenue in our Services business, operating profit in our technology business, and reaping the benefits of our strong cash flow. Our profits in Document Technology help offset the headwinds that we\u2019re seeing in some of our Services businesses.","Our focus on implementing the Services strategy is showing positive results, and we are seeing good progress internationally and in areas like document outsourcing and commercial healthcare. Our strong cash flow allows us the flexibility to make strategic investments that will enhance opportunities in the future. Our 2014 priorities and focus are consistent.","In Services, improving growth through portfolio management and profitability by driving cost efficiencies through the business. In Document Technology, capitalizing on the most advantaged segments of the business to maintain our leadership positions in the industry while maintaining strong profitability. And we\u2019ll continue to generate healthy cash flow to deliver shareholder value.","Thank you. And now I'll turn you over to Jim.","Jim Lesko","Thanks, Ursula. Joining Ursula and Kathy today are Bob Zapfel, head of our services and Jeff Jacobson, head of our Document Technology business. Also let me point out that we had several supplemental slides at the end of our deck. They provide more financial detail to support today's presentation and complement our prepared remarks.","For the Q&A, I ask participants to please limit follow-on and multipart questions, so we can get to everyone today. At the end of our Q&A session, I'll turn it back to Ursula for closing comments. Operator, please open the line for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instruction) Our first question comes from the line Brian Essex from Morgan Stanley.","Brian Essex - Morgan Stanley","Good morning. And thank you for taking my questions. Maybe start off with a question for Bob, so you had some nice sequential margin improvement, ex the restructuring or ex charge-off, it was 9.2% over 8.6% last quarter. What kind of -- I guess, the first part of the question is what kind of milestones do you need to hurdle for the remainder of the year, exit the year at a 10% or better than 10% margin run rate? And then I have a follow-up?","Bob Zapfel","Brian, thanks. I would appreciate that we did make -- we did make progress. I think we\u2019ve got a good clear game plan relative to cost management. We\u2019ve moved to a capability centered organization which has allowed us to look at our businesses and where we have a chance to leverage some cost advantages or cost businesses.","So I wouldn\u2019t view it necessarily as some key milestones and jump over it. It\u2019s really more executing our overall plan. And I think we\u2019ve got a very clear line of sight to the track that Kathy laid out that gets us to comfortably at 10% plus as we exit the year.","Brian Essex - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And I understand, when we had the call last quarter, you had only been there for about 21 days. Since then I imagine you have the opportunity to peek under the covers to a little bit greater extent. If you look at the guidance prior quarter of exiting the year better than a 10% run rate, have you been able to identify additional low-hanging fruit and is that going for -- I guess, along the lines of cost improvements or operational improvements. And would that potentially lead to upside to that number and then going into 2015, do we expect sequential improvement again through the year or there is certain factors that could lead to additional lumpiness in margin performance in 2015?","Bob Zapfel","Well, we\u2019ll be more in 2015 at the Investor Day session in November. But again, I would say our track through year end, we\u2019ve got a pretty clear line of -- I wouldn't call it low-hanging fruit. But I would say that -- it never feels that way when you\u2019re operating the business. But I would say we\u2019ve got a very, very clear plan that is broadly owned by the team. And some of this is, that news that we\u2019ve had that\u2019s affected our margin. So it won\u2019t repeat.","So we get a little better lift in the second half versus the first half because of some of the challenges that we specifically called out. But we\u2019ve got a good solid operating plan to deliver those kind of margin as we exit the year. And we certainly are looking -- we certainly are looking at next year as though now we want to fall back in the wrong direction. But we\u2019ll get more detail on the 2015 roadmap when we\u2019re together for the investor session in November.","Ursula Burns","Brian, if you think about -- this is Ursula, all the business lines that Bob manages and he has been leading into in the last couple of months, we manage all of them to try to show us margin expansion on a business-by-business basis. And in the second quarter, we saw that and we expect and literally the plan is to continue to drive those actions through the business so that we see the same kind of margin expansion in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter.","So just reiterating what you said, there is no miracle here. It is literally just operating the business on a line-by-line basis and getting better control over government help, which I think we have the foundation for it today.","Brian Essex - Morgan Stanley","Thanks.","Ursula Burns","We can have the next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Barclays.","Ben Reitzes - Barclays","Hi. I just want to kind of go on to the margin question a little more and ask about the two segments as we go throughout the year and maybe a little bit of a different way. In services, you mentioned renewals down quite a bit and the bookings look like they are below your expectations. So I wanted to just -- I was under the impression renewals, you probably have higher margin than new business.","And in light of that, just how that plays out on the margin line with you guys getting above your -- above 10%. And then on the technology side, I just want to know, you guys talked about margin coming down from 14.4, just how abruptly like does it stabilized in the 12-ish type range because the upside there was about $0.05 in the quarter on that technology margin that was quite staggering. So I just want to see how much that comes back in and why. So it's just a little more detail in both margins in the big segments?","Kathy Mikells","Sure. So Ben, I\u2019ll start with just talking about overall kind of booking and how we see bookings impacting our margins. If we look forward to the second half, clearly we\u2019re expecting bookings to improve in the second half fiscals because they\u2019ve got bigger renewal opportunity as well as additional new bookings expected on top of that.","In terms of renewals versus new-- we wouldn\u2019t expect to see a negative mix implication overall. We always anticipate adding renewals, we have price downs. We\u2019re anticipating that overall and so we don't see any negative mix. And overall if you look at how the mix of the portfolio is changing. Out ITO growth has slowed a little bit. BPO growth is picking up. That\u2019s generally a positive for us on mix overall.","If I flip to the second part of your question which was really about technology margin, if we look at what happened in this quarter, I\u2019d say, three months ago, we underestimated the level of pension improvement we were going to get. We got a little bit more currency improvement and overall mix turned out to be more favorable and we had a little less pricing pressure than we would typically see.","If I go to talk about that in second half, our expectations for our technology margins, we\u2019ll see a dip in the third quarter because we\u2019ve got a lot of new product launches and so that\u2019s mainly the impact there. We don\u2019t get quite as much pension benefit in the third quarter. So pension benefits are a little bit lumpy for us because we have pension settlement cost.","But overall if you look at the second half and certainly the guidance we gave for the full year, at least 100 basis points above the high end of our 9% to 11% range, I feel really good about technology margins but I feel great about our ability to continue to well-manage this business to produce very strong profit and very strong cash flow.","Ursula Burns","Thanks Ben. If we could move to the next question please?","Operator","Certainly, our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross from Cross Research.","Shannon Cross - Cross Research","Thank you very much. Jeff, I had a question for you. Could you talk a bit about what you're seeing in the printing market? I mean, you\u2019ve got rollout of significantly more product in the second half of this year. Do you expect market share gains? What markets are you sort of focused on and if you can give any color in terms of geography because it seems like Europe was pretty strong? And then I had a quick follow-up. Thanks.","Jeff Jacobson","Sure. Shannon. So let me just say in terms of our activity, our activity has been strong for the past year and we gained a share point in 2013. And in Q1 and as Kathy said we knew we would have a tough Q2 compare, due to ConnectKey, our entry production color high launch. However Kathy mentioned our product launch is coming in the second half, which I think will really start seeing more of a benefit in Q4 and certainly into 2015 where we have about 20 new launches in the second half.","We\u2019re benefiting entire company but I think it will especially benefit our developing markets, our channels organization and certainly document outsourcing. And I think it\u2019s also important to mention that even in this quarter where we had a tough compare in our median high segments, we had sequential growth in both color and mono, and in entry, we were essentially flat in color.","Ursula Burns","Let me take some of the geographies. We\u2019re seeing pretty stable business environment in the U.S., very predictable for us. We manage it well. And so you were right -- Europe, last quarter, we saw improvement. This quarter, Europe is hanging in there for us and doing well. Developing market continues to be a precious place for us.","My expectation is that U.S. and Europe will continue to trend that they are on and unfortunately developing economies will continue to trend that they want to be. It would be tough for us. The product launch that Jeff talked about should help us, giving them more optionality to sell and deal. But it\u2019s not clear that the environment they will actually pick it all up.","Shannon Cross - Cross Research","Okay. Great and then just my follow-up question for Bob or Ursula, I'm not sure which. When you think about New York State in the contract that you've -- I know it's not finalized, but it appears you're going to be awarded. How do we think about that in light of some of the startup costs that we saw with California Medi-Cal? I mean, is this something where you're going to be able to leverage some of your newer platforms, so perhaps not as many startup costs or just how do we sort of think about that as we look through the year?","Ursula Burns","Bob will take it.","Bob Zapfel","Yeah, Shannon, I think the way to think about New York is obviously first we have to -- we have to move from award to contracts. So we are excited for the opportunity to do that after the protest cycle and our view would be we\u2019ve really learned a lot through the prior implementations. We think that we will be able to execute New York well for the citizens in the state and for us. It won\u2019t be, all of these new implementations start with not huge margins. You make your money over time, but that\u2019s the way we built it into all of our guidance. So, that\u2019s plan for us. We understand we don\u2019t expect to have big unrecovered costs, but we do know that they don\u2019t start at higher margin that that\u2019s the business model designed. It\u2019s not unique to any individual state that services broadly and that\u2019s part of what we\u2019ve accounted for in our commitments as we go forward.","Jim Lesko","Thanks, Jim. If we could have the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citigroup.","Jim Suva - Citigroup","Thank you. And congratulations to you and your team there at Xerox. If we\u2019re to look at several of the metrics such as signings and bookings and margins -- and I am looking more forward-looking. Should we then expect them to no longer come up? Or given the timing of when the decisions were made from Texas, Nevada, California, and New York that there might be some impact to those? And I think that maybe help us filter through the magnitude of what we should expect.","Kathy Mikells","So on signing, the loss of Texas is basically behind us. It was reflected overall in our renewal rate. What we\u2019re expecting going forward as we talked about signings improvements in the second half and so New York isn\u2019t included in our numbers today, but we would expect to see that in the future. We have another award, that\u2019s under protest for a tolling deal that we did in Florida, again not included in our numbers, part of the reason why we have a good amount optimism in the second half. So overall, we feel good about looking forward in signings improvements in the second half.","Ursula Burns","And our renewal rate without the Texas loss would be in the range that we wanted to be in the 85% to 90% range. So the Texas loss is a singular event, but our business flows are fairly consistent with all the quarters previously, particular on renewals.","Jim Suva - Citigroup","Okay. And then as a quick follow-up, when we think about there has been a lot of public information about the New York contract and the California contract. When those are ramping, are those fully considered in your margin profile outlook, or are you building in a little additional stand-up costs? I at least want to make sure that we're just not then going to be seeing some additional pressure from those ramping.","Kathy Mikells","Both of those are fully contemplated in the guidance.","Jim Suva - Citigroup","Great. That\u2019s good to hear. Thank you and congratulations again.","Jim Lesko","Thanks, Jim. If we could have the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray.","George Tong - Piper Jaffray","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I will just start out with Kathy. Could you provide the impact or expected impact on the various government healthcare contracts you have rolling on and off over the next several quarters? Specifically, what the timing is for when New York MMIS will come online and whether the expected impact for Texas MMIS will be a very consistent 150 basis points year-over-year? Then I have a follow-up. Thanks.","Kathy Mikells","And so take New York first. New York is a little bit hard to call perfectly right is we are going to a protest period and we then have to contract. Our expectation would be that we start to see a little bit of New York coming on towards the tail end of this year, but it has a more material impact in 2015. And then with respect to Texas, Texas is going to tail off pretty quickly. And so we have a little bit of transition in Texas, but we expect to see Texas tail off pretty fast.","Bob Zapfel","Kathy, if I could add, so that 150 basis points on the top line, we would be dealing with that if you will for roughly for a quarter. So, that is it will hit us to start. As Kathy has mentioned, as we kind of go through the third and fourth quarters. And then on a quarter year-over-year basis we would be looking at that still in the first half of next year as well.","George Tong - Piper Jaffray","That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks. And lastly, Ursula and Bob, could you share color on how the other parts of the services business is performing, so commercial BPO, commercial ITO and document outsourcing?","Ursula Burns","I will start at the highest level. Let\u2019s say I am pleased with all of them and let me let Bob go into a little bit more color.","Bob Zapfel","Yeah, I would say we really had -- we\u2019ve got the challenge obviously what we talked about in government healthcare, but if you look at the rest of the portfolio, our business in Europe was up double digits organically, even more sizably with the benefit of an acquisition earlier in the year. Our commercial healthcare business is growing at double-digit rates with very strong margins. Our HR and learning business is performing very well for the most part the mix. I mean not everybody is perfect, but the mix across the rest of those businesses in aggregate we are very pleased with.","Ursula Burns","And one -- if I can add one point on ITO, very specifically, our revenue growth in ITO is half for the last few quarters, last two quarters at least slowed to low-single digits and we spoke about this in last year\u2019s Investor Conference, and I am sure in some calls before about how we look at our ITO business. It\u2019s a good business for us. It is a relatively small business for us and it operates at the lower end of our margin range. And so we are focusing on margin expansion, an improvement in ITO and not so much on revenue growth there. We are putting most our bullets or guns in the -- bullets in the gun around BPO and document outsourcing from a revenue growth perspective and that will continue.","Bob Zapfel","And that\u2019s part of the portfolio mix strategy that the team covered last November at the Investor meeting. So that\u2019s part of our five-plank strategy is really around trying to grow more rapidly in our most 'advantage' businesses. And Ursula\u2019s comments are right to that point.","Jim Lesko","Thanks, George. If we could have our next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman from BMO Capital Markets.","Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets","Hi. Thank you, guys. I have two questions as well. The first is philosophical growth rate. And what I mean by that is, Bob, I was hoping you could address BPO and ITO. And the recent data points around BPO have been very mixed. A lot of your competitors and even some of the leading consulting organizations have suggested that the BPO market has indeed slowed. Now Xerox is in a slightly different segment or at least a slightly different segment than some of the leading organizations, but I was hoping you could address on the market level if you are seeing a slowdown in BPO? Related to that is the ITO side. Ursula just mentioned, your strategy is different, which I think is completely appropriate, but can you grow the ITO side, or does that become a negative growth rate as you look out? And then I have a follow-on question on margins, please.","Bob Zapfel","Yeah, I would say on the BPO market, we are in the middle of our strategy cycle. We see that market, obviously it\u2019s a broad $200 billion plus market. It breaks into horizontal, multi-industry components and industry-specific components. Overall, we see it at mid-single-digits and there is a little bit different mix depending on what area, but it\u2019s a very attractive market from our standpoint. And I would view it as a more favorable from a market dynamic standpoint, more favorable than ITO which is -- it was earlier in the maturity cycle, grew to be a very large market more rapidly. So we still feel very good. Obviously segment by segment, we look at each of them, but if you just macro to BPO broadly, we see mid-single-digit growth through the strategic horizon in that business area.","Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets","Okay. Well, I will transition to my second question. Although, Bob, I'd love you to come back on and say can ITO grow or does it go negative? But my second question is for you, Ursula, as well as for Bob. You do seem to be doing well in the commercial side of your services business, which the healthcare or government side, more specifically the government side of healthcare continues to struggle, why not deemphasize that business? Nobody makes any money who serves the healthcare industry in the government side, it doesn't seem. CSC has been pretty vocal that they did not follow up with a bid for the New York side because they didn't think they would make money in it. So just philosophically, why not focus more on the commercial side and deemphasize the government healthcare related activities and thereby improve your sustainable profit levels?","Ursula Burns","I don\u2019t think that we are not focused more or focused a lot on the commercial side we are, but we also -- the government healthcare market is a very attractive market. We went through one cycle when this market started many, many years ago that shows that we could invest in a new platform, stay in that platform up and have it last for many, many years and continue to drive growth on topline and profitability on the bottomline. That is -- that remains our expectation.","And if you look at some of the contracts that are more mature, moving towards more maturity, California, for example, we have been able to literally move that contract from investment phase to flat profitability now to looking for growing profitability in a very predictable kind of a standard way, took a little bit longer but on a go forward basis California is going to be beautiful. And we expect as we implement New York to be beautiful as well. So we\u2019re not deemphasizing commercial in favor of government, not at all. We\u2019re focused on all of them at a demographic show that we should be focused on them as well.","Bob Zapfel","If I could just add one point a color, we\u2019re above 10% operating margins and the majority of roughly 70% of our government healthcare business. So our experience, I can\u2019t speak to the competitor, but our experience is once you get this stabilized, you can have a great value proposition for the client and good for the shareowners. And one of client just yesterday came out and reference that we\u2019ve been working through some issues, but they expect the system to have a 20 year longevity. So, that\u2019s the reason that we don\u2019t view it as an area to exit or deemphasize.","Jim Lesko","Thanks, Keith. If we can move on to next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan","Great. Thanks for sharing that commercial margin in the size. I didn't realize how big it was. Actually I just wanted to ask first about signings and the outlook for the second half. Can you be more specific there? Can you get to a book-to-bill north of say 1 in the second half without New York?","Kathy Mikells","Yes. So I\u2019ll get a little more specific. When we look at the second half, we\u2019re expecting improvements and we think roughly we should end the year flattish on a 12-month trailing basis. So we clearly have expectations make up for some of the softness in the first half.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan","Understood. And then just my follow-up, the outlook on Document Technology margins, same question there, maybe you can be a little more specific. It sounds like you could stay above your target range in the second half. You called out the 2 points around pension and transaction effects, but it feels like with some of the changes, is it possible we can assume that your longer-term margin target 9% to 11% could be elevated given some of the -- given the run rate?","Kathy Mikells","So I\u2019m going to put aside sort to 2015 and long term, but if you just look at the second half, we guided specifically to being at call it the high end of that 9% to 11% target range for the third quarter. We typically are a fourth quarter stronger just from a seasonality perspective in the technology business.","And if you look at some of the kind of year-over-year things that are going on, one of the things we had last year where these receivable sales or financing receivable sales. And so year-over-year we have a little less headwind in the fourth quarter from that than we do in the third quarter. So we would expect seasonally better performance in the fourth quarter there.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan","Yeah. Now it seems like it\u2019s in a good place, that\u2019s why I asked. Thank you.","Kathy Mikells","Great.","Jim Lesko","Thank you, Tien-tsin. If we could have the next question please.","Operator","Certainly, our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah from Brean Capital.","Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital","Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Two if I could. The first is on services rev growth. Bob, can you just kind of walk through what -- given that there has been some choppiness this year in both revenue growth and in signing, can you give us a sense of what the headwinds are going into 2015? And how we should think about those kind of layering in and falling off as we exit the year?","Bob Zapfel","Yeah. I guess from a headwind standpoint, we\u2019re still have the student loan runoff, that\u2019s more of a factor in the second half of the year, the next year. Texas will be a headwind as we\u2019ve talked about more in the first half of next year than as we exit the year. We\u2019ve got -- as we\u2019ve referenced, we\u2019ve got some substantial contract award potential for us as we close out this year that will then lead to filling in some of those gaps.","And we view the market, as I briefly said earlier at a mid-single-digit growth rate and we think that we can get roughly that range as part of our overall sales strategy. So there are a few headwinds, they are not unknown headwinds though. And we\u2019ve got a team that wants to be successful on the marketplace and that\u2019s our focus.","Ursula Burns","If I can just put an umbrella on top of that, so BPO, Bob has talked about it, I have mentioned it, higher growth rates, document outsourcing higher growth rate. The part of the market that we are, that we\u2019ll continue to have a low growth rate for us is the ITO business, that is not something that the market should panic on, that is literally the strategy.","One actually focus on profitability there, be very selective with our contract plans and we\u2019re doing that. Our renewals and our renewal rate continues to be strong. Loss of 85%, we continue to have that as an expectation. Decisions are slow, a little bit -- well they were little bit slower in the second quarter. A lot of them have moved to the third quarter and fourth and we expect to sign the ones that coming up then. We have a very good win rate on new business there, the 10 or so that we were pursuing in the quarter.","We lost two and signed eight. We expect to have that kind of a flow going forward. So I think that the revenue portion of the picture, there are puts and takes and there are of course some ups and down, Texas down, etcetera, etcetera. But I think on a macro basis, it looks good.","Jim Lesko","Thanks, Ananda. If we could have the next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Shope from Goldman Sachs.","Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs","Okay. Thank you. So my first question is on services. So you have the Nevada issue out of the way, which obviously gives you room for improvement into the back half. But given some of the other contract challenges you've had and some of the unexpected challenges in recent months, is there a risk that we could see further write-downs in the second half or do you feel like the model is pretty fully scrubbed at this point?","And then my second question, a broader question would be on your restructuring plans, how is it going relative to your original targets? And as you refine the services strategy, are you finding any new opportunities arising in the restructuring category? That\u2019s it for me.","Kathy Mikells","So overall on the first piece, the impairment charges that we took in the quarter were associated with our state (indiscernible) platform, right? And we basically completely cleansed our balance sheet with regard to that. As you look then at our Medicaid platform, I mean, we\u2019re winning new business in the marketplace. So, we don\u2019t really see any issue there in terms of some future shoe to drop type of thing.","Overall, I\u2019d also mention in this quarter that we settled with another state in terms of just our execution plan associated with their implementation and more specifics around the design and functionality. And so that\u2019s another one that I\u2019d say, we really kind of tucked away in this quarter. So we feel pretty good about our grip on what we need to do in order to continue to mature the implementations.","And I would say kind of kudos to the Government Health Solutions group in terms of pretty well predicting outside of the impairment charge. What we\u2019re going to see in this quarter which is why when I exclude the impairment charge, we\u2019ve really had the profitability in margin progression that we were expecting.","On the second question on restructuring, we\u2019ve been very consistent about restructuring. I\u2019d expect to continue to see about $0.02 a quarter at the very beginning of the year. We said, we expect that restructuring charges to be pretty similar year-over-year and I think we did about a $115 million in total in restructuring charges last year. So maybe we would be a tad higher this year, but we\u2019re going to continue to be pretty consistent in our overall approach to restructuring.","Ursula Burns","And one of the things that we talked about in this infamous or famous five-plank strategy, one of the major things we talked about was cost improvement in services. So we have a lot of focus on restructuring in the technology business and have a good reason there. And Bob is developing that same level of discipline and rhythm in the services business, so I expect the restructuring to participate and drive margin expansion, portion of the margin expansion that Bob is counting on and continue to be strong margin contributors in the technology business as well.","Jim Lesko","Thanks, Bill. And operator, I think we have time for one last question.","Operator","Certainly, our final question for today comes from the line of James Friedman from Susquehanna.","James Friedman - Susquehanna","Hi. Thanks for sneaking me in and I'll ask my two upfront. First for Ursula, second for Kathy. Ursula, when you look across the services portfolio, which do you emphasize more, is it revenue growth or margins? And then, Kathy, I'll just ask you upfront, could you share some color on the margin characteristics of ISG and Smart Data? And are there other dispositions, meaning asset sales that you have planned in the second half? Thank you.","Ursula Burns","By the way your first question is a good question and unfortunately it doesn\u2019t have a singular answer. It depends on the section of the business and markets that we\u2019re speaking about. I just talked about ITO for example. And in ITO, I emphasized margin expansion over revenue growth. It doesn\u2019t mean I want them to walk away from good business that we can get and we can stand up in a margin expanding way, but I actually tell them more focus on margin than on revenue.","In government healthcare, it\u2019s both. I want to make sure we do not lose any large contracts and in places like in MMIS where we have a platform go hard to what\u2019s growing that business, why would you expand margins. So it\u2019s a mix of discussions and it\u2019s different across the word transportation, revenue growth, etcetera.","Our advantaged businesses revenue growth and our businesses that are not performing at the level that we want from a margin perspective, its margin on focus, so it\u2019s a mix of things. And the good news is that Bob can actually walk and chew gum at the same time. So he can actually manage too many different signals that I gave him.","Kathy Mikells","And then just on the second question, generally as we\u2019ve talked about one plank of our overall services strategy as it\u2019s just portfolio management and we\u2019re trying to improve the overall mix of our business, right. So as you look at the things that we\u2019re acquiring, they\u2019re very strategically aligned with that strategy. And I would say, ISG and Smart Data absolutely fall into that category. Smart Data gives us a little bit of added scale in the litigation space, litigation services, which is the great business for us, it\u2019s a high margin business. And ISG got added into our insurance overall portfolio and so again, looking to mix up and not looking to dilute margin.","Jim Lesko","Great. Thank you. That\u2019s all the time we have for questions today. We generally thank you for your interest. Ursula, anything more to wrap up.","Ursula Burns","Thanks, Jim. And I\u2019m confident that we have the right strategy and the right team in place to deliver on that strategy. We\u2019re making progress and we have a lot of work to do to continue to create greater value for our employees, our customers and our shareholders and we are up to the challenge.","Jim Lesko","Thanks, Ursula. That concludes our call today. If you have any further questions, please contact me or any members from our Investor Relations team. Thank so much for joining us today.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a good day."]}}
