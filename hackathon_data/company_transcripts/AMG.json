At this, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Selene Oh, Vice President, Investor Relations for AMG. Thank you. You may begin.","Selene Oh","Thank you for joining AMG to discuss the results for the second quarter of 2018.","In this conference call, certain matters discussed will constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those referenced in the company's Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time-to-time. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the call.","AMG will provide on the Investor Relations section of its website at www.amg.com, a replay of the call and a copy of our announcement of our results for the quarter as well as a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of any estimates of the company's economic earnings per share for future periods that are announced on this call.","With us on the line to discuss the company's results for the quarter are Nate Dalton, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Horgen, Chief Financial Officer.","With that, I will turn the call over to Nate.","Nate Dalton","Thanks, Selene. Good morning everyone.","AMG generated strong results in the second quarter with positive net client cash flow of $4.3 billion, and year-over-year growth of 8% in economic earnings per share. Our results reflects the strength of our strategic position in attractive areas of alternative and active global equities and ongoing significant client demand for our Affiliates' broad range of distinctive return streams especially in these areas.","At the highest level, we're pleased with our organic growth as we generate continued strong growth sales and return overall more normal level of redemption. While still early in the third quarter, we're off to a good start so far with positive flows and the level of activity at all stage of the sales cycle remains very high across AMGs and our Affiliates business development team. We are seeing across won but unfunded mandates, finals, and RFPs.","In terms of second quarter flows across our product categories, we saw continued strong demand for alternative with $2.6 billion in positive net flows. We generated record sales in global equities during the quarter resulting in $1.9 billion in net flows while U.S. equities had one of its best quarters in the years on a net basis with only modest outflows. Finally, we continue to see positive flows in our multi-asset and other category as some newer products are starting to gain traction.","Turning to our quarterly flows by distribution channel, we saw significant strength within institutional, it is our best quarter in the last three years with $5.3 billion in net flows and sales well diversified across the product categories. Our institutional flows were also well diversified by geography with sales in each of our coverage region.","In the retail channel, we reported net outflows of $0.5 billion and while we saw weakness in our liquid alternative, this was mostly offset by strong sales in global equities. In terms of subcategories within the retail channel, we had good traction in sub-advisory in certain non-U.S. region.","Finally, in the high net worth channel we reported modest outflows of $0.5 billion which we believe were driven primarily by a few SMA model changes, but otherwise the underlying demand trends remain in play.","One final point relative to flows in the quarter, we were pleased to see a very diverse group of product types and affiliates contributing significantly as we saw strong sales across AQR, Capula, EIG, Pantheon, and Systematica with an alternative segment while Artemis, Harding Loevner, TimesSquare and Veritas were notable contributors within our global equity segment. As I said, we are off to a strong start to the second half of the year and now let me also spend a minute on why we are very confident about our long-term organic growth prospects.","First and most importantly begins with our affiliate outstanding long-term track record with investment performance in areas where we continue to see a secular demand trend including global equities and liquid alternative. Fundamentally many of our affiliates, largest and most significant products continue to build on excellent and distinctive track record. ","Second, we and our affiliates are innovating and developing new products which is of course critically important to match evolving client needs. Examples are many and diverse and will include AQR beginning to build a fixed income franchise, our U.S. equity manager such as TimesSquare launching International in our emerging markets franchise, or GW&K evolving from a great mini bond manager to successful U.S. and now an international equity manager. Artemis in particular has been very successful model leveraging their UK retail brand across a series of new product, homegrown and through leftouts.","Third, we have a unique distribution strategy that combines the focused distribution resources at each of our affiliates with a leveragable token sale of AMG's global distribution platform and our continuous evolution and improvement of those platforms and this includes coverage of geographies and channels, but also packaging and operational expertise. As you heard us say this distribution strategy is increasingly effective as leading clients worldwide in the intermodal serves them are consolidating their relationships with external managers and looking for more effective relationships and even partnerships with a smaller universe of investment management firms.","Now one product there we highlighted recently that holds all three of these organs together is our growing franchise in illiquid alternatives across facilities such as Baring Asia, EIG, and Pantheon.","First each of these Affiliates' produces distinctive return streams in their flagship product. Second, we and they have been working to innovate and develop additional product such as the infrastructure real asset and credit strategy to Pantheon, the Asia Credit and Real Estate product with Baring Asia, and credits direct lending and operating energy capabilities at EIG. Third we and they have been working together to diversify their distribution opportunities and bring their expanding products sets to the most appropriate capital worldwide.","Now expanding on that last point about distribution capability, we continue to leverage AMG's scale in working with our affiliates to bring their differentiated strategy to sophisticated clients and intermediaries around the world. As you know, we have been successful in strategically and deliberately building out our global distribution capabilities over the past dozen years.","First in Australia, then next turning to the Middle East, Europe and parts of Asia and offering clients an array of distinctive return streams managed by best in class boutique firms. As we mentioned on recent calls, we are extending our Asian coverage to Japan. We are opening our office in close cooperation with Pantheon which recently opened their Tokyo office and we're in the planning stages with certain other affiliates. Given the array of relationships, we and our affiliates have been establishing with some of the largest and most important clients and leaders in Japan we see tremendous growth opportunities building on our early wins and we look forward to updating you more in the quarters to come.","Putting together the three elements I highlighted earlier first Affiliate investment performance, second continued innovation and product development, and third our unique collaborative distribution strategy our growth prospects was very good and that is just speaking about our existing Affiliates. In addition AMGs business strategy provides a unique opportunity to generate incremental earnings growth and product diversification through accretive investments in new affiliates. Given our outstanding track record spanning more than two decades, AMG is the partner of choice for boutique firms around the world both traditional and alternatives which take a permanent strategic partner. We have an outstanding secular opportunity here and while the pace of activity is inherently based on the dynamics of each prospective affiliate, we continue to make good progress across a range of potential new investments. As always, we remain very disciplined and highly selective.","Now given the scale of our recurring free cash flow generation we were able to execute these elements of our growth strategy, while also consistently returning capital to shareholders through both our regular cash dividends as well as ongoing and increasing share repurchases as our earnings grow. As Jay will discuss further in a moment we demonstrated the disciplined approach to capital again last quarter.","Looking ahead, we are very account in our ability to continue to enhance the quality, diversity and earnings power of our business and generate outstanding long-term shareholder value. Through our unique business model we offer the focused expertise and specialist managers along with the scale and resources of a global asset management franchise. To manage the 25 year track record of deploying the cash flow generated by our business to create shareholder value.","And with that I'll turn it to Jay to discuss our results in more detail.","Jay Horgen","Thank you, Nate and good morning.","AMG generates strong organic growth for the second quarter with $4.3 billion in net client cash flows across a broad array of alternatives and active global equity strategies.","As Nate described we feel good about our improving organic growth profile and looking forward we are off to a good start in the second half of the year with positive flows in July to-date and a strong pipeline of one but unfunded mandates.","Now turning to the details for the quarter, I'm going to describe our business trends within each product category with a focus on both flows and market performance through June. And given that this is the first time for me to review our business trends, the flow and format may be a little different and will evolve over time. I look forward to your feedback as we continue to enhance our disclosure.","Starting with alternatives which account for 39% of our AUM we had another good quarter of organic growth and saw meaningful positive contributions from both our liquid and illiquid parts that totaling $2.6 billion in net flows for the quarter. Focusing on the illliquids for a moment we had a solid level of findings in the second quarter but in July we generated more commitments in this category than all of the second quarter.","Beyond illiquid, consistent with recent trends the systematic diversified category continues to be challenged. However we had experienced good flows within multi-strategy as well as the fixed income and equity relative value category.","Now turning to our selective benchmarks by alternative category, within systematic diversified which accounts for 5% of our AUM our selected industry benchmark continued to move lower with the SG Trend Index down 1.3% for the quarter and 5.2% year-to-date. However most of our products in this category maintained good relative performance.","Within fixed income and equity relative value which accounts for 9% of our AUM our selected industry benchmarks were modestly positive with HFRI relative value of 1.1% for the quarter and 1.5% year-to-date and HFRI equity hedge up 0.9% for the quarter and 1.2% year-to-date. And finally the HFRI active index was up 4.8% for the quarter and 2.4% year-to-date. While our benchmarks remain modestly positive generally we have seen mixed relative performance in this category however we have seen strong relative performance from our event driven strategy.","Now turning to multi-strat and other which accounts for 15% of our AUM our selected industry benchmark was modestly positive with HFRI fund weighted composite of 0.8% for both the second quarter and year-to-date. Against this backdrop our performance has been mixed for both the quarter and year-to-date.","Next turning to our private equity and real asset category which accounts for 10% of our AUM and includes strategies such as global and regional private equity, co-investments, credit, real assets, infrastructure, and real estate. Our Affiliates maintained strong long-term track record and the pace of product innovation extensions in this category has led to even greater growth in our business.","Next turning to global equities which account for 34% of our AUM we saw net inflows of $1.9 billion in the quarter driven by retail sales including a number of sub-advisory wins as well as strong momentum in institutional sales with a significant improvement in redemption level. Selected industry benchmarks in the category were mixed with MSCI world up 1.9% for the quarter and 0.8% year-to-date while the MSCI EP was down 1% for the quarter and 2.4% year-to-date and MSCI Merger Market was down 7.9% for the quarter and 6.5% year-to-date. And U.S. equities which account for 14% of our AUM we reported outflows of $400 million and while negative overall we had a good institutional flow quarter with number of wins and continued to see pockets of ongoing opportunities.","While industry trends continue to be challenged in U.S. equities our overall redemptions have been improving over time. Selected industry benchmarks were positive with the S&P 500 up 3.4% for the quarter and 2.6% year-to-date and the Russell 2000 up 7.8% for the quarter and 7.7% year-to-date.","Finally in multi-asset and others account for 13% of our AUM and encompasses multi-asset and balanced mandates within our wealth management business as well as a number of specialty fixed income and multi-asset products we had a slightly positive quarter producing net flows of $200 million.","While we saw some weakness with our legacy fixed income products, our wealth management affiliates continue to generate positive flows and we are seeing good momentum in new products including systematic fixed income.","Before turning to the financials, I wanted to reiterate that we are pleased with our improving organic growth profile as we and our affiliates are realizing the benefits of new products, new packaging, and new geographies.","Now turning to our financials. As we saw in the release, we reported economic earnings per share of $3.61 for the second quarter which included net performance fees of $0.10. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $2.16. For the second quarter, aggregate fees grew 5% to $1.3 billion from a year-ago driven by positive markets and organic growth and alternatives. The ratio of aggregate fees to average assets under management declined modestly year-over-year from 64 basis points to 62 basis points which was driven in part by timing differences between AUM and revenue recognition as well as changes in composition of our AUM.","Adjusted EBITDA decreased 3% to $246.2 million from a year ago reflecting lower other income from realized and unrealized gains, modestly lower net performance fees, and the impact of investments which position our business for long-term growth.","Economic net income grew 4% to $195.6 million from a year ago reflecting lower interest expense and lower tax rate, while economic earnings per share grew 8% to $3.61 given lower year-over-year share count due to repurchase activity.","Turning to more of specific modeling items for the second quarter the ratio of adjusted EBITDA to average assets under management was 11.9 basis points or 11.5 basis points excluding performance fees. Looking ahead, we expect adjusted EBITDA to average assets under management to be approximately 11.3 basis points in the third quarter reflecting seasonally lower performance fees and continued investment in product development and distribution capabilities.","Our share of interest expense was $21.4 million for the second quarter. In the third quarter we expect our share of interest expense to remain at approximately $21 million.","Our share before the amortization impairments was $74.4 million for the second quarter including $56.8 million from Affiliates accounted for under the equity method which was elevated primarily due to a non-cash impairment charge of $33 million related to Ivory. While this non-cash charge reduced our carrying value to zero, the economic impact was far less at roughly $1 million in yield of per quarter. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect our share before the amortization to return to a normalized level of $41 million.","Turning to our taxes, with regard to our tax rate in the second quarter our effective GAAP tax rate was 21.3% and our cash tax rate was 18.1% which was lower due to adjustments related to U.S. tax reform and we expect these rates to normalize on a full-year basis. Looking forward, we expect our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 25% and our cash tax rate to be approximately 20%.","Intangible related to deferred taxes were $4.7 million which was lower in the quarter given the level of amortization and impairment. For the third quarter, we expect intangible related for taxes to return to approximately $12 million as our amortization normalizes.","Other economic items were negative $0.5 million for the second quarter. For modeling purposes we expect our other economic items to be approximately $1 million per quarter.","Our adjusted weighted average share count for the second quarter was 54.2 million and we expect it to be approximately 53.5 million for the third quarter reflecting a continued level of repurchases and we now expect our adjusted weighted average share count for the full-year to be approximately $53.9 million.","Turning to our balance sheet in the second quarter, we paid a $0.30 dividend per share and we repurchased 150 million in shares. Looking to the second half of the year, we expect to repurchase between 200 million and 300 million depending on the level of new investment activity.","Looking ahead, we are confident in our ability to generate outstanding long-term shareholder value through both the organic growth of our global asset management business as well as the deployment of capital into accretive investments in outstanding new affiliates while also consistently returning capital to shareholders.","Now I\u2019d be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions].","Our first question comes from the line of Will Katz with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Will Katz","Okay, thank you very much. And thank you for taking the questions. So just come back to flows for a moment if it's sort of differentiated update versus some of your peers last week, how much of this might be cyclical in terms of some of the product gains even out there on alternative side and how much of it do you think is little more structural just given that you sort of ended with new products, expanded opportunity, expanded geographies, et cetera and how you sort of think about that beyond the third quarter just look out maybe the second half of the year and even into 2019?","Jay Horgen","Great. Thanks, Will for the question. So sort of simply put I think much of it is using the firm, so I think much of it is structural and therefore sustainable and on some level there is really nothing all that different or new from the way we\u2019ve been talking about overall levels of growth sales but if you look over the last probably year and year-and-a-half our gross sales have actually been pretty good. And then the question then is well okay so why and we covered much of this in the prepared remarks but as I said it starts with the distinctive track records and that our Affiliates are producing, and these are great institutional brands, these Affiliates I think are seeing in global equities like Harding Loevner or Veritas and with our alternatives we are talking about brands like AQR or Capula or Winton and in the liquids which we highlighted in the prepared remarks it\u2019s brands like Pantheon, Baring, and EIG.","And I used that word brand because it is as we talked about these are franchises that are growing and expanding and we talked about just approximization but it\u2019s really doing a better and better job matching the capabilities of the firms with the evolving client needs across channel and geographies. And so sort of a layer down if you sort of step back, we had sales in something like in 400 products in the quarter and a bunch of those are products that didn\u2019t have five years ago and those include some of the fastest growing lines. Now that say as you said some of that will have cycles to it especially where is something that's got a fund raising cycle to it or where there is a product exploiting specific opportunities at one of our Affiliates fees. But in the main that that overall kind of wave of product development and evolution is the most important, is most important theme.","And then again just to make sure everybody is tracking for us product development happens some at the Affiliate of course just Affiliates alone, it also happens us jointly with Affiliates and this is something that we\u2019re still at the see early stages of because we\u2019re getting better and better at bringing market knowledge that we have back to the Affiliates. Again that can talk about leveraging the scope and scale. And then as we always have we have this unique ability to add kind of prudent well performing products with distinctive, serve distinctive products through our new mechanism.","So we have sort of all those kind of product development engine and then as we have said in our prepared remarks, it\u2019s not just product development that way and innovation but it\u2019s also the packaging and distribution capabilities, extensions and wrappers and some of that is simply bringing product to new geographies and channels.","And while we talked about the opening of Tokyo here, it\u2019s important to note also that over the last really couple of years we've been adding resources in Europe and little bit in the Middle-East and a little bit in Asia as we are doing some channel expansions in places like that and then we\u2019ve also been making some modest investments in packaging and capabilities and here I would highlight things like the Pantheon, Zodiac Fund, or something which is public as we can talk about it. If we put all this together the performance, the brand, the innovation and this distribution size so actually we think those are the things that will -- that have been showing up in gross sales and will continue to drive gross sales going forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Dan Fannon","Thanks, good morning. I guess Jay could you kind of update us on your kind of the outlook views, you think about performance views into the back half of the year and just kind of the benchmarks versus your guidance from earlier in the year in terms of where we sit?","Jay Horgen","Yes, thanks Dan. So maybe I'll take this in two pieces. I will talk about the third quarter and then maybe the rest of the year. So first as I said in the prepared remarks, we\u2019re off to a good start, we have seen positive markets and positive flows in July so far our current blend across all categories is up 1.5% that includes FX as well that's from a base of $824 billion which you can see on the June 30 -- in the June 30 numbers. So we\u2019re up in July should give us a little bit of lift here in the quarter and for the year.","You also just one week turn to the third quarter I gave some guidance in the call around our EBITDA to average AUM of 11.3 basis points which is slightly lower than while we came in this quarter. And I just want to remind everyone our third quarter is a typically seasonally low point for us both EBITDA and earnings primarily given the population of performance fee contracts to crystallize in the third quarter a very low that population, so as a result we\u2019re only expecting one or two pennies in this third quarter. So that\u2019s in there obviously we continue to as you heard from Nate to make investments in the business of new products and new capabilities that's all reflected in the 11.3 basis points.","And then looking beyond the third quarter to the fourth and staying on performance fees for a moment then I\u2019ll just maybe take the perspective of full-year and then I\u2019ll narrow it to the fourth quarter. Given the benchmarks that I mentioned in my prepared remarks and the alternative category primarily most of those benchmarks are modestly positive and so really if the comment is about make is more about the overall benchmarks our relative performance is pretty good with the exception of the continuing challenging environment for systematic diversified.","So really relative performance is good, benchmark is modest and I think when you factor all that together and you think about where we are in the year, we\u2019re now tracking closer to about $1.30 for the whole year in performance fees of course is a range around that, we\u2019ve already booked $0.50 in the first half I mentioned one or two pennies in the third quarter, so at least about $0.80 in the fourth quarter, this is a conservative estimate and we're just in July. So we\u2019ve had obviously many environments where the third and fourth quarter bring about lots of performance fees.","So I just wanted to point that out still feeling pretty good about the prospects of performance fees beyond 2018 just given the relative long-term performance of our alternative products.","And then, finally on capital deployment and maybe I will even touch a little bit on 2019 here. As you think about what have you said, we continue to repurchase shares at a reasonably high level 200 to 300 in the second half of the year. We have already done 300 in the first half that's brought our average share count down quite a bit, we expect the weighted average share count for the year to breakthrough $54 million and when we look at the year-end share count we\u2019re seeing it below $53 million, just a touch below $53 million. So that is a pretty good set-up going into next year as we started this year $57 million and we\u2019re ending it $53 million. So looking forward to 2019 together with sort of improving organic growth profile, lower share count, and some good things going on our business we're looking forward to that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your question.","Patrick Davitt","Good morning, thank you. Last couple of quarters you talked about some big wins in the pipeline getting delayed, did that help 2Q or you still waiting for some of those to come through and Jay your comments about July commitments and all being more than all of 2Q, is that actual inflow or is that just adding to the pipeline? Thanks.","Nate Dalton","Yes, let me start and then maybe Jay can take up on that last bit. So as I think we\u2019ve talked about we have been both sort of compositioning the product mix as well as kind of the combination of channel geographies and pursuing some more complicated mandates. With some of that absolutely did start to materialize in the second quarter but in terms of the pipeline overall the overall pipeline that\u2019s all been replenished and so it\u2019s not like hey that this was this kind of one-time thing.","That is part of -- those kind of mandates I think are part of two overall trends, one is a trend in the marketplace which is the behavior of pools of capital and the large intermediaries and how they're narrowing because lots of folks talk about that and the other is again on our side which is the evolving capabilities that we and our affiliates have to do it increasingly good job, and again to be clear there is lots more you could do increasing good job sort of spacing off against that trend. So we are seeing some of that pull-through but we also -- we\u2019re also just seeing that opportunity as a long and growing opportunity. And then Jay I don\u2019t know if you want to touch on the --","Jay Horgen","Yes, Patrick just maybe starting with the second quarter, I mentioned in my prepared remarks we saw $2.6 billion in net flows for this second quarter and I also mentioned that we saw net flows in both the liquid and illiquid books. So as you imagine something in the neighborhood of equal weighing we had good flows in both. I would say that going into July, we\u2019re seeing a number of our private equity real assets and illiquids managers starting to close on a number of funds that have been in the market without going into any more detail there because I can\u2019t. Those some of those have made the news, some of them haven\u2019t but we\u2019re seeing that number being quite a bit more than what we saw net in the second quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Carrier","All right, thanks guys. Kind of two part question. First for Jay, just on the EBITDA, you mentioned down year-over-year, I think you mentioned the other income performance fees and investments, I guess just on the investments like how much is that you may be weighing on it and then like in terms of the maybe the investment time horizon or where you should think about like the return on those investments and then I guess just bigger picture like if I look at how you guys are positioned on the -- you mentioned the structural allocation that makes sense, investments you\u2019re making they make sense. On the other side it seems like performance as a whole maybe for the industry has been more muted and then you had the impairment with Ivory, so I just wanted to understand when you look across all the affiliates do you have any stats on like how many are outperforming the benchmarks even if it\u2019s a longer-term like three, five year or out of all the affiliates how many are having inflows versus outflows on maybe a trailing 12-months, just something to get a little bit of color because the flows are obviously good for the quarter but just to get a little bit more color on the sustainability there? Thanks.","Nate Dalton","I will start with the back half and then turn it to Jay. So I appreciate the comment and there is a couple of different themes that we have and as you are there are a couple of different themes we have to work together here. So one is kind of short term performance themes and this sounds down on a lot of levels on the short-term kind of performance themes, I think we have to look through those and so you heard of talk about some specific areas where they have been good and now we've to sort of look through those, I think there are questions, so I would start with where do we see and we will think about the ways that we can get better kind of meaningful data out. But where are the ways in which we can -- where are the place where we can see and again we're much better at this as we go here, where are the ways we can see, where are the places we can see significant opportunities in part for specific products but really for capabilities, right.","And so I think that and I don\u2019t think just specifically in us but you can use alternatives as an example and a place to start that. And so we think there is a long-term opportunity for the capabilities that our Affiliates have. Some products absolutely underperforming, some products absolutely outperforming in the main the alternative products you just start think about it across the whole, in the main alternative projects are performing better than peers. And that's probably the right way to think about it once you've gone from category to because there is demand check versus all the categories and then which are the better performing products and capabilities within that. So in the main, our Affiliates are performing better than peers and we will figure out ways to get that.","So then -- so demand characteristics, its capabilities and then within all specifically there\u2019s -- we\u2019ve talked about it on two dimensions which is liquid and illiquid, we sort of put them somewhat artificial stakes around those two definitions but within stakes around definition. If we do it that way the illiquid book and the illiquid opportunity set is behaving as good as the liquid is, the illiquid opportunity set is even better and there is just an incredible amount of demands for both the existing capabilities and also reasonably easy to see extensions of what our affiliates are doing and to the extent that these business are ultimately and you've heard us talk about this little in our prepared remarks, these businesses are behaving more like platforms as we look at the way they can expand their products consistently under their brand. I don\u2019t know Jay if you want to add to that or also take the second part?","Jay Horgen","Yes, yes. So let me take the second part, there is a lot, there is a lot I could say here. So I will try to just be brief. Just on the earnings, the EBITDA and kind of where we are, if you look at our business is seasonal, so I want to make sure that we note that, we have higher level performance fees in the first and the fourth quarters seasonally low in the second and the third and to some extent that's affecting our EBITDA in the second to third. So if you kind of look at it the first half, second half kind of business I think you will see numbers will be more I guess at least you'll take into account sort of the spreading of those performance fees.","The other point that I made in the prepared remarks is other income clearly was down you could see it was down $4.5 million on the line item the financial statement line item but actually we had last year a bit more realized gains than we do this year. So it\u2019s really more down like $6 million not $4.5 million. So that obviously impacted and those are gains from investments that we\u2019ve made typically SE or GP investments and that's part of our business. So we see that in our earnings and we expect them to go up over time. So that is something that we usually have a contribution from almost every quarter but just down this quarter.","There is a little bit of Ivory in there as I mentioned, there is a non-cash element to Ivory and then there is about a $1 million which we would take out if you reconcile that's about $10 million spread that we did not see recurring in this quarter year-over-year.","And then as I mentioned in my remarks the investments that we have and we will make in the business that\u2019s included in the guidance will be 11.3 basis points.","I would say you know and just to dimensionalize it a little bit, I think if you think about our history of expanding geographies in front of both the significant demand and participation by all of our affiliates you think about Japan as an example and then I\u2019ll make the comment that just like Australia, Middle-East et cetera before that we do have a bit of a start-up expense initially and in Japan it's contextualized, it is even a more robust statement because not only have we moved to open up the Japanese office and work in Japan. We helped some of our affiliates do the same. So if you think about the Pantheon we work side-by-side with Pantheon in a way to get that start-up cost through and so when you see that come through our numbers, sure we\u2019ve had a little bit of that it\u2019s in the forward projections and we do expect that return coming through as AUM as accumulated in those regions and that\u2019s been our history.","Nate Dalton","Let me maybe just add a text to our last point which is as Jay said, we -- we\u2019ve been looking at Japan for a while and we\u2019re now in a place where we have enough, we see enough demand that we and our Affiliates are going to -- are going after on the ground kind of way, there is a little bit of start-up costs as we said and that\u2019s to everywhere as we invest and then start to experience the growth curve. I'll say to be clear most of the time as we\u2019re entering the market we have much less traction than we already have in Japan and we really had quite a good sort of experience and some of which has already come through but not much obviously hasn\u2019t but we\u2019re really seeing good traction there.","And then the other just small point I'd add is obviously we have had to start the process to open a Dublin office and we had contingency in place but we're having to execute on them. So not a lot of money but obviously and the ultimate shape of it will depend on Brexit and obviously our conversation with regulators but we\u2019re having to stand that out.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Lee","Good morning, maybe I guess my first question well I will ask two parts, first one is just on M&A, I know you guys obviously anticipate discipline but you haven\u2019t seen the fair amount of activity in the market, some competitors acquiring stakes and some of these kind of called permitting capital vehicles whether it\u2019s Dell or Blackstone\u2019s platform, can you maybe talk a little bit about beyond the looking for a permanent partner but kind of perceive maybe your strategy or what you\u2019re looking to invest and compare to what you are kind of seeing happening in the marketplace as it relates to each minority stakes and all managers? And then I guess maybe this is a second part, in New York\u2019s business you talked about lot of commitments coming on board in July, I guess a lot of fund closing. I\u2019m assuming that when that's going to flow into AUM all of that if they haven\u2019t turned on fees. So is there any sense of getting a -- anyway getting a sense of what your kind of dry powder pipeline maybe like if commitments that your affiliates have received but we\u2019re not seeing yet in AUM or they haven\u2019t been turned on?","Nate Dalton","Great, so let me start on the first part and then I'll have Jay to do the second. So and I think you framed it you understand it exactly really well and framed it well. So just a sort of a level stepping back, we do have a differentiated model and approach and we've been kind of running and evolving this model for now nearly 25 years. Our approach is very attractive to our target universe which is perspective Affiliates that are looking for permanent institutional partner and I would underline the word permanent there and look at the highest level we\u2019re helping solve it demographically driven kind of management ownership and succession problem for these firms and we have a solution that preserves and protects their unique entrepreneurial cultures across successive generations of management and that's why that kind of permanent underline is important.","And then in terms of how we pursue it right we have this project calling for, we\u2019ve been out building relationships with that firm for many years and that activity continues okay and you heard us say those kind of firms that we\u2019re pursuing generally don\u2019t have to do anything and at least to the point of time, so what\u2019s driving the transaction of those firms is generally us building the relationships and the firms deciding that now, now is the right time to address that long-term demographic issue. So that's a universal firms where we have a unique solution I think we're uniquely attractive.","Now in terms of your comments about the current environment absolutely this has been an elevated period of M&A activity in the industry and you should assume alongside of our project calling effort we\u2019re looking at all the opportunities in the market. And then you should also assume and expect as you sort of ledger your question that when we're looking at investment we're very disciplined and that\u2019s across multiple dimensions that discipline around business quality, that discipline around long-term alignment structures that we talked about and of course that discipline around pricing.","And then I guess the last point I make is that when we talk about this discipline, we also always measuring the opportunities we have against reinvesting in our business through share repurchases and we have a very high quality towards business in place, so we're always looking at it against that backdrop as well. Put that altogether we have this outstanding secular opportunity to partner with the best boutique firm and while the timing of anyone has been driven by those dynamics I described, yes we continue to be really busy and make good progress across the range of new investment.","Jay Horgen","Yes and I was just going to add one thing and I\u2019ll talk about the liquid AUM in a moment but just the thing I would add is one of the major advantages that we have in the market is our reputation for being a supportive partner over 25 years and our permanence and the model AMG model that is what people know to be the succession planning model to ensure that permanence for both us and the Affiliate and really alignment is close in that, that is still highly valued in the market, it's not for everyone and when you look at some of these stake buyers whether it's pricing or other elements in some cases we have just decided that it's not a situation, we want to chase because pricing can be too high in those environment. So we have stressed it at eight to 10 times EBITDA discipline but where we really are attractive to partners is where they value the permit, they value their reputation in the model.","And then as it relates to the AUM policy you did say one thing, I wanted to clarify our policy is actually to take asses in under account for them when they come under supervisory really when we start to manage those assets. Generally speaking fees are tied very closely to that timing but I would say and I mentioned in my prepared remarks even this quarter we saw our aggregate fees to AUM tick down a little bit mainly because of this timing issue, we have taken in some AUM before the fees were turned on that's usually days or months or a quarter but it's not usually that long and I think you will see us book again in the third quarter some AUM right at the onset of fees, so we could have a little noise in the third quarter but in general we are taking that AUM as we start to manage it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Bedell","Just sort of come back to the EBITDA and the investments in the business critically obviously lot of good promising organic growth opportunities that we would definitely think you want to invest in but as you talked about the Japan office and that opportunity and then the Dublin office also, should we be thinking of these investments as sort of I know it\u2019s actually one-time but sort of brief and then you guys are coming back to the realization rate closer to that 12 basis points ex-performance fees worth or rather do you see enough organic growth opportunities that you want to really continue that into the future?","Nate Dalton","Let me start and then hand it to Jay. So the last part of the question sitting here today, we think there are a lot of opportunities for us to improve how we\u2019re bringing distinctive return streams to market. I think our method and approach will be pretty consistent, I think you've seen us be quite disciplined as we built distribution over the last 12 years and so I think you'll see us pursue in a deliberative fashion and I mean part of the question is what the pace and how do we do it in our way which is partnering with Affiliates and pursuing things that we think of the highest return opportunities at any point in time.","And so I think you'll see us purse it sort of the same disciplined way we always have. I think there are definitely included things that are short-term in nature right, so the startup costs for a geography with the startup costs for channels and geography, the Dublin office, I think is -- the question is highly dependent on how Brexit unfolds but we very much hope that it is a temporary thing.","So I think there's absolutely the category to go that way but the most important part of I think in my mind my most important part of it, the question is sort of where you ended which is sitting here today we do see opportunities each and probably we will continue to pursue them in that disciplined way.","And the other thing I'd say is -- it's working we are seeing returns on those investments not coming through in growth on the sales line.","Jay Horgen","And our sort of AUM realization rates obviously they have a lot to do with the level of performance fees in addition to asset base fees. So when you think about over the course of the year, if I go back to my first half, second half, nomenclature that if you\u2019re averaging the first quarter, the second quarter and the third quarter to the fourth quarter you\u2019ll see the realization being higher just by virtue of that normalizes our performance fee opportunity. So you really have to think about those, I think altogether.","The last thing I would say is on that ratio we have continued to see faster growth amongst our equity method Affiliates primarily because those are in the alternative space and that\u2019s where most of liquid managers are Pantheon is a consolidated Affiliate. So we\u2019re seeing more growth there which we obviously own a bit less and that will change that ratio just from a composition perspective over time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Shutler","So a couple on the pipeline, I think this first one kind of touching on the points you\u2019re just making Jay but looking at the pipeline and where you\u2019re going over the next couple of years, can you give us a sense of where you think that the revenue yield and the EBITDA yield on the inflows will be compared to the yield on the outflows at least in the near-term there and then on new Affiliate investments, I know you've made you've been talking about focusing more on larger more diverse prospects, you\u2019re still within that context in your conversations with prospects in the near-term part of the pipeline is, is distribution still as much of a selling point of the AMG model?","Nate Dalton","Okay. Let me start with that last question. So I think the way we talk about it is, we\u2019re looking for the highest quality boutiques right and I do think that the dimensions of highest quality boutiques more require either products that are more leveragable through distribution or otherwise or fair to themselves have investment processes and disciplines and orientation to continue to grow and expand their business. So I think it can be both, the firm doesn\u2019t have to necessarily be larger right away but it has to include those things which are process that can evolve and grow as well that orientation.","But absolutely we\u2019re looking at larger firms and more diverse firms as well. In terms of track the relative importance or attractiveness of AMG, physically it is one of the things which is as we are looking at firms that are themselves already complete firms and so therefore have distribution, proven distribution capabilities generally in at least one or two geographies and one or two channels, right. So those are the firms we are attracted to.","Our distribution, the distribution we\u2019ve been building over this dozen years that we talk about is designed to nit to the distribution capabilities of our affiliates which include some obviously very large successful diverse firms. So we are very used to working with and continuing and partnering with and enhancing and diversifying the asset bases of very successful large diverse growing firms.","So that\u2019s actually and that not so that easy but that is something that we really done, we put a lot of effort behind and are doing an increasingly good job at. So it\u2019s not so much that they specifically needed but I think we have built the unique distribution, flat set of platforms that can sort of nit to the distribution of boutiques and enhance them. And that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve been investing in over the past decade. So I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s I\u2019m not sure necessarily specifically important to each of them but I think as we go through these conversations with them, I think they will get it.","I want to pick up on a point that Jay made before which is a huge asset that we have is this track record of partnership with these firms and so all the things we described about the ability of the distribution platform to work with very successful large scale diverse and growing boutiques is highly referencable. So they can just call and speak with any number of our affiliates about how we work with them in ways that are highly customized to those businesses. So we do think that what we\u2019re building is additive and again we\u2019re building it not just any of the virtuous circle we've talked about much of it because it's helpful to these new boutiques and add to new investment process but it\u2019s also absolutely today additive to even largest most of our affiliates and we saw that again this quarter in coming fall.","Jay Horgen","Chris just on the yield point, so look it\u2019s a fee rate comment, it\u2019s also an ownership comment for us but just at the fee rate level you\u2019ve seen us and you\u2019ve heard us say that our fee rates have been holding relatively stable at the highest level we\u2019re at about 52 basis points with some performance fees, so we\u2019re in that 59, 58 kind of range without performance fees that level and you think about it, we -- you could say it\u2019s been holding relatively stable interesting thing is we probably seen everything underneath that right we have some places where we\u2019re seeing our mix shift to higher fees, we\u2019re seeing places where we see the mix shift to lower fees, we\u2019re seeing differences between Affiliates, we\u2019re seeing it all. I mean because when you have $824 billion in AUM and as many Affiliates we have we\u2019re seeing it all but we\u2019re seeing the composition remain relatively static at the highest level, why is that because we continue to grow an alternative just sort of plain and simple and then within alternative the illiquid tend to have higher fees. So when you think about and frankly longer duration. So I think that\u2019s a good phenomena or structural phenomena that\u2019s actually happening in our business today and that\u2019s keeping our yield on the assets higher and attractive mix shift if I had to say it that way.","On the ownership side we do have the comments I made earlier about EBITDA to AUM, we are seeing good growth in those alternative business but we\u2019re also seeing good growth in some of our global equity manager like Harding Loevner and Pantheon these are consolidated affiliates, so we have \u2013 we are keeping up if you will on an ownership basis but from quarter-to-quarter over time those changes can be modest but you have to stay focused on the EBITDA line that should be growing over time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Alex Blostein","I was hoping you guys could give us a couple of specific answers around the systematic performance, I guess one topic but a couple of questions there, I guess A would be helpful to get an update on how different strategies have done year-to-date kind of on an absolute basis, obviously we can all see the public fees, managed features long short et cetera but it would be helpful to get a sense of where the others are and I guess more importantly given sort of year-to-date challenges in that bucket, can you give us a sense of how critical it is going to be for flows over the next six months from an institutional perspective and ultimately kind of what the clients care about, is it absolute or relative performance in that category?","Nate Dalton","Let me start, there is a bunch of pieces in there. So I think the clients in that category are divided into couple of different groups. I think there is clearly clients who are -- who understand the product and are investing in it because of the characteristics, the diversifying characteristics of it. I'll make an observation here which is the large drawdowns in traditional portfolios tend to be more severe than the drawdowns, trend managers both now in specific environment and historically.","So I think there are absolutely I think the core of the investors especially the core of institutional investors understand the reason they\u2019re investing in new strategies and how these strategies should behave as diversifying their overall portfolios. So I think that\u2019s true.","And I think that while this is a challenging period for the category it\u2019s not sort of unheard of period. So I think that applies, those comments are really important for a significant portion, I\u2019d say the most significant portion of the asset base for us in the category. Now there is also absolutely people investing in the strategy in the way that was following performance being driven by performance and the performance of the category has not been good and that has been reflected in flows and you\u2019re seeing that in the weak outflows that you mentioned and I think you can look at that asset base as long as performance continues this way some portion of it will behave that way.","We at the highest level, we\u2019ve in the category I think we -- as part of our diverse business, I think it\u2019s an important part of the business and I think for us that\u2019s the most important point to make which is we have a large diverse business with significant participation in areas that we think have long-term secular demand trends behind them, any one piece of it will not -- of the product set within those segments will not be performing well at any one given point in time and that\u2019s okay. In fact that actually also provide some opportunity. So I think that\u2019s kind of how I would answer it at the highest level.","Jay Horgen","Yes and I wanted to pick up on what Nate mentioned in his prepared remarks as well. I mean with systematic diversified being 5% of our business today on an AUM basis, it really speaks to the diversity and sort of the power of the diversity of our business because as you saw in the public data, I\u2019m sure all of you saw in the public data that it look like we\u2019re going to have negative flows and actually had demonstrably positive flows this quarter and it just shows you that that we do have tremendous diversity in this business and even though systematic diversified is challenged at the moment as Nate said it\u2019s an opportunity for the future and again within a context of diversified business it\u2019s -- you\u2019re always going to have those pockets and we\u2019re completely confident that over time that segment will provide us some growth in the future period.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, it concludes our time for questions. I will turn the floor back to Mr. Dalton for any final comments.","Nate Dalton","Thank you. Thank you again for joining us this morning. We\u2019re pleased with our results for the quarter and we\u2019re confident in our ability to continue to create long-term shareholder value. We look forward to speaking with you again in October.

Welcome to the Affiliated Managers Group First Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Alexandra Lynn. Thank you, Ms. Lynn. You may now begin.","Alexandra Lynn","Thank you for joining AMG to discuss our results for the first quarter of 2014. In this conference call, certain matters discussed will constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to those referenced in the company's Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.","AMG will provide on its website a replay of the call and a copy of our announcement of our results for the quarter, as well as the reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.","With us on the line to discuss the company's results for the quarter are Sean Healey, Chairman and CEO; Nate Dalton, President and COO; and Jay Horgen, CFO. With that, I'll turn the call over to Sean Healey.","Sean M. Healey","Thanks, Ally. Good morning, everyone. With economic earnings per share of $2.48 for the first quarter, AMG is off to an excellent start in 2014 with strong execution across all elements of our growth strategy, including the announcement of 3 new Affiliate investments, the strong performance for our Affiliates return-oriented products and the continued outstanding growth from net client cash flows, bringing our total pro forma assets under management to just under $600 billion and substantially increasing the scale, diversity and earnings power of our business.","While Jay will talk about earnings guidance in a moment, to give you a sense of the magnitude of our earnings growth, our run rate EBITDA of roughly $1 billion is almost double what it was 2 years ago, and 4x the level of 5 years ago.","We generated $7 billion of net client cash flows during the quarter, which marked our 16th consecutive quarter of strong positive net flows. Even in a relatively volatile market environment, we continue to benefit from our strategic focus on value-added products, especially global and emerging market equities and alternatives. While uneven markets may have dampened retail investor risk appetite, we continued to see strong institutional client demand for return-oriented products, particularly alternatives and global equities. Our flows were, again, broadly distributed across all channels and coverage regions, reflecting the marketing efforts of our Affiliates, as well as a meaningful contribution from our global institutional and retail distribution platforms.","Given our Affiliates' exceptional long-term track records of investment performance, we see strong ongoing demand around the world for our differentiated return-oriented strategies as the trends of portfolio globalization and the barbell-ing of alpha and beta play out. Global institutional clients are increasingly recognizing boutique firms as having a competitive advantage in generating alpha, and at the same time, are attracted to the scale, resources and risk management of a global asset management franchise. AMG uniquely offers the breadth and diversity of an array of independent managers with distinct brands and specialized investment processes, combined with the efficiency of in-market client service and a single point of contact.","Finally, as Nate will discuss further, we see substantial additional opportunities to extend our distribution franchise in the U.S. retail market. In this quarter, we announced important strategic initiatives, including the rebranding to AMG Funds and the hiring of Jeff Cerutti to lead the effort.","Turning to new investments. This morning, we were pleased to announce our partnership with Veritas Asset Management, one of the industry's most highly regarded global and Asian equity managers. With over $17 billion in assets under management, Veritas has a tremendous track record of investment performance across its award-winning strategies, and I'm very pleased to welcome Charles Richardson and his partners to our Affiliate group.","Veritas is the fourth new Affiliate we've announced in the past 5 months. And we were delighted to welcome EIG Global Energy Partners, River Road Asset Management and SouthernSun Asset Management over the past several weeks.","Each of these investments grew out of an existing relationship we had developed over time with the firms' senior partners. And looking ahead, we see a very substantial set of new investment opportunities in outstanding traditional and alternative firms where we have already built strong relationships. Virtually all of these firms will inevitably face a need for succession planning solution, and when they decide the time is right to move forward, the strength of our existing relationship and the success of our 20-year track record as a strategic partner to some of the leading boutique firms in the world give us a unique competitive advantage.","Finally, it's important to note the degree to which the successful execution of our global distribution strategy not only enhances our extant Affiliates' organic growth but also makes us an even more attractive partner to prospective Affiliates. In fact, as we invest in additional new Affiliates, we create a virtuous circle in which we have incremental earnings accretion while also enhancing our position in the most attractive product areas to clients worldwide. Each additional Affiliate adds immediately salable products, which further diversify our business while also enriching the strategic dialogues we have with clients and intermediaries around the world.","Given the strength and scale of our existing business and our unmatched opportunities to partner with leading boutique firms, together with the distribution capabilities we offer to enhance their growth, we are confident in our ability to continue to create outstanding shareholder value going forward. With that, I'll turn it to Nate to discuss our Affiliate results in greater detail.","Nathaniel Dalton","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. As Sean said, our results from the first quarter demonstrated the strength and diversity of our business and the multiple ways AMG can drive significant growth. We generated $7 billion in positive net flows in what was our 16th consecutive quarter of strong flows, totaling over $110 billion in flows over that period. Although it was a relatively volatile quarter in the market, we continued to benefit from some of the favorable flow trends as clients separate their portfolios into passive beta exposures at one end and active alpha at the other. And for the alpha portions of their portfolios, clients worldwide are increasingly attracted to boutiques. In the quarter, for example, we saw sizable flows and wins from a broad range of alternative product areas, from liquid-managed futures and risk-balancing products to illiquid private equity, with multi-strat and credit products also being significant contributors. In addition, we continue to generate significant wins in active global and emerging markets equities and high-conviction U.S. equities.","As you know, AMG includes the broadest array of return-oriented boutiques in the world. And our Affiliates have outstanding long-term investment track records across a wide range of alpha-generating strategies. These are the product areas where we generated the bulk of the positive net flows over the last 16 quarters. And for much of that period, many of these areas were out of favor, for example, during the time when investors significantly increased allocations to fixed income. Now, as risk appetites increase and our Affiliate track records remain strong and we enhanced our distribution resources, we'll be even better positioned to drive significant positive flows going forward.","Turning to our Affiliates' investment performance for the quarter. Against the backdrop of relatively volatile markets, our Affiliates generated good investment results. Starting with the global developed markets category, highlights for the quarter included notably strong performance from AQR across the suite of global, international and global defense of equity products; and from Tweedy, Browne, where all of their global equity products including global, international and worldwide high-dividend outperformed for the quarter.","In the emerging markets category, we continue to have generally strong performance, as all of the major EM products managed by Genesis and Harding Loevner beat their benchmarks in the quarter and remain well ahead for the 1-, 3- and 5-year periods.","In our U.S. equity category, we had a solid quarter in the performance side, where Affiliates including AQR, First Quadrant, Frontier, Renaissance and Tweedy, Browne delivered outstanding performance across their respective equity products. While near-term performance at Yacktman was challenged, largely due to their defensive positioning, the funds maintain top decile rankings for the 5-year period and first percentile rankings for the 10- and 15-year periods.","Finally, turning to our alternatives products category. Looking across our Affiliate Group, as you know, they manage a very broad array of liquid and illiquid strategies. Broadly speaking, our Affiliates started the year with good performance. This includes best in class credit, control equity, currency, multi-strat and private equity products. As you saw, we also added a new Affiliate, one of the world's leading energy investment firms, EIG Global Energy Partners, this past quarter. While it's early in the year, the good performance in the first quarter results in some performance fees being recognized.","Now, turning to flows for the quarter. As I said, we had another strong quarter with $7 billion in positive net client cash flows. As we emphasize on every call, flows, especially in the institutional and sub-advisory channels, are inherently lumpy. However, overall flow momentum continues to be good.","Turning to the channel review and starting with the Institutional channel. We had positive net flows of approximately $4.6 billion. These flows came primarily in alternative strategies and emerging markets products and were broadly spread across Affiliates. Notable contributions came from AQR, BlueMountain, First Quadrant, Harding Loevner, Pantheon, Systematic and ValueAct.","Similar to previous quarters, we had a number of great wins coming from leading institutions located around the world.","Moving to the Mutual Fund channel. We have positive net flows of $2 billion. From a product category standpoint, we had strong flows into global equities and alternative strategies. While our AMG funds platform had negative flows due to the significant allocation to U.S. equity, the positive flows in the channel came from a number of Affiliates including AQR, Artemis, Harding Loevner and Tweedy, Browne.","In our High Net Worth channel, flows were over $350 million for the quarter with contributions coming primarily from GW&K, Harding Loevner and ValueAct, with a significant contribution from our AMG retail platform.","Now, stepping back from the quarter-to-quarter flows, I want to orient everyone to the global distribution strategy we've employed over the last 7 or 8 years. Starting with our Affiliates high quality product and outstanding long-term track records into return-oriented areas we focus on, and our Affiliates outstanding dedicated sales, marketing and client service teams, we have added a global distribution platform covering many of the most attractive institutional markets around the world with very strong local teams with deep market knowledge. The results from combining our global teams with our Affiliates' own dedicated resources are clear. If you look at those 16 quarters and over $110 billion of net flows, roughly $65 billion were in the Institutional channel, 75% of which came from outside the U.S. This leads to another important point. It's not just the absolute net flows that matter, but also we've added significantly to the global diversification of our asset base. For example, we're now one of the largest non-Aussie asset managers in Australia. And we are shortly going to begin launching local Australia investment trust to extend our presence in the platform markets there. We have already built a significant business in the Middle East, and just added another channel specialist to the team to further extend our footprint. In Europe, we recently added dedicated coverage to the Netherlands and also a new head of Europe to work with the expanded team there. And they are now covering all the critical institutional markets in Europe.","We feel like we've accomplished a great deal, but there may be much bigger opportunity ahead. We and our Affiliates have now built client relationships with many of the largest and most sophisticated institutions worldwide, as well as the largest global and regional consultants and many of the other intermediaries, and we can now leverage these relationships across Affiliates, product areas and regions. In addition, there's still a number of white spaces, regions we have not launched in yet, as well as channels within coverage regions where we have significant untapped opportunities.","Now picking up on the theme Sean mentioned. Obviously, this distribution platform makes us an even more attractive partner to potential Affiliates. But also as we bring on new Affiliates, their products can be immediately available to our distribution teams around the globe, which in turn, makes us an even more attractive partner to clients and intermediaries worldwide.","Now as I described, there's a tremendous opportunity to continue to drive positive net client cash flows through our global institutional platforms. But in addition, we believe that over time, we also have an opportunity to build a leading retail distribution business, especially in U.S. retail. In part, this is because we believe demand trends are shifting in our favor as, over time, clients and intermediaries must allocate to return-oriented products to meet their objectives, but also fundamentally, we think there is a unique opportunity to be the point of contact through which platforms and intermediaries and other channel partners can access the world's broadest array of return-oriented boutiques. There are really only a very few asset managers in the world that have the same breadth of performance-oriented products as our Affiliates manage. Now as Sean described, we've recently took several critical steps towards this goal, with Jeff Cerutti joining as CEO of our U.S. retail business, which we rebranded AMG Funds effective yesterday. And we all look forward to working with Jeff as he helps us capitalize on these opportunities. Looking ahead, as our Affiliates maintain their excellent long-term performance records, and as global demand for alpha-generating products managed by some of the best investors at their respective disciplines continues to build, we are confident that we can continue to generate strong growth. With that, I'll turn to Jay.","Jay C. Horgen","Thank you, Nate. As Sean noted, with nearly $600 billion in return-oriented assets, including the significant organic growth from net flows in the quarter, and the continued successful execution of our new investment strategy, we have meaningfully increased the earnings power of our business and are well-positioned for future growth. As you saw in the release, we reported economic earnings per share of $2.48 for the quarter with net performance fees contributing $0.07. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings of $1.40 for the quarter.","Turning to more specific modeling items. With the integration and rebranding of our retail business this quarter, we are providing enhanced disclosure around AMG's portion of EBITDA as well as guidance on an EBITDA to end-of-period assets-under-management basis. This ratio provides a clear metric for indicating the earnings power of AMG as a whole, and as with any profitability ratio, we will make note of material items such as new investments, performance fees or intra-quarter periods of volatility.","For the first quarter, the ratio of EBITDA to end of period assets under management was approximately 13.8 basis points, which includes the closing of SouthernSun at the end of the quarter. For the second quarter, we expect this ratio to be approximately 13.6 basis points, which includes the closing of EIG in April and the expected closing of River Road at the end of the second quarter.","As regard to our taxes, our effective GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 37.1% and our cash tax rate was 24 points -- 24.7%. For modeling purposes, we expect our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 35% and our cash tax rate to be approximately 25%.","Intangible-related deferred taxes for the first quarter were $16.9 million, and we expect this number to increase to approximately $19 million for the second quarter, given our recent new investments. Our share of amortization for the quarter was $27.3 million, including $5.4 million amortization from Affiliates accounted for under the equity method, which was lower than previous quarters as we experienced the scheduled roll-off of amortization at certain equity-method Affiliates. We expect AMG's amortization to be approximately $29 million for the second quarter, given our recent new investments.","Our interest expense for the quarter was $40.1 million, including $22.5 million of pretax, noncash computed interest expense, of which $18.8 million was a onetime noncash item resulting from the retirement of our 2006 convertible trust preferred securities. For the second quarter, we expect our total interest expense to be $22 million, including $2.6 million of pretax noncash computed interest expense.","Turning to our balance sheet. We further increased our balance sheet flexibility and capacity by raising a $400 million 10-year senior bond and a $250 million 5-year term loan, both at very attractive rates. And by retiring our 2006 convertible trust preferred securities for shares during the quarter.","Looking ahead, we continue to focus on positioning our balance sheet to take advantage of our new investment opportunity set and given the growing scale of our business, our approximately $750 million of run rate after tax cash flow and approximately $1.2 billion of undrawn revolver capacity will continue to meaningfully contribute to our earnings growth.","Now turning to guidance. We are raising our 2014 guidance, as we expect economic earnings per share to be in the range of $11.10 to $12.20, which of course, only includes the partial-year impact of new investments. We also assume our normal convention of actual market performance through yesterday for the current quarter and 2% quarterly market growth beginning in the third quarter of 2014. We also assume a weighted average share count of approximately 56.5 million for the year. The lower end of our guidance range includes a modest incremental contribution from performance fees and organic growth, while the upper end of the range assumes a more robust contribution from both performance fees and net client cash flows. As always, these assumptions are based on our current expectations of Affiliate growth rates performance and the mix of Affiliate contributions to our earnings. Of course, substantial changes in markets and the earnings contribution of our Affiliates would impact these expectations. Now we'll be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Craig Siegenthaler of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","First question. Just given the high level of M&A activity since December, should we expect kind of a cooldown period as you guys kind of regroup and go back and meet with new potential Affiliates? Or do you think there's more potential for other acquisitions and investments in 2014?","Sean M. Healey","Without giving specific guidance around quarter-to-quarter new investment activity, I would say, broadly, we continue to see a very substantial set of new investment opportunities, traditional and alternative, and I would say in the near and long-term. And maybe this is a little broader than your question, Craig, but I think it's important to illustrate the way in which we build our new investment strategy and execute. If you look at the most -- the 3 most recently announced investments, they illustrate nicely the quality and diversity of our opportunity set, as well as our competitive advantage relative to other firms. First thing about EIG, an outstanding energy-focused PE firm, it's a tremendous firm in one of the most sought after areas of the alternative space, $16 billion in assets under management. River Road, an excellent diverse -- differentiated U.S. equity manager, highly-regarded entrepreneurial management team, it was an divestiture from Aviva, $11 billion in assets under management. Veritas, the firm we announced our investment in this morning, a leading global and Asian equity -- one of the leading global and Asian equity managers in the world, I would say, U.K.-based, $17 billion in assets under management. In each case, we had built a strong relationship with the senior partners of the firm years earlier. And if you'd asked me a year ago whether I thought we would have an opportunity to invest in these firms, I think, we were confident at that point that we would at some point. Each of them over the period of time that we got to know each other, each of us spent time knowing each other as -- getting to know each other as people, getting to know our businesses. Obviously, these firms would've all checked out AMG with our Affiliates and gotten the recommendation and insights from their experience, in some cases over decades. And in each case, these are different firms, different geographies, different products, et cetera. But in each case, the firm's partners chose AMG. They chose AMG because they wanted to bet on themselves, they wanted continued strong significant equity participation in their firm, and they chose AMG because of the distribution capability, which as Nate and I noted, is increasingly important in the decisions that prospective Affiliates make. And finally, they chose AMG because of our track record and reputation. And so as we look forward, there are a very substantial set of outstanding boutique asset management firms, traditional and alternative on a global basis, where we've already built strong relationships. And looking ahead, for any individual firm, it may be difficult to precisely estimate when they'll choose to take the step to move forward, but on a broad basis, we're very confident that there is this very substantial set where they will inevitably need to pursue a transaction. And we are very, very well-positioned with what I described as really a unique competitive advantage. And so taking all of that, taking a market environment which is relatively volatile, but it's sufficiently stable that it's a very attractive backdrop. So we see, on an ongoing basis, the execution of this tremendous opportunity set that we've built over time.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And just as my follow-up here. I'm wondering beside the Australian product additions that Nate mentioned in the prepared remarks, if there are other funds at your existing or even some of the newer Affiliates that you want to relaunch and rebrand through the AMG Funds retail platform. And I'm also wondering if there's any initial plans from Andrew Dyson or Jeff Cerutti on how they look to upgrade the platform?","Nathaniel Dalton","Okay. So yes, and to be clear, the Australia reference, that is something that we're looking at doing but it's -- that's one just very specific example I happen to have pulled out. The way I would talk about the retail, take the bulk of your question, the way I would talk about what we're doing with the retail business. So first, and we said some of this in our prepared remarks, over the medium term, we think we can build a really leading retail franchise. Some of that is what you described, which is bringing Affiliates with institutional products into these channels, all right. And some of it is as simple as that. Some of it is -- alternatives, as an example, is a product area where we're working on some very interesting product innovations with firms like Pantheon. And as those go forward, there's no reason that same technology can't be used as we use it in PE, to be used in liquid credit or to be used with EIG, for example. So, there is definitely a component part of it which is what you described, bringing Affiliates from channel to channel. But so most fundamentally, if you sort of step back, and look we took 2 -- couple of key steps that you mentioned, hiring Jeff and then also the rebrand as AMG. But if you sort of step back, fundamentally, there's -- let me give you 2 perspectives, right. So as Sean said, when we talk to an Affiliate or a prospective Affiliate, what we can now say to them, and we are still building it, but we can now say to them is, in institutional and retail, we can help you access the most appropriate clients for your product set in a way that's entirely complementary to the distribution you already have, whether that's institutions from one region into another region, whether that's cross channel, as you mentioned, right. So that's one perspective to Affiliates or prospective Affiliates. And at the same time, from a marketplace standpoint, right, we're able to look to institutions, consultants, other intermediaries including platforms in the retail space, and say, we can be a single point through which you can access the broadest array of performance-oriented products, right, and the only place that you can really get this performance -- these performance-oriented products managed by boutiques, right, at this scale. And this brings me back to the AMG Funds and I know what Andrew and Jeff will be working on, which is we can interact with you worldwide under 1 brand and across the -- and this is important, across the range of packaging that you may want. So we're able to have those complete conversations in ways that allow market participants to use us to address all -- address many of the potential sort of issues or challenges they're facing, which is a very powerful way to interact with them.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon of Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I guess, Jay, to start just with the guidance, there's a lot of moving parts since you last gave it. Could you kind of break down the components, kind of what's from the deals and kind of the mark-to-market, and then if there was any change in your assumptions around performance fee opportunity?","Jay C. Horgen","Okay. Yes sure, Dan. You're right. There's a number of items. I think there'll be 4 that I will tick off here. The first is new investments. So we've closed now on 2 of these 4 new investments at the beginning of -- end of the first, beginning of the second, that was SouthernSun and EIG. We expect to close 2 more: River Road at the end of the second and Veritas at the end of the third, respectively. So importantly, our guidance for 2014 reflects only the partial-year impact of these new investments. The second thing to highlight is we position our balance sheet, as I described in my prepared remarks, for both capacity and continued flexibility. We raised $650 million between the 10-year and the 5-year. We settled our TruPS with shares, and so the net impact of all of those actions, which is front-loading quite a number -- quite a bit of our financing, was $1 million of additional shares. So that's why our share count is at 56.5 million, and that's the real impact of the capital planning. I think the benefit that we have is we have a $1.2 billion undrawn revolver and the recurring cash flows from our business now to move forward with our pipeline. And then third, just reminding everyone of our modeling convention and the mark-to-market. We assume that markets in the current quarter, this second quarter, up to the date of this call, captures 100% of the performance in the quarter for modeling convention. Since the last time we gave guidance, which was February 4, then we experienced 4.5% appreciation since that call, which we would have assumed 2% to have been in model conventions, so 2.5% higher than our standard 2% convention and we've reflected that in our guidance. So taking that together, and I'll comment on performance fees in a second. We've raised our midpoint by $0.55 to $11.65. That of course, assumes that partial-year impact of new investments, so there's more run rate effect in 2015 but we don't guide yet to that. On performance fees for this year, we continue to assume a typical year in performance fees. That's -- the typical year for us is 5% to 10% of our total economic net income. Of course, we've already booked $0.07 in the quarter, so it can't be less than that, and, of course, like 2013, it can be more than 10%.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just to clarify in terms of the balance sheet and the revolver that's available. So if you -- we shouldn't assume any kind of funding based on the announcement today, any need to fund or lack of additional leverage for other than tapping into the credit line?","Jay C. Horgen","Correct. So the credit line is, as we stand today, almost completely undrawn, so we have $1.2 billion of capacity. No new leverage is needed. And I will just note that we've actually delevered through this period because of the substantial cash flow and the scale of our business.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Great. And then just a follow-up with Nate. In terms of this quarter's flows, and just kind of comparing to last quarter, it looks like from the buckets, they all kind of broadly improved. But I guess, would you point to any region or specific Affiliate or strategy that might have improved or seen, even on a go forward basis, acceleration in either demand trends or the opposite in terms of rate of change to the negative?","Nathaniel Dalton","Yes, so I don't have much to add to what we talked about, but look, at a high-level, right, the demand trends remain in place, right, so we're seeing very good activity. Our fee is final one but not funded, that -- those kind of demand trends, that's mostly an institutional comment there, but those kind of demand trends remain good, right, and in place. If I was going to call out maybe where would I say the biggest -- where have I seen sort of particular strength and the biggest changes, something like that, I think the alternatives area has been very strong for us across channels, both institutional and retail. Some of that is, I think, sort of broader market comments, and some of that I think is the mix of Affiliates and Affiliate products. But that was definitely something that we saw in the quarter. And then as I step back, as I said, this is much more a sort of a medium-term comment, but as I sort of step back at a very high level, more and more product coming online, some of that is the comment we made about additional Affiliates, obviously. But also some of it's product development and more and more distribution resources coming online. And as we've talked about on prior calls, as distribution resources come online -- and we've added a number over the last sort of 4 quarters. As distribution resources come online, there is a period where they sort of ramp-up and all that and there is a period where it really starts to kick in and, I think, we've probably mentioned maybe on the last call that last year was really kind of a breakthrough year for us in Asia, and that was -- that's now become a kind of a steady contributor. And so at a high level, more and more product and more and more distribution resources, both of those should continue to impact.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Bill Katz of Citigroup.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just in terms of 2 things, unrelated. Sean, I'll start with you. I sort of heard you loud and clear on the opportunity both in the near-term and long-term. Has the market -- in terms of deals. Has the market chop over last few weeks substantially change any of the momentum that you are seeing? Obviously, you have a deal today, but just more broadly in your conversation with investors?","Sean M. Healey","No, I wouldn't -- I wouldn't say it has. And I think as I mentioned, if you look at the market performance through the first part of the year, the relative volatility that we've seen is, in some respects, is normal for this kind of a market stage. And I think it's salutary for new investment activity because people are reminded that -- well, I'll say it differently. Periods of extreme volatility, either up as in last year or down as in '11 and '12 and certain parts of the year, are difficult. They're difficult for people to stop and make a permanent decision, understandably. As we look forward, if we continue to be in a period of relative stability with volatility that may be periodically accelerated but, on an overall basis, is within tolerable limits, I would say that's a very positive backdrop for new investment activity. And remember that in many cases, the investments that we're making, the firms that we're in conversations with actually have products which are less or even uncorrelated to broader equity markets.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And then, one follow-up for Nate, and this one might be a harder one to answer, specifically, but you seem to have very good diversified growth. Just sort of wondering how much of the momentum is just coming from your own efficacy of the business model versus picking up market share from others. So when you're getting these wins, what are you hearing from either consultants or the gatekeepers about why the AMG model is being selected?","Nathaniel Dalton","Okay. Well, I think the second half of the question is actually easier than the first. I did not [ph] predict, in terms of any particular set of win, how much of it is somebody is making a change versus the -- sort of the model change versus a replacement search or what have you. Sometimes you know, but that's anecdotal and hard to generalize. The second part of the question, which is -- which I'm going to focus on, is on the feedback that we're getting from other intermediaries on the AMG business model. And I tried to speak to this a little bit in the prepared remarks, which is we are now in a place where, in many markets and many channels, there's now a very good understanding of the advantages of the AMG business model, and I'll use one word for it which is alignment, right, which is as you talk to the intermediaries, consultants and platforms and others, they understand that AMG is very well aligned with the Affiliates and the Affiliate management teams are very well aligned with the clients and that, that carries through. And they also understand that we're aligned with them as channel partners and that -- and so there's a unique relationship that can be built over time in these markets and channels and with these other channel participants, consultants and platforms and others. And that is what we are starting to see. The feedback we're getting is very positive. They like our model because they now -- I mean, some of it, obviously, is track record, right. They can look at the track -- the 20-year track record, but I think, they really do understand and appreciate it. And they want -- and this another important point, many of these channel participants want to deal with boutiques, right, and they're -- I don't mean to be -- sort of minimize it, they're busy and it's hard to do a really good job getting to know lots of boutiques around the world that don't have the resources maybe to access all these markets and access a regional consultant somewhere or what have you. And so through AMG, they're able to get what they want, which is access to boutiques who are good alpha return-generating managers. They believe that, they want that, that is definitely a trend we're seeing. And through us, we're trying to make it easy for them to access those managers on one level, and we're also trying to make sure they really do understand the benefits of our structure and the long-term stability that it provides to the underlying boutiques, and I think, increasingly, they do understand that. And that I do think is a potentially very powerful force.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then just a follow-up on the first part of my question. When you are winning these mandates, is it just -- money is coming from different pools of assets or is it coming from competition? What's your sense there?","Nathaniel Dalton","I think -- again, I said I think it's both. There are certainly anecdotes which are we're taking -- they are growing pools and we're taking allocations in growing pools and we're taking allocations where people and making model changes, absolutely. And then there's certainly places where we know we're taking allocations from competitors. But, again, I think the data, the information is anecdotal. It's very hard to generalize and say, what percent overall is one or the other.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Robert Lee of Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Sean, I have a question, I guess, mainly for you maybe. As you go out and you look at your pipeline of transactions or talk to prospective investments, I mean, to what extent mainly in the alternative world are you're seeing, I guess, I'd call it increased competition? You've had some firms out there raise permanent capital vehicles, invest in alternative managers with the promises of giving them some funding, asking their management as well as distribution, and is that at all changing the type of conversation or just who you're speaking with, particularly in the alternative space?","Sean M. Healey","Well, we've been doing this for more than 2 decades, so we're used to competition. I would say broadly, across our business, we're in a stronger competitive position now than we've ever been. I think, when you talk about the alternative space specifically, it's important to understand there are an increasing number of opportunities. As really outstanding alternative firms have institutionalized their businesses, the founding partners are older than they were and increasingly thinking about the advantages and appropriateness of bringing in a strategic partner. The offering that we provide is really unique. And I'm not saying across our business that there aren't firms that will choose, for one reason or another, to pursue a different path. And you should understand that there are many opportunities where we get to know a firm and we decide that it really isn't an appropriate thing for us to want to be their partner. But among the relatively large number of very attractive firms where we built relationships and we believe that at some point, they will pursue a transaction and where they describe the elements of what they're looking for in a partner and they include probably first, more than anything, a track record and a reputation, a firm that knows what they're doing and a firm that has a series of investments which have been very successful over time, where the senior partners of those firms are known to the prospective Affiliate partners. And if you think about AMG's investments in the alternative space, AQR, ValueAct, BlueMountain, now EIG, extraordinarily successful firms, and you could understand that any prospective Affiliates in the alternative space would reach out and talk to those firms' partners. The other elements of our approach include, of course, the strategic capabilities that we offer across our business in a way that is on offer, never required of Affiliates. And especially in the distribution area, where as Nate has described, we're able to provide a platform which complements what our Affiliate partners do and what their distribution teams do. And we are -- there's no one in the industry that has anything like the track record of success that we have in working with our Affiliate partners and selling to the largest and most sophisticated clients around the world differentiated alternative products run by, managed by different independent boutique firms. And that's just a -- that's a different thing to do than to sell your -- an individual integrated firms-branded products. Obviously, different firms will describe different advantages but broadly speaking, entities that are private-equity sponsored vehicles, and they are a number out there, and there have been a number in the past and there will be a number in the future, those kinds of entities have very different kinds of capabilities and they have -- they inherently cannot offer the same kind of track record and certainty of an AMG partnership. And so I sometimes smile, well I always smile when I sometimes hear that 1 firm or another has been started and that their business opportunity is to become the AMG of alternatives. I can tell you who the AMG of alternatives is. And you can ask EIG, you can ask AQR, you can ask ValueAct, BlueMountain, and I can assure you a number of other investments that we'll make in the future, and they'll tell you that AMG is the AMG of alternatives.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Fair enough. And maybe a question for Nate. At the distribution front, on the global distribution platform, I mean, clearly as you said, you continued to make investments there and kind of deepen your penetration in different markets. But maybe just to play devil's advocate a little bit, to what extent does your success create, maybe it's a high class problem, of almost having too much product? How do you kind of manage the access to it? Because you also do have some Affiliates that in some ways may compete against each other in terms of the types of strategies they run. So how do you like manage access and kind of keep kind of the -- even as you expand the pipe, kind of keep it clear and flowing and manage that product?","Nathaniel Dalton","So I certainly track the theoretical -- or the points you made, right. And maybe the way I'll set up the answer is compare what we're doing to a very large integrated firm that has -- that's distributing products around the world. And the point I'll make, and again, because I think your starting point for conversation...","Sean M. Healey","Under 1 brand.","Nathaniel Dalton","Under 1 brand. The starting point for the conversation is important because they're marketing -- they have the same -- a version of the same but much worse problem, which is they are top-down managed as one firm trying to figure out what to do. And so they -- and they've build distribution and everything else around that model. Our distribution is designed to be complementary, and it's designed to introduce, as I said in the prepared remarks, to introduce Affiliate product to appropriate buyers and intermediaries. And what we're trying to do is educate the intermediaries and the most sophisticated buyers around the world on the capabilities of the product that our Affiliates manage. It's a fundamentally different job than trying to sell a product. We're trying to make sure we really do an excellent job of educating the, again, as I said, the clients and the consultants. And that's why I said in answer to the earlier question, this alignment point is a really important point because the relationship that we can have with the marketplace is a different kind of relationship than many other firms, I would say most other firms, can try to have. We have breadth. We do have multiple high-quality products doing things in the same style box. And they do them very differently, right, and part of our job is to make sure that people understand the differences. But our job is to do an excellent job making sure that the intermediaries and the end very sophisticated clients understand the products managed by our Affiliates. We are aligned with each of our Affiliates, right. We have a very strong alignment with each of those multiple Affiliates. And we also have an alignment with our channel partners, right. These are all also very important relationships to us. But again, I think we're playing -- we're playing a fundamentally different role than just trying to sell products and trying to pick a product that we can push and raise the most assets, where it really is about making the appropriate -- getting the appropriate clients, making sure we do a really good job in education, that's what we're trying to do.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Michael Kim with Sandler O'Neill.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","First, maybe just a follow-up on that last question. I'll take the flip side. Are you maybe starting to see cross-selling activity pick up where an investor may have had money with 1 of your Affiliates and goes on to establish a relationship with a different Affiliate just because of the connections across the platform, if you will? And any way to potentially quantify that in terms of maybe tracking sort of the number of strategies per client, for example?","Nathaniel Dalton","Yes, so to answer your question -- and thank you very much for the question. The answer to the question is an unqualified yes, right. So we are -- and this is the point we were trying to make, which is we are absolutely getting a leverage within clients across Affiliates, certainly within intermediaries, global consultants, regional consultants across affiliates, and it's coming for multiple reasons. One is there -- we are absolutely educating people, clients and intermediaries, on the AMG model and the benefits of AMG model. Another is they are realizing that they can get access to a bunch of very high-quality boutiques in a scale way and they're doing -- the AMG is -- can be that single point of access. Another is -- as I said, we're hiring very good, very experienced local teams that know the clients and the markets well, and some of it is just they're doing a good job covering those clients. But there is absolutely cross-Affiliate leverage within a single client or intermediary. Some of it extends across regions because the intermediate -- intermediaries extend across regions. Some of it -- and I tried to mention this relative to the AMG Funds question. Some of it also extends across packages, right. So as we build out AMG Funds, if we're interacting with a client on a DB plan over here, we can interact them with on a DC plan over here, if we have the packaging right. And so there are many, many points of leverage within this model, some of which we have begun to exploit, some of which we have not yet really begun to exploit and so -- but absolutely, the opportunity there is very real and we are doing it.","Sean M. Healey","Just to clarify and expand slightly Nate's comments, when you talk about cross-selling, I think sometimes people can imagine that it's 1 Affiliate calling up another Affiliate and introducing an opportunity. Of course, that occasionally happens but really what we're describing is what is occurring through the development of strategic relationships with the largest most sophisticated clients and their intermediaries through AMG's global distribution platform. With AMG personnel, supported by senior management, telling the AMG story and building the relationship with these important clients. I'm just back from a week in the Middle East and I can tell you from there and broadly, as Nate described, the largest, most sophisticated clients in the world are increasingly focused for the return part of their product allocation on the attractiveness of -- and appeal of boutique firms, independent boutique firms, across a broad array of strategies. And there is a -- just for efficiency purposes, there's an increasing appreciation for the ability to have strategic relationships where you have a single point of contact and you're able to get not only certainty around business stability and risk management, relationship, but also the single point access to all of these firms and their various products. And I think that is a trend that is increasing and it absolutely favors us.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just a follow-up on the flows in the Institutional channel. I know the sales and redemptions can be lumpy, particularly when you're looking quarter-over-quarter. But any -- just any incremental color on maybe some of the underlying puts and takes during the quarter, especially as it relates to rebalancing and\/or just broader asset allocation trends that you may be seeing?","Nathaniel Dalton","Yes. Again, I think the only one that I would really call out in the Institutional channel, there were good wins in emerging and global and U.S. equity and other places. But the only real trend I would call out was some very good alternative wins that came through. As I said again, I think some of that is probably on the allocation side, top-down, and some of it is very specific and some of these are conversations that have been going on for a long time. But there are some good institutional wins in the alternative space. Across a number of Affiliates. I mean, it was liquid and illiquid both and -- but a number of good wins.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Marc Irizarry with Goldman Sachs.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. Sean, can you give some perspective on the retail initiative in AMG Funds? How do you expect the response going forward from Affiliates who are currently on board? I mean, should we be thinking about more Affiliates signing up to sort of be on the platform, if you will? And how does that compare maybe to the experience that you're seeing with the buildout of global distribution?","Sean M. Healey","Well I think we have, as Nate and I both indicated, a tremendous opportunity to build a leading retail franchise. And we've done it. And in some respects, it may have been, in hindsight, more difficult if you looked back 7 years ago and said, would AMG have been able to build the global institutional platform and have the success that we've had in an absolute sense and certainly, relative to really any other firm in the world? I think that might have seemed the taller order. Now, it's not going to be easy and we don't think that it will happen overnight, but we have an outstanding team led by, of course, the addition of Jeff Cerutti. I think it is going to be quite meaningful over time, rebranding the business AMG Funds and giving the scale -- leveraging the scale and reputation and relationships of AMG. And over time, the opportunity set, of course, includes other existing Affiliates coming onto that platform, but that's not going to be required. And remember, we have a very large -- we have over $100 billion in mutual fund assets away from the AMG Funds platform. And very successfully managed and distributed. So no requirement to add existing Affiliates, but I'm sure over time that will occur. And then we see an increasing opportunity to bring in prospective Affiliates and gain leverage that way. And over time, all of the elements that we've described about the strategic relationships that we're building and have built with the most sophisticated global institutional clients, we're doing the same thing in the U.S. retail space and with the most important distributors. Would you add anything to that, Nate?","Nathaniel Dalton","The only thing I'd to add is I do think there are Affiliates -- so when we talk about the rebranding with Affiliates, there are certainly Affiliates who are working with us in global institutional markets, who will be more likely to work with us here. Because then again, is it just the rebrand? I don't know. It's certainly our commitment, that we've evidenced in a lot of ways, to building a leading retail franchise that's helping them with their decision. But there's also cross leverage between work we're doing with some intermediaries on the institutional side and what we're doing in the retail side. And I think being able to do it under a unified brand is certainly something that make sense to all of the Affiliates that are working with us in -- or to some of the Affiliates that are working with us in institutional markets who might be deciding to work with us in the retail markets. So I do think it's helpful. It's not just the brand, it's everything. It's a commitment to building a truly leading franchise there. But I do think on the margin, branding is a symbol of it certainly, and I do think it's helpful in the conversations.","Operator","Next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler with William Blair.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","On the Veritas deal, so it looks like they've added a pretty significant amount of AUM over the last 18 or 24 months. Can you just -- to the extent possible, can you talk about the flow potential from that business both over the near- and long-term?","Sean M. Healey","Sure. They have products that are highly scalable in the global area and an Asian product -- or a set of Asian equity products that have tremendous opportunity, including an alternative product. So as with all outstanding firms, they're focused above all else on continuing to maintain an outstanding performance record for their clients. So they are sensitive to making sure that the growth is measured, but the Veritas partners are -- it's a young group. They're focused on building -- continuing to build an outstanding franchise and to serving their clients. So we certainly expect strong growth over time.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, great. And then Nate, you talked about there still being number of white spaces which you see. I know that's a pretty broad comment, but I'm guessing it relates to both geographies and different product areas. But can you may be drill down into that a little bit more and maybe what are the top 1 or 2 incremental opportunities you see from here?","Nathaniel Dalton","So I'd say, the 2 areas where I'm talking about white spaces are primarily geographies and also channels within geographies rather than product areas. It's really geographies and then channels within geographies. And so if you sort of look backwards, we're focused on sort of building out teams in some of the geographies we already had covered, and we started to move into some white spaces, I referenced Australia, referenced Middle East. We're starting to move into channels where we weren't. So some of the white space is just moving within channels in places where we already have very strong sort of what I'll call high-end institutional and high-end intermediary coverage. And in some ways it's easier because there's a lot of cross leverage with some of those intermediaries, and also reputationally with the fact that -- with some of the client relationships that we've already built. And so there's already familiarity with AMG, there's already familiarity with a number of Affiliates, right. So some of the white space is just moving within channels. And then there are sizable geographies. I'll just do sort of one example, which is Japan, which -- yes, there's just sizable geographies where we haven't yet decided exactly how we will try to help our Affiliates access appropriate clients. These are places -- I just gave one example, but there are several of them. These are places where there are significant assets, we think there are significant opportunities and it's sorting out on our list of priorities and also how,, the right way to do it and finding the right people and the rest of it. So it's both geographies and then also channels within geographies we're already covering are, I'd say, the 2 primary white spaces.","Sean M. Healey","I would add to that, that as we continue to build out our platform and find opportunities to serve Affiliates and generate organic growth for our business, we are aware of the opportunities and thinking hard about the most efficient and effective way of executing those opportunities, but we don't think about our business as one where we need to be in certain places at all costs, whether or not it's efficient and effective. And so that financial screen, that discipline is overlaid across really all of our activities. Doesn't mean that we're not investing for the long run because we've described the array of new initiatives, coverage regions, new personnel. I mean, we're growing substantially, building out the organic growth engine that will continue to drive future growth. But if you look back at the track record of what we've done, it's one where we have generated very strong growth, in some ways against the tide of where industry client demand flows were. And we see that continuing. And as we look forward, where we've been we'll continue to work, and I think the -- there are a lots of additional opportunities.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Cynthia Mayer of Bank of America.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Now that you're focusing in building out your distribution more, I'm just wondering if you could talk a little about the economics of it? For instance, for a minority-owned Affiliate versus majority, how do you -- how does it work for instance, if you sell a retail fund version of an institutional product for an Affiliate where you have a minority stake, how do you -- do you rearrange the previous split you have with them? Do you somehow add the cost of distribution to their expenses, how do you make sure that that's covered since you're making the effort and going through the expense?","Nathaniel Dalton","Okay. So the answer to the question is yes. So we approach every one -- as Sean said, and it's very important to emphasize, we're not top-down pushing Affiliates to do something one way or the other. But of course, you're exactly right, which is we're very conscious of making sure that we appropriately share the cost of building out these platforms with the Affiliates that are using them. And so there is a way in each channel -- and I'm not going I don't think go through the specifics of it. But there is a way in each channel of ensuring that we're fairly sharing the costs of the activity and the rewards of the success. But we think about it as appropriately sharing the cost of the buildout of those platforms and the ongoing operating costs of those platforms with the Affiliates that are using them. And again, it's important to remember Affiliates have the opportunity to pick and choose across the whole thing. So that's something that's done on a platform-by-platform, even platforms within regions kind of basis, making sure the Affiliates feel comfortable with the -- that they are of course receiving excellent value for money, right. So Affiliates should look at any 1 of these offerings, and do look at these offerings, and realize that they're getting access to world-class distribution resources, packaging resources at scale and all the rest of it in a way that they couldn't do or it would be very challenging for them to do on their own. They also don't have to manage all those things and they can access all those resources at scale, benefit from the work that's already been done, and share really in the incremental cost of their participation is the way -- is sort of a crude way to think about it.","Sean M. Healey","And it's critical to underscore that last bit. It's sharing the incremental cost, and we do it in a very transparent way. What Affiliates know is that we're not creating separate profit centers in distribution where they have to worry about negotiating a separate profit margin. We're seeking cost sharing, cost recovery, and then generating our earnings growth in the same way the Affiliate partners do through the growth of their businesses.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So does it make any difference economically to you if you -- if you're selling a product for a majority-owned firm versus a minority-owned firm or not particularly?","Sean M. Healey","Not particularly. I mean, by definition, the incremental share of revenues might be different from 1 firm versus another but that's -- we don't think about that when we're out or our distribution team is out working with Affiliate partners. We're trying for growth of the overall enterprise and supporting each individual Affiliates' growth.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. And just more broadly on that, circling back to another question you had on just all of the strategies you have and the embarrassment of riches. Now that you're doing more distribution, does it at all influence how you think about your pipeline, what kinds of investments you want to make? Are you any more, say, wary of investing in managers that have overlapping strategies? Or are you incrementally more interested in investing in managers to fill a hole in the kinds of products you could sell, or to sell something that the clients you're talking to really need? Does the distribution influence the front end at all?","Sean M. Healey","Yes, of course. No, it's a good question. But I would say, first, we're not embarrassed by the breadth and diversity of our products. We're enthusiastic. And as we look at new opportunities, I think, as Nate noted and as you know, if you say global equity, there are myriad different variations and different strategies within that 1 style category, and certainly sophisticated clients appreciate those differences and so there's lots of opportunity for diversity, even among broad categories. And then you're right. As -- what is completing the virtuous circle that I described in my prepared remarks is actually we're getting insight from our strategic dialogues with the largest clients and intermediaries about what product categories they think are most interesting to them on a forward basis. Now, it doesn't mean that we're able to immediately turn and find an outstanding prospective Affiliate that we can immediately invest in. But broadly, we build relationships with the finest boutique firms in the world. And certainly, in prioritizing our prospecting efforts and the time that I and other senior executives will spend building relationships, we can focus more on those products. And when we're able to make an investment in a product area where we know there's demand, the enormous advantage we have relative to integrated firms is we're not incubating a product. We are bringing, as we said, immediately salable products with, by definition, outstanding track records of success. That's why we wanted to invest in the firm. And so it allows for a scalability and leverage in our distribution that's really different and unique relative to other entities.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then finally, I just wondering if you can update us on the wealth management strategy, because all the deals have been sort of traditional Affiliates and not wealth management. Is that still percolating? Or are you focused more on areas that sort of play to your building distribution?","Sean M. Healey","Well, it's important to understand that that's an entirely separate team, separate location and they're focused entirely on building relationships with the most outstanding independent wealth management firms and teams and waiting for the right opportunities, in the same way that we do in executing our new investment strategy with boutique asset management firms. So they are -- they've done a fine job, we've done a fine job in making investments in several really outstanding wealth management firms. We're in the low- to mid-20 billions in assets across that group and there is a good list of prospective opportunities, of pipeline that they're working on. And so I feel very good and very optimistic about our prospects for that business.","Operator","Our final question will be a follow-up from the line of Robert Lee of Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Just 1 question real quickly. As you expand -- as you work more closely with Affiliates to developing the new products and strategies as the number of Affiliates expand, are you seeing any or expect any increased demands for providing incremental seed capital or incremental fund commitments on new strategies, and that was it.","Sean M. Healey","Well I think -- and I'll ask Nate to give 1 or 2 examples. But we invest in outstanding firms that are -- they're outstanding businesses. And so like all excellent businesses, the firms' partners are focused on building enduring franchises and carefully and appropriately adding to their product set over time. And we absolutely support them in every way that we can, including on occasion and perhaps, in an increasing way, providing seed capital to support that. It honestly is not as much of a demand in most cases as you might expect. These are very successful firms and they -- when they incubate products, they've got a track record of doing it with the partners' own funds and with clients who support them and are interested in supporting new products that appeal to that client, let's say. So there's a lot of product development that occurs across the system. And I would say, increasingly, we are actually using -- to answer or to extend the answer I made to an earlier question, increasingly using the insights that we glean from our global distribution team to feed that information back to Affiliates to help them think about how their product strategy should develop over time. Nate, there might be 1 or 2 examples we could give?","Nathaniel Dalton","Sure. Well I think the places I'd focus here from a product development standpoint, some of it's what you'd expect with the sort of logical extensions of product lines within an Affiliate, right? But the place where I think there is a real significant opportunity in the reasonably short-term, I don't know, how many quarters there is whatever, but in the reasonably short-term -- and this is a place where we are absolutely working with them, and I mentioned it in response to an earlier question, is helping them bring product cross-channel, where we have expertise, depth of relationship, but also just the scale of having -- the scale of the AMG Funds platform allows us to efficiently launch product. And so we have been doing some things on the infrastructure side, extending our licensing to allows us to do some different kinds of packaging, and I do think you'll see us bring -- and I mentioned this especially around alternative, I do think you'll see us bring product from firms like a Pantheon into the more retail market, which has the potential to be an enormous, enormous opportunity if we can execute well. So that -- if I were going to pick a place to focus on, that's a specific thing which is more across channel, certainly more in the alternatives area, and maybe specifically a firm like a Pantheon, where we're definitely working closely with them today.","Operator","Thank you. At this time, I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Sean Healey for closing comments.","Sean M. Healey","Thank you, again, for joining us this morning. As you've heard, we're pleased with our results for the quarter and the year, and we're confident in our prospects for continued strong growth ahead. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Alexandra Lynn, Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Lynn. You may now begin.","Alexandra Lynn","Thank you for joining AMG to discuss our results for the second quarter and first half of 2014. In this conference call, certain matters discussed will constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected due to a number of factors including, but not limited to, those referenced in the company's Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the call. AMG will provide on its website at www.amg.com a replay of the call and a copy of our announcement of our results for the quarter, as well as a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. With us on the line to discuss the company's results for the quarter are Sean Healey, Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; Nate Dalton, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Jay Horgen, Chief Financial Officer. With that, I'll turn the call over to Sean Healey.","Sean M. Healey","Thanks, Ally, and good morning, everyone. AMG reported economic earnings per share of $2.65 for the second quarter of 2014, an increase of 22% compared to the same period last year. Our results for both the quarter and the year-to-date demonstrate consistently excellent execution across our diversified global platform, including the addition of several outstanding new affiliates, the ongoing strong performance of our return-oriented product set and continued outstanding growth from net client cash flows bringing our assets under management to a record $625 billion. As you will hear in a moment, when Jay gives our earnings guidance for 2015, this successful execution of our growth strategy have substantially increased the earnings power of our business.","With $7 billion in net client cash flows this past quarter, it marked our 17th consecutive quarter of strong positive net flows with a total of $120 billion in net flows over this period. As in prior quarters, our outstanding organic growth reflects our boutique Affiliates continued excellent investment performance, our strategic focus on alpha-generating products and the ongoing success of our global distribution strategy.","Looking forward, we continue to see strong demand from global institutions for return-oriented products. And it is also clear that clients increasingly prefer boutique managers for the alpha portions of their portfolios. AMG has the broadest array of performance-oriented boutiques in the world, and our Affiliates have outstanding long-term investment track records across a wide range of alpha-generating strategies, especially in global and emerging market equities and alternatives. Through our global distribution strategy, we offer clients the benefits of this diverse set of independent specialist managers combined with the scale and efficiency of a global asset management firm with in-market client service and a single point of contact.","As Nate will describe further, we are very pleased with the execution of this strategy and, as in prior quarters, we have very significant positive flows in every coverage region this past quarter. As we broaden and deepen our global distribution platform, we are well positioned to continue to generate outstanding organic growth over time.","","Our strong net flows into return-oriented products stand in sharp contrast to broader industry trends, which include continued and even accelerated fixed-income inflows especially from U.S. retail clients. We remain convinced, however, that this trend will change as Central Bank intervention begins to wane as economies recover and rates inevitably rise. And just as we've been experiencing with the largest institutional clients around the world, we believe that U.S. retail clients will increasingly seek return-oriented strategies especially in global and emerging market equities and alternatives, and will also recognize boutique firms as having a competitive advantage in generating alpha. We are positioned ahead of this title change in client flows with an increased focus on U.S. retail, including new leadership, additional senior-level hires and the rebranding to AMG Funds. There are only a few asset management firms in the world that can match the breadth of our performance-oriented product set, and we believe we have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us to build one of the leading retail franchises in the industry.","The successful execution of our global institutional and retail distribution strategy is increasingly enhancing our appeal to prospective new Affiliates. With 4 new Affiliates added thus far in 2014, we are seeing evidence of this effect along with the benefit of our 20-year track record of successful partnerships and the proprietary relationships we have established with leading traditional and alternative boutique firms around the world.","Going forward, the transaction environment remains highly favorable for us, and we continue to have a strong and diverse pipeline of new investment prospects. We're confident in our ability to make additional investments in outstanding firms, which will add meaningful accretion to our earnings while also enhancing the diversity and capacity of our performance-oriented product set with excellent, immediately salable products.","Looking ahead, with the strength and scale of our existing business and our unparalleled opportunities to partner with leading boutique firms around the world, together with a strategic distribution capabilities we offer to enhance our growth, we look forward to continuing to create outstanding shareholder value going forward. With that, I'll turn it to Nate to discuss our Affiliates results in greater detail.","Nathaniel Dalton","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. We had another very good quarter, again demonstrating the strength and diversity of our business and the multiple ways we can drive growth.","As Sean noted, this past quarter was our 17th consecutive quarter of significant positive cash flows as we and our Affiliates once again executed well and benefited from our strategic positioning. Clients continue to separate their portfolios into passive beta exposures at one end and active alpha at the other, and for the alpha portions of their portfolios, clients worldwide are increasingly attracted to boutiques.","For example, in the quarter, we saw significant flows and wins across a broad range of alternative product areas from liquid hedge fund products to illiquid private equity and infrastructure, with multi-strat and credit products also being significant contributors. We also continue to generate significant flows in active global developed and emerging markets equities.","Turning to investment performance by category and starting with the global developed markets area. Overall, we had a good quarter with highlights including very strong performance from the global product at Artemis and Harding Loevner, as well as AQR defensive equity products. Tweedy, Browne's major global international products were right around their benchmarks reflecting good stock selection while they were held back by their still significant cash levels.","In the emerging markets category, we had a very strong performance. All the major products managed by Genesis outperformed in the quarter and continue to build their exceptional track records. Trilogy had a very good quarter, and a major emerging markets products at Harding Loevner continue to maintain their very strong long-term track records.","In our U.S. equity category, we had a mixed-performance quarter. Many Affiliates, including AQR, First Quadrant, SouthernSun, have outstanding performance record across their respective equity products. And while near-term performance at Yacktman continues to be challenged, largely due to their cash levels and defensive positioning, their funds had maintained their first percentile ranking for 10-year and longer periods.","Finally, turning to our alternatives product category. Looking across our Affiliate group, AMG is among the largest alternative managers in the world, with our Affiliates managing a very broad array of liquid and illiquid strategies. Broadly speaking, our Affiliates generated good performance in the quarter. This includes best-in-class credit, control equity, currency, energy, infrastructure and private equity products. While it's still early in the year, the combined strong returns -- I'm sorry, the continued strong returns in the second quarter resulted in some performance fees being recognized.","Now looking at flows for the quarter. As I said, we had another strong quarter with $6.9 billion in positive net client cash flows. As we emphasized on every call, flows, especially in the institutional and sub-advisory channels, are inherently lumpy. However, overall flow momentum continues to be good.","Turning to the channel review and starting with the institutional channel. We have positive net flows of approximately $4.6 billion. These flows came primarily in global and emerging markets products and alternative strategies. Notable contributions came from AQR, BlueMountain, Harding Loevner, Pantheon and Trilogy. Similar to previous quarters, we had a number of great wins coming from leading institutional investors located around the world.","Moving to the mutual fund channel. We have positive net flows of $1.9 billion. From a product category standpoint, we had strong net flows into global equities, emerging markets equities and alternative strategies, which came from a number of Affiliates including Artemis, First Quadrant, Harding Loevner and Tweedy, Browne. In our high net worth channel, flows were roughly $500 million for the quarter with contributions coming primarily from BlueMountain, SouthernSun and GW&K, including through our U.S. retail distribution platform.","Now turning to an update of our global institutional distribution platforms. We continue to help our Affiliates generate strong flows among a diversified set of products and across geographies with significant flows coming in every one of our institutional coverage regions once again this quarter. In addition, we further enhanced our regional coverage with the addition of another senior sales professional dedicated to the Middle East, a reason why we have built a significant business over the last 5 years.","While we continue to evaluate expansion to new regions, we also remain focused on deepening our sales teams in regions where we made good progress and see significant additional opportunities to gain market share. In our institutional coverage regions, we still believe we are in the relatively early stages of capitalizing on extraordinary opportunities.","While we've built relationships with the largest pools of capital in our coverage regions, our Affiliates have so far only established client relationships with a subset of those large pools. So there are many more where we can make that first sale. Even where we've established a client relationship with 1 or 2 Affiliates, in almost every case there's a much more significant opportunity to introduce additional products over time from the same Affiliate, additional existing Affiliates and importantly new Affiliates as they partner with AMG.","Now turning next to our U.S. retail platform, AMG Funds. As Sean noted, we believe we have an opportunity to build a leading U.S. retail distribution business. As you know, earlier this year, we re-branded the platform and brought on additional leadership. And Jeff Cerutti and his team are just making good progress.","Our belief in the long-term opportunity is based in part on a view that demand trends are shifting on our favor as over time clients and their intermediaries must increase allocations to return-oriented products to meet their long-term objectives. We also believe there's a unique opportunity to be the point of contact through which platforms and intermediaries and other channel partners can access the world's broadest array of return-oriented boutiques.","Finally, I want to spend a minute on our unique product development opportunity alongside these growing these distribution platforms. For us, creating new product happens together with our Affiliates, and in this regard a number of Affiliates are well known for their product innovation and development. In addition, as we add new Affiliates, each new firm brings an array of products with exceptional track records often with significant capacity to our Affiliate group. At the same time, we bring them the opportunity to offer these established, excellent products through our global institutional and retail distribution platforms.","The year-to-date is a very good example of this, when you look at the 4 new Affiliates and their long-term track records in these very attractive product areas, including energy and energy infrastructure, which didn't have before; as well as additional global, emerging and high-conviction U.S. equities. These are outstanding products that are immediately salable through our distribution platform. The addition of these product and product areas will, over time, increase the effectiveness of our global institutional and retail platforms in the marketplace, as we have an even broader array of high-quality boutiques to discuss, which will not only continue to increase our organic growth opportunities, but also ultimately continue to enhance our value as an institutional partner to our existing Affiliates and our position with prospective new Affiliates. All component parts of the virtuous circle that you've heard Sean talk about.","More immediately, as we look at the second half of 2014, we see a continuation of the momentum we've had for the last several years as our Affiliates maintain their excellent long-term performance records and as we continue to see strong global demand for performance-oriented products managed by some of the best investors in their respective disciplines. With that, I'll turn it to Jay to discuss financials.","Jay C. Horgen","Thank you, Nate. As Sean and Nate discussed, we are pleased with our second quarter results, which reflect our continued outstanding organic growth as well as the strength and diversity of our Affiliates. As you saw in the release, we reported economic earnings per share of $2.65 for the quarter with net performance fees contributing $0.09. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings of $1.77 for the quarter.","Turning to more specific modeling items. For the second quarter, our EBITDA was up more than 22% year-over-year to $212 million, reflecting the continued organic growth of our business and strong execution of our new investment growth strategy. The ratio of our EBITDA to end-of-period assets under management for the second quarter was 14 basis points or approximately 13.4 basis points before the second quarter performance fees I had mentioned earlier. In the third quarter, we expect this ratio to be closer to 13.2 basis points as a result of the closing of Veritas at the very end of the quarter and reflecting the more modest amount of performance fees typically expected in the third quarter.","With regard to our taxes, our effective GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 36.8%, and our cash tax rate was 26.7%. For modeling purposes, we expect our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 34% and our cash tax rate to be approximately 25%. Intangible-related deferred taxes for the second quarter were $19 million, and we expect this number to be approximately $20 million for the third quarter. Our share of amortization for the quarter was $29.2 million, including $7.3 million of amortization from Affiliates accounted for under the equity method, and we expect AMG's amortization to remain at approximately this level for the third quarter. Our interest expense for the second quarter was $22.4 million, including $2.4 million of pretax noncash imputed interest expense. For the third quarter, we expect our total interest expense to remain at approximately $22 million, including $2.7 million of pretax noncash imputed interest expense.","Turning to our balance sheet. The continued growth and scale of our business has allowed us to execute on 4 new investments in the first half of 2014 while also reducing our leverage. With a run rate EBITDA of more than $1 billion combined with another $1.2 billion of undrawn revolver, we continue to have the capacity and flexibility to execute on new investments, and the scale of our business will continue to create incremental opportunities for earnings growth.","Now turning to guidance. We are narrowing our 2014 guidance as we expect economic earnings per share to be in the range of $11.20 to $12.10. With the meaningful run rate impact of recent new investments, we are providing preliminary 2015 guidance, which we expect to be in the range of $13 to $14.50. As always, we assume our normal convention of actual market performance through yesterday for the current quarter and 2% quarterly market growth beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014. We also assume a weighted average share count of approximately 56.5 million for 2014 and approximately 57 million for 2015. The lower end of our guidance ranges include a modest contribution from performance fees and organic growth, while the upper end of these ranges assumes a more robust contribution from both performance fees and net client cash flows.","As always, these assumptions do not include earnings from future new investments and are based on our current expectation of Affiliate growth rates, performance and the mix of Affiliate contribution to our earnings. Of course, substantial changes in markets and the earnings contribution of our Affiliates would impact these expectations.","Now we'll be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Daniel Fannon of Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I guess just a focus on guidance to start. It seems like you took $0.10 off the high end for this year. If you could talk about what's changed. And also thinking about the performance fee, which I believe would be part of that. Then kind of where that stacks up, as you said, in the end of July this year versus where you were a year ago.","Jay C. Horgen","Sure. So let me point out several items in the quarter that affects our guidance but maybe then mentioning that we did take $0.10 off the top. We also brought in the bottom or moved the $0.10 up in the bottom, so we narrowed it $0.10 on each side. I guess the first thing I would call out is just the new investments. Dan, just to level set, we had closed 2 new investments in the quarter, EIG at the beginning and River Road at the end. And we also expect, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that Veritas will close at the very end of the third quarter. So the 2014 guidance that we're giving first reflects on that timing and the partial year impact of our new investments. I would also note that it's offset by slightly elevated deal expenses since we did 4 deals this year. And that's why, honestly, we're giving the full earnings impact estimate for 2015, and that's why we're introducing it this quarter, a quarter early. I'll just remind you also of just of our model convention. We assume markets up and until this day in the quarter, which will capture 100% of the performance for the quarter, and then we assume no more market performance until the fourth quarter. So since the last time we gave guidance which was set forth, we experienced about 3.5% market appreciation blended across all products. And again since the last time we gave guidance, that was up 1.5% higher than our standard 2% convention. And then the last point, which gets to your performance fee, I think at this point we assume 2014 will be kind of a typical year. So in the range of 5% to 10% of our total economic net income would be in the form of performance fees, which is roughly $0.60 to $1.20, $0.60 to $1.20 for the year.","But we've already booked $0.16 year-to-date. So taken all of that together, that's the tightening of the 2014 range. So it's really affirming the midpoint of $11.65, but then we're guiding to 2015 midpoint of $13.75 which is an 18% year-over-year growth rate.","Sean M. Healey","I would just add with respect to performance fees, Dan. As you know, we are very conservative in the way that we think about performance fees and embed them in our guidance, but the track record and the opportunity is very large, and so we're not -- I don't think any different than we were last year at this time. And seeing substantial alpha that's already been generated, performance fees that are -- that we expect, we believe, will be substantial. But it still only a little bit past midway through the year and there's a lot that can happen, and we think that the taking of conservative approach is the right path. But you'll hear it later in the year us talk about more performance fees.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just to clarify, so is it safe to say that the deal costs are a bit higher than when you gave us your last guidance? Because markets are up to your point. The deals were already -- all the deal -- there's not an incremental deal from the last time you gave guidance.","Jay C. Horgen","Yes. I would note that there is -- it's modest. I mean, we're up 1.5% relative to -- and I'll just clarify. Since April 29 -- I think I was off by a quarter. But since April 29, we're up 1.5% relative to our guidance. That's a modest increase from investment performance. And it is offset slightly by deal expenses. That taken together were just normal, typical performance fee years. It's all in the small dollar category, Dan. It's why we tightened it.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Got it. And then, Sean, just to kind of look at the outlook for new investment activity there. It does seem as if there's just generally more activity obviously with you, guys, as well as the industry. And thinking about the market at the all-time high and trying to be thinking about the value that's out there for deals and how you guys can be disciplined in maybe a little bit more of a competitive environment. If you could kind of just talk about how you're thinking about capital deployment over the next kind of 6 to 12 months.","Sean M. Healey","Clever and relatively novel way of asking me how many deals we're likely to do, Dan. But I think the answer, as always, is that we remain very optimistic. We have a tremendous competitive position. Really better than it's ever been. You're correct that the market environment is favorable. And some firms are in product categories where their assets and revenues reflect a lot of growth, but of course there are other product categories where there hasn't been as much growth. And inevitably, all of our new investments, virtually all of our new investments, arise out of the relationships that we have developed and maintained with the very best boutique firms around the world now over the past 20 years. And it's the opportunity that we see from all of these firms inevitably needing to do some kind of transaction to provide a solution to their succession, transition issues, that gives us the underlying confidence. And over time, while it's hard to gauge in any period, we are very, very confident. You're seeing, as I said, the beginnings of what we believe over the -- certainly over the medium to long term, will be a very substantial set of new investment opportunities. The industry backdrop and competition is relevant but really very much on the margin. Virtually, all of our investments arise out of these relationships and our negotiated transactions. So as I said in the prepared remarks, the pipeline continues. Even though we've had a very good year already, the pipeline continues to be very strong, and we're very busy.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Kim of Sandler O'Neill.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","First, can you just give us a bit more color in terms of where you stand on sort of more fully leveraging AMG Funds in the retail channel? And then related to that, was just curious if there's an economic benefit from being able to offer sort of the breadth of your funds across Affiliates through a centralized platform when you're partnering with the distributors.","Nathaniel Dalton","So I'll take them in reverse order. I think the -- of course, we believe that's exactly right. I think you captured it. So with the largest intermediaries, as well as with sort of regional intermediaries in big networks and independent networks, we absolutely think there's an opportunity to be the single point of contact through which they access a broad array of return-oriented products across a range of packages. And I think especially at the bigger ones, that across the range of packages, it is an important piece to add. So absolutely that opportunity is there. I should mention, just to step back for a second, the AMG Funds platform is really a reasonably large-scale platform, and we have signed agreements in place with all of the large -- well actually we've got over 2,000 signed agreements in place And so we got signed agreements in place with some of these places already and so the opportunity to bring additional products -- moving to the first part of the question, to bring additional product from existing Affiliates as well as to offer to new prospective Affiliates. As they come on line, the opportunity to access that breadth in distribution as well as the breadth in operations, looking at a firm like SouthernSun, you can bring their products right onto our platform. Both ways there's a lot of leveraged opportunity there.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, and then maybe one for Jay. I know guys remained active on the deal front but -- as well as sort of the opportunity set seemingly remains pretty broad. But as cash flows just continue to build, at what point do maybe share repurchases come back into the equation particularly since if you look at -- your EPS growth hasn't really benefited from buybacks to the same extent as most of your peers?","Jay C. Horgen","Yes, thanks, Michael. I'll get to your -- to the punchline here in a second. I would note that our EBITDA growth rate has been much higher than our peers, and we continue to grow because of organic growth and because of the execution on new investments. So that's against the backdrop of that. As you know, we position our balance sheet as recently as last quarter and then if you kind of go back 2 or 3 quarters. What we've done here is we've simplified our balance sheet but then we've increased the capacity pretty significantly in front of the new investment opportunity. As you know, we've done 4 new investments already, and as per Sean's comments, we are still very -- we look forward to continue to execute on new investments. So we're positioning our balance sheet to do that to the extent that we are able to do both. I think that's something that we're thinking about. But for the moment, we see a big pipeline of new investments in front of us.","Sean M. Healey","And so if you think of a business with more than $1 billion of EBITDA rapidly growing through a very strong organic growth, and even as we feel that the cash generated from the business over the medium to long term, we see that amount and more in prospective potential new investments. And so we will, as always, be primarily focused on executing new investment opportunities, which build and broaden and diversify our business and create, as we've discussed, this virtuous circle with our distribution capability. But inevitably, there will be periods, because of market volatility or just the accident of fortuity and circumstances, where there aren't new investments that we're interested in pursuing. And so what you will see more of in the future in periods like that is more substantial repurchase. We won't -- as you know, we don't like to just warehouse cash on the balance sheet. We'll stay flexible and advance to new investment opportunities, but you'll absolutely, as Jay said, see more repurchase activity over time.","Operator","The next question is from Robert Lee of KBW.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","This question maybe is for Nate or, I guess, Sean as well. But how do you manage kind of the bandwidth and capacity of the global distribution? I mean, you have a lot of growing number of Affiliates, a lot of different products, some of which -- some Affiliates arguably compete against each other in the marketplace to some extent. So how do you actually manage kind of access -- because I assume as you demonstrated success of that, more Affiliates want to make more use of the platform. So how do you kind of control that?","Nathaniel Dalton","I think there's sort of at least 2 different broad areas to go at this one on. So first, just to back up for a second. So the way we're building our distribution, it's designed to complement each Affiliates standalone distribution, right? So each Affiliate has a distribution capability as they're coming aboard or just a capability, right? And the goal of our distribution is to make appropriate matches. So if -- and I'll move here more into institutional. So what we're doing is, we're educating, right, the end users and intermediaries. We're using deep local expertise. Thus we're hiring very high quality people in the geography to know the client base very well. And on the institutional side, we've been focusing -- and this is a generalization, but they're focusing mostly on the high-end institutional market and the intermediaries who serve them. We're also building institution-to-institution relationships between AMG and those institutions and AMG and those large intermediaries. Now the reason we're able to build those institution-to-institution relationships is because of our breadth, including the fact that we in many cases had multiple high-quality products or product capabilities and things that could simply be looked at as the same area. Again, obviously everyone of them does it differently, but that breadth and that multiplicity of products within areas, this is the thing that allows us to build those institution-to-institution relationships. And so at the end of the -- the end-user and the intermediaries understand that they're hiring the Affiliate to manage the money, right? And so that's -- they're very clear on that. And then they get all the benefits of hiring a boutique which -- as you heard us say on our prepared remarks, there's an increasing acceptance of the advantages of the boutiques in producing the alpha streams. So they're getting all the benefits of hiring a boutique, with many of the benefits of working with a global financial institution, and they understand the advantages of these boutiques operating within AMG. So in the way I just described that process, the breadth is a really strong advantage, not disadvantage. Now obviously, we have to do on our end the distribution infrastructure that we build. You're exactly right, we have to do a very good job making sure that we understand our Affiliate products well and are able to appropriately represent them in the marketplace, and that's a huge area of focus for us. The other thing I'll say is sort of just the next step to it is that breadth is allowing us to build institution-to-institution relationships with many of the largest pools of capital in the world. Then, as I said in my prepared remarks, as we're building those relationships, we are beginning to make those first sales in here. And here's where the big opportunity -- the big sort of medium-term opportunity is. We're beginning to make those first sales. For many, we still have the opportunity to make the first sale. And as we build a relationship and make the initial sale, the opportunity to sort of, I'll use the word, cross-sell. It's not really cross-sell, but the opportunity to cross-sell within that Affiliate to other Affiliates and then to additional Affiliates as they come online is very, very powerful. It's also powerful that institutions are interacting with us, the end users, understand that we're going to be adding new Affiliates. But all of these pieces really do knit together.","Sean M. Healey","And the backdrop, as you know, is one where across the industry broadly active equities and alternatives have not been as much in favor. Certainly, the active equities. And so if you look at 17 straight quarters of positive flows predominantly in return-oriented products, $120 billion in net flows through this period, and yet, as Nate said, we still feel that we're in the early stages of exploiting the opportunity both at the -- in terms of global institutional distribution but also importantly in U.S. retail. So as big as we are, lots, lots more opportunity ahead of us.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And maybe the follow-up question on distribution. I mean, I know, Nate, I think you talked earlier about product development, and I think your comments are mainly focused on kind of the AMG fund channel. But to what extent, as you kind of expand and broaden your institutional relationships globally, have you been able to kind of take that feedback and help specific Affiliates to develop new products that they've launched and have had some success? Or is it still too early to...","Nathaniel Dalton","Yes. I would say there is some of that, but it is still early. So again, for us, the -- when we talked broadly about product development, we mean both sort of new products as well as track records that are becoming really scalable and then also the new packages. So if you sort of think about those 3, in the first 2 categories it's still early days, as you say. In the third, this sort of new packages -- and this also relates to the earlier question. In the new packages category, this is a place where -- especially with some of the things we're doing were alternative products or working to do. It gets very early days still, but we're working to do with things like illiquid alternatives in the retail space. These are places where bringing established institutional quality product capability into more retail markets is a very big opportunity for us to do that there. And that's enabled by the scale of AMG and the fact that we're interacting. And that's partly U.S. retail but it's also non-U.S. retail. I mean as -- I think we talked about last quarter, we've begun going into the platform market in Australia. Again early days but there's an opportunity there to bring some very high-quality institutional products including alternatives. And this quarter, we spoke briefly about beginning to do some moves in the Middle East both some smaller institutions but also at the high net worth market, which is going to have a platform component to it as well.","Sean M. Healey","And our distribution strategy informs and enhances our new investment strategy as well as we learn from clients or we see demand -- client demand and opportunities for new products, we in turn can reflect that in the prospecting effort with new Affiliates. And obviously it's a way that we add, as we described earlier, substantial capacity even in product areas where we may already have a presence.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And maybe following up to the last one and just one more question. I appreciate the patience. Certainly there's no evidence of it given the number of transactions you announced and completed this year. But as you add -- as you got larger and add Affiliates, I mean, is it becoming part of the conversation that some prospective Affiliates look and say, \"Gee, where am I going to fit within this 30-odd Affiliate structure?\" The feeling that they're going to get potentially lost at all?","Sean M. Healey","Well, I think if you compare it to the alternative, right, other entities which describe a distribution capability but have no evidence and no real ability to in fact effectively market and distribute independent boutique firms products around the world or indeed even in the U.S. retail space. So it's kind of a high-quality potential issue, but I would say it's an issue that we very effectively address in the way that we just described in responding to your prior question. I think, in fact, now more than ever, the distribution capability and the track record, the real track record, of actually selling not just selling the AMG brand and the benefits of the collective and the efficiency of single point of contact and the strategic relationships that we're building with the most important largest institutional clients around the world, but also simultaneously, in a complementary way, selling independent boutique Affiliate products and especially in return-oriented product categories, alternative products and, in many cases, to clients who haven't been big purchasers before. So that demonstrable track record is enormously valuable and increasingly visible. And so is, to the contrary, I would say, actually an even more significant advantage than it's ever been.","Operator","The next question is from Cynthia Mayer of Bank of America.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Maybe similar to what you were just answering but in a new way, which is -- if you look at the new investments you've made recently, which is 4 in pretty short succession, if you look at the past acquisitions, what kind of lag time is there between when they join and when you can ramp up their organic growth, either through increased distribution of the products they already have or through new products?","Nathaniel Dalton","Yes. So, Cynthia, the first part of the question on existing products, there is of course a lag time, but the lag time is small numbers and anecdotal, right, but the lag time is much shorter than I would said it was if you went back a couple of years ago. And it's for a number of reasons, right? So one is we have more resources in more places with deeper relationships, right? So we're just more efficient into understanding hereof. We have more places to go, and our better understanding -- here's the ease with which this product set can go there. We're just -- we've been doing it now longer in more places, so I think we're better at that. I also think -- and this a little bit drives to the point that Sean was making. I think our credibility with the Affiliates, existing and new, is -- since we've now been doing it for a reasonably long period of time with good success, that process of bringing them on board is just a much better more efficient process. So I think we're better bringing the Affiliates along, and I think we're better understanding where the opportunity is in the marketplace. Again that -- those are self-reinforcing obviously. And then in terms of new product, I would say it's still pretty early for me to be able to give you a view of whether that's gotten sort of shorter or not. The conversation certainly start earlier, which again stands reason because we are in more places with better understandings of more market opportunities, and so we're better able to say, \"There's a specific opportunity here if you just do this.\" And again it's obviously always, just to be clear, completely controlled by the Affiliates. We don't have judgment about what -- the return stream that they can and can't generate and how they wish to use their investment process. But we're just in more places and we're better at making that match.","Sean M. Healey","A couple of points to add. First, as you know, Cynthia, in all of our investments, we're investing in firms that are very successful, complete firms generating strong organic growth already. So what we can offer is incremental to the strong growth. I mean, by definition we're not investing in firms where they're not seeing growth, and where they come to us and say, \"I need something.\" We instead invest in firms which are very successful, and inevitably want us above all else, and we're good at this, to make sure we preserve and protect their culture and autonomy and do no harm. But increasingly, they do, as I said -- as you heard us both say, they do see real opportunity. And even in the earliest conversations increasingly with prospective Affiliates, increasingly Andrew Dyson, the head of our global distribution effort, is in the conversation, and we're talking to prospective Affiliates about opportunities that we see based on a very tangible awareness of specific client opportunities and specific opportunities in different regions and channels. And so the conversation about the ability for us to support and complement what the Affiliates, what the prospective Affiliates wants to do begin even before we close investment, and we're again seeing that in some of these investments even this year.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And I guess since you put together -- since you put out a '15 guidance there, should I assume that for your new Affiliates, when you layer them into '15 guidance, you're not adding incremental flows, you're taking their existing organic growth rate and saying, \"Let's wait and see on incremental?\" Or how do you differentiate...","Sean M. Healey","The answer is, it depends. But we absolutely apply judgment to what we think the forward organic growth opportunity is from alpha generation and net flows, and we've looked at it in the case of each Affiliate.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then can you just briefly talk a little bit the earnings dynamics of EIG, because some -- it's a little bit different from some other investments? And should we assume that it's a typical private equity model where you receive management fees on committed capital, but then you get carry at some point? When will you expect carry? And what visibility would we get into that as we go along? Also maybe, could they offer retail at some point?","Jay C. Horgen","So just on the sort of the economic profile. It's Jay, Cynthia. So you're right. It is typical private equity style commitments in the main. So that is a period on committed, and then after that it's on what's invested. So you're right about that. Reminding everyone, we are on Method 1 GAAP accounting, so we only experience performance fees when crystallized. So when we report our performance fees, EIG will be in them, and it will only be when we actually get the cash. So that's an important difference, I think, in some cases relative to alternative firms. So it will be in our guidance. It will also just be in that guidance we give for performance fees, which is typically 5% to 10% of our economic earnings per share. Given the recent fund raise that the EIG has done, which is very sizable one, and the dynamic of EIG coming out of TCW and so on, we would expect those performance fee to really come in small amount in 2015 and then after that.","Nathaniel Dalton","And then maybe to speak to the retail question. So the short answer is yes. I think you've heard us talk about last quarter some of investment that we and [indiscernible] doing together to build the opportunity to build, to bring some of their product set to both the sort of retail market and maybe even also the DC market. So we're building some of that infrastructure. We believe that there's leverage in what we're building there to other Affiliates, and that would include EIG. It would include maybe BlueMountain and [indiscernible]. I do think there's absolutely an opportunity to bring additional illiquid alternative product to the retail market.","Operator","The next question is from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess Jay and\/or Sean, if you could just talk a little bit about what you see as your core EBITDA yield run rates excluding performance fees after Veritas is integrated, maybe embedded within your 2015 guidance. And then this is probably hard to answer, but is the variation around that depending on how flows move, are sort of structurally biased for that to improve given what you're seeing in flows across your product set?","Sean M. Healey","Brian, can you repeat the last part of your question again?","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, sure, sure. So the core EBITDA revenue yield run rate x performance fees, and then the last part was the variation around that given how you're seeing or how you're expecting net flows to transpire across your business mix? Is it -- are you seeing -- I guess the question is are you seeing stronger potential flows in higher-yielding Affiliates?","Sean M. Healey","Right. So let's -- to your first question, and I'll take you back to the prepared remarks just to clarify, Brian. So we experienced this quarter, and I did carve it out specifically to address this point, while we had 14 basis points EBITDA to end the period. As we have mentioned [ph] 13.4 before performance fees. In the third quarter, we expected that ratio to go to 13.2 and specifically 2 things are happening in that quarter. Third quarter that is 13.2. One, performance fees are very modest in the third quarter typically unless there's positive surprises, because there can only positive surprises with performance fees. So really the third quarter is a pretty close to nonperformance fees run rate. And then you have Veritas coming in at the end of the quarter, and if you look at the difference between our pro forma AUM and our current table, you'll see about $18 billion that's related to Veritas. So you can back that out yourself. So you'll see that our fee rate is pretty much flat in the kind of the 13.2 to 13.4, 13.5 range. That's all very close to the same number when you do the math. And I would just generically say we're not seeing a lot of movement in this ratio so that means that the mix and the blend, which are, I guess, 2 slightly different concepts, but they're producing about a consistent pattern of fees to -- fees and mix to EBITDA. But of course, you understand, Brian, we don't manage to this ratio because the accident of the next incremental Affiliate revenue share will change the ratio in ways that may -- well, that don't -- won't matter to us, because by definition we'll have satisfied ourselves. But it's an excellent firm with all of the requisite attributes of growth and stability in their earnings stream, and what their profit margin or revenue share of margin happens to be won't matter. So we'll give you the forward guidance on a go-forward basis by quarters but we don't do it for future years.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, yes, totally understood. And then maybe just to talk about guidance just quickly. Do I understand this correctly: for the third quarter, we have the market up about 1%, so is your guidance inclusive of the 1% performance in the third quarter? For the market, that is. And then as you're talking about the new pipeline for deals, obviously it's very good. If they don't come to fruition, I think, Sean, you talked about if there's a lull in activity, you would not look for cash to build up on the balance sheet too aggressively and be in the market for buying back stocks. I'm just trying to get a sense of timing on that. For example, if we don't see any deals in the next couple of quarters, would that be soon enough to be back in the market to sort of buy back? Or are you thinking more longer term?","Sean M. Healey","Unfortunately, there's no ready formula that I can give you. It will necessarily depend on the circumstances, and it maybe that we see very substantial opportunities to make new investments just ahead of us, which we won't be able to describe fully. But in that scenario, we might have more cash than from the outside one would expect. I think the commitment and in the track record over time, even in a period where the cash generation of the business was at a much lower scale, is to put cash to work on behalf of shareholders and not to just let it build on the balance sheet. And if you look over time, that's what we've done, and I think over the medium to long term, that's what we will do. And just to your specific question on guidance. So to distinguish between what I said earlier, really since 6\/30, so really the last 29 days, we've had very modest appreciation for the quarter. A little bit but modest. And that's all the market assumption we would put into our model. That's our convention. So no more market for this quarter. And in the fourth quarter, we would assume 2% going forward.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Right. And then, of course, just to clarify, the 2015 guidance does not include any use of that capital for buyback either even if there are no deals?","Sean M. Healey","Right. So as especially if this preliminary -- but also as part of our convention, we assume no new investments or material capital deployment.","Operator","The next question is from Greggory Warren of Morningstar.","Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Just a few housekeeping issues here. And pardon me, I jumped in the call a little bit late, so you may have gone over this already. On Veritas, you were looking at about $18.2 billion in AUM at the end of the second quarter, correct?","Jay C. Horgen","I think a number like $18 billion is close. There's a little rounding in your numbers.","Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. Because I think you said $625 billion on a pro forma basis in the release, so I was looking about $18.2 billion, and then you were expecting that to close by the end of the third quarter, correct?","Jay C. Horgen","Correct.","Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just real quick on that and then related to distribution. How much excitement are you seeing around their particular product set in that. I'm looking at this from a more industry level, because when you look at flows overall on the equity side, it's all been passive the last couple of years here with all the money coming in. And the only area where active flows have been strong have been on the global international side of the business. So I'm just wondering what sort of interest there is and the products they're bringing in to bear.","Nathaniel Dalton","So I think obviously very, very early days preliminary, but they have an outstanding reputation among a wide range of people globally, and that's been fantastic. And then for the people who don't know them, as we begin to talk about it, people are obviously very impressed. I think maybe one just modest sort of broader point, which is -- well, I think your observations are sort of spot on in terms of industry trends. I do think, we have been finding -- and Sean spoke to this earlier, but we have been finding the opportunity to introduce very high-quality performance oriented boutiques with excellent long-term track records and capacity into places, and been able to generate some flows in ways that are counter to the broad trends. But just to answer your question, again it's very, very early days. But obviously there's a fantastic group, and we're obviously very, very pleased that they chose to partner with us.","Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Good to hear you. And you guys do sort of buck the trend on the other side of the business. I wasn't making an insinuation there. And then, Jay, just real quick, too. I didn't quite catch it during the run-up to the Q&A. You were saying next year's estimates are based on 56.5 million shares, or this year's on 56.5 million and next year on 57 million, correct?","Jay C. Horgen","Correct. Those are the average for the year so...","Operator","And our final question comes from Chris Shutler of William Blair.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So first on the global distribution effort. Sounds like you're certainly very focused on deepening penetration in existing regions, but just curious on new geographies. You mentioned Japan in the past. Just where are you on the thought process there? And is your desire to go after any new geography dependent all on your ability to execute a new Affiliate investment?","Nathaniel Dalton","I don't think it's dependent on our ability to execute a new affiliate investment. You're right, I think there have been 3 -- sort of focus on the institutional global bit. There's been 3 things we're focusing on. So one is, if you sort of go back in last year, we've been increasing with specialization by country. So sort of Benelux higher, German higher, Swiss higher, those kind of things, yes. And then as you say, we've been looking at deepening our penetration, and we did speak about Australia and this quarter spoke about the Middle East. And it looks like we've already built very strong businesses at scale especially at the high institutional end. And so that's leveraging that brand and much greater awareness of us, our business model and our affiliates in these geographies. And then we continue to look at additional regions. Japan is one that we talked about last quarter, and we continue to work on. We are building relationships institution to institution. Those high-level institutional relationships that we talked about, and we are also having conversations with intermediaries and thinking about both the institutional side and over time the sort of platform side of that market and others. I think we've talked about it in prior calls as both for us looking at the organic opportunities in the markets and looking our existing product set, and where the sort of more short-term specific opportunities are. And then a lot of it is finding the right people and building the right sort of relationships that we can find. The people that we really want to represent our Affiliates in these marketplaces.","Sean M. Healey","Worth underscoring. Not that you're seeing this, but the implication sometimes when you talk about new regions is that somehow there is saturation of the extant regions and coverage, and as you've heard us say to the contrary, we see enormous opportunity in the existing regions. Some of which like Australia and the Middle East are large and rapidly growing. And we know looking at -- on a client by client basis, the extent to which we have ongoing incremental opportunities to build further relationships and deepen those relationships, so that's important to understand. And then secondly, in markets like Japan and U.S. retail has some of the same attributes, and maybe even broadly around the world, that tide of client demand trends, we believe, is increasingly shifting in our favor toward the alpha side of the barbell return-oriented products. And you're seeing that. Maybe are not quite yet seen in U.S. retail the extent to which we think we all will. But you're certainly seeing it in Japan where there's a huge ongoing shift of opportunity into the kinds of products that our Affiliates create. And on an overall basis the opportunity set in the existing areas as well as new coverage areas, new geographies, as Nate said, we're in a very early stages of taking advantage of that.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, makes sense. And then just one more. You guys have made some pretty impressive hires in the last few months and just maybe a little bit under the radar. But I wanted to hone in on the hiring of Glenn Earle in particular and just better understand what his role is going to be at AMG?","Sean M. Healey","Glenn is actually not a hire. He's a senior advisor to the firm in a consulting relationship, so a great friend to AMG and someone who is incredibly smart with as broad and an impressive network of relationships as anyone I can think of in the U.K. and more broadly in the industry given his role in a very senior position at Goldman Sachs before coming to join forces with us. But we are as -- you're absolutely right in saying that we've made some great hires, and we know as we continue to build our business, it's one that has an enormous scale opportunity. So we don't have to hire that many people, but our business depends on key people being excellent professionals, interacting effectively with our Affiliates, prospective Affiliates and our clients. And so on an ongoing basis, you'll see us adding more terrific people. And Nate and Jay and I are -- at least we tell ourselves we're still young so we're -- we have a long way ahead of us, but a great team.","Operator","Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing remarks.","Sean M. Healey","Thanks again for joining us this morning. As you've heard, we're pleased with our results for the quarter and the first half of the year. We remain confident in our ability to generate meaningful earnings growth both through organic growth and accretive investments in new Affiliates going forward. We look forward to talking to you in October. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and thank you for your participation."],"585":["Affiliated Managers Group Inc.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Miss. Anjali Aggarwal, Vice President, Investor Relations for AMG. Thank you. You may begin.","Anjali Aggarwal","Thank you for joining AMG to discuss our results for the first quarter of 2019. In this conference call, certain matters discussed will constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected due to a number of factors, including but not limited to, those referenced in the company\u2019s Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time-to-time. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the call.","AMG will provide on the Investor Relations section of its website at ir.amg.com, a replay of the call, a copy of the announcement of our results for the quarter and a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of any estimate of the company\u2019s economic earnings per share for future periods that are announced on this call. As a reminder, we have also included an updated investor presentation on this section of our website. AMG encourages investors to consult the Investor Relations section of its website regularly for updated information.","With us on the line to discuss the company\u2019s results for the quarter are Nate Dalton, Chief Executive Officer and Jay Horgen, President and Chief Financial Officer.","With that, I will turn the call over to Nate.","Nate Dalton","Thanks Anjali and good morning everyone. I'd like to begin by congratulating Jay and thanking our shareholders, affiliate, employees and friends for your support over this past year. I\u2019ll cover the evolution of roles in a moment, but first, in terms of the quarter, AMG reported economic earnings per share of $3.26.","Our results for the quarter were inevitably impacted by the significant equity market declines in the fourth quarter of last year, leading to both a reduced, starting AUM for the quarter, and also a lower performance fee generation in the quarter, as beta sensitive products needed to make up their high watermark.","During the first quarter, however, the beta rally drove AUM higher recovering that lost ground for a subset of our performance fee product as our affiliates continue to build on a strong long term performance track record across many areas.","Turning to flow, we had net outflows of $7.4 billion in the first quarter, a significant improvement from the previous quarter. Flows are driven by expected, continued softness in our liquid alternatives and [Indiscernible] equity businesses, including 3.3 billion from two client redemption, neither of which was related to the affiliate performance.","In addition, during the quarter we continued to make progress executing on our investment strategy, and, as you saw in our separate release this morning, we were very pleased to announce the addition of Garda Capital Partners to our group of outstanding affiliate.","Looking ahead, we are very confident in our long term growth prospects, because first, we have actively positioned our business to focus on the attractive growth opportunities in alternative and distinctive equity.","Second, these are areas where boutiques have a proven ability to outperform, and where our affiliates have exceptional long term performance records across a broad range of product. Third, we are increasing the effective at bringing our affiliates diverse, distinctive, high quality returns stream, into a range of channels and geographies using our affiliate\u2019s distribution capability, AMGs global distribution effort and more recently through strategic relationships with capital allocators and intermediary.","Fourth, we have a complementary growth engine and new investments where we can add immediately sell the products through accretive investments and excellent new affiliates by Garda and fifth, we have a very strong balance sheet with the flexibility to advance our new investment pipeline while also continue to return capital to shareholders.","Now, let me spend a minute on a couple of these key drivers. First, the positioning of our business. Over the last decade, we have actively diversified our business across a range of growth opportunities. Our affiliates have high quality differentiated return streams across a broad set of distinctive equity and alternative products, which have attractive secular growth characteristics.","The leveraging themes like barbeling [ph] of client portfolios and erosion of home country buyer. In addition, these are areas where active asset managers and especially boutique have the ability to outperform.","Now in terms of specific product areas, our alternatives business now has approximately 300 billion in assets under management, making AMG one of the largest alternative managers in the world with one of the broadest and most diverse set of liquid and illiquid alternative strategy, managed by leading boutique investors.","In addition, our substantial exposure to uncorrelated alternative strategies should increase the stability and resilience of our business across market cycles, while, most importantly, proving attractive to clients, so increasing the long term organic growth potential of our business. While some of our liquid alternative products are going through a challenging period, others like relative value fixed income and global risk premium are doing well, and we're building on an increasingly large scale illiquid business across private equity, infrastructure, real assets and credit.","We've also built out a very diverse set of distinctive global equity strategy across both developed and emerging markets equity. Our affiliate\u2019s global equities products have excellent long term investment performance record with over 65% of our global equities ahead of benchmarks for the last five years.","Moreover, as leading clients worldwide and the intermediaries who serve them are consolidating their relationships with external managers and looking for more efficient relationships, and even partnership with a smaller number of investment management firm AMG, and our unique model are beginning to capitalize on this trend, as we can bring to bear the largest collection of independently managed distinctive returned schemes in the world to meet client needs.","As we discussed last quarter, we are making progress in formalizing some of these relationships, such as our strategic relationship with their asset management. While this is a relatively new initiative for AMG, we're making good progress toward launching our first wave of product this year. Additionally, this quarter we entered into our second strategic partnership, this time with an investment solutions provider focused on slightly different channels and geography. As of Nordea, together we will now work towards bringing our affiliates, distinctive return stream to their client base.","Turning next to the progress we're making investing in additional, high quality affiliate. As I noted earlier, today, we are pleased to announce our investment in Garda Capital Partner, a leading alternative investment manager specializing in fixed income, relative value strategies, with approximately 4 billion in assets under management.","Well known for differentiated strategy and a highly attractive asset class, distinctive return stream and outstanding long term investment track record across market cycle, Garda serves a diversified set of sophisticated institutional clients around the world.","We believe, they have excellent long term growth prospects and are very excited to partner with Jeff Rodney and his team. Now in addition to executing our investment in Garda, we continue to make very good progress actively developing our proprietary relationships with leading boutiques.","AMG\u2019s equity ownership succession solution is uniquely attractive to asset management boutiques that value their independent, wants a permanent partner and also access to the scale distribution platforms we felt.","Now, before I turn it over to Jay, I've been working on AMG for roughly a quarter century and this is something approaching 70 earnings calls for me. So I'd like to take a minute to talk about where we are today against the [Indiscernible] of that history.","While there's certainly some short term challenges, today, our business is stronger and more diverse than ever and we have more ways to drive growth than ever before. We benefit from the compounding of the asset classes we've invested in, asset classes where over time the blend has compounded the high single digit rate. In addition, we benefit from the excess return generated by our affiliate\u2019s products, which increases the rate at which the asset classes come from.","Add to that, growth from net sales, from existing and new product, geographies in general, as well as accretive investments and additional high quality affiliate which can add immediately to our earnings growth and bring saleable product which will not only further increase our growth rate from flows, but also increase in client engagement, which is good for the growth rate of all affiliate.","Then finally, we increased the growth in our shareholders experience through other capital allocation decisions it makes. This is basically the strategy we use to grow from a startup with an idea to become the permanent institutional partner of choice to the best boutiques in the world, and we\u2019ve executed on this idea over the last 25 years, across multiple markets cycles.","Beyond all of that, I'm incredibly confident in our ability to execute and continue to grow our business, and generate outstanding long term shareholder value, because of the great group of talented professionals with AMG. This includes both people who've grown up at AMG, but also the teammates that joined us over the last several years as we evolved the business, the level of talent and dedication is at an all-time high.","Now, turning to the evolution of role. As you saw in our release this morning, over the past year, we continue to execute on our long term succession plan. And today, we announce that Jay will succeed me as CEO. From the time Sean and I and others began building AMG from a true startup through today, AMG has been an important part of my life. This is not changing. I plan to remain on the company's board of directors and serve as an advisor to Jay and Sean and the rest of the senior team, focusing my time on relationships for our affiliate partner and in the industry as well as the strategic evolution of AMG.","We've always maintained short and medium term succession plans for AMG, as we do with our affiliate. Jay has been for well over a decade now an important part really a critical part of that plan. We thought Sean will serve as CEO for a number of years as we manage the evolution of our team, and over that time, Jay and an emerging group of the next generation of leaders would evolve into their role.","Of course, reality unfolded differently than we expected and when Sean was diagnosed with ALS, we implemented our contingency plan and role evolvement chapter. At that time, I agreed to serve as CEO while Sean continues to serve as our Executive Chairman.","We've all worked hard together since that day, Sean, myself many others, but no one more than Jay to accelerate achieving the milestones necessary to get the evolving team in place. I am very pleased with the progress we've made, and I'm happy to report that we've achieved those milestones, which is what allows us to be where we are today. And to be clear, while Jay has executed on a number of those milestones himself, a whole senior team has really stepped up into expanded role. And of course, Tom Wojcik joining us as CFO is a critical thing.","I was and am honored to serve as CEO for as long as necessary for all aspects of the long term succession plan to be in place. And sitting here today, I look forward to working with Sean, Jay and this team in my new role as an advisor and helping them as they lead AMG over the decades to come.","Now, before I turn the call over to Jay, I want to talk about him for a minute, and why I'm so confident that he is the right person to lead AMG forward at this moment. Of course, it's is experience that AMG over the last dozen years, running and overseeing various parts of our business from new investments, to finance and distribution, as well as his experiences as one of AMGs closest advisors over the decade before he joined. But it's more than that, and I'll speak personally here for a minute.","Jay has all of the traits needed to excel as AMG\u2019s CEO, and I've seen these demonstrated every day over many years. He has the intellect and curiosity to lead AMG\u2019s evolution in a very dynamic and rapidly evolving industry. He has the drive and passion not just for the AMG we've all built together, but also for the role of CEO and I fervently believe that he is the right person to lead the AMG management team forward over at least the next decade ahead.","With that, I congratulate you Jay in your role and let me turn to you one last time to talk more about the quarter.","Jay Horgen","Thank you, Nate. I\u2019m honored to have the opportunity to lead AMG as our next CEO. And I look forward to working with you in your ongoing role. I also want to take a moment to recognize Nate for the countless contribution he's made to the firm over his 25 years.","As AMG has grown from just an idea into a $775 billion global asset manager. From a personal perspective, I'm enormously grateful to both Nate and Sean for their support, guidance and partnership over the past 12 years and especially during this past year as my responsibilities have evolved.","In my new role, I look forward to continuing to work closely with our board, and Sean as executive chairman, as well as the rest of the senior management team, most of whom I've had the pleasure of working with for more than a decade, and many of whom I recruited to AMG.","This team shares with me, and with Sean and Nate, the entrepreneurial spirit and partnership orientation that has always defined AMGs culture, and I am confident in our ability to create significant shareholder value together in the years ahead.","Now, there are a number of themes I'll develop further. But let me first go through the details of the quarter. Turning to our flows by asset class and starting with alternatives, which account for 38% of our AUM, we reported outflows of $2.9 billion driven by our liquid alternative strategy and partially offset by positive contributions from illiquid product set.","The outflows in this category were largely driven by a single client redemption, which was not performance related. Our illiquid which includes strategies, such as global and regional private equity, co-investments, credit, real assets, infrastructure and real estate, generated another solid level of fundings in the quarter, and we continue to see a steadily growing opportunity in illiquid as our affiliates build further on existing and new product capability.","AMGs performance in this category is very strong with 91% of our recent vintages outperforming industry benchmarks on an IRR basis. Our liquid alternatives category comprises our multi strategy, systematic, diversified, fixed income and equity relative value strategy.","While our long term investment performance in this category remained strong with 59% of our assets under management outperforming their benchmark over a five year period, more recent performance in this area has been challenged, resulting in a decline in assets outperforming the benchmark and pressure on recent net flows. However, we believe strongly as these strategies play an important role in client portfolios and with our affiliate\u2019s broad array of high quality liquid alternative strategies we expect this category to be a meaningful, positive contributor to our long term organic growth profile over time.","Now turning to equities, which account for 49% of our AUM. In the global equities category, we saw net outflows of $3.4 billion in the quarter, driven primarily by quantitative global equity products, a meaningful portion of which was attributable to a partial redemption from a large pension client, which was also unrelated to performance.","AMG continues to generate strong, long term performance in this category with 66% of our assets under management ahead of benchmark over a five-year period, reflecting improving performance in the global equities category, generally, and particularly in our emerging market product.","Our affiliates in this category include some of the industry leading, global and emerging market managers such as Genesis, Harding Loevner, Tweedy Browne and Veritas all of which continued to have excellent competitive positioning.","In U.S. equities, we reported now outflows of $1.4 billion, a meaningful improvement over the fourth quarter. Given our value bias in this category, performance continues to be challenged with 38% of our strategy outperforming benchmarks on a five-year basis.","That said, volatility in the fourth quarter and early in the first quarter has led to an uptick in client demand resulting from the relative outperformance generated by our high quality fundamental equity managers in this period. We believe that clients will continue to seek these strategies especially value oriented products, given the risk adjusted benefits of holding these strategies to a full market cycle.","Turning to the multi asset and fixed income category, which accounts for 13% of our AUM and encompasses multi asset, balance mandates within our wealth management affiliates as well as a number of specially fixed income and multi asset product. Here, we posted $300 million in net inflows, primarily driven by wealth -- our wealth management business as well as our systematic fixed income products, which continue to generate good flow momentum.","Now turning to our financials. As you saw in the release, economic earnings per share decreased 17% to $3.26 for the first quarter, including $0.17 of net performance fees. On a GAAP basis, we reported an earnings per share loss of $3.87 reflecting the reduction in carrying value of the amount.","For the first quarter, aggregate fees decreased 24% to $1.3 billion from a year ago, and the ratio of aggregate fees to average assets under management declined year-over-year from 79 basis point to 65 basis point, in each case primarily driven by lower performance fee.","Adjusted EBITDA increased 25% to $215.6 million from a year ago, due to a number of factors including the timing and impact of negative markets at the very end of 2018, which resulted in lower performance fees and investment and other income at certain affiliates where we report on a one quarter lag.","In addition, we saw a lower contribution from certain of our equity method affiliates, which impacted EBITDA. It is worth noting that while the reduction of BlueMountain\u2019s carrying value during the quarter did not directly impact EBITDA given the non-cash nature of the expense, our first quarter EBITDA levels reflect the cost of BlueMountains repositioning, which we expect to continue for the next couple of quarters.","Relative to adjusted EBITDA, the smaller year-over-year declines and economic net income of 21% and economic earnings per share of 17% reflect lower taxes and lower year-over-year share count due to repurchase activity in the case of economic earnings per share.","Turning to more specific modeling items, for the first quarter, the ratio of adjusted EBITDA to average assets under management was 11.2 basis points. Excluding performance fees, this ratio was 10.6 basis points, which was negatively impacted by the factors I previously mentioned.","In the second quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA to average assets under management to be approximately 10.8 basis points reflecting seasonally low performance fees of $0.03 to $0.05 per share and the continued impact from BlueMountain\u2019s repositioning.","This ratio should improve in the second half of 2019 following the closing of Garda and as we see improvement in our equity method affiliate contribution. Our share of interest expense was $18.2 million for the first quarter, in the second quarter; we expect our share of interest expense to increase to approximately $20 million reflecting the full impact of our new junior subordinated bond.","Our share of reported amortization impairments was $459.8 million for the first quarter, including $438.2 million from affiliates accounted for under the equity method.","As you saw in the release, this included a $450 million non-cash expense related to the reevaluation of the amount. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect our share of reported amortization impairments to be approximately $48 million.","Turning to taxes; with regard to our tax rates in the first quarter, our effective GAAP tax rate was 24.4%. Given the impact of the non-cash expense, our cash tax rate was negative. For modeling purposes, we expect our GAAP and cash tax rate to be approximately 26% and 18% respectively.","Intangible related deferred taxes were negative $93.8 million in the first quarter, which was impacted by the non-cash item. For the second quarter, we expect intangible related deferred taxes to be approximately $11 million. Other economic items were $3.8 million for the first quarter. For modeling purposes, we expect other economic items to be approximately $1 million.","Our adjusted weighted average share count for the first quarter was $51.9 million and we expect it to be approximately $51.1 million for the second quarter reflecting a modest level of share repurchase.","Turning to our balance sheet, during the first quarter, we paid a $0.32 per share dividend repurchased $91 million and shares. In addition, we continue to position our balance sheet including the issuance of a 40-year $300 million bond, which extended duration of our debt to approximately 15 years and increased our capacity and flexibility to be able to capitalize on our new investment pipeline.","Thinking about new investments more broadly as Nate said, we are excited about our new partnership with Garda, a fixed income relative value specialist among the premiere firms in the state. With its very strong, near and long term performance track record, together with its positive flow momentum, Garda will be an immediately accretive transaction to our financial results upon closing early in the third quarter.","We expect economic earnings per share accretion from this transaction of approximately $0.20 on a full year basis, and expect to realize about half of that contribution to our financial results in calendar year 2019 given the midyear closing.","There is strong alignment between Garda's objectives, and AMG\u2019s partnership approach. The firm's cohesive management team, which has worked together since 1999 has a strong entrepreneurial, culture that they want to preserve and a goal to build an enduring multigenerational business.","Stepping back, as Nate and Sean recognized, from the very beginning all independent firms will inevitably face the need for a succession oriented partnership solution, and given AMG's competitive position along with the proprietary relationships we have been building over the past two decades, we have a unique opportunity to selectively invest in the highest quality firm such as Garda, and generate meaningful earnings growth over the long term.","In addition to Garda, we continue to see both good progress in our near-term pipeline as well as continued dialogue with longer term prospect. As always, we remain disciplined on both quality and pricing in our current pipeline reflects these attributes.","Taken together, this may lead to more modest share repurchases in the second quarter as we see our pipeline develop. And finally looking ahead, I am excited about AMG's future prospects as we continue to capitalize on our preeminent position as a partner of choice to the most highly regarded firms globally. The evolution in the asset management industry presents opportunities for us. Client appetite for truly differentiated independently managed return streams is enduring, and having invested in an outstanding group of affiliate partners over the past 25 years, AMG now has the world's most diverse array of independently managed differentiated strategy, a successful track record of offering this broad product set to clients globally in an efficient way, and an ability to add new capabilities to product development initiatives, both at AMG and at our affiliates, as well as through our new investment strategy.","We also have deep experience and expertise in, identifying high quality, independent growing businesses, structuring permanent partnerships with these firms through a unique approach that preserves the essential element of their ongoing success.","Aligning interests between AMG, our affiliates, and their clients and building strong enduring affiliate relationships over multiple generations. As we focus on these competitive strengths, consistent with our core principles of entrepreneurialism, alignment and long term orientation, I am confident that we will capitalize on the opportunities before us to broaden the scale, diversity and earnings power of our business, and generate long term shareholder value.","Now we're happy to answer your question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies.","Dan Fannon","Thanks. Good morning. I guess first, Nate, I wish you well in your new role and Jay, congrats on your extended role at the firm. I guess wanted to talk broadly about alternatives. If you could elaborate on BlueMountain and what\u2019s happening there? And if we think the kind of over the next kind of 12 months kind of the flow outlook for this category which is been such a big contributor to your firm over the last several years with performance at some of the products we can see at AQR still being challenged, as well as some of the changes you mentioned at BlueMountain. How we should think about the liquid component of this business over that time period?","Nate Dalton","Perfect. So, this is Nate. Maybe I\u2019ll start on BlueMountain and then I think Jay maybe will pick the other part of that question. So, look, on BlueMountain specifically I\u2019d say, look, fundamentally BlueMountain had some real core strength, certainly about \u2013 like their credit and volatility history. And over the last couple years they were diversifying the business along with some industry trends that building out infrastructure, but recent performance especially the first quarter\u2019s performance was really challenging and that was impact just -- not just on kind of performance fees, but also on some of the track record which has the impact on both client and also on kind of forward outlook for some of those clients.","And so, the current client base, but those track record and some of the products and capabilities makes it kind of not feasible to sustain, I think if that infrastructure kind of it\u2019s activated. So this is really I think for them an issue of -- and we agree an issue of focusing on those really outstanding core strength. I think maybe on the alts [ph] more generally, why we\u2019re very strong believers maybe I\u2019ll turn to Jay.","Jay Horgen","Yes. Thanks Dan. So, starting with the quarter, the quarter I think we had expected the flows to be about where they are. We did have some lumpy outflows from two different client transition unrelated performance, but your question to the liquid alts in particular I do think that we have a really diverse great set of products there. We do think that long-term client need these products in their portfolio. They add both diversity and to the correlation aspect of the portfolio. So, the long-term demand trend in place.","I think we need our way through the sort of near term performance challenges. There are bright spots and there are certainly some products that are doing quite well. And so, we do think that the arc of that is the return to long-term positive growth. I would take the opportunity to highlight a couple of other important elements of sort of low-profile that are quite strong. Obviously, the continued illiquid private equity funding continue; we still see extension and innovation coming from our illiquid managers and we see that long-term growth profile enduring.","We've also had an uptick in demand for our U.S. fundamental equity managers especially in the fourth quarter, in the first part of this past quarter where volatility picked up and the value of those managers and the portfolio became clear that we did see an uptick in demand there. We have improving performance in emerging market. We have improving performance generally in global equities. These all give us reason to be optimistic about the medium and long-term flow profile.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Shutler","Hey, guys. Good morning and congrats, Jay. I want to ask about Garda. And so maybe you could just talk about Garda. How it fits into the investment philosophy a little bit more. I know it\u2019s reasonably a smaller at this point. But how does it fit in regarding your comments previously around more entrepreneurial management teams and maybe talk about any ambitions they had moved beyond to fixed income relative value? Thanks.","Jay Horgen","Yes. Thanks, Chris. So far \u2013 first, as you\u2019ve heard in both Nate and my prepared remarks we\u2019re excited to welcome Garda, Jeff Drobny and his the entire management team there. We think that this partnership is exactly what we are looking for. We remained very focused on both quality and alignment, as well as making sure we\u2019re disciplined on pricing and I think new partnership has reflects all of those elements of what we\u2019re looking for.","Garda is a great firm. High quality, relative value, fixed-income, specialist, exceptional track record for over 15 years, very low correlation to traditional indices. As you said, the business is small but not that small, actually 4 billion with really strong flow momentum and the capacity to grow. It\u2019s highly rated. We\u2019ve seen substantial appetite from institutions for fixed income relative value. Importantly, I think the firm has its strong entrepreneurial and investment centric culture. The long tenured management team committed to building and enduring franchise over multiple generations.","I also would just note that this opportunity is unique for us. The business was started in 1999 and for 15 years it was within cargo. Therefore not open to external capital. As the business came out of cargo we\u2019ve seen substantial growth in clients and this is an example of our -- the benefits of our proprietary calling effort allows us to partner with Garda at this point in this growth cycle. And then second on pricing, as you heard me say, we do see $0.20 of run rate accretion or 2019 accretion and growing half of that in 2020, half of that in 2019 or about $0.10 for the back half of this year.","It is a meaningful EBITDA contribution if you work your way through the math you\u2019ll find to that\u2019s in the neighborhood of $15 million of EBITDA. The partnership is structured as the minority interest revenue share and it will go through kind of our equity method line items, the deal from pricing perspective within our 8 to 10 times EBITDA range, but really at the low end of that. So I think here again both on quality pricing and alignment we\u2019re very excited about this partnership.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Craig Siegenthaler","Thanks. Good morning everyone. First, Jay, just congrats on the new role, well deserve.","Jay Horgen","Thanks Craig.","Craig Siegenthaler","So, my question is actually on the new investment pipeline, a follow-up to the last one. But if you look at what is inside the pipeline today, is it mostly smaller businesses like Garda? Or is it also has some larger businesses potentially multi-manager platforms that could provide larger EPS accretion opportunities from AMG shareholders?","Jay Horgen","Yes. So, I think as you heard me say, Craig that we\u2019re quite optimistic about the progress we\u2019re making on our near term pipeline, obviously we are in the relationship building business over long-term. We\u2019ve had good dialogue more broadly. Let me backup then I\u2019ll come back your specific question. We see the M&A market today as being pretty active. I think we\u2019ve seen lots of different types of transactions in the market including both larger transactions and transactions like Garda. And specifically on some of the larger consolidated transaction, in general we do think that those are difficult to execute particularly those that are focused predominantly on cost-saving. Of course that is not what we do.","We have unique business model that puts us in a position where we can through the successful execution of our new investment strategy obtain to benefits of scale that accrue in a strategic transaction without having to integrate. I think that\u2019s really important aspect of our ability to scale whether it's a series of midsize firms or larger firms. We have the ability to scale without having to go through a year or two integration project where at the end of it is unclear exactly how much you ultimately save, so very excited about our ability to grow through new investments whether they\u2019re midsize or larger firms.","I would also say that the transition of or succession planning of firms is inevitable. As you heard me say that\u2019s what John and Nate identified 25 years ago and we\u2019re still capitalizing on the demographic trends that do occur in the firm. We are very good at partnerships at AMG, both the organizational aspects of it, as well as the alignment aspect of it and the technical aspect of it. And I think that is going to be -- a reason why we\u2019re going to continue to be able to execute on the market opportunity as succession planning needs surface at managers.","In terms of the size and the complexion of our current pipeline, but we have good diversity in our pipeline. I would describe it generally as global which include emerging and alternative firms in that pipeline. It does range from midsize to larger. I do think that the bar on larger transaction is higher given the importance of making sure that you price it right. And I would also just note that on pricing generally in the private markets we\u2019re seeing finally pricing come down in the private market. But the lag I guess relative to the public market, but we do think that we are able to execute it on the lower half of our sort of general pricing range of 8 to 10 times in this market. So we\u2019re very excited about the opportunity ahead of us and we feel like we will see more new investment activity over the year and the medium term.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Bill Katz","Okay. Thank you very for taking the questions and congratulations to everybody. So just sort of staying on the theme of big picture, Jay, just as you sort of see the evolution of the asset management business, do you see any evolution of AMG strategy to sort of realign it anyway to tend to accelerate organic growth beyond the acquisition related opportunities?","Jay Horgen","Thanks Bill. Look, our industry is evolving. We acknowledge and we embrace it. It presents opportunities for us and capitalizing effectively on these opportunities will require us to focus on our strength. First and foremost, we want to be the partner of choice to the most highly regarded independent firms globally. We think we\u2019ve accomplished that over our 25-year history and we\u2019re going to continue to do that. I think as you know everyone on the phone know that Sean, Nate and I have all been united in our entrepreneurial spirit. In this way and our focused on excellent execution in order to do grow shareholder value; this will not change.","The element of our strategy will continue on at the highest level building strong relationships with our affiliates to maintain them across generation. We want to enhance our affiliates growth prospects and leverage scale in efficient ways. We want to find new affiliates, new prospect that are not only earnings accretive but also business accretive and adding new products and new channels and new geographies as we do so, that powerful combination to create shareholder value, and as we said or as I said, a moment ago we see in our current pipeline the ability to make it new investment. We do have deep experience in these partnerships. We also have built excellent relationships in our industry. And today we have the most diverse array of return stream by independently managed -- asset managers independently owned firm.","And so, when you look forward you say with that portfolio of pipeline relationships and new investment the world\u2019s most diverse array of independently manage differentiated strategies and reputation of being an excellent partner. And finally a team that has the right orientation, skill set, I think we will as we also have on this forward prospects; notwithstanding the evolving market we will evolve with it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your question.","Patrick Davitt","Good morning. Thank you. Given the market move quarter to-date, is it fair to say that your view of where yearend performance fees could come out \u2013 have come up quite a bit in terms of where you are versus high watermarks?","Nate Dalton","Thanks Patrick. Yes. So, well, let me just take a step back. As of last Friday our market blend was up about 2% on the year which is kind of across all of our exposures and that profile I would say, is consistent with our normal market convention. As it \u2013 so just to answer to your specific question I would say, there really hasn\u2019t been a change in our view of sort o longer term range that we gave out on performance fees mainly because it's still early in the year and the progression is consistent with what we would expect for our model of convention. That said, we have regained quite a bit of ground on high watermarks, in some cases we've gone over high watermarks, and so we are making good progress along the way to that goal.","You would note that we do have seasonality in that performance fee opportunity. We experienced $0.17 in this quarter and we have highlighted kind of guidance of $0.03 to $0.05 in the second quarter and then it typically goes down to a couple of pennies, call it $0.01 to $0.03 in the third quarter. So it's really the fourth quarter where we see the bulk of our performance fee opportunities seasonally. And I think when you pull that all together we're still in that $0.50 to $0.0150 range on top of the performance fees that we'll experience in the first three quarters. So that is consistent. But I would say on balance we feel good about the performance fee opportunity because of the recent uptick in market.","And then the last thing I would say is, with the addition of Garda in the second half of the year both our ratios of EBITDA to average assets under management, but also our cash flows and the opportunity to earn performance fees have all been increased by the addition of Garda.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Alex Blostein","Hey, good morning guys. Just a quick question around the AUM disclosure you put out. If you look at the other bucket within the total role forward that seems like it's becoming a bigger negative number over the last couple of quarter. I think it was over 6 billion this quarter. Can you expand a little bit beyond what's in the footnote? Just kind of where it's coming from or any sort of EBITDA impact that is associated with that, that would be helpful? Thanks.","Jay Horgen","Yes. It's a very simple answer. In the quarter -- at the very beginning of the quarter I think we've probably made the announcement in January and I think we've talked about it briefly on the last call. Clarfeld, we sold Clarfeld in a transaction and so it's really just the removal of their AUM coming out of our table. We did remove -- we did generate a small profit on Clarfeld, but as it comes out of our financial that has to come out of our AUM and that's really the point on other. And I'll just say more generally on the \u2013 say, the distribution, the realization that was a normal quarter for us and I think we've only been reporting this way for about a year but that just seems like a normal quarter on that basis as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Bedell","Great. Thanks and congrats Jay as well, well deserve. Maybe just to ask you another one on the outlook for deals; obviously you guys as you've been making new investments over a long time frame, fixed income has been one area where you really haven't done a ton relative to some other alternatives. Maybe, Jay relative to the past do you have a sort of a view over the next say five plus years that fixed income might become a bigger part of that deal activity?","And then also if you can comment on what you view as your capacity for deals over the next couple of years and would you prioritize that over stock buyback given the deal pipeline that you're currently seeing?","Jay Horgen","Okay. Thanks, Brian. So you\u2019ve asked a few things in there so if I can take them off. Hopefully I'll remember them. On fixed income generally I would say that we are -- I think we're interested in fix income. We like the differentiated strategies within fixed income, the kind of core kind of bond U.S. and global. The first thing I would note is there's very few independently sort of boutique still management owned businesses out there. There are few and I think we would have an interest in the highest quality of those firms. So, you just don't see them exist partly because it is a tremendous scale business and number of them are owned by large kind of conglomerate type firms or scaled organization.","I would also say that that's a tougher business and it use to be a tough business. So we like differentiated fixed income strategy than we will look to make new investments in those types of businesses. As it relates to -- in general what we're looking for in new investments. Look, we want to stay close to what clients are looking for in their portfolios long term. We \u2013 I think we've always been good at using our information both from our existing affiliates as well as from our global distribution staying close to clients and understanding long term demand trends. And so that is why we're interested in differentiated fixed income and we're different. We're interested in a number of other businesses that are involved in kind of long term cyclical trends within client portfolios. So that is our kind of forward look on how we think about new investments and where we are prospecting.","As it relates to capacity, look, we did some balance sheet positioning. I appreciate the question because I don't think we highlighted it enough in the quarter. We did a $300 million for 40-year bond that allows us to think long term about our new investment pipeline, but it also gave us additional capacity as we pay down our revolver which is a significant revolver, over $1.2 billion revolver that we can execute new investments and therefore we have lots and lots of capacity to do new investment. The other thing I would say is in the quarter we did repurchase 91 million in shares. As I said, we're going to see how this pipeline develops. We would imagine doing a more modest amount of repurchases in this quarter. Although that will be dependent upon the timing of our near-term pipeline as well as just market conditions, so we'll continue to think about that.","As far as a priority goes; yes, our first priority is to invest in new businesses and new initiatives at our affiliates that will generate long term value for our shareholders. But along the way we will maintain a capital allocation model that returns capital to shareholders when we are not investing in those initiatives, of course making sure that we are appropriately balancing the risks of our balance sheet against the forward opportunity.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi guys. This is actually Sean on for Mike. Just given the tougher organic growth trends to start the year, do you guys still expect the flow picture to improve and hit that 2% organic growth by the end of 2019?","Jay Horgen","So yes, let me let me take and if Nate, you want to add to this, please do. As we described in our prepared remarks and I said earlier, we do see the long-term trends in place to be at that 2% level over the medium to long-term. The elements of how we get there and the timing of it will in part depend on performance in liquid alts. I think as it relates to the other aspects of our business illiquids global equities, emerging markets and U.S. equities we are seeing uptick in both performance and in some cases demand for those products. I think illiquids alts were moving through a period of near term performance challenges and as we move through that period we need to see those stabilized before I think we can feel confident that the timing is in front of us with respect to when the 2% occurs.","That said, look, there's quite a bit of good things going on underlying in our business. As I\u2019d mentioned these other upticks in demand really could outweigh any of the performance, challenges we're having in illiquids alts also therefore it's hard to know exactly the timing of that. We do expect over the medium term noted to see that 2% number being a reasonable growth rate for our business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Robert Lee with KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Lee","Great. Thank you. And congratulations Jay and best of luck on the [Indiscernible]. I guess my first question is if we think of the outlook this quarter and kind of what -- maybe what seem to be on track over the near term. Is the -- just trying to get a feel if the economic impact of the flows is reflective of kind of the growth outflows we're seeing and if organic growth was like minus 1% in this quarter. Is that a reasonable proxy kind of EBITDA impact?","Jay Horgen","So, it's a good question. I would actually -- as you have -- you have even written on there is a bit of disconnect between the metric of flows and EBITDA. I would say for us, it's particularly challenging because it depends on not only what assets are raised but the ownership of the underlying affiliate, so that's really the equation. I think what I would point you to is the EBITDA to average AUM. I made some comments around that in my prepared remarks. It has been impacted recently for us by both performance fees and the mix shift, but also the cost of repositioning BlueMountain.","When you look forward this year we do see that that ratio which is a bit of a profitability ratio for us improving \u2013 it\u2019s improving because we see that those costs abate, we see a return of performance fees and we see the addition of Garda, so all of those things should lead to an increasing kind of ratio there. That is a ratio to track for us. It has come down over time, but it's come down as much from just the mix of the overall business and that can easily go back the other way and very well could in the near term.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your question.","Patrick Davitt","Thanks. I just wanted to confirm that the BlueMountain repositioning is just the 1 billion sleeve the press has mentioned or is there something broader going on?","Nate Dalton","Yes. So, look I think it's the -- the business is meeting the market opportunity and therefore that is one element of repositioning. I do think that all of the -- the cost of that is in our first quarter EBITDA, and is in our forward outlook and the one thing I would say is that, none of that had anything to do with the actual book. I should say that the impact on a current basis in our financial statements, the non-cash charge is really a historical look at the purchase price that we pay and that is just being revalued. I would also note that we've had reevaluation events, such as Value Act where we've seen significant growth thereafter and therefore you can't write these businesses, but GAAP [ph] does not allow you to write businesses up. So there is some asymmetry to what's going on here other than the experience that we have in our current EBITDA. The write-down itself is not -- does not tell the future. And the asymmetry is really you can't recognize the gain GAAP only requires you write down assets.","The other thing is worth noting is we have a portfolio of investment across lots of different strategies. The sum of all those investments, they are significantly above their carrying value. Frankly, the sum of all of our equity methods are significantly above the carrying value, and again you can't offset any portfolio effect from any one or any one investment.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Lee","Yes. Hi. This is just a simple real bottom question, Jay. But did you -- I think I may have missed it. You mentioned the performance fee contribution in the quarter?","Jay Horgen","Yes. It was $0.17 in the quarter. That is similar to the fourth quarter and it's down from the first quarter. So, when you look at a year-over-year it's down. And that's mainly because if you remember we have a one quarter lag in a number of affiliate to generate performance fees. And so if you think about what happened the fourth quarter those affiliates were impacted by that one quarter lag which we're just now reporting in this quarter. That's really the reason for the drop-off from the first quarter of last year to this year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Shutler","Hi. Thanks for taking the follow-up. I just want to go back to your comment in the prepared remarks about a new distribution relationship on investment solutions provider. Just any more detail you can provide there on how big this company is? What strategies you think will fit and timing?","Nate Dalton","Sure. So, just -- this is Nate. Just to level set for a second. So, the easiest kind of framework to think about it and the trajectory is the way we've talked about in Nordea, starting I guess a couple quarters ago which is if you sort of step back, pick up on what Jay said, we have the world's most diverse array of independent and largest array of independently managed fund streams and so the challenges how do you and the opportunity is how do you take that set of returns stream and efficiently get it into the right client portfolios, right? And it's not just necessarily just product, its returning streams.","And so what we're doing in each of these settings as we're finding what we believe are partners who really understand it. We think of them as channel partners, partners who really understand that there was the first example. We've been building out the infrastructure and there's still a little bit of work to do. But building up the infrastructure to efficiently get our affiliates or transferring into their portfolios and to efficiently understand the dynamics of their client base and the demand trends.","So that\u2019s what we have done in the \u2013 in the end. And I think as we said we're in the back half of this year going to begin launching our product together it's going through the regulatory process right now, plunging price, the other bringing our affiliate manufacturing together with their packaging and distribution into the places, channel, geographies where they're exceptionally strong, right.","For that kind of that relationship, this is as we alluded to in our prepared remarks, different channel, different geographies. So, not kind of an overlapping footprint at all. And, also more institutional and retail when I think about the -- I think of channels.","So, so we're going through that same process. We have conceptual agreement. We're working through which of our affiliates products, which of our first return streams that may not be expressed as product, are particularly appropriate for the portfolio they're building, and are going to be able to be used efficiently by them. We're beginning to work on the infrastructure to get the information about the demand, characteristics that they see in their client base. So, starting that you're kind of a joint product development on this concept together. And there are a few other places with this one where it's not able to name it, but this one where we're able to work on some things together.","So it's really I\u2019ll go back to a point Jay made, which is it's really focused on the things that that we have a real competitive strength, and one is clearly we have this array of independently managed with extraordinary return streams and how do we get those especially in my portfolio.","But one last thing I\u2019ll say and this is -- we really do now have three ways that we're doing this. One is, each of our affiliates has their distribution. We with AMG have our global distribution, and we're now building this sort of channel partnerships to get that raise again efficiently, and these are all very complementary ways to choose product and play into some of things Jay talked about in terms of evolution in the industry, and clients desire to concentrate in the last intermediary desires to concentrate relationships and get for their own purposes, get returns into their client portfolio efficiently.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question and answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Horgen for any final comments.","Jay Horgen","Thank you all again for joining us this morning. As you heard, we are confident in our prospects for significant long term growth. We have built a diverse business, which includes some of the highest quality independent firms in the industry with established, long term track records of outperformance across a wide array of investment strategy.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ally Lynn, Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Investor Relations for Affiliated Managers Group. Thank you Ms. Lynn. You may begin.","Alexandra Lynn","Thank you for joining AMG to discuss our results for the third quarter of 2013. In this conference call, certain matters discussed will constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those referenced in the company's Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.","AMG will provide on its website, at www.amg.com, a replay of the call and a copy of our announcement of our results for the quarter as well as the reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.","With us on the line to discuss the company's results for the quarter are Sean Healey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Nate Dalton, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Jay Horgen, Chief Financial Officer.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Sean Healey.","Sean M. Healey","Thanks, Ally, and good morning, everyone. AMG reported economic earnings per share of $2.19 for the third quarter of 2013, which is a 15% increase over the same period of 2012. Our earnings growth was driven by continued momentum across our business as our Affiliates outstanding long-term track records and a broad array of U.S., global and emerging market equity and alternative products continue to attract investors worldwide.","We generated over $10 billion in net client cash flows in the third quarter, our 14th consecutive quarter of strong positive flows. This outstanding organic growth reflects the quality of our boutique Affiliates and the ongoing impact of our strategic focus on alpha-generating equity and alternative products. More and more clients view specialist firms as the best alpha generators in these product areas and Affiliates such as Yacktman and TimesSquare in U.S. equities; Tweedy, Browne; Genesis; Harding Loevner; and Artemis among global and emerging market equity managers and Pantheon, ValueAct, BlueMountain, First Quadrant and AQR among alternative managers are all recognized as leaders in their respective disciplines.","Looking ahead, given retail and institutional investors' increasing emphasis on alpha-generating strategies to complement passive beta, we believe that firms such as our Affiliates with their excellent long-term track records of investment performance will continue to generate strong organic growth. And as you've heard us say before, given our focus on active equity and alternative products in a rising rate environment, AMG will experience neither the drag of fixed income outflows nor the depreciation in value of fixed income products.","AMG's industry-leading organic growth also reflects the continued success of our global distribution strategy, which complements Affiliate level marketing efforts with the leverage of AMG's scale, enhancing the distribution capabilities of our Affiliates across channels and geographies.","With the opportunities that we see for our Affiliates to gather new business around the world, we are continuing to build out our global distribution platform, including the recent addition of 2 senior professionals to deepen our European coverage. The investments we've been making in our global distribution platform continue to yield strong results as evidenced by new mandates generated in every one of our covered regions during the quarter, and as in prior quarters, flows broadly distributed across all product areas and channels.","In addition, as Nate will describe, we see substantial opportunities for incremental growth in the U.S. retail channel and are continuing to broaden our capabilities in this area. Finally, we're making good progress in the new investments area with a notable acceleration in activity during the quarter. As always, we will remain disciplined in our approach and while it's impossible to predict the precise timing and execution of transactions, our market position has never been stronger and we're confident that we will continue to meaningfully enhance our earnings growth through accretive investments in new Affiliates going forward.","With that, I'll turn it to Nate to discuss our Affiliates results in greater detail.","Nathaniel Dalton","Thanks, Sean. Good morning, everyone. As you saw in the release, we had another quarter of very strong growth, with our assets under management now over $500 billion, which includes positive flows of $10 billion for the quarter. Over the past 14 consecutive quarters, our consistently strong net client cash flows, especially into active equity and alternative strategies, have been in contrast to broad industry trends over most of that period, which have favored fixed income and passive products. These past 2 quarters, we've seen a rotation begin out of fixed income products. During that period, industry flows into equities and alternatives have been mixed while our strong flow trends on the other hand continued. As Sean said, clients are continuing to move to focused performance-oriented managers for the alpha portions of their portfolios and our Affiliates remain well-positioned to attract meaningful flows going forward.","Turning to investment performance for the quarter. We had strong performance for many of our larger Affiliates, and especially, in the global and emerging markets equities and alternative areas. Starting with the global developed markets category. Against the backdrop of rising equity markets generally, our Affiliates generated good investment performance. Highlights for the quarter include strong performance from significant products at Artemis, Harding Loevner and Trilogy while Tweedy Browne with its deep value strategy, not surprisingly, lagged in such a sharply rising market, however, their long-term track records remain very good. In the emerging markets category, our Affiliates have very strong relative investment performance, and track records for the full year and longer periods remain excellent. In fact, all of the major products managed by AQR, Genesis and Harding Loevner, are well ahead of their respective benchmarks for the quarter, 1-, 3- and 5-year periods.","Turning to our alternatives product category. We have a broad suite of strategies, many of which are not correlated with the equity markets. In the quarter, many of our Affiliates' most significant products and strategies as diverse as quantitative multi-strat, relative value, illiquid asset, credit, active value and arbitrage products performed very well. This includes high-quality products AQR, BlueMountain, ValueAct, First Quadrant and Pantheon. While the year is not over, given the outstanding performance of a number of our alternative products, we are well-positioned to generate additional, meaningful performances this year.","Turning to our U.S. equity products. We had a mixed quarter on the performance side, with Yacktman underperforming, while Frontier Capital, Systematic and GW&K had a very strong quarter, with outstanding performance across their respective suites of equity products.","Now turning to flows for the quarter. As I said, we had another very good quarter with $10.1 billion in positive net client cash flows. While flow momentum continue to be strong, as we emphasize on every call, flows, especially in the institutional and sub-advisory channels, are inherently lumpy.","Turning to the channel review and starting with the institutional channel. We had positive flows with approximately $4.9 billion. These flows came primarily in global and emerging markets products and alternative strategies, including notable contributions from BlueMountain, Pantheon, Harding Loevner, AQR, ValueAct, Trilogy and First Quadrant. Similar to previous quarters, we had a number of high-quality wins coming from leading institutions located around the world.","Moving to the mutual fund channel. We had positive flows of $4.9 billion. From a product category standpoint, we had strong flows in the U.S. equities, as well as global and alternative strategies. The breakdown of flows in this channel was also very broad as we had a number of Affiliates make significant contributions, including AQR, Artemis, Harding Loevner, Tweedy Browne, Aston, Beutel Goodman, and Yacktman.","In our high net worth channel, flows are about $250 million for the quarter. The most significant contributors were Harding Loevner and BlueMountain, as well as 2 of our AMG wealth partners Affiliates, Veritable and Clarfeld. Of course, we were very pleased to recently welcome Rob Clarfeld and his team to our Affiliate group.","Finally, turning to an update of our distribution platforms, which complement our Affiliates' dedicated marketing efforts. We continue to generate strong flows among a diverse set of products and across geographies. Looking forward, our basic approach remains the same. We will continue to make strategic investments in regions and channels where institutions and intermediaries pick the investment expertise of boutique firms, such as our Affiliates, which are focused on truly differentiated, return-oriented investment disciplines.","To that end, we continue to selectively enhance our regional coverage with senior sales and marketing professionals while we also expand into new channels in the geographies where we currently operate and make progress in identifying additional geographies for future expansion. In the third quarter, we announced the new European distribution head to lead our team of regional and country specialists who work on behalf of AMG Affiliates across Europe. And in the fourth quarter, we will also add a new senior professional dedicated to selling Affiliate products in the Benelux region.","Finally, as we mentioned last quarter, we remain focused on the significant additional opportunities we see in the U.S. retail market, while still maybe early, we've begun to see the rotation of investors out of fixed income. And looking ahead, we continue to see a significant opportunity for active, return-oriented products as investors will have no other way to meet their investment goals. We are already investing in growing and scaling our U.S. retail platform and are very pleased with the strong flows we're generating.","However, we see opportunities to further build scale, and in particular, to leverage the AMG brand into our Retail business. Of course, this is still early in the process because we think about how we build our global institutional business and use the AMG brand to establish a very successful platform, we believe we can capture a similar opportunity in U.S. retail. Fundamentally, as we look ahead, we see increasing global demand for performance-oriented products managed by boutique firms, such as our Affiliates, which are focused on truly differentiated, return-oriented investment disciplines, and we're confident we can continue to generate strong organic growth.","With that, I'll turn to Jay to discuss our financials.","Jay C. Horgen","Thank you, Nate. As Sean and Nate discussed, our third quarter results, which included another quarter of outstanding organic growth again demonstrated the strength and diversity of the earnings power of our business. As you saw on the release, we reported economic earnings per share of $2.19 for the third quarter with net performance fees contributing $0.04. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings of $1.37 for the quarter. Turning to more specific modeling items. The ratio of our EBITDA contribution end of period assets under management was approximately 15.4 basis points in the third quarter. We expect this ratio to be approximately 19.9 basis points in the fourth quarter, reflecting a reasonable assumption for performance fees. And for 2014, we expect this ratio to be approximately 16.6 basis points.","Holding company expenses were $25 million in the third quarter, and we expect them to be approximately $30 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting year-end expenses before returning to a normalized $25 million per quarter. In regard to our taxes, our effective GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 29.6%, primarily as a result of a further decrease in the U.K. tax rate, which is expected to be the final U.K. tax rate decrease. And our cash tax rate was 30.6% as a result of higher pre-tax earnings and the retirement of our senior convertible securities.","For modeling purposes, we expect our GAAP tax rate to return to 36% and our cash tax rate to be approximately 28%. Intangible-related deferred taxes for the quarter were $5.2 million, also as a result of the U.K. tax rate change. We expect this number to return to approximately $14 million for the fourth quarter and to increase to approximately $15 million per quarter in 2014. Our share of reported amortization for the quarter was $27.8 million and together with $10.4 million of amortization from Affiliates accounting for under the equity method, AMG's controlling interest portion of amortization was $38.2 million. We expect AMG's amortization to decrease to approximately $34 million in the fourth quarter and with a further reduction to approximately $30 million per quarter in 2014.","Our interest expense for the third quarter was $23.8 million, including $3.9 million of pretax noncash imputed interest expense. For the fourth quarter, we expect our total interest expense to decrease to approximately $22 million, including $2.7 million of pretax noncash imputed interest.","Turning to our balance sheet. As we discussed on last quarter's call, as part of our ongoing effort to simplify our balance sheet and reduce our cost to capital, we retired our senior convertibles using cash and revolver. In addition, given the increasing opportunity we see in the new investments area, we will continue to focus on maintaining ample capacity and flexibility in our capital structure.","Now turning to guidance. We are raising our 2013 guidance as we expect economic earnings per share to be in the range of $9.30 to $9.80. And for 2014, we expect economic earnings per share to be in the range of $10.50 to $11.70. Our guidance assumes our normal convention of actual market performance through yesterday for the current quarter and 2% quarterly market growth beginning in the first quarter of 2014. We also assume a weighted average share count of approximately 55.5 million for the fourth quarter and for the next year.","The lower end of our guidance range includes a modest incremental contribution from performance fees and organic growth, while the upper end of the range assumes a more robust contribution from both performance fees and net client cash flows. As always, these assumptions do not include earnings from future new investments and are based on our current expectations of Affiliate growth rates, performance and the mix of Affiliate contribution to our earnings. Of course, substantial changes in markets and earnings contribution of our Affiliates would impact these expectations.","Now we will be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I guess, Sean, to start with you just on the deal front. I guess what has changed or makes you a little bit more bullish about the commentary for activity or your pipeline today versus where we were 3 months ago or at other points in time?","Sean M. Healey","Well, I think the changes, as I said, an increase in acceleration in the level of new investment inquiry and opportunity. Why is that occurring now? I think it's not a surprise that given the market environment, given the number of perspective Affiliates for us, given the extent and success of our calling effort that we're seeing some opportunities, inevitably though they tend to come in waves and we may be seeing one such wave now. The opportunity set is partly probably driven by a positive market, partly driven by idiosyncratic considerations, which is always the hardest thing to assess and predict. It includes firms that are -- and transaction opportunities that are relationship-driven, which is of course the core of our new investment strategy. But also includes organized processes, which cover the spectrum, including independent firms that have chosen to hire an investment banker to manage a potential sale process as well as some divestitures. As I mentioned in our prepared remarks, as always, we will be disciplined and selective in our approach. And so no specific predictions beyond just giving you that broader color.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And just, I guess, to follow up on that, is there any specific type or focus of the backlog that appears to be more realistic, whether it'll be alternatives, still the global theme, U.S. or is it generally just broad?","Sean M. Healey","I think it's actually quite broad-based. I mean, of course, our focus, as you know, is on return-oriented products, emphasizing global and emerging market equity and alternatives although quite willing to invest where we see an opportunity to partner with an outstanding firm like Yacktman, for example, in U.S. equities. So no, it's quite broad-based and consistent with our overall business strategy in terms of products we want to focus on.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And just one follow-up, Jay, quickly, what was the end-of-period share count as of the third quarter?","Jay C. Horgen","So on a -- on an economic basis, it was -- in the third quarter, it was 55.6 million. And so the share count guidance that we've given you is 55.5 million fourth quarter and next year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Kim with Sandler O'Neill.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Just first, based on some commentary that we've been hearing from some other firms and some real-time data we've seen across the industry more recently, it does seem like retail investors are starting to move up the risk curve to your point earlier. So just given the fact that a lot of your flows over the last few years have gone into global and emerging market equities, as well as alternative strategies, do you see any sort of rotation risks assuming investors start to come back to more traditional U.S. equity strategies? Or do you think that sort of shift is really sort of just incremental to flows?","Sean M. Healey","Well, I think the global institutional client base, which is the dominant portion of our current and prospective clients, is -- continues to be focused on global and emerging market equities. I think certainly there will be opportunities for U.S. equities. I wouldn't necessarily say that we see the trend reversing. I think that big opportunity that Nate and I have talked about is -- that is incremental, is in U.S. retail. And there, I think that you will see some continuation of what we think is an enduring trend, the erosion of home country bias and the opportunity to invest in fast-growing emerging markets. I think what we've seen in terms of the market beta performance for the year suggests that the opportunity is probably greater in the markets that have performed less well, that's obviously not always how investors perform or behave. I think we have a very broad product set, and our position to be ahead of the main trend, which is rerisking, which is separating alpha and beta and moving both in institutional but also in retail toward the firms that generate true alpha. So we remain quite confident, and whatever the trends within the trend are, I think the broad focus on rerisking and return-oriented alpha-generating products plays very well to our product set.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then a question on performance fees. So it sounds like the near-term outlook remains constructive, particularly as the diversity across Affiliates strategies and structures continues to improve. If I look at the performance fee contributions as a percentage of total earnings, it's pretty much been at the high-end of sort of the 5% to 10% range over the last 4 years, which has obviously been a pretty volatile market backdrop. So understanding the inherent difficulty in trying to predict performance fees going forward and wanting to be conservative in terms of what you build into your outlook, just wondering if it's reasonable to think that you've reached a new level here in terms of the level of contributions and maybe the consistency of those earnings?","Jay C. Horgen","So Mike, I'll just -- I'll get to sort of the punchline in just a second. I think you're right to say that our performance fee opportunity continues to grow and diversify and it's across the product and it's across structures. This year, we've already booked with the $0.04 in this quarter, $0.44, so we like to say a typical year is a 5% to 10% contribution to our earnings. So you will note that we're already close to the 5% range. And then as you heard Nate say, we are having a good year in both absolute and relative performance and kind of assuming no change with that, we would have the potential for additional meaningful contribution in the fourth quarter. So this does feel like a pretty good year. I think as you look forward to the 2014 guidance though, I think we would still imagine just a typical year because it's -- there's no reason to assume it won't be a typical year and that we'd still be in that 5% to 10% range, but of course, when you get into next year, we'll reflect on whether that's a better-than-average year.","Sean M. Healey","And the absolute level performance fee earnings, of course, is rising but it's rising in the context of an overall strong level of earnings growth by -- in the rest of our business and so -- as well as the opportunity to get earnings accretion from investments in new Affiliates. So I think the proportionate relationship can confuse the overall opportunity is very large. Nate, why don't you talk a bit more about the breadth and capacity of our product set?","Nathaniel Dalton","Sure. And so in answering that part of it, I do agree with part of the way you framed the question, right? Which is the growth in both diverse -- the growth in diversity both by firms, by investment strategies and by product structures and types does tend to create more consistency, right? So I think that dynamic is definitely -- that you described is definitely there. But just sort of stepping back, I tried to cover this a bit in my prepared remarks. We have a number of firms, it's traditional and alternative products, a whole range of different Affiliates. Some of these are sort of the traditional kind of 1 in 20 or 2 in 20 kinds of products. A number of them are also very highly customized. And so and also the blend is implicit in the way you framed the question. The blend is really not -- has a lot of significant parts that are really not correlated with each other. Again, it doesn't mean that there won't be periods where there is correlation, but the blend over time, tends not to be correlated with each other. So -- and of course, there's -- it's asymmetrical, right? So it's bounded on the downside and that get kicked, right? And so it's very broad, very diverse, and again, I don't think we would want to sit here and say, it is growing as a percentage, in large part, because of the points I made, which is the overall business continues to grow at a good pace, but the size and amount of the performance fees that can be generated is definitely growing.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just finally, coming back to capital management and deal flow. It sounds like some of the recent moves on the capital management side are ways to maybe maximize some liquidity and then just given what sounds like maybe more -- a bit more constructive commentary around the pipeline. Just taken those 2 things together, is it reasonable to characterize the pipeline as maybe being skewed more towards bigger deals? Or is it just more a function of maybe right sizing your capacity with the opportunity set in terms of just the number of potential transactions?","Sean M. Healey","I think the pipeline is strong and includes a broad set of prospective Affiliate types, both in terms of product types, geography and size. I think I'd leave it at that. Do you want to comment on...","Jay C. Horgen","Yes, just on the capital planning. So, of course, we've been kind of harping on this point that we're focused on simplicity, flexibility and capacity. I think given what Sean has said about increasing activity, flexibility, liquidity with a potential to even add capacity is really the thing that we're thinking about today.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Lee from KBW.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Just real quickly, I guess, for Jay. Just picking through the balance sheet, did you still have to crystal the forward equity rate arrangement to get cleaned up or...","Jay C. Horgen","So, yes, we, of course you saw the senior convertible was retired. We have unwound approximately half of our forward equity with no shares issued. I think, at this point, we'll reflect on whether to do the other half. I mean, the forward equity together with our $1.25 billion revolver is part of our readiness program to execute on our new investment strategy. So I think we're going to continue to reflect on that.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. Maybe a question for Nate. I'm just kind of curious -- if I think of the global distribution and just general thinking of that is predominantly an institutional success story and where most of you flows have been. But can you maybe -- how do you think of a retail component to that. Clearly, you're focused on it here, and I know it's -- try to take some additional investment, but is there -- do you seen an opportunity to kind of leverage what you've built at? And maybe start attacking more of a non-retail outside the U.S.?","Nathaniel Dalton","To do the last bit first, I think in the long-term, of course, that's part of it. And there is -- and I'll work my way backwards to the questions. I think there is definitely some cross leverage between things we've done in global distribution. For example, there are a number of intermediaries that are truly global intermediaries. There are a number of platforms that are really global platforms that we're interacting with, both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. And there's definitely leverage to bring through the way we face off against those global platforms, right? So there's definitely a cross leverage between the 2, as well as, obviously lots of learning. But the main thing I'd say is our U.S. retail business is today a very successful platform, and we are driving positive flows for a number of our Affiliates through that platform. It's just sort of coming to a point that Sean made, it's just that looking ahead, we think there's a real big opportunity here as investors rerisk. And so -- and we think that this is definitely a channel where there are significant benefits to scale. And so again, remember this will go all the way back to what we're trying to do with global distribution, is we're trying to marry excellent performance of any boutique with the scope and scale of a global distribution platform and business and we're trying to be big where big is an advantage but not get in the way of the things where boutiques really have competitive advantages. Anyway, that we think U.S. retail is absolutely a place where that kind of theme can really play out. And so as -- while it is a scaled business today and we are driving good flow today, as we look forward, we think there is a very big opportunity there. And it will require some incremental investment on our part but it'll also be a lot of just how we position that business and how we pull Affiliates in and ultimately leverage the scale that we've got in relationships we've got already.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Well, Nate, following on that. So if I think of the U.S. retail business, I'm back getting too lost in the weeds -- 2 questions here. When you talk about investing in the platform, is it -- should I simplistically, think of it as, hey, we need more boots on the ground, so it's really more wholesalers and servicing people. And then I guess the second part of that, to your point, maybe getting a sense of how many of your existing Affiliates are actually using your retail platform that exist today and is part of the opportunity bringing -- how much of the opportunity to bring more of them whether it's a Third Avenue or whoever may be kind of into that fold?","Nathaniel Dalton","Yes, so the answer is -- the short answer is yes, right? Some of it is the incremental investment, some of it is absolutely, they are firms that are working with us in global distribution. And as we've gotten -- as we've built businesses together elsewhere, we see the opportunity to bringing them to reach. I mean, look, the biggest place for that kind of opportunities or a big place -- I mean, not the biggest but a big place where that kind of opportunity exist is, of course, bringing additional high-quality alternative product packaged appropriately. Where there's -- it's more than just the boots on the ground plan, how do we appropriately package the product, and then how do we leverage our relationships at the home offices of large distribution platforms. I think there's -- a lot of the value will come through things like that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler from William Blair.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So I know that you said that the flows were diversified geographically, but I was hoping maybe you could hit the key regions, so U.S., Europe, Middle East, Asia and just talk about what kind of products you think you're having the most success with in each of those different regions? I mean, I know it might be tough to make generalizations, but any specifics you could offer will be helpful.","Nathaniel Dalton","Okay. Obviously, that could be a very long question. I think the -- I think that maybe the easiest way to start into the answer is not to focus specifically on the quarter. Like because if you focus specifically on the quarter, there's all sorts of idiosyncratic things that come out, right? So if I look back -- so in the U.S., right, which is absolutely one of the -- we'll start with the U.S. In the U.S., it's been global, emerging alternatives in U.S. equities. That's definitely -- it's been all of those. Those were areas we're been having really good success. As we look at sort of the other regions over mostly institutional, so Middle East, or in Australia or in Asia, those have tended to be mostly global emerging markets and alternatives, there have been some significant -- I don't know whether it's trend or idiosyncratic U.S. equity wins, I mean, that's something that we talked about the last quarter or 2. So there has been some of that. There's been more of these same things that we've been talking about global, emerging and alternatives. And in Europe, it's those plus also sort of more European-focused product as well. So that's sort of a high-level long trend kind of answer.","Sean M. Healey","And again, it is positive net flows in every covered region, every channel, across a broad range of products, virtually all of our largest Affiliates more than 70% of our total Affiliate base has had positive flows. So it's quite broad-based. Obviously, ongoing success and organic growth requires continued excellent execution by our Affiliates in generating alpha for their clients and by our Affiliates and AMG's distribution professionals but we're -- all of the elements continue to be in place for us to see sustained growth.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","All right, great. That's encouraging. And then only other question would just be, given the strong flows of some of your minority interest Affiliates, how would you compare the opportunity to acquire larger stakes in some of those firms today versus maybe at the outset of the year? Has it changed?","Sean M. Healey","No, it hasn't changed.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greggory Warren with Morningstar.","Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","As we work through this year and we get into next year, I think we've gone a bit of a reprieve here on the fixed income side with the fed backing off a little bit on the quantitative easing. But as we look out, we all know that interest rates are eventually going to go up and people are going to be moving out of fixed income more than they have already. Do you think there's a potential as we get into next year, the first half of the year being a really good positive period of flows for your guys sort of akin to what we saw the first half of this year?","Sean M. Healey","I think we're not going to try to predict the forward path of interest rates. I think in our experience, no one does a very good job at doing that and inevitably the consensus is wrong. So I certainly wouldn't disagree with the premise that rates should rise over time. I think what is very clear to us is that clients, both institutional and retail, are increasingly aware of and sensitive to the very substantial risk that there is in long-duration fixed income products. Now how that reflects in client flows, I think is going to vary firm to firm, and it too, will be somewhat difficult to predict. For us, we know that we don't have any exposure to long-duration fixed income. So to the extent that one believes that there will be outflows after a period of really epic inflows into fixed income, to the extent one believes that there will be this rotation, the fixed income outflows will not affect us nor will the depreciation and the value of fixed income products as rates rise over time. To the extent that you see a true rotation and flows into risk products in a more sustained and dramatic way, obviously, as we've said, we think we're very well-positioned to take advantage of that. We're seeing early signs of that opportunity. We're building out our U.S. retail capability to take even greater advantage of it. And so none of us know when but I think to the extent that we believe that these trends will reverse, we're quite optimistic about its impact on us.","Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. I guess my question wasn't as eloquently put in as I wanted, but you got around sort of kind of the answer I was trying to get at and I was just thinking as we got into next year sort of that first half of the year is generally a good period for, especially advisory-driven accounts and institutional accounts, looking at mandates, looking at specific things to kind of adjust allocations. And emerging developing markets continue to be sort of an area of growth within equities that people are still interested in. And U.S. equities, I think you guys are well positioned there. I was just wondering if we're likely to see kind of a continuation of the run rate, the quarterly run rate we've been seeing this year from a flow perspective? Because I think we're on pace to do sort of a double-digit rate of organic growth this year.","Sean M. Healey","I think it's very difficult to predict what industry flow patterns will be quarter-to-quarter. So I think we don't disagree with your broad characterization but don't want to get in the business of predicting quarterly retail flows so...","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Marc Irizarry with Goldman Sachs.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sean, I was wondering 2 things: One, when the tide -- if and when the tide does turn on fixed income, if there's a rotation within fixed income, where are you sort of in the thought process or discussions with more fixed income type of boutiques? Is that something that you see as an opportunity for you in the future? And then I don't know if this is for Nate, but can you give some perspective on how much of the flows in the equity world that you're seeing from institutions as sort of manager replacement activity versus sort of outright allocations?","Sean M. Healey","So to answer your first question with respect to our interest in fixed income perspective Affiliates, there are certainly niche areas of the fixed income product set that are attractive, either alternative categories or some maybe non-U.S. fixed income managers, but core fixed income is not, as you know, a product area that we think is something that makes sense for us either in terms of the unique nature of the elements of -- that make for a successful fixed income manager, we think they are different than -- in many respects than they are for what makes for the most successful alpha-generating product categories. We also don't find many boutiques that are successful in core fixed income. And the last thing I would say is that from a timing standpoint, I think we missed a 25-year run. Nate and I got our first project together when we were both on the advisory side was in the transaction that created PIMCO Advisors. That was in 1993. That would have been a really good time to invest in core fixed income. I think 2013 isn't such a good time. And so you shouldn't expect us to be doing anything in that area. Nate?","Nathaniel Dalton","So your question was focused specifically on the equity piece, I think. As best we can tell, more than half and I'm focused here on this quarter, as best we can tell more than half of the flows in institutional equity were replacement. Again, it's really hard -- that's a sense not something that's sort of scientific and a lot of them we honestly, the sub funds, I mean we just -- a lot of times you just can't tell, but that's our sense.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Sean Healey for closing comments.","Sean M. Healey","Thank you, again, for joining us this morning. As you've heard, we're pleased with our results for the quarter, and we're confident in our prospects for continued strong growth ahead. We look forward to speaking to you again in January.","Operator","This will conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. Have a great day."],"423":["Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host Ms. Ally Lynn, Senior Vice President Corporate Strategy and Investor Relations for Affiliated Managers Group. Thank you, you may begin.","Ally Lynn","Thank you for joining AMG to discuss our results for the fourth quarter of 2014. In this conference call, certain matters discussed will constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected due to a number of factors including, but not limited to those referenced in the company's Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time.","We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. AMG will provide on its website at www.amg.com a replay of the call and a copy of our announcement of our results for the quarter, as well as a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.","With us on the line to discuss the company's results for the quarter are Sean Healey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Nate Dalton, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Jay Horgen, Chief Financial Officer.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Sean Healey.","Sean Healey","Thanks, Ally, and good morning everyone. We were pleased to report economic earnings per share of $3.55 for the fourth quarter and a record $11.45 for the full year as assets under management were over $620 billion at year end, an increase of 15% year over year.","Our excellent results for the quarter and the year were driven by the strong long term investment performance and new business momentum of our affiliates as well as significant deployment of capital through our new investment strategy, resulting in the addition of four highly regarded new affiliates and a meaningful incremental investment in an existing affiliate.","Even in a difficult quarter for industry flows into return oriented products, we recorded our 19th consecutive quarter of positive net client cash flows. While our net flows in the fourth quarter were impacted by some specific factors that Nate will describe, we have a substantial pipeline of new mandates this quarter and are confident that we will continue to generate strong organic growth ahead.","Our consistent track record of net flows reflects the outstanding quality of our specialist affiliates and their excellent investment performance, our unique position in highly attractive product areas and the ongoing success of our global distribution strategy. We continue to benefit from our strategic focus on products which are on the alpha side of the barbell where we see outstanding secular growth opportunities and our boutique affiliates are recognized as among the world\u2019s best managers in their respective disciplines.","This theme is especially pronounced among non-US investors and we\u2019ve been able to capitalize on the opportunity through our global distribution strategy which continues to generate significant new business as together with our affiliates, we continue to build relationships with the largest and most important clients around the world.","During the fourth quarter, we won a record number of new mandates as well as numerous expansions of mandates through every covered region of AMG-centralized platform, including Continental Europe, the Middle East, Asia and Australia. We see incremental opportunities for our affiliates to gain further market share with existing clients and win new clients across an increasingly broad range of regions and channels around the world.","We continue to see strong client demand for our affiliates\u2019 return oriented strategies among our institutional client base as sophisticated global institutions seek differentiated value-added strategies in active equities and alternatives and we believe that over time demand for these products will likewise increase among retail clients who will inevitably require larger allocations through return oriented strategies to meet their long-term objectives.","Turning to new investments. We were very pleased with the excellent execution of our new investment strategy in 2014. We deployed over $1.3 billion over the course of the year adding four new affiliates, SouthernSun, River Road, EIG and Veritas and most recently making a significant additional investment in AQR. Cliff Asness, David Kabiller and John Liew and their rest of their partners have built AQR into an exceptional franchise with tremendous growth and innovation and outstanding future prospects. So we were especially pleased to deepen our partnership 10 years after our initial investment.","Notwithstanding the record level of capital deployed on our new investments in 2014, we\u2019re entering 2015 with a substantial pipeline of outstanding prospective affiliates and our forward opportunities to partner with the highest quality boutiques worldwide are better than ever.","In addition, we are continuing to innovate and pursue investment opportunities in excellent firms which extend beyond the universe of prospective asset management affiliates. One example of this broader strategy is of course wealth management. And as Nate will describe we just announced this morning the addition of an outstanding firm Baker Street Advisors to our Wealth Partners affiliate group. Looking ahead, the transaction environment remains highly favorable to AMG and with our two decade track record of successful partnerships, we\u2019re uniquely positioned to execute on our diverse opportunity set.","Looking across our business, we've entered 2015 in an outstanding position to continue to successfully execute our growth strategy. First, our affiliates are recognized as industry leaders in attractive product areas with excellent performance track records and tremendous commitment to their future growth.","Second, in addition to the strong organic growth prospects of our existing affiliates, we have a tremendous opportunity to build incremental scale, capacity and diversification in our business through additional new affiliate investments.","And third, as you'll hear further from Nate and Jay, the greater scale of our business is increasingly an advantage in itself. As we demonstrated in 2014 we now have the scale and cash generation to fund our new investment strategy while also returning capital to shareholders through share repurchase. We\u2019re able to leverage the scale and brand -- our scale and brand to market on behalf of our affiliates in more and more regions and channels around the world. And this distribution capability makes us a uniquely attractive partner to the best boutiques around the world. And as we add new affiliates, the increased diversity and scale of our product set makes us a more attractive counterparty to the largest and most sophisticated clients globally.","We and our affiliates offer our clients the best of both worlds, the benefits of scale where scale is the benefit and the preservation of the special aspects of boutique managers, including the distinct and focused investment processes, alignment of interest and unique entrepreneurial cultures which are hallmarks of independent firms where management partners own direct equity in their own business. All of these characteristics give boutique firms the competitive advantage in generating alpha.","And while the prevailing narrative is that active management can\u2019t outperform passive products, the best active managers in the industry, including especially our boutique affiliates do add value for their clients, in many cases complementing a client\u2019s allocation of asset beta. We strongly believe that the forward organic growth opportunity for AMG and its affiliates is extremely attractive.","As always, we know that our future success requires an ongoing focus on excellent execution across all aspects of our business and we look forward to continuing to create significant long-term shareholder value in the years to come.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it to Nate to discuss our affiliates in greater detail.","Nate Dalton","Thanks. Good morning everyone. As Sean said, 2014 was a very good year for AMG. We added four excellent new boutiques in our affiliates outstanding long-term investment track records combined with our robust global distribution strategy and resources resulted in another year of strong net client cash flows with over 20 billion for the year, including 2.6 billion in the fourth quarter.","A particular highlight of the year was our additional investment in AQR. Of course, it was an attractive investment, increasing our exposure to one of the fastest growing, most innovative asset management firms. For us, it was also a testament to the strong partnership and friendship we\u2019ve built with Cliff, David and John and their partners over the past decade and we look forward to continuing to work together as AQR grows.","Stepping back for a moment, as you know, AMG includes the broadest array of return-oriented boutiques in the world and our affiliates have outstanding long-term investment track records across a wide range of strategies, especially in US, global and emerging markets equities and liquid and illiquid alternative strategies.","It\u2019s been very interesting to look back not just at the volatility in the past month and the specific environment we\u2019re in today but also over the past decade or two and see the opportunities for focused boutique managers, the ability of boutiques to outperform has increasingly been recognized by sophisticated investors worldwide. One of the ways we\u2019ve seen this in practice in which we continue to benefit from is with many investors who are complementing their core passive exposures with so called barbell allocation to very active strategies managed by our affiliates across equities and alternatives.","And turning to investment performance, and staring with the global developed markets category. Our affiliates generate good investment performance with highlights for the quarter and full-year, including excellent performance from products of AQR, Harding Loevner, and Tweedy, Browne whose flagship global value fund ranked in the 1st percentile for the year in its Morningstar category.","In the emerging markets category, we had very strong performance for the year in all of the major products managed by AQR, Genesis and Harding Loevner are ahead of their benchmarks for the one, three and five year periods.","Turning next to our alternatives category where, as Sean noted, we offer broad suite of strategies. Many of our affiliates\u2019 most significant products performed very well, including at affiliates AQR, Pantheon and ValueAct. Affiliates that have incentive fee structures, including both alternatives and traditional strategies performed well in 2014 which not only led to fees being recognized in the fourth quarter but also set us up well going into 2015 from a performance and the opportunity standpoint.","Finally, with respect to our US equity products. Performance was relatively mixed with GW&K, Time Square and Tweedy Browne underperforming while Yacktman on the other hand performed well during the quarter. Frontier also delivered very strong performance for the full-year and across longer time periods.","Now turning to flows. As I said, we had 2.6 billion in positive net client cash flows last quarter. While these flows were good, in the quarter, we also had two significant lumpy outflows in the institutional and sub-advisory channels and our retail mutual funds were impacted by some negative seasonality from dividends and distributed gains not all of which were invested. These factors masked underlying strengths in our new business generation as we have one of our strongest growth sales quarters ever.","While as we emphasize on every call, flows especially in the institutional and sub-advisory channels are inherently lumpy, looking ahead, we continue to see good institutional sales momentum and an improving retail flow picture this quarter.","Turning to the channel review and starting with the institutional channel. We had positive net flows of approximately 5 billion. These flows came across alternate strategies in US and EM equities, including notable contributions from AQR, BlueMountain, GW&K and Pantheon. Similar to previous quarters, we had a number of high quality wins coming from leading institutions located around the world.","In our high net worth channel, flows were essentially flat for the quarter with a meaningful contribution from GW&K. As you saw this morning, we were also pleased to welcome Baker Street, a leading wealth management firm based in San Francisco with approximately 6 billion in AUM to our Wealth Partners Group. Jeff Colin, Mike, Chris and Jim and the team run a great firm and make a fantastic addition to our Wealth Partners Affiliates. Including Baker Street, we now have four Wealth Partners affiliates with over 25 billion in AUM.","Moving to the mutual fund channel. We had outflows of 2.5 billion. While we had positive flows into many global and emerging markets equities and alternative strategies which came from a number of affiliates including especially AQR, Artemis, Harding Wealth Management [ph], Veritas, these were more than offset by outflows from US equity products of several affiliates.","As you know, our US retail business unlike our broader business, has a skew towards US equities. Also, as I mentioned, it was one lumpy sub-advisory outflow in the quarter and the fourth quarter does have some negative seasonality.","Speaking about our US retail platform AMG Funds more broadly. Even though it was a challenging flow quarter for the reasons I mentioned, we continued to make good progress in building out our retail distribution business. As you know, during the year, we made some key senior hires and rebranded AMG Funds to help replicate the success we\u2019ve had through our institutional focused platforms. As we\u2019ve discussed on previous calls, we believe that clients and intermediaries ultimately must allocate to return oriented products to meet their objectives. At the same time, we think there is a unique opportunity to create the point of contact through which platforms and intermediaries and other channel partners can access the world\u2019s broadest array of return oriented boutiques.","Finally, in terms of updating you on our global institutional distribution platforms, we continue to help our affiliates to generate strong flows among a diversified set of products and across geographies. We also continued to build up the platforms and just added another senior sales professional in Asia with a particular focus initially in Korea where we have good high level of penetration but also see an increasing demand for the types of products that our affiliates manage.","In terms of where the platform is today, we have combined many of the benefits of a large organization\u2019s distribution capabilities with a focused product performance of outstanding boutiques. We are also beginning to get the benefit of the AMG brand as an aligned permanent partner who can bring to bear the largest collection of boutique managers in the world into our client conversation. To put this in context, we now have dialogues with most of the largest institutions and intermediaries in the world and are increasingly capitalizing on that investment with a first or second sale into relationships that should over time develop many more.","We are also just starting to deepen our penetration in these markets into the higher volume next level institutions and intermediaries and to build the packaging that will allow us to get on their platforms, so many many opportunity is yet untapped.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it to Jay to discuss the financials.","Jay Horgen","Thank you, Nate. As Sean discussed, we're pleased to report another year of strong earnings growth with the continued successful execution of our new investment growth strategy and positive net client cash flows despite global market volatility.","As you saw in the release, we reported economic earnings per share of $11.45 for 2014. For the fourth quarter we reported economic earnings-per-share of $3.55 which included net performance fees of $0.78. And on a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $3.02.","Turning to specific modeling items. For the fourth quarter EBITDA was 279 million reflecting continued organic growth as well as fourth-quarter performance fees. With the full-year effect of our five investments in 2014, we entered 2015 with approximately 1 billion in run rate EBITDA, reflecting the strength, diversity, and scale of our global business.","In the fourth quarter, the ratio of our EBITDA to end of period assets under management was approximately 18 basis points or approximately 13.4 basis points excluding performance fees. These figures include the partial quarter impact of EBITDA from Veritas and AQR which closed in the quarter.","In the first quarter of 2015, we expect the ratio of EBITDA to end of period assets under management to be approximately 14 basis points which includes the full run rate impact of our fourth quarter new investments.","With regard to our taxes, we had offsetting items that ran through our GAAP tax rate and our intangible related deferred tax add-backs that did not impact our economic earnings. These items resulted from the year-end restructuring of our non-US entities. As a result, our effective GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 23% and our intangible related deferred taxes were negative 6.5 million. Going forward we expect our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 34% and our cash tax rate to be approximately 23%. In addition, we expect our intangible related deferred taxes to return to approximately 20 million per quarter.","Our share of amortization for the quarter, including the closing of Veritas and AQR was 31.7 million with 9.1 million of amortization from affiliates accounted for under the equity method. For the first quarter, we expect AMG\u2019s amortization to be approximately 30 million, primarily due to the scheduled roll-up of amortization of certain affiliates.","Our interest expense for the fourth quarter was 22.4 million including 2.5 million of pretax non-cash imputed interest expense. In the first quarter we expect our interest expense to increase to approximately 23.5 million as a result of higher revolver balances primarily from the financing of AQR.","Now turning to our balance sheet. The size, scale and diversity of our business enabled us to deploy 1.3 billion across five investments in 2014 and returned capital to shareholders through repurchases while simultaneously improving our credit ratings. In the fourth quarter, these included the funding of our new investments in Veritas and AQR, repurchasing over 9000 shares and being upgraded to BBB plus by S&P and rated A3 by Moody\u2019s. Looking ahead we continue to position our balance sheet to take advantage of our tremendous opportunity set in new investments and given the attractive rate environment and the strength of our credit we look to opportunistically extend our maturities and lower our long-term cost of capital. This, combined with approximately 650 million of undrawn capacity on our $1.25 billion revolver and run rate EBITDA of 1 billion ensures that we continue to be well-positioned to create meaningful incremental opportunities for earnings growth while also returning capital.","Now turning to guidance. We are raising our 2015 guidance as we expect economic earnings-per-share to be in the range of $13 to $14.25. This guidance assumes our normal convention of actual market through yesterday for the current quarter and 2% quarterly market growth beginning in the second quarter of 2015. We also assume a weighted average share count for the year of approximately 56.5 million.","The lower end of our guidance range includes a modest contribution from performance fees and organic growth while the upper end of the range assumes a more robust contribution from both performance fees and net client cash flows. As always, these assumptions do not include earnings from future new investments and are based on our current expectation of affiliate growth rates, performance and the mix of affiliate contribution to our earnings. Of course, substantial changes in markets and earnings contribution of our affiliates would impact these expectations.","Now we\u2019ll be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler ","First, just on capital management, I am wondering if you could discuss appetite and availability of new investment in 2015. And given the increase in share repurchase activity in 4Q, should we view that as any indication of how the pipeline looks or was that more as a tool to prevent dilution in \u201815?","Sean Healey","Well I appreciate the question because I think historically sometimes people misinterpret share repurchase activity as reflecting some indication on the new investment opportunity set. Given the scale that the business has grown to, given the size of the \u2013 which I will be happy to talk further about -- given the size of the opportunity set for new affiliates and a current environment that is very attractive with a very strong competitive position, we are very optimistic about our forward new investment prospects, the strength of our existing pipeline, the prospects for new investment in the over the medium to long term. But given the scale of our business we can\u2019t as we showed in 2014 both make substantial new investment activity over 1.3 billion last year while also continuing to buy back stock. And even in a scenario where we\u2019re making substantial new investments you should expect there will be buybacks to manage dilution and of course in periods where we see less immediate opportunity for new investments and the buyback will increase. Jay, do you want to comment on credit rating and the overall positioning?","Jay Horgen","Yes, so the position of our balance sheet today is very strong, Craig and as you look at I guess the reflection on the ratings A3 now by Moody\u2019s and continuing to be upgraded by S&P two times over the last two years, I think it does reflect where we stand today which is we have opportunity on our balance sheet both from the revolver that\u2019s undrawn, we have 650 million but also the senior debt market where playing into the level of our credit we can fund very efficiently amongst the lowest cost of capital in the industry and gives us that opportunity to both be flexible but also repurchase shares. As Sean said, in periods where deal doesn\u2019t happen in a quarter or in periods where deals happen in the quarter, and we can do both. So I think that\u2019s \u2013 and we also, just to point out that our leverage is still low, very low on a historic basis. So we're not levering the balance sheet to do this.","And I think the biggest and most important point is just the cash flow from the business itself which is about $1 billion run rate EBITDA today, that translates into about $750 million of after-tax earnings and that comes in quarterly as we all know. So that is our funding mechanism throughout the year in addition to leverage that we might take on.","Craig Siegenthaler ","Thank you Jay and just as my follow-up. If we take a step back and look at the EPS run rate in 4Q, performance fee contribution from the institutional channel was actually quite low versus the last few years. And I am just wondering do you view the 4Q run rate as low versus sort of where we are in the cycle? And can you provide any color on the contribution of absolute return generating assets versus relative return performance fee generating assets?","Sean Healey","I think I will start but ask Nate to comment on the performance fee opportunity generally. I think the last few years, certainly the last two years you\u2019ve seen strong performance fees really kind of above the 5% to 10% level that we included in our guidance and we felt like this was another strong -- not as strong as the prior year but another strong performance year and we\u2019ve of course increased our exposure to performance fee opportunities or investment in \u2013 our new investment in AQR. But Nate, why don\u2019t you talk more broadly?","Nate Dalton","Sure. So \u2013 and I think this is sort of implicit in your question but if you step back just a bit, you understand our book exactly right which is broadly performance fees across both absolute return and also more data sensitive products. There is also, as you understand a wide range of different fee structures across that, right, so some benchmark, relative to some absolute return, some kind of highly structured, single year and multi-year, so there is a pretty broad mix of fee structures that fit under those two categories.","So if you look specifically to this quarter, last quarter and maybe compared to the prior year, I would say couple things here. So one is I think the diversity of the opportunity is increasing. So some of this, as Sean said, the addition of new affiliates, some of it is existing alternative \u2013 or for instance the existing alternative product sets broadening and diversifying their own product sests. AQR is a good example of that, but BlueMountain and First Quadrant and others are as well. So I think if I were going to sort of describe it, I would say, it\u2019s more diverse which should create more consistency to the booking and obviously to performance fees and there will be volatility to it but that increase in diversity will create more consistency but ultimately I think I would echo what Sean said, we look back and I think it was a good year, I don\u2019t think we look at and say it was sort of a great year, years it could be and I do think there is more upside opportunity, but we look back and think it's a good year with an increasingly diverse mix of potential \u2013","Sean Healey","And happily given the nature of the products, it positions us for as good or indeed an even better year prospectively.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies.","Dan Fannon ","I guess, Jay, first, if you could let us know, is there buybacks assumed in your guidance next year and if you could also let us know what the mark is as of today for your kind of blended mix to give us a sense of the inputs?","Jay Horgen","Yes, okay. Dan, I will try to cover all of the items of guidance and which capture those couple of things that you\u2019ve said in the few more. So at the highest level, we raised range to $13 to $14.25 reflecting the full-year effective AQR, the mark-to-market which I will go into a second, since our last call, and a few other items including Baker Street as well as share count itself. So on the beta, just to remind everyone our modeling convention when we last gave guidance was third quarter call, November 3 was the date. We assumed 0% markets for the remainder of fourth quarter but we had 2% in the first quarter -- for first quarter 2015, and each quarter thereafter. Since that third quarter call we experienced some market volatility but our blend still ended up to yesterday, it was up 0.5% across all products. And as you know, Dan, that replaces the 2% assumption. So the convention, no additional market beta for the remainder of the quarter. Removing the 2% means that our realized market performance was minus 1.5 lower or just minus 1.5 than the last time we gave guidance, So this will partially offset the accretion of AQR and the share count.","You will also note that our share count from the last time we gave guidance which we gave on November 3 said 57 million weighted-average next year, we\u2019re now saying 56.5 million, that\u2019s a 1.5 million share difference, that is a weighted-average number for the year. So it does reflect a constant share count effectively, does not include any additional share reduction.","On performance fees, I will just note that we talked about that just a minute ago, we booked a dollar this year of performance fees, so $0.78 plus $0.22 in the prior three quarters which was 8.7%, it\u2019s just a good year, not a great year. We would still generally say that while growing, because our earnings growth in the range and at the midpoint of our new range is 19% over the 11.45 for this year. So performance fees are growing but so is our business. So it\u2019s sort of growing into our business. We still generally expect 5% to 10% but at the very top end of our $14.25 we could see a little extra performance fees just given the opportunity set.","Dan Fannon ","And then Nate, I have a couple of questions on flows. If you could first give us some color around, I think you highlighted two redemptions in the institutional channel. And then just at a high level you\u2019re just thinking about this past year aggregate numbers are still good but you\u2019re roughly 50% down on a net basis versus where you were in 2013. And so I want to characterize how you think about the set up into next year versus where you were last year, is this -- we know that the mutual fund channel has been where there's been a source of slowness but the institutional side has been very good. I guess just looking for a little more detail around how you\u2019re thinking of the set up into this year versus maybe where we were at the start of last year?","Nate Dalton","Sure. So I will try and hit those kind of in that order. So first, I think the two flows I highlighted, one was institutional and one was sub-advisory which shows up for us in our mutual fund channel, so that\u2019s a little bit just a nuance there. But what\u2019s happening with those, I\u2019d say a couple things. So first, you never really know around these kind of flows and so can't really ever be certain. But let me do one just sort of example, kind of give you what we mean by these outflows. And so the example I highlighted is just a good performing product, has good traction, otherwise has good flows, the mandate actually not that of the mandate, so everything seems well set up and then there was a management turnover to specific clients, new CIO and you\u2019re always risking those things happen, they made some changes, do we really know exactly what the reasonable change were but certainly not the kind of thing that as you look ahead, you look at that product and say, okay, wait, maybe there is something, something they are asking. So I think it\u2019s that kind of thing \u2013 this can happen but moving from that part of the question to the other part of the question, if we sort of think about the underlying drivers, so these are the things we talk about which is we feel really good about how we are positioned, good performance in the underlying products in areas that we think have good opportunities especially as we look at the global potential in active equities and alternatives, and I said good performance and we \u2013 which is a theme we\u2019ve had for last year as well. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s difference but think feel really good about is increasing distribution resources against that really well performing product set, which set us up very well going into 2015.","And then the other thing I\u2019d say and this is not a new point but I think it\u2019s an important point is as we look at the full picture we have this unique opportunity set which is we\u2019ve added, as Sean said, four outstanding new affiliates to the group, those firms as with new firms we will add during this year. Those firms bring outstanding products, good track records, and those are immediately leverageable into this increasing distribution. So we feel really good about how we are set up on those dimensions. I think you are also right to highlight if you sort of look at the distribution picture ex US retail, it looks much stronger, and I think in US retail we feel very good about the opportunity set medium to long-term. We feel very good about the team that we brought together, the people that we brought on board, we feel good about the rebrand that we did and you will see us do additional work on the product set, some of that is to diversify. As I said in the prepared remarks, there is a US equity skew there which hasn\u2019t helped. We also have some products that have been closed and those will open at some point. So again we feel good about it and but recognize that there is more skew there as well.","Sean Healey","Yes, I mean the point that we all understand is that all of this is against a relatively challenging backdrop in terms of industry flow trend into return oriented products. I think we will see that relatively few if any of our peers will probably be reporting positive net flows into active equities and alternatives. And so for us what that really means is as we look forward we see broad macro trends coming into our favour and it\u2019s anybody's judgment as to when there is this rotation out of fixed income into active equities and alternatives but we see it coming. And we think last year was an extraordinarily difficult year for active equities generally, probably this year will be a better year and in any event, the way that we have positioned our business is very much focused on the end of the barbell that \u2013 that is alpha generating products and we see current and even stronger, as Nate said, future opportunities and demand for those products.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup.","Bill Katz ","First, just staying with Nate, I was listening to what you'd said in terms of Dan's question about the lumpy numbers. Can you quantify the specific level of that? It seems like it is more of a client-driven move on both sides, but just trying to frame out the actual redemption level. And the second part of the question is, you mentioned in some of your prepared remarks -- Sean, I think it was yourself -- that you have some great opportunity outside the United States to deepen the platform. I was just wondering if you might be able to expand on where you see some of that growth as you look out to 2015?","Nate Dalton","So first on the sort of the two lumpy alphas, as we mentioned, they were both \u2013 they were large mandates and it\u2019s over a couple billion and that\u2019s the way to think about it. And as I think I sort of went through the explanation kind of side of that, you never really know, as I said.","To the other part of your question, as we look out on global distribution and build out, so maybe thing just to step back for a second, we\u2019ve been building into regions and our approach has been at high-level hire very experienced senior folks with good marketplace knowledge understanding, but even with that and given the breadth of the product they will be able to bring to bear, it takes a little while for each region to sort of grow and come up the curve. And so some of our regions \u2013 and we talked about stacking this growth curve. So some of our regions we\u2019ve been there for a while they are mature at that \u2013 at the high end both with the largest clients and large intermediaries and we\u2019ve made now multiple sales into those. And in those regions one of the places we see the big opportunity and we\u2019ve talked about this on prior calls as well is to bring additional resources online and move into the higher volume parts of the market including platforms and we\u2019ve done that in Australia as an example, we\u2019ve done that in the Middle East into ultra high net worth market as well. And those have to come up the curve as well. So we are in the market, we have a good brand, we have a good reputation, we\u2019ve built a scale business and we\u2019re extending by channel.","There are other places where we've been now for a year or two and you can think about Germany and Switzerland and the Nordics, and they are starting to contribute but we really expect them to their level of contribution. So that\u2019s another source of growth and then there are some markets, and I mentioned Korea in the prepared remarks where we see a significant opportunity and have added resources and it will be a little while before that increases its level of contribution but those will come online as well and then there's also a component part of it which is increasing the packaging which we still need to do. But we are now in a place where we are working with most of our affiliates across most of these regions. And so the opportunity set as we continue to add distribution resources and increasingly work with our affiliates, there is also a feedback loop that we didn\u2019t really talk about in the prepared remarks but there is a feedback loop here where we are bringing that global demand information back which helps our affiliates focus on where they spend their resources, also feeds back into the product development, package development conversation, which creates another level of uplift that we haven\u2019t really been able to experience yet but all of those together make us incredibly optimistic about this, all we can built which goes to the point we were making in the prepared remarks about trying to be \u2013 trying to capitalize on these opportunities would be the best of the benefits of scale, without that scale getting in the way of the thing that makes boutiques so special and attractive to these sophisticated institutional investors.","Bill Katz ","And then maybe one for Jay or Sean. Obviously, you put a lot of capital to work in 2014. You announced today's deal. But as soon as you step back, the markets got a little more choppy as we have gone over the last month or two. Is that either delaying or accelerating the conversations? And where are you sort of most focused at this point in terms of new investments?","Sean Healey","I would say the recent bit of volatility is not really having any effect. I think as we all know as it becomes severe, or extreme, then it would have a dampening effect. This amount of volatility I think one could argue might even be helpful. The current pipeline is, as we said, very strong skewed slightly I would say to non-US opportunities and skewed to alternative opportunities but a very healthy mix of firms across geographies and product categories. And the long term opportunity as we discussed is enormously attractive. We began trying to give investors more insight into the magnitude of the opportunity set and we talked about our 150 most attractive largest prospective affiliates, firms where we have an existing relationship and we believe that they are oriented toward our investment approach and where we think we\u2019re well-positioned. And if you sort of say, how big is that opportunity set in terms of purchase price, if you understand and we\u2019ve looked, as you would expect in detail, we know of these firms, so the average AUM of these firms is 12 billion, and if you sort of think about what that means in terms of AMG purchase price that would mean a typical transaction might be 300 million to 400 million depending on the fee rate and the aggregate amount of the opportunity could approach 50 billion of purchase price.","And so we think about that size of an opportunity where we believe we have the strongest competitive position and as we know these will almost all inevitably pursue some kind of a succession and transition solution. So there are transactions coming over \u2013 they won\u2019t all happen in the next year or two but over the next 5 to 7 year period most of these firms will pursue a transaction.","Bill Katz ","And then just one last one for me. And thanks for taking all the questions. Jay, you mentioned that you got -- you upgraded by S&P and Moody's. You have sort of one of the lowest cost of capitals out there right now. As I quickly scan your balance sheet, your debt is somewhere between 4% and 6% and some odd percent. How are you thinking about refinancing versus maybe expansion of the balance sheet, if you will?","Jay Horgen","So as it relates to our current debt and capital structure, as you know we\u2019ve been moving towards simplifying it. So clearly we\u2019ve taken out two convertibles in favour of debt. We also have what looks like higher-priced debt now just given the timeframe which we did it when we were a triple B minus company. So we really do have a tremendous opportunity just a lower cost of capital just by refinancing out most of our capital structure. So I think we are focused on that, it will take us some time, we will be opportunistic. Really the incremental debt will come along only if we spend more than the $750 million of after tax per year that I described, now that did happen in 2014. So it is possible and we will add debt where appropriate.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Kim with Sandler O'Neill.","Michael Kim ","First, just focusing on the retail channel, it looks like the outflows for the quarter were maybe a bit more widespread across different affiliates and strategies. And I understand the industry backdrop played a role in that as well. But just wondering what some of the drivers may be in terms of potentially turning flows around in that channel. Is it mostly a function of more favorable demand trends across the industry, or do you think you can continue to gain market share, even if risk appetites remain more muted, just as you may be increasingly leveraged, performance, and\/or distribution advantages?","Nate Dalton","So I will try to hit all those. I think look, there is no question, as Sean said, the overall environment that we are operating in has a huge effect. So that\u2019s one thing I\u2019d say. A second thing is we mentioned this I think before, the US retail, our US retail product set is more heavily skewed to US equities than our overall business. And so we are more exposed in that sense to what's going on in US equities. I think the other thing I'd say, one of the reasons it may look a little more widespread or broader this quarter may be the seasonality that I mentioned which is having an impact and it\u2019s a noticeable impact across a bunch of portfolios. So that may be a bit of that.","When you look forward, while I think it\u2019s true that we are subject to what goes on with the overall environment, look, we believe that ultimately, as we improve our execution and increase resources available, and we have good performance, there should be the opportunity -- we believe there will be the opportunity for us to generate meaningful positive flows, even in a more difficult environment. And I think if you went back a year or two ago, if we have significant good performing product with Cathie [ph], we do have the ability, we have a platform which is a scale platform, has selling relationships, good key account coverage and field coverage, we have the ability to drive sales. And so I think we feel good about that opportunity set, recognizing that, as Sean said, we're going to be subject to the environment we are operating in.","Sean Healey ","But just to be clear, we are seeing -- and we are only part way into the quarter. But we are seeing more positive trends in retail this quarter for a variety of reasons than we did last quarter, just so that we are making the --","Nate Dalton ","Yes. And just to finish that thought. Thank you, Sean. Just to finish that thought, obviously, there was this -- if you look at it from a channel perspective, there was this one lumpy outflow that I mentioned, which was significant, as well as the seasonality. Both of those obviously don't apply to this quarter. But even in addition to that, the underlying trend looks -- as Sean said, looks better.","Michael Kim ","And just in terms of the institutional channel from a mix perspective, I know it can be a lumpy business on a quarterly basis. But if you sort of look back over longer periods of time, have you seen any trends play out in terms of particular regions, affiliates, or strategies maybe driving an outsized proportion of flows in that channel? Just trying to think about sort of positioning in the context of diversification and broader allocation trends.","Nate Dalton ","So if I were going to highlight a couple things here, one, I would go to the -- first, sort of, I'll go macro down, I think, here. I think, first, I would go to the point that both Sean and I talked about before, which is there is this macro trend of -- we use the word barbelling. But there is this macro trend where people are large, sophisticated institutions, intermediaries who serve them. And we think further down the market as well, where this trend towards taking some of your portfolio and taking on passive exposures, while increasing allocations to sort of really active managers who are running more concentrated and taking more sort of active return postures managers. We think that\u2019s a trend. We think we have benefited from that trend, as I said before, and we think we will continue to benefit from that trend. So that is certainly one. We think this is a largely -- there is obviously exceptions region by region. We think this is a largely global phenomenon. So that, I think, is part of it.","When you look back over longer periods of time for us in the institutional channel -- and I think this holds true looking forward as well -- the other thing I would say is just the increasing acceptance of boutiques as a source of these active return streams. And I think that\u2019s something that we have really seen take hold if you sort of look back over the last decade around the world. And we\u2019ve benefited from that.","Another trend I would raise -- and I answered this a bit in answer to a prior question -- is we have been increasing our distribution resources. And so just enabling a boutique that sits in the US to very easily acquire the right clients who really want their kind of return stream in Australia or in China or in Southeast Asia or in Korea or, go around the globe. And to be able to access the appropriate clients quickly and easily is just something that is just a complete new growth opportunity which we have capitalized on over this last period. And as I said before, the level of resources coming online is increasing. And when we think that opportunity holds true, not just for all of our existing boutiques, but also as we add additional boutiques to easily plug -- and not to be too glib about it, but easily plug those outstanding return streams, those outstanding boutiques into this distribution and bring them into the market is a really powerful opportunity.","So I think those are things that impacted us sort of looking backwards, but also looking forward, I think those are true. And by product area, I think it\u2019s the themes we have talked about global and EM equities. We continue to see good demand and we also see good demand for US equities in some of these global regions. And then, obviously, alternatives -- liquid and illiquid -- there has been a long-term trend that we think will continue.","Sean Healey ","The only thing I would add to that is that if you look back or you think about the sources of growth from a geographic perspective, where we think that we will continue to get very good results out of markets like Australia or the Middle East, where we\u2019ve had a presence for more than five years. But think about the markets in Asia, for example, where we\u2019ve had a presence for a much shorter period of time and the second senior-level person in Korea that Nate mentioned, we just hired, just a few weeks ago. So the forward opportunity is very substantial on a broad base in the markets where we already have been, but it\u2019s not static. We are rapidly expanding and building into new markets where, as Nate noted, there is inevitably some seasoning that needs to take place. But we think about that forward opportunity and the composition from a geographic standpoint, to some extent from a product standpoint, will be different and even broader and diverse going forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler with William Blair.","Chris Shutler ","Sean, you mentioned broadening your new investment strategy, I think, maybe moving into some adjacent areas. And I know one example is Wealth Partners where you have been now for a couple of years. But just anything that you could elaborate on that topic and maybe help us size any additional opportunities that you see, at least relative to the Wealth Partners business?","Sean Healey ","Sure. Well the first point to note, similar to Craig's initial question, is by talking about broadening -- innovating and broadening the opportunity set, what I am absolutely positively not saying is that the universe and opportunity among boutique asset management firms, prospective affiliates, is anything but extraordinary. I mean, we think it\u2019s a huge opportunity. We are very, very well positioned. And just like with share repurchase, talking about broadening the investment opportunity set should only be interpreted as an incremental positive.","So what are some examples? The first thing I guess I would say is that in every single case, our focus always -- I mean, people would say this, but if you look at our track record, we really mean it. We only want to partner with firms that are excellent, that are committed to excellence and execution and are people of integrity and they are committed to building enduring franchises. Now that said, what are some specific examples that maybe go beyond? Certainly, Wealth Partners. There is a number of excellent wealth management firms -- and maybe Nate can talk about some of the opportunities over time to sort of find synergies. But just on a standalone basis, the opportunity to invest in firms like Baker Street is excellent. And so the more of those that we can do, the better.","Second, there are opportunities that we probably would not have pursued historically with smaller firms, both traditional and alternative, where there is a particular appeal -- a little bit what Nate was saying earlier, the feedback loop where we know -- we have a good sense, a better sense than we have ever had of client demand and opportunities for growth in discrete product areas, where we see a smaller firm -- an excellent, smaller firm that we think will be particularly attractive from a distribution standpoint, will be more focused on pursuing those kinds of transactions.","The business is increasingly global. We have relationships with firms in more than a dozen countries. And in some cases -- Value Partners in Hong Kong might be an example. We will make an investment that is in a different structure and just be more willing to be innovative and build relationships and sort of see where it takes us. As long as, of course, there is all the other attributes, including, especially, alignment in the investment. There are product areas like specialty private equity, our investment in EIG. We are thrilled with that investment and see opportunities in other kinds of firms like that, which has not been part of our traditional opportunity set.","And then finally, I would say there are third-party sales -- sales of third-party interest in excellent firms, often alternative firms. And some of those opportunities might not look -- because we are stepping into the shoes of someone else -- might not look exactly like our existing affiliate relationships. Indeed, they might -- the firm might want a different kind of relationship. As long as the firm is excellent, as long as there is the alignment, and as long as, over time, we see the opportunity to build a very strong relationship and fit consistently with the rest of our business, we will be willing to look at those kinds of transactions. Again, always a very high bar in terms of the quality of the firms and maybe indeed an even higher bar where it looks different from the existing opportunity set.","But to say again what I said at the outset, we are extraordinarily optimistic about the opportunity among the traditional and alternative boutique asset management firm universe where we see a very substantial set of opportunities, currently and prospectively, over the coming years. But we are willing to innovate as we have in the past, and investing in alternative firms. Our investment in AQR 10 years ago was viewed as surprising and different and I think was the first in the industry. And then, of course, there were a number of transactions with different kinds of entities. Not all ended so well. But anyway that was an important innovation for us. Obviously has worked extraordinarily well and we have made several other investments and will make several other.","And then Wealth Partners, we think, is, again, what\u2019s surprising, we think, is a very attractive and interesting opportunity. In that case, with an entirely separate team, focused on identifying, building relationships and then executing investments in those firms. Nate, maybe you can just add a bit to the discussion of Wealth Partners.","Nate Dalton ","Sure. So just to -- and maybe using it as illustrative of some of the stuff Sean talked about. So we think there are lots of similarities, but also some differences. And so we are investing in firms like Baker Street, using a very similar structure, but a slightly different -- there are differences. And so we think, for example -- and this is, again, same quality bar kind of starting point that Sean described -- but we think with the Wealth Partners firms, for example, there are things we can be doing to be helpful to them in their organic growth. Again, we have a well-developed track record now in other areas, helping affiliates without interfering with their autonomy and helping them with organic growth. So we have been able to -- and are working on some of those things with the Wealth Partners affiliates.","Same thing is true on the operational side. So we have some well-developed platforms that we have used as our affiliates in areas like legal and compliance or what have you. And so evolving some of those offerings to create some operational efficiencies and some increased operational excellence with the Wealth Partners firms are the kind of things that we can do there. And then, the other thing -- and in an AMG way, be incredibly respectful of the autonomy each of these firms have and their relationships with their clients. We also think that, over time, there is the opportunity for us to build pipes between some of the products that our affiliates are running and some that they are building and these wealth partner firms. And just as we talked about, the feedback loop phenomenon with the global distribution, that same kind of thing works in the wealth management industry as well, where we now have very close relationships, obviously, with four outstanding wealth management firms and bringing that information back to affiliates is also helpful as they work on product development and things. So we think there's some really good opportunities to extend what we are doing and also some really good synergies between the parts of our business.","Chris Shutler ","And then just one more quick one on EIG. I was just wondering if you could give us a quick update in terms of how far along they are in committing capital to their new fund and whether -- I'm guessing the big decline in oil could actually present some nice opportunities investment for them. And then, lastly, do you expect them to contribute to performance fees in 2015?","Sean Healey ","So high level -- and Nate can fill in if I miss something. High level, you have got it exactly right. They have a large fund that they've just raised. And so looking forward, they are where a lot of other people are -- want to be. In other words, I think there are a lot of people who wish they had large funds that were available to take advantage of opportunities, which we are sure are going to present themselves.","Historically, and this is just not to go too much into the details of the particular investment, but I think broadly, people understand that the management partners bought the business out of TCW and so there was an arrangement where our participation is really on the funds since they have that -- since they separated from TCW. So for us, the forward opportunity is we think tremendous. We are not really impacted by the performance fees or whatever happens or doesn't happen in performance fees on historical funds. By the way, the nature of their approach has always been to be extremely conservative and consistent in a way that they invest. And so we actually think this kind of volatility will -- is an environment or a market where, looking back a year from now, I think clients will be rewarded and appreciate the conservatism and the diversification that EIG has.","And so I think as in any difficult period, the best firms really distinguish themselves. You sort of aren\u2019t happy that you are going through that difficult period, but when you come out the other side of it, the forward opportunity -- the long-term opportunity, I think, is going to be even better.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.","Robert Lee ","I guess a big first question, I guess, for Jay. You mentioned restructuring the non-US investments. Could you maybe kind of walk us through a little bit of the why of that and maybe some of the benefits and how we should think of it flowing through the P&L?","Jay Horgen ","Sure. So the commercial aspects of it, I think they tie back to the scale of our business. When you think about the early days of AMG, we need all of our money back in the US to pay down our debt. And now that we have all this cash flow coming out of the core business and a much more diverse business and, frankly, more offshore entities that source capital offshore, it affords us the opportunity to match our sources and uses, because as Sean mentioned, our pipeline as well as this past year reflected new investments that could be non-US. And having that need for capital offshore and the ability for us to structure the uses and sources close together, it gives us the benefit of a global tax rate as opposed to a US tax rate.","So what you see in the numbers is really the accounting entries that occurred in the fourth quarter. We plan for it through the year. I think, from the prior call, you remember we had some extra deal expenses related to structuring in the second and third quarter when we knew Veritas was coming in. We completed all of that in the fourth quarter. And these accounting entries effectively unwound the tax liability that we had in the US that accumulated over time for businesses that really were generating earnings offshore in favor of experiencing this global tax rate so it went through our taxes -- our GAAP tax rate. That is why they equally offset. That number was about $26 million. So if you add $26 million back to our IRDT, it would have been $20 million in the quarter. It would have been a normal quarter. If you add $26 million back to our GAAP taxes, you would have seen a tax rate that was consistent with GAAP, that\u2019s 34%, 35%.","So what does that mean? It means nothing for 2014 other than accounting. But going forward, it gives us the ability to just experience a lower global tax rate, which is lower than the US, because the US hasn't caught up to other countries' tax rates. And so it will add to our bottom line over time. It won't be in the magnitude that we see for the accounting, but as you've probably heard from me over the last couple quarters, we are already seeing the forward benefits of the 2015 GAAP tax rate is expected to be 34% and the cash much lower than that at 23%. So we are already starting to see it. That was in our 2015 guidance. But what we don't give is 2016 or 2017 or 2018 guidance, so we do expect that to continue to go down over time. So there is a cumulative effect of that over time.","Robert Lee ","And then maybe also sticking with capital management. One of the things that you have seen across the industry, which you guys haven't had to deal with, but you have seen increased seed capital demand. I mean, a lot of companies deployed -- deploying a lot of capital towards seeding new products. And it may be helpful, at least for me, to walk through what is it about your structure that you haven't had to really face those capital demands, so to speak, to help affiliates seed new products to any substantial degree, at least?","Sean Healey ","I will start and then ask Nate to give you some specific examples. I would say, at a higher level -- or at the highest level, we are investing in firms which, by definition, when we make the investment, have a good track record, excellent performance, and products with capacity, the opportunity for and commitment to, in a measured way, achieve strong growth in assets and earnings over time. And so to some extent, it is not as if we inherited or arrived with a whole set of products which were at capacity and then we had to sort of scramble to create them. Our affiliates absolutely -- and there's a great track record and we give you lots of examples -- they do innovate. And part of running an excellent business and building an enduring franchise is thinking strategically about the development of product capability over time, different of course, for every affiliate. So we absolutely do have that, but we also have uniquely, I would say, relative to peers of our size, the opportunity to, through our new investment strategy, to bring in through investments and new affiliates, new products, which are already immediately saleable. They have got a great track record and they add immediately to the capacity of the product set broadly.","And so that, I think, is very distinguishing. That said, on an ongoing basis, one of the things that we are going to do, including in broadening the scope of our investment activity, is continue to support what our affiliates are doing in building out their product set. And in some cases, that involves seed capital. Maybe I will let Nate give a little more detail.","Nate Dalton ","I think that is -- so that is exactly right. So just picking up where Sean left that off, and this is -- I will tie back to the feedback loop comment that I made before and sort of this -- one of the virtuous circles that we have created. So as we are being able to bring back more of this information to our affiliates and participate in a different way than we would have 5 or 10 years ago in a product development opportunity conversation, we are more involved broadly in that product development opportunity conversation. And a component part of that has been at a very small level. But over time, one could see increasingly including using capital to help grow products. And I think it is probably the idea of seeding, but also probably bringing product to scale. So that\u2019s a piece of it.","So I don't -- I think, as Sean said, it\u2019s something we have done and also at a small level, but you could see increasing. The other piece is, as we increase our packaging capability, that\u2019s the other place that you will see some seed capital possibly come into the product development conversation. And so as we are building out that -- those distribution platforms and as we are increasing the information we are bringing back to our affiliates and participating in the product development conversations, this is something that we do do and you can see increasing over time.","Sean Healey ","Yes. And we are going to do it in an offensive way -- in an opportunistic way as opposed to, in some settings, we see others talk about seed capital almost from a defensive standpoint. For us, the only thing I would add to the comments that we have made. If you think about it, one of the essential elements of our business strategy is the skin in the game -- the alignment of interest and our affiliate partners have direct equity in their firms. And they also are committed to their firms in the sense that their net worth is not just in the equity, it is also in the firm's products. And that is something that is very appealing to clients and we see that across the product set, for traditional and alternative. And very often, the proceeds that come out of an investment by AMG go right back into the firm's products, which of course clients love.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell ","Just a little bit more on the organic growth fourth quarter to first quarter. I think Nate, you talked about roughly $1 billion outflows that were lumpy from the subadvisory and the institutional mandates in the fourth quarter. So that would sort of bring you back to where you were in the third quarter, with the $6 billion of institutional flows and $1.5 billion out of mutual fund. Just coming into the first quarter, given the mandates that you won in the fourth quarter to be funded coming into the first quarter, and then as you think about the mutual fund business, with the positive seasonality that we have in the first quarter and the progress that you are making, do you think you can turn that mutual fund outflow around to a positive inflow in the first quarter? And then do you guys still feel good about the roughly $5 billion to $10 billion type of quarterly run rate in net flows?","Nate Dalton ","Yes. Again, I don't think I would build it up that way, frankly. So I think if you -- a couple things, just to make sure we are -- I was sort of being clear when I went through the fourth quarter first. So we talked about two lumpy outflows and I think each kind of in that range or sort of average kind of in that range you just described. So I think, just to be clear about that.","And then when we look at the underlying drivers, so how would I sort of describe the quarter and then we can sort of go back through them and say, well, how do these play out going forward. So if I just at a very high level think about the fourth quarter, I'd say very strong growth sales; the mutual fund channel, as you have observed, sort of impacted by general headwinds in US equities; and our mutual fund book being skewed to US equities. So there was that headwind in the quarter. And we had a couple lumpy outflows, as we've talked about, sort of institutional and subadvisory, both impacted by that. And for us, remember that subadvisory flow is showing up in the mutual fund channel. So I think you can look at those being kind of one-offs. Some seasonality in the mutual fund channel. So we talked about that. And again, sort of sizing that, sort of a little under $1 billion or something is maybe a way to size that. So there is that sort of seasonality in the channel.","And then you sort of ask, okay, well, how does that set you up going into Q1. And I think -- I'm not sure I would say much more than what I did, which is when you sort of look at the underlying drivers -- the product set, the performance, and the distribution resources that we have got, institutional continues that trend, as you observed. And the mutual fund channel is trending better and we can look at that in the numbers that are in. But it\u2019s very, very early in the quarter. But those are the things I would say. So underlying drivers. We feel good about the performance. We feel good about the -- we sort of look at the level of activity and the level of our fees and the level of finals and sort of can see that in the institutional channel that kind of consistency. And then, the mutual fund channel is shaping up so that January is sort of a better month than the month in the fourth quarter.","Sean Healey ","Yes. I think we will leave it there. Hopefully gives you some insight into what we see in the forward opportunity. But I think we are the only public asset management firm to give forward earnings guidance. I don't also want to be the only public asset manager management firm to give forward flow guidance. So we'll leave it where we have. But hopefully, it was helpful.","Brian Bedell ","Yes. That was very helpful. Maybe just the last one from me is on the Wealth Partners, strategy with Baker Street. I guess, do you see that -- and I know you touched on this a little bit with the broad investment pipeline comments. But from a wealth management perspective, do you see adding more boutiques like that? And then how do you think about distributing the AMG product through those boutiques such as Baker Street? Should we think of that as a compelling growth opportunity?","Nate Dalton ","Yes. So the first part of your question, our Wealth Partners colleagues definitely have a strong pipeline. Lots of good conversations. And I would say that our brand -- we have been doing it for a couple years now and our brand is sort of increasingly becoming known in the channels. It just takes some time. We have built the AMG brand in the boutique asset management firm over 20-plus years and they are building the AMG brand among the best wealth management firms and doing a great job and have obviously added a fantastic affiliate just announced this morning. So that pipeline is good and they are making good progress. So that is the first part of it.","The second part -- and I think I said some of this in answer to a prior question. I think we won't -- I am not sure the right way to think about it is just -- and again, maybe I am getting too caught up in the way we talk about it. But I'm not sure the right way to describe it exactly is AMG distributing through these firms. I think the way I would talk about it is we have outstanding partnerships, relationships, friendships with a bunch of the best active -- manufacturers of active return streams, manufacturers of return streams in the world. And they have products, that are the kinds of products that many of these wealth firms do today use. And there is some use already today. And so if we can make that -- just as we talk about with institutional distribution or elsewhere. If we can make the access easier, make sure people clearly understand the products and how to use them and where use them. But we make that access easier. And we make the sales marketing clients process easier, we think we can make -- we can create an opportunity for some of the best wealth management firms in the world, who face the same problem \u2013 same problem that institutions around the world face, which is how do they allocate their time to be able to access easily some of the best manufacturers of return streams in the world. We think there will be an opportunity for them to use our affiliates.","And so we certainly see the opportunity for them to use our affiliates and we see the opportunity for our affiliates to build very strong client relationships there. But I don't think we would necessarily talk about it as sort of a -- in sort of a product push kind of -- not to imply that.","Sean Healey ","Absolutely. And the two things I would add. One, a couple years ago when we were talking about this, I think people said, oh, interesting. How big can it be? And I said, well, maybe in 5 years, it could be $50 billion and maybe it could be even bigger than that. So with $25 billion across these four affiliates is -- makes just in a couple of years our platform one of the largest independent wealth management firms in the country. And so we see lots of opportunity from organic growth to of course investments in additional Wealth Partners affiliates. And then that is a one.","Number two is, remember, again, this is entirely incremental. Different team, different approach, and leveraging, of course, the infrastructure and capabilities that we have. But it\u2019s entirely incremental to the core affiliate investing activity. And as we look at other opportunities that are broadening to our opportunity set, they have the same feature incremental, positive opportunities.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Greggory Warren with Morningstar.","Greggory Warren ","More sort of a high level thought. When we look at the industry flows for December, they are a little bit quirky on the active side. I think there's only two categories -- sector equity and muni bonds where there is actually positive flows into active funds during the month. And things have sort of tempered a bit as we roll into January here. I'm just wondering, I mean, first quarter is kind of a big period for reallocations amongst institutional and advisor clients. And just wondering what kind of trends you are seeing right now. How are clients looking to sort of set up for this year? I know Morgan Stanley came out this morning and pushed out their forecast for interest rates rising into next year. So I'm just kind of curious what kind of trends you are seeing out there right now?","Sean Healey ","Well, first, the fourth quarter was unusual in a number of respects. Obviously, you had -- long-term fixed income flows were impacted by one firm having one major news event. And last year was a tough year for active equities for reasons we all understand. Prospectively, it\u2019s anybody's guess as to -- and it really is a guess. I think we all can -- in the short term, no one knows. In the medium to long term, I think, with a level of underlying optimism about the American economy and world economies and an appreciation for history, one can imagine that fixed-income flows will reverse as rates rise. Even if rates don't rise, they stay at these very low levels for an extended period. There is no way for individuals or institutions who need to generate returns in order to fund retirement or meet plan objectives that they can do that by investing in fixed income. So our view is that there will be -- again, anybody's guess as to exactly when -- but there will be a rotation out of fixed income into return-oriented products.","There is a second phenomenon, of course, occurring, which is the whole active-passive debate. And the prevailing narrative that you read in every newspaper is, of course, the death of active equity. And I think it will be a tough period or there will be volatility in the industry and many active equity managers who don't have high active share and don't add value are going to be replaced by passive products and they should be. But the world isn't as simple. And in our view, we see and we are privileged to be partners with a number of really excellent firms, who have very differentiated approaches. Obviously, we think there is something special about boutiques in these alpha generating product areas.","And so over time, just as you see with the largest, most sophisticated clients in the world who were early into barbelling, taking a lot of the beta exposure they wanted and doing it either themselves or very cheaply in passive products, but have an ongoing and in some cases increasing demand for differentiated alpha generating products, we think that -- just as that phenomenon continues to play out among global institutional investors, we think that will increasingly play out among retail investors for some of the same reasons. And so in the short term, who knows. In the medium to long term, we think these trends will be significant and enduring and very much -- not exclusively to us, but we think that our strategy and product set will be a large beneficiary.","Greggory Warren ","Okay. Could we just take that maybe one step further, then? If we think about the notion that -- because it\u2019s sort of our thought, too, as we look out longer-term. Active managers that are underperforming, or closet indexing that aren\u2019t beating their benchmarks are likely to either close down, consolidate in other funds. You're going to have potentially consolidation within the industry. I'm just wondering as you look at sort of the longer-term picture, does this kind of benefit you if some of the smaller boutique managers are, a) having a more difficult time getting onto platforms because you have got these larger asset management firms overall, especially on the broker-dealer channel, kind of vying for that shelf space. Does this really improve the profile of your firm over the long run?","Sean Healey ","Why don't I let Nate answer the question with respect to how we benefit or how that kind of a phenomenon could benefit us. The one other point I wanted to make before I hand over to Nate is, remember, our product set is focused on global and emerging market equities, where I think it is easier to add alpha. For sure, excellent focus niche US equity managers can do that as well. But we are predominantly global and emerging market equities and alternatives, including in the retail channel liquid alternatives. And so that plays into or helps as you think about product positioning over time. And being -- having products on the right side of the barbell.","Nate Dalton ","Sure. So let me take -- let me try and approach that last part of the question that you asked. Because I think we fundamentally agree with it. Well, I think we fundamentally agree with where you are coming out. I think that there are some questions around what is causing it and I think what may cause it and I think the causes may be linked and may leverage off each other. So if you sort of step back and use the example of the wires or some very large platform. So and some of what I'm going to say here is also applicable to the platforms we are encountering around the world and also just some of the large institutions around the world.","So one of the things that -- and I will put all of it under the theme of bringing the benefits of scale while keeping scale out of the picture in the places where we think focus boutiques add value and where scale is the enemy, not your friend. But bringing benefit to scale to bear. So agree with the conclusion I think you're coming to, which is if you sort of think about one of the wires -- so what are the kinds of things that we can help with. So some of it is just the operational and risk management and all of those things that the wire is going to worry about. Because they have a fundamental problem, which is how do they meet the needs of their clients, how do they build the best portfolios, given the liability streams they are trying to help their clients with and the risk profiles of their clients.","So some of it is just the ease of interaction and building the operational pipes, the right packages. And so absolutely scale is helpful there and we have done lots of that. Some of it is understanding that and then what their priorities are and being able to have the kinds of conversations with them at sort of a key accounts or for a key client relationship kind of level to really understand what their priorities are and to help them meet those needs. And to be able to bring to bear all of the products that our affiliates have into those conversations. So that is worth them having a very complete joined up conversation with us about all of the kinds of things they are working on. We are one of the largest places that they could go, one of the most complete places they could go, for these active return streams and equities and alternatives. We are one of the largest in the world in those areas if you think about it as a single point of access.","So that kind of key accounts, understanding them, helping them meet their needs, ease of access, those are places where we do think we should be able to benefit. Lots more work to do, but I think we're -- other teams are making good progress. And then the final thing I will add -- and this is definitely true for the retail channels -- is the ability to support. So we, at our scale, will be able to provide the kinds of support, hopefully, that they would receive from the largest institutions with whom they have a relationship. So I think we should be able to have that complete engagement and so if we are able to achieve that, I think those trends will absolutely benefit us. And I think to the extent those things are important, whether it is on the operational side, whether it is on that kind of key accounts and complete understanding and ease of access, whether it is on the support, those are all things that are very challenging for a boutique to build and maintain against a single investment process or a single investment product or discipline. So to the extent those things happen, I think that will benefit us. I do think, whether that is also coming from the sort of the closet indexing points you made [indiscernible], I think they are related and complementary points.","Sean Healey ","And I think the one other piece that was embedded in your question was with all that we are building and these positive trends unfolding, does that give us an incremental opportunity to build capability and capacity through investments in smaller firms that have attractive products. And the answer is absolutely yes and we think that will be an increasing theme going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Mike Carrier ","Keep this quick. Just given the moves that we have seen in FX and commodities, I guess first on FX, just a strong dollar. How does that impact the P&L? And then, on commodities, just any significant exposures among the affiliates? And then, Jay, I think last quarter, you guys mentioned just the level of buybacks. This quarter, I don't think I heard it, so I just wanted some clarity. I would expect it to be lower, just given the amount of capital deployed in the quarter, but just wanted to get some clarity on that.","Jay Horgen ","Sure. So on FX, it runs through our investment performance line. So as an AUM matter, it just comes out in that line item. So we have been impacted negatively for the past several quarters, I think it is three quarters running, by the AUM having an FX component to it. And it has been noticeable. It\u2019s not a small amount, but it has been noticeable. I think most recently, it's started to reverse itself. So maybe there is some positive lift going forward as currencies start to stabilize around the world. So that is where it runs through.","As it relates to client billings and other aspects of our business, it is a much more modest impact. So we have very little mark to market exposure, in part because most of our clients -- not all, but most of our clients are billed in US dollars. And where they are not, it is either modest level of exposure or we have agreed with that affiliate to pay us in US dollars. So there is also some contractual arrangements there. And where we have operations offshore, we keep cash offshore to match funds. So that is how we handle FX and I think other than the AUM impact, everything else is relatively small. Hopefully that answers that question.","And then as it relates to your share repurchase, yes, the way I answered it, which I think it did answer it, last quarter, we gave guidance that 2015 would have 57 million shares weighted average, which of course the weighted average number. We have moved that down to 56.5 million. We are actually below that level right now, but that would be expected. We're 56.3 million weighted average in the fourth quarter. That would be expected if you think about the whole four quarters of next year. That implies no new share repurchases.","Nate Dalton ","And maybe just a second on the points you asked about commodities. So I think there is nothing really I would focus you on. I mean, we do have a set of affiliates that have commodities products, including some long short commodities and some balance risk commodities. I think some benefited, some didn't. I think the balance risk things did really well because the relatively worse performance in oil. But so there is that. We obviously talked -- Sean spoke to EIG before and the real opportunity they see. In fact, they have a bunch of capital put to work and are also out raising capital for additional products, given the opportunity set.","They see -- and then, as a relates to how those things play through our different equity portfolios, again, I think there is sort of a mix -- some that have benefited, some that hadn't. I would probably say couple of the Canadian portfolios, some regional equities were -- it has probably made things a little tougher. But overall, nothing I would really call out, other than the EIG we talked about already.","End of Q&A","Operator","Thank you. Mr. Healey, there are no further questions. At this time, I would like to turn the floor back to you for any final remarks.","Sean Healey ","Thank you again for joining us this morning. As you have heard, we were pleased with our results for the quarter and the year and we are confident in our ability to continue to generate meaningful earnings growth, both through organic growth and accretive investments in new affiliates going forward.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Selene Oh, Vice President, Investor Relations for AMG. Thank you. You may begin.","Selene Oh - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Thank you for joining AMG to discuss the results for the first quarter of 2017. In this conference call, certain matters discussed will constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected due to a number of factors including, but not limited to, those referenced in the company's Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the call.","AMG will provide on the Investor Relations section of its website at www.amg.com a replay of the call and a copy of our announcement of our results for the quarter, as well as a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of any estimates of the company's economic earnings per share for future periods that are announced on this call.","With us on the line to discuss the company's results for the quarter are Sean Healey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Nate Dalton, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Jay Horgen, Chief Financial Officer.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Sean Healey.","Sean M. Healey - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Thanks, Selene, and good morning, everyone. AMG generated year-over-year growth in the first quarter across our key performance metrics, including record assets under management of $754 billion, a 17% increase over the first quarter of 2016; and economic earnings per share of $3.21, a 10% increase from the year-ago quarter.","Our results reflect the successful execution of our growth strategy, including the impact of new Affiliates and the excellent investment performance and growth of our existing Affiliates.","During the quarter, our Affiliates' alternative products generated strong positive net client cash flows, which were offset by elevated outflows from U.S. equity strategies, resulting in modest outflows overall.","Looking ahead, as Nate will describe, we see positive flow momentum across our business over the balance of the year as we continue to see global institutional retail clients increased their allocations to truly active value-added products even as they may also expand their passive beta exposures. Given the quality and breadth of our Affiliates' alternative and differentiated global equities strategies, AMG is well-positioned to generate strong long-term organic growth.","Through our strategic focus on areas where we see secular demand trends, and where boutique firms excel, AMG has built one of the largest and broadest alternative product sets in the industry, and clients seeking uncorrelated return streams recognized our Affiliates as among the best managers in the world.","With over $290 billion in assets managed across relative value, systematic diversified, private equity, multi-strategy, and other alternative products, our Affiliates in these areas provide true diversification, both in terms of cross-correlation as well as relative to traditional fixed income and equity markets.","In addition to growing demand for uncorrelated alternative strategies, trends favoring alpha-oriented products will also benefit high-conviction, high-active share equity strategies, especially in global and emerging market equities, which account for approximately one-third of our assets under management.","We believe that passive equity products will take share from poorly performing core equity products, while differentiated truly active strategies, especially in non-U.S. equities, will continue to see growth.","Of course, in every area of asset management, the fundamental measure of success is investment performance. Contrary to the conventional narrative, there are active managers which have and will continue to generate alpha. AMG's partnered with a substantial number of these firms over the past 24 years, and we believe that the best boutique firms are positioned to outperform benchmarks and peers over the long term. And across an array of alpha-oriented strategies, leading independent firms are recognized by clients as among the best managers in the industry.","We've built AMG's business based on the fundamental belief that specialist firms have meaningful competitive advantages in generating alpha, including distinct, highly focused operating and investment processes, alignment of interest through direct equity ownership and unique entrepreneurial cultures. AMG's partnership approach preserves these attributes across generations of management partners, and the advantages of our structure can be seen in our Affiliates' outstanding long-term performance records.","As Nate will describe further, in the first quarter, our Affiliates continue to generate excellent investment results across a diverse array of differentiated, high value-added strategies.","AMG's partnership approach allows individual Affiliates to retain their investment focus and alignment with clients, even as AMG itself has become one of the largest global asset managers. While consolidation is a topic of increasing interest in the asset management industry, we believe that consolidation and scale do not enhance, and often detract, from the primary mission of an active manager, alpha generation.","AMG's business model allows us to leverage our global scale on behalf of our Affiliates in areas where scale is a benefit, such as marketing and compliance. But importantly, our partnership approach protects the unique operating investment culture of each individual Affiliate and the close alignment of client interest, preserving the essential advantages in alpha generation, which will further extend our Affiliates' long-term track records of success.","Turning to new investments, we continue to make progress in executing on our substantial and unique opportunity to invest in outstanding new Affiliates. Given our proprietary relationship set with the most highly regarded independent firms worldwide, along with our reputation and unmatched track record as a partner to our Affiliates over the past two decades, we are confident that we will continue to generate incremental earnings growth through accretive investments and additional Affiliates.","With the scale of AMG's global business today, we're also able to maintain our commitment to proven capital allocation, consistent capital return to shareholders, and significant long-term value creation. As you know, last quarter, we initiated a dividend evidencing this commitment, and going forward, we expect to increase the dividend while continuing to enhance shareholder returns through accretive investments in new Affiliates and share repurchases.","Finally, and against a backdrop of heightened political and macroeconomic uncertainty, AMG's business is well-positioned to generate sustained long-term earnings growth. Our broad range of alternative strategies and differentiated global equity products is increasingly attractive to clients seeking to balance their passive beta exposures, and a more volatile market environment will provide enhanced opportunities for our Affiliates to continue to distinguish themselves through meaningful alpha generation.","Lastly, the breadth and diversity of our alternative strategies, which are uncorrelated with traditional markets and with each other, will provide stability and upside opportunity to our earnings, and substantial free cash flow across market cycles.","With that, I'll turn it to Nate to discuss our Affiliates results in more detail.","Nathaniel Dalton - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Thanks and good morning, everyone. As Sean said, in the first quarter, our Affiliates, and especially our largest Affiliates, had excellent investment performance across a broad range of alternatives and truly active equity products.","We continue to believe that the best managers' products that deliver excess returns through market cycles, whether in traditional or alternative asset classes, will remain critical components of client portfolios as these clients need to generate returns to meet their liabilities. Our Affiliates have produced outstanding results over long periods of time, and again this quarter, many of them generated excess returns, extending those long-term track records.","Now I'll cover performance in more detail in a moment, but first let me provide a bit of context to our slightly negative flows for the quarter. There were several underlying themes. First, we continue to see very good demand for a large number of our alternative products across the full range of client types. Second, consistent with the broader environment, we continue to see weakness within U.S. equities. Finally, and most impactful to the first quarter, we had two lumpy institutional outflows, one in global equity and one in U.S. equity. Each of the underlying products has performed well, and we believe these redemptions were driven by specific client rebalancing decisions.","Now in the case of the lost U.S. equity mandate, a portion has already been reallocated to the same Affiliate in a different product in the second quarter.","Now, looking ahead, we feel very good about the positive momentum we now have in the retail and high net worth areas, as our product set includes a large number of in-demand alternative and global equity products, and also as our U.S. equity retail outflows have continued to moderate as absolute and benchmark relative performance has improved in this area.","We also feel very good about our institutional growth opportunities, especially as we begin to move into the primary fundraising cycles for a number of our significant illiquid strategies and, in addition, our pipeline of one, but unfunded institutional mandates include some very large pieces of business.","Now, turning to the details for the quarter. As a reminder, our product categories include alternatives; global equities, including both developed and emerging markets; U.S. equities; and multi-asset and other strategies. In addition, we'll continue to discuss our alternative products at the sub-category level to dimension underlying return in flow dynamics that are lost at the aggregate level.","Now, as you may have seen, we've introduced our new product category disclosure in the tables of our press release as we believe it helps further describe and contextualize our business.","Now, for the specifics and starting with our alternative strategies, which account for approximately 39% of our business by assets, within private equity and real assets, our Affiliates, including Baring Asia, EIG and Pantheon continue to maintain and enhance their solid long-term track records across their flagship offerings.","As we said before, these historical returns will drive strong interest for the upcoming capital-raising cycle. In addition, each of these firms continues to enhance and broaden our product sets, which over time will produce additional significant growth opportunities.","In the fixed income and equity relative value area, major hedge fund indices posted positive returns in the quarter as indicated by the HFRI Relative Value Index with a 2.2% return, the HFRI Equity Hedge Index with a 3.8% return, and the HFRI Event-Driven Activist Index with a 1% return for the period. Performance across our Affiliates was also very strong on an absolute and relative basis as AQR, BlueMountain, Capula and ValueAct all performed well.","Within our multi-strategy and other category, indices were generally positive for the quarter as indicated by the HFRI Fund Weighted Composite return of 2.4%. Against that backdrop, most of our Affiliate strategies generated good, absolute and relative returns in the quarter. AQR and First Quadrant's largest strategy in the category, including alternative risk premia and risk parity strategies, produced solid positive returns benefiting from their broad portfolio positioning in the quarter as most underlying exposures performed well.","In our systematic diversified category, the SocGen Trend Index fell by about 0.9% and against that backdrop, results among AQR, Systematica and Winton products were mixed in the quarter. But we continue to see good client demand for these strategies as they've uncorrelated return streams and many of them have historically performed well in strongly downward trending markets.","Turning next to flows in our alternatives calculation for the quarter, we had good organic growth with $4.3 billion of net inflows, supported by both strong retail and institutional sales. It's also worth pointing out that we generated these positive flows almost entirely across our more liquid alternative subcategories.","On the other hand, within our private equity and more illiquid product set, we had continued realization activity from maturing funds without the offset benefit of meaningful fundraising. Now, as we discussed last quarter, we have a very significant upcoming fundraising cycle for illiquids that's weighed to the back half of this year and the first half of 2018. Although we should start to see some initial activity in the second quarter of this year.","Now, moving to our global equities category, which accounts for approximately 33% of our business by assets, global developed markets had a strong quarter with the MSCI World Index returning 6.5%. Our Affiliates generated excellent returns in the quarter as well with the primary strategies from AQR, Harding Loevner, Trilogy, Tweedy, Browne and Veritas outperforming the benchmarks.","Emerging markets provided even stronger returns with the benchmark MSCI Emerging Markets Index up 11.5% in the quarter, both AQR and Harding Loevner outpaces index, but Genesis lags in the quarter but still maintained an excellent long-term track record.","Within global equities, we have $1.1 billion in net outflows as growth within our retail and high net worth channels, both of which continues to see solid positive momentum, was offset by elevated institutional redemption levels, most notably the single, large institutional redemption I mentioned earlier.","Across global equities more broadly, AMG's largest Affiliates \u2013 AQR, Artemis, Genesis, Harding Loevner, Tweedy, Browne and Veritas \u2013 all continued to have excellent long-term track records and we feel quite good about where we are with the category as a whole.","Now, turning next to U.S. equities which accounts for approximately 15% of our business by assets. Market performance was mixed with large cap and growth stocks generating strong returns. For the quarter, the S&P 500 returned 6.1%, while the Russell 2000 Index returned 2.5%.","Our performance against these benchmarks was also mixed in the quarter. Our performance includes Frontier, GW&K, SouthernSun and Yacktman; although largest strategy, the TimesSquare, missed their benchmarks in the quarter.","Within U.S. equities, we have $4.6 billion in net outflows and that's in line with industry-wide trends in the product category. While we have a broad array of specialist strategies that we believe will continue to track client demands over time, especially within the small and midcap spaces, this was a particularly challenging quarter as the one large institutional redemption I mentioned, along with overall institutional demand weakness, more than offset the continued improvement in retail flows.","Turning finally to our multi-asset and other category, which accounts for about 13% of our business by assets and that encompasses multi-strategy and balanced mandates in our wealth management Affiliates, as well as a number of multi-asset and specialty fixed income products, including municipal bond as well as Canadian and UK fixed income strategies.","Now on the wealth side, we saw good growth from performance across these generally customized portfolios as well as continued positive net flows. In the specially fixed income space, performance was generally good and we continued to see solid net flows into the our muni bond and other fixed income strategies. Overall, within the category, we had roughly $200 million in positive net flows.","Now looking ahead, with an excellent group of in-demand strategies across global and emerging markets equities and a wide range of liquid alternatives, coupled with an upcoming significant private equity fundraising cycle, we're well-positioned to generate long-term organic growth. We also believe that the combination of dedicated local sales and marketing efforts in our Affiliates, in partnership with the global scale and reach of AMG's complementary distribution platforms, creates an even greater opportunity to drive significant growth across the business.","With that, let me turn to Jay to discuss our financials.","Jay C. Horgen - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Thank you, Nate.","As Sean discussed, our first quarter results reflect strong year-over-year growth across our key performance metrics. With assets under management of $754 billion, up 17% from a year ago, we continue to meaningfully increase the scale, diversity and earnings power of our business.","As you saw on the release, we reported economic earnings per share of $3.21 for the first quarter, which included net performance fees of $0.18. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $2.13.","Turning to our performance metrics, for the first quarter, aggregate revenue grew 37% to $1.4 billion from a year ago, driven by significant growth in equity method revenue due to the impact of our 2016 new investments, all of which were equity method Affiliates, together with stronger markets and a higher level of performance fees.","The ratio of aggregate revenue to average assets under management increased from a year ago both on a management fee-only basis and in total, reflecting our 2016 new investments, which added a number of high-quality alternative managers at slightly higher management fee rates and also contributed to a higher level of performance fees in the quarter.","Adjusted EBITDA grew 13% to $243.8 million from a year ago, driven by the impact of our new investments, together with stronger markets and a higher level of performance fees, and reflected our mix between consolidated and equity method Affiliates.","Economic net income grew 15% to $183.2 million from a year ago as a result of lower interest expense as we've continued to reduce leverage. Economic earnings per share increased 10% to $3.21 from a year ago, which includes the full effect of last year's equity issuance.","Now turning to more specific modeling items, for the first quarter, the ratio of adjusted EBITDA to average assets under management was 13.1 basis points or 12.2 basis points excluding performance fees. We expect this ratio to be between 12.8 basis points and 13.1 basis points in the second quarter, reflecting a range of net performance fees of $0.06 to $0.12 per share.","With regard to our taxes, our effective GAAP tax rate was 32.1% and our cash tax rate was 21.1% in the first quarter. Going forward, for modeling purposes, we expect our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 33% and our cash tax rate to be approximately 21%.","Intangible-related deferred taxes for the first quarter were $19.8 million and in the second quarter, we expect this number to remain at approximately $20 million.","Our share of reported amortization for the first quarter was $38.5 million, which includes $21.7 million of amortization from Affiliates accounted for under the equity method. Amortization increased as a result of our 2016 new investments, all of which were equity method Affiliates. For the second quarter, we expect our share of amortization to remain at approximately $38 million.","Our share of interest expense for the first quarter was $21.9 million and in the second quarter, we expect our share of interest expense to remain at approximately $22 million.","Other economic items for the first quarter were $2.4 million and for modeling purposes, we expect other economic items to be approximately $1 million per quarter.","Our adjusted weighted average share count for the quarter was approximately 57 million and we expect it to be approximately 56.6 million for the second quarter, reflecting continued repurchases.","Finally, turning to our balance sheet. In the first quarter, we initiated cash dividend of $0.20 per share and we repurchased $80 million for approximately 0.5 million shares. We expect to repurchase an additional $120 million in the second quarter, bringing our total to $200 million in the first half of 2017.","Looking forward to the remainder of the year, we expect to maintain balance sheet flexibility to fund new investments or repurchase additional shares, while also building capacity for the future by delivering, including the expected retirement or a $200 million retail bond in the third quarter, which would be accretive to earnings given its relatively high cost.","With the full-year effect of our new investments, the earnings power of our business has increased, generating run rate EBITDA of over $1.1 billion and we are well positioned to continue to execute on our growth strategy, while consistently returning capital to shareholders.","Now, we'll be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. In the interest of time, we ask that you each ask one question and invite you to rejoin the queue. Our first question comes from the line of Chris Shutler with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Sean M. Healey - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Good morning, Chris.","Chris Charles Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","So, when you say that you're seeing positive flow momentum across the business over the balance of the year, can you just break that down a little more, and would you feel that way even without the big private equity fundraises?","Nathaniel Dalton - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Yeah. So, I'll start this. So I think, if you look at our flows overall sort of trends over the last couple years, we've generally been generating sort of modest positive flows across the entire business, with a significant part coming through the institutional channel.","And when we look at good momentum in the more retail sides of our business, what we \u2013 the retail and high net worth parts of our business, good, positive continued momentum there. A lot of that coming through all, but also slowing outflows in places like U.S. equities, where there had been kind of drags. So I feel good about that.","And then we look at the institutional channel, and it's certainly got a component of the illiquids and private equity piece that you described. And I should also remind, as we said in our prepared remarks, there's a realization component to that, which has kind of been ongoing underneath the business.","So, I think we've got those realizations. We've got the pipeline kind of deferred for that. But honestly, you look at the one on funded mandates and the pipeline of kind of finals activity and all of that, we feel good about \u2013 there are some very large wins in there in the institutional channel.","Now, predicting exactly which quarter are hard and all that, but you sort of \u2013 you look at the back half of the year \u2013 or really the balance of the year, which I think is how you framed the question, and yeah, we feel pretty good about it. Again, any one quarter will have lumpy things in it, but we feel good about it over the balance of the year.","And then you add on top of that the illiquid pipeline, which I think we have more \u2013 not visibility to the specific amounts, but we have pretty good visibility to the track records of the kinds of firms \u2013 Baring, EIG, Pantheon \u2013 that are going to be out raising money, and you make some conservative estimates about what those firms should be able to do, given their track record and the very strong performance they've been generating, and we feel quite good about that.","Sean M. Healey - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","And those are attractive flows when they come. And as Nate noted right now, we're just getting the outs, if you will, the realizations, without the accompanying flows, which over time will be more balanced. And obviously, some fantastic firms are representing us in those areas. So, on an overall basis, we do feel quite optimistic.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Sean M. Healey - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. I was just looking for an update on fee pressure and can you talk about, if any of your Affiliates have reduced prices in some of their larger products? And also, when they're launching newer products, are the fees today generally lower than they were five years ago on similar products?","And then also, when you're going into a new platform or big relationship, what type of fee concessions could be offered in that? And I know like, there's a lot of different scenarios there, but I'm just looking for kind of high-level, kind of general data points here.","Sean M. Healey - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Jay, why don't you start by reminding everyone of the aggregate revenue and fee measure overall?","Jay C. Horgen - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Sean M. Healey - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","And then, maybe Nate, you can give some color.","Jay C. Horgen - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, Craig. So just at the top level, the ratio of our aggregate revenue to average assets under management has actually increased from a year ago. It's increased on a management fee-only basis as well as a total basis, as I have mentioned. That's because obviously, we've added a number of high-quality alternative managers that have higher management fee rates and also contributed to the performance fee opportunity, but also, our alternative managers are growing as part of our mix, the existing Affiliates.","So even when you exclude 2016's new investments, our fee rates have been stable to maybe up a bit, both on a management fee and total basis. And maybe, Nate, if you want to give a little more context to what's happening at the next level?","Nathaniel Dalton - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Sure. So, I think when we talk about fee pressure, obviously at a high level, sort of Jay did mention (25:16) how it's happening across the whole business, but maybe to just focus on a couple of different dynamics here, right?","So, one, if you look across many of our Affiliates, they've got good track records, they are managing their capacity, either because of product capacity or just opportunity in the market at the time. And so, they're managing their product set pretty carefully. And that group of firms is able to sustain competitiveness on kind of flows and all that while maintaining their pricing discipline. So, there's a category of Affiliates that I'd sort of put in that bucket.","And then next thing I'd say is, there's definitely parts of the business where there's fee pressure, whether it's certain product categories, certain geographies, certain channels. And there, I think Affiliates are having to make those kinds of choices, and you can actually see, in some ways, some of the choices they're making reflected in the fact that the fee rate for our business overall has been quite stable.","One piece, and you touched on this is, we are seeing some of our Affiliates kind of lower fees a bit in trade for sort of longer duration, whether it's in longer lot kind of multi-year kinds of products, and we think that's a good trade. And again, depending on how you look at the pricing structure for those products, many of which will also include performance fee component. If you think that that longer duration will allow an expanded investment opportunity set, and therefore potentially higher performance, you can actually get \u2013 you can think about those as a little bit, the trade between slightly lower management fees for slightly \u2013 ultimately higher realized performance fees, potentially.","And then the third point, and you touched on this as well, but also, while there are areas we're seeing fee compression, that's offset in many respects by what we're seeing in product development, which is much of which is happening in relatively high fee areas. So, we're seeing lots of increased allocations, alternatives for example from retail investors and platforms. And so, while there are some of the dynamics you talked about, if you compare that to much of the other \u2013 such products, they're still coming online at very good effective management fee level. So, you sort of put all those together and hopefully that gives you a sense of the color that sits under the high level that Jay described.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much. Thanks for taking the question. I had to join a little bit late. Unfortunately, some of the breaking news in the industry was flowing as well with the continuing calls, so I apologize if you called this already.","Can you talk a little bit about in the outflows on the U.S. equity side and maybe institutional, I guess you called out a couple of one-offs. So just wondering if you may give a little more detail behind that and then I have a follow-up question.","Sean M. Healey - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Right. We did a version of the first question. But, Nate, why don't you reinforce that? And then, Bill, since that's only half a question, we'll let you ask your second one.","William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Nathaniel Dalton - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","So in U.S. equities, as we said in the prepared remarks, so I said U.S. equities, we had outflows in about $4.5 billion in the quarter. So it grows in about $3.5 billion and outflows of about $8 billion. And so, what would I say about what was driving it in U.S. equity? So at a high level, a lot of that's consistent with the rest of the industry, but was changed sort of in this quarter.","I'd sort of point you to a couple of different dynamics. One is we did in our prepared remarks talk about one lumpy large institutional outflow and actually \u2013 and then, we also mentioned in our prepared remarks that the product's performing fine and that client was doing rebalancing and in fact has allocated back to the same Affiliate in a different product already in this quarter in a different product as I said.","And then, look, the other underlying sort of somewhat positive trend in U.S. equities is we are -always continue to see outflows in U.S. retail for U.S. equities. We do see that trend \u2013 the outflow trend kind of slowing there as well.","Sean M. Healey - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","And on an overall basis, through the balance of the year, we feel quite optimistic about our positive flow momentum, and we called out and discussed a range of illiquid products, which are raising funds as well in the mix of that.","Go ahead. What's your second question, Bill?","William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, and I apologize if I go back while you go forward on that one. In terms of capital management, I think you laid out a pretty shift in policy last quarter with the dividend and then the buyback, and I think you mentioned about $20 million. This quarter is only about $80 million. I'm wondering if you could sort of lay out where do we go from here and how you balance between repurchase, dividend growth, and maybe new investments.","Sean M. Healey - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","You better have Jay answer those.","Jay C. Horgen - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Yeah. You might come back to the new investment piece. So, just on the capital, I've mentioned and I'll just reiterate that we do expect to repurchase $120 million in the second quarter and that'll bring our total for the first half to $200 million.","And then, as we look forward to the back half, we do expect to maintain balance sheet flexibility to fund new investments or repurchase additional shares. However, the one thing that is in our sight is that $200 million retail bond, which we do expect to retire in the third quarter. That will add about $0.14 on a run rate accretion basis to our earnings. And beyond that, we'll evaluate our needs, which could include new investments, additional share repurchases or further de-levering or combination of these things.","Sean M. Healey - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Great.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Sean M. Healey - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Hey, Dan.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","I know you guys walked through \u2013 backed away from updating guidance on a quarterly basis, but I guess if you kind of talk to some of the inputs and where they sit relative to original expectations. Obviously, markets look like they're doing better, but wondering if you can give a little more color on maybe the performance fee outlook and then also the $0.18 in performance fees this quarter, kind of where those \u2013 would Affiliates drove that, please.","Jay C. Horgen - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Yeah. Sure, Dan. So, yeah, you're right. I think on the last call, we said that just given the size of our business today and the sort of diversity of it, we're really likely to just do one time a year at the beginning of year for full guidance, but happy to kind of comment on the drivers again.","I think the first one is just as you saw on the release, we start the second quarter at $754 billion in AUM and that's reflective of the closing of all of our 2016 new investments have added an additional $35 billion in the quarter, as well as market appreciation and as you mentioned, it has been a strong quarter. Our blend in the quarter through March 31 was 4%.","And then if you look at it and you bring it forward through last Friday, our blend is up another 1%, so bringing the total year-to-date to 5% approximately. And as you know, our model convention has been 2% per quarter or 4% for the first half. So we're experiencing slightly higher market levels early in the year relative to our model convention.","The other two main assumptions or inputs that go into \u2013 or that can impact our 2017 guidance are performance fees in capital deployment, and I'll talk about performance fees maybe over the course of the year just on capital, which is a more simple one. As I just mentioned, we do anticipate another $120 million in repurchases, bringing our total to $200 million in the first half. And we do expect our weighted average share count for the whole year to be about $56.6 million, so that's helpful for modeling.","The other assumption being performance fees. Firstly, I wanted to say and to address your question, with the addition of the 2016 new investments and a number of them report on a lag, we do expect performance fees throughout the year. And so, other than our fourth quarter, which tends to be the highest performance fee quarter, we do expect the first quarter to be the next highest and then the third obviously the lowest.","And so, as you heard, performance fees in the first quarter were $0.18 compared to $0.09 a year ago. We expect the second quarter to be in the range of $0.06 to $0.12, that is consistent with last year's $0.10 number for the second quarter. And in the third quarter, we just don't have that many contracts that are expected to crystallize in the quarter, so our expectation is that the third quarter will be just a few pennies. Of course, the fourth quarter is where we experience the bulk of our performance fees. And though it's still early in the year, we are seeing positive performance across a range of our alternative products consistent with our expectations.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my call. Good morning.","Sean M. Healey - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","I guess I just have, at this time, a broader question. But given your Affiliate structure and each your Affiliates kind of operating completely \u2013 well, independently, but given the increased demands on scale across the industry, in understanding that you provide some \u2013 the global distribution that you do provide help that the Affiliates wanted with compliance and other things, but how do you really best \u2013 do you feel like you're efficiently delivering scale across all your Affiliates as they operate independently? I mean how do you really kind of scale, take advantage of that on an administrative and operational basis, maybe not so much on the distribution side?","Sean M. Healey - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Yeah. Well, look, I think scale economies exist in parts of the industry; distribution, compliance, maybe some administrative functions are among them. And in those areas, we absolutely offer Affiliates the advantages of being part of a global scale asset management company. And we're in conversations building relationships with the largest, most important clients, and their constituents and advisors around the world. So while there's of course always more to be done, I think we're in a very good place in terms of exploiting those economies of scale.","I think the more important point, which to us seems often lost in broader discussions about the benefits of consolidation is that in many areas of the industry, especially in alpha generation, it's not at all clear that scale is a benefit. And in fact, in many cases, you can see and imagine transactions that involve some integration, disturbing the operating and investment culture. And it seems to us to be, if you look across the history and the industry, quite rare that integration transactions actually result in better performance and to the contrary, most often, they result in worse performance.","Of course, our model, our business strategy is predicated on preserving and protecting the independent operating and investment culture of our Affiliates and to maintain the very strong direct alignment that direct equity ownership brings with clients.","And so, the elements of alpha generation, which in our view are most important, of course, it always requires execution. But if you don't start with a focused operating and investment culture, you don't start with direct alignment of interest, it becomes more challenging. And so for us, to sustain excellent results and re-allow for generation.","So for us, we're quite confident that the structure and approach that we have, as you look forward and think about the industry's evolution where mediocre equity products, mediocre investment products generally are losing share to passive as they should, but simultaneously clients, both global institutional and retail, are increasingly focused on and investing in outstanding alpha-oriented products, including alternative products as a complement to that passive beta exposure.","And so, for that universe of alpha-oriented products, in our view, you need to have the right ingredients. You need to have, of course, the right product set. But you need especially to have underlying firms, which are positioned as best they can in terms of alignment and focus to sustain alpha generation. And in that respect, scale is the enemy, not the friend.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks very much. Good morning, guys. Can we just try to segment the private equity component of the alternative business a little better in terms of \u2013 I don't know if we can dimension the actual realizations that you're seeing?","And then when you talk about the fundraising cycle, are you \u2013 maybe if you could talk a little bit more about the product sets coming into? And I assume you're counting that when it becomes fee-paying as opposed to just raised and not fee-paying. And then, are there different pricing structures or agreements rather that would change the sort of the fee rate that you're overall \u2013 you've seen overall in your institutional services (39:49)?","Jay C. Horgen - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Yeah. So, I think you understand the pricing structures correctly, so it is as they come on our fee bank. So, let me back up and try and help dimension the book.","So, there's a few different \u2013 there's a number of different Affiliates who have products in the kind of the private equity, and what we're calling the private equity and real asset bucket. The sub-strategy, if you want to call that, includes firms like, as sort of the primary ones, firms like Baring Asia, firms like EIG, and firms like Pantheon.","So these are firms that are leaders in their respective areas, sort of Asia in private equity as well into real estate, and now increasingly credit, EIG in the energy space, in a few different ways in Pantheon, both in private equity primaries, secondaries, co-invests and increasingly, infrastructure and real assets as well. And so it's a broad view, and there are other Affiliates implementing others who have products in this area as well.","So, very broad group. And as Sean said earlier, it's really just the \u2013 kind of just the accident of how the calendar worked out, with the pace of realizations happening \u2013 for several of these \u2013 happening to come ahead of the timing of raising new funds. And I think we talked about a bit maybe last quarter, there were also some other things in there, right? So, EIG, you can imagine being slightly slowed by energy prices and those kinds of things.","So, it just sort of worked out that the realizations are ahead of the fundraisings. And so, when we look to the back \u2013 I think the way we characterized in our prepared remarks, it's the back half of this, the first half of next. Although, again, we should start to see some things in the second quarter. It just stacked up at sort of primary products.","So the terms are all \u2013 have sort of primary products and then are also expanding their product sets into other areas, and so I don't want to imply that there's been no activity. But the primary products, as they move into those fundraising cycles, that's just how they end up getting weighted, and it really did just happen to come across those firms. So I wouldn't just call one or two out and describe it that way.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, guys. Just given the strength on the retail side, just had a question on the institutional, and maybe a few clarifications, just given what you guys said in terms of the outlook. So, one, I guess just on the outflows in the quarter, was any of that performance-driven or was it the trends that we're seeing in the industry, in terms of some of the vast (42:38) pressure?","And then, just in terms of that fund cycle, I don't know if you can somewhat size \u2013 I know you can't usually give us what the funds that are being raised and the anticipation of the fund size, but more the funds that are currently being invested, like what the fund size is, so we can kind of get a sense on like what the base of that asset raise could be.","And then I guess same thing on the realizations. If you have anything, whether it's for the quarter for the last 12 months on like how significant that has been in the line where you have client cash outflows and realizations, because a lot of people look at that a little differently, in terms of outflows versus realizations being part of the private equity of the real asset business. So, couple questions there, but just trying to shed a little bit more light on the institutional side.","Sean M. Healey - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Sure. Just at the highest level, and then I'll turn to Nate. The U.S. equity product set has, of course, exposure to the same kinds of structural pressures that the broader industry is facing, but we're actually seeing, over time, a narrowing of the outflows. And I think what we have this quarter were a couple of one-off institutional outflows that were actually, if you look at the underlying Affiliates, were not performance-related. So if you look past that and extrapolate from the current trends and look at the performance of our underlying Affiliates, that's what gives us the confidence.","Nate, do you want to add to that?","Nathaniel Dalton - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Sure. So, yeah, I think that covers the sort of the backward-looking piece a bit. And then I think, looking forward, I think \u2013 let me start with private equity and real assets segment part of your question. So I think what we've said on the last call, just to try to help you dimension kind of the potential incremental impact of that cycle, I think we said probably about $10 billion net, I think was the number that we used.","So, just as a way to dimension those, we say can't \u2013 obviously, we can't go into sort of specifically how they're fundraising each products. But also the other thing is, while we do have \u2013 as I described in answer to an earlier question, while we do have a decent amount of visibility, these are very high-quality firms with really good track records, both on the investment track records as well as fundraising track records. And so we can have a high degree of confidence as they go into the fundraising cycle.","And the products, as I said, range from, whether it's Asian private equity or real estate or credit through the energy product set into secondaries and whatnot. But if you look across that product set, we have a pretty good sense of how they're thinking at least, and have seen kind of the work they're doing around dimensioning the demand for those products. So feel like, while we can't know the exact sizes of them, we can have pretty good sense directionally.","And then I think, overall, as we sort of think about the flows in the institutional channel sort of the short term ahead, as Sean said, normalizing for the lumpy outflows, one of which was in global equities, one of which was in U.S. equities. While we do see a little bit of softness continuing in U.S. equities, we feel really good about the demand we're seeing and actually the accounts we've seen that are won but not yet funded, both especially in alternatives, but also in some of the global equity areas. So, yeah, feel good about that over the longer term.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your question.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Sean M. Healey - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","I have a couple more around outflows. First on the U.S. equity outflow, you mentioned that has reallocated this quarter. Why wouldn't that just be a straight transfer? Was there just a longer decision process between what they actually wanted to put it in? And the second one, if you could, would be to qualify the commentary around the pipeline relative to last quarter and year-over-year even if it's as general as matter?","Nathaniel Dalton - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Okay. Well, on the first \u2013 this is my memory, but I'm the first, I believe it really is as funny as the accident of literally quarter timing.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","Okay.","Nathaniel Dalton - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","I think it was right at the end of one quarter and then the first day of the next month on the other quarter just literally de-weigh it (47:22).","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","Okay.","Nathaniel Dalton - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Though the first quarter worked out. So I think it was \u2013 at my memory, it's literally just the hatch (47:29).","Sean M. Healey - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Surprisingly, the client was indifferent to where our quarterly reporting flows.","Nathaniel Dalton - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Yes, exactly. So, I think that was that one.","But the \u2013 and then on qualifying looking forward, so I think the \u2013 we feel really good, as I said earlier, about the kind of won but not funded and some of those will take some time to fund the won-but-not-funded contracts and all that.","And then, I'd say the kind of the RPs (47:58) and finals and kind of the activity levels I think are sort of good and consistent with, as I think we talked about, the elevated \u2013 we have talked about the activity last quarter in sort of finals and I think the overall activity levels remains good.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks, and thanks for taking my follow-up. I just had a question on flows. I mean, obviously, we're all focusing on the gross inflow, the outflow, the $1.3 billion. But maybe economically, the $1.3 billion outflow, is that a good indication of kind of the EBIT contribution of flows if we were thinking a bit in that context? Or given the mix of Affiliates and asset classes, was there a positive EBIT contribution from \u2013 despite of having the kind of headline asset outflow?","Jay C. Horgen - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","So, yeah. I appreciate that question because there's a lot of questions on flows. And when you look at our AUM table, you'll note that the flows are the smallest number on the page net. And surely, the $35 billion of new investments or the $30 billion of market swamp set (49:17) number, so does FX event this quarter and the impact of those flows are proportionate to our business. So, I think the flows as a percentage were like 0.3% down and that's about what it impacted our earnings.","Sean M. Healey - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","And said differently, I think our additional disclosure around aggregate revenue and ratios to assets so that you're getting a sense of what the stability of the fee level is, over time, is important. I think we \u2013 and Nate had a good answer to this earlier, so I'll refer you to that while \u2013 rather than restating it.","But we feel good about how our overall business is positioned and how Affiliates are responding to challenges in the broader environment. And while there are some challenges, I think we're pleased that are business and our Affiliates are holding up very well. And what you're seeing in contrast to others in the industry, what you're seeing at AMG is real stability in the fee levels.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Hey, everybody. Good morning.","Nathaniel Dalton - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Sorry. Just another one around some of the channel dynamic in the quarter. I wanted to head on the high net worth channel, it looks like that the flows there are a bit softer than what we've seen in the past in the beginning of the year. So I was wondering if you could give us a little more color on what's kind of happening underneath and again, more importantly, the forward backdrop.","Nathaniel Dalton - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Got it. So focusing in on the high net worth channel. Yeah. So, just to dimension for a second. So as we said in the prepared remarks, right, so another positive quarter. I do think if you look I think kind of up quarter-over-quarter and down a bit from the very beginning of last year, which we're \u2013 especially that second quarter, which is a very strong gross sale quarter and low net outflow quarter.","So, in this quarter, we had about $4 billion of gross sales, $3.5 million redemptions and spent 13 positive quarters in a row. So, we feel really good about kind of the stable, steady contribution that we're getting from high net worth business.","In terms of dimension, the pieces underneath that, I think in the prepared remarks, we broke it into the two categories and you think about the wealth management Affiliates, which had positive flows. But we're also seeing pretty strong and sustained flows into the SMA businesses and kind of the biggest contributors for us there are sort of strong global equity flows and also municipal bonds including, in both cases, ones that are sold through our AMG Funds U.S. platform. So feel good about that, and we are seeing some good momentum on the \u2013 and I think consistent with some of the underlying industry dynamics on the SMA side.","So sort of longer term maybe to finish off that \u2013 answer that question. I do think that \u2013 sorry, we think that separately managed account market has a lot of potential and traction, and we have strong products there and some of this, as I said, is responding to the way platforms are moving as they anticipated the deal overall. So feel good about the momentum there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my follow-up. Just appreciate the asset class disclosure that you've got. Maybe if you can talk a little bit about the quantitative strategy contribution. And we can see AQR with a little over $3 billion on the mutual fund side, positive flows in the quarter and maybe not getting firm-specific, but if you can talk about what you would view as the overall contribution of floats from quantitative strategies and is that in own alternatives or would you characterize some of that in multi-asset as well?","Nathaniel Dalton - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Yeah. So I think maybe just to step back for a second and talk about \u2013 when we think about the firms that are maybe I'll say more quantitative because I think most of our Affiliates have some quantitative element to their strategies. But when we think about what are sort of \u2013 what would be broadly put into that sort of quantitative bucket (54:00) that makes.","So one, as you know, very strong franchise in the alternative space across a number of Affiliates. You think about firms like AQR and Winton and Systematica and First Quadrant, BlueMountain, Capula, I would even put many of their products into those kinds of buckets and think about their strategies. So I think they're very strong franchise across a number of Affiliates in alternatives.","I do think it includes sort of equities franchises as well, again, across several Affiliates. And I think you could put into that both sort of the more traditional sort of client equity kinds of products and strategies. You might also put into that sort of the factor \u2013 so sort of so-called factoring and smart beta, which lots of people are talking about now. You could put that there as well.","And I think a couple of our Affiliates, in that case, most notably, AQR have quite strong \u2013 have really been pioneers and have quite strong franchises there. Yeah. So I think this is definitely broader than just \u2013 in the alternatives category and I do think it also \u2013 and you've alluded to this in your comment, you also see it coming as a strong franchise across different channels for us as well.","Sean M. Healey - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Yeah. Maybe just add to that, I think there, as we all know, has been an increasing level of discussion around the rule of technology, and especially technology as it relates to investment processes and products. And I think it's a broad topic, but it's important to underscore the degree to which the leaders in the industry include a handful of specialist firms. And we're very pleased that that group includes a number of AMG Affiliates: AQR, Winton, Systematica, First Quadrant.","We have firms, which are leading the development of advanced machine learning, artificial intelligence applications which, over time, I think will play an increasingly important role and each in their way, these firms are innovating and developing products, all really at the highest level of the industry.","So, as you think about that broad trend unfolding over time, we feel very good about how AMG is positioned to benefit from it.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you. We have come to the end of our time allowed for questions. I'll now turn the floor back to Mr. Healey for any final remarks.","Sean M. Healey - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Thank you again for joining us this morning.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Anjali Aggarwal, Vice President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Anjali Aggarwal","Thank you for joining AMG to discuss our results for the fourth quarter of 2019. During this conference call, certain matters discussed will constitute forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those projected due to a number of factors, including those referenced in our Form 10-K and other SEC filings. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.","AMG will provide on the Investor Relations section of its website, a replay of this call, a copy of our earnings release, as well as a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures, including any earnings guidance announced on this call. As a reminder, we posted an updated investor presentation on our website this morning and encourage investors to consult our site regularly for updated information.","With us on the line to discuss the company\u2019s results for the quarter are Jay Horgen, President and Chief Executive Officer and Tom Wojcik, Chief Financial Officer.","With that, I will turn the call over to Jay.","Jay Horgen","Thanks, Anjali and good morning everyone. 2019 was a year of change and evolution at AMG. We completed a generational transition and succession within the management team, further evolves our core strategy and took action to position our business for future growth. Given the significant competitive advantages we have built over nearly three decades together with the entrepreneurial spirit of a new management team, we are confident in our forward growth prospects. I will discuss the progress we have made against our strategy in more detail, but first let me summarize our earnings for the quarter.","AMG reported economic earnings per share of $4.52 for the fourth quarter and $14.22 for the full year 2019. AMG\u2019s fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA grew 5% year-over-year driven by higher performance fees, which offset declines in margin-based affiliates. Our outflows moderate in the quarter and continued to be driven by certain quantitative strategies coupled with seasonal client redemptions. I would note that while quantitative strategies account for approximately 30% of our AUM today that contribute less than 10% of our run-rate EBITDA. The large majority of our EBITDA is generated by affiliates and strategies that have strong long-term performance track record and are aligned with secular client demand trend. For example, our illiquid alternative affiliates, which collectively managed a $100 billion of AUM are benefiting from record levels of client allocations to private markets and contribute stable and growing fee streams to AMG\u2019s earnings.","Our wealth management affiliates, which collectively managed $50 billion of AUM, posted another year of consistent inflows. With their solutions orientation and a focus on innovation, these affiliates also contribute stable and growing fee streams to AMD\u2019s earnings. In addition, a number of our fundamental managers across active equities and liquid alternatives enhanced their long-term performance track records during the year delivering excellent returns to clients and contributing to AMG\u2019s strong performance fees. Finally, as investors increasingly focus on ESG, many of our affiliates have launched ESG products that are gaining momentum. With strength across these areas, AMG is well-positioned for long-term organic growth and earnings growth and we are focused on aligning our resources with these affiliates and strategies.","Turning the quarter to a number of strategic initiatives, AMG freed up capital and resources to reallocate to growth areas and certain of our margin-based affiliates address cost in order to offset revenue decline. In addition, as we discussed last quarter, we are collaborating with certain affiliates facing industry headwinds to reposition their businesses to achieve optimal outcomes for affiliate partners, their clients and AMG\u2019s shareholders. Through these collective efforts, we will realize benefits on a forward basis and Tom will discuss the impact of these initiatives on our financial results and disclosures. At the highest level, we continue to execute on our core strategy of partnering with leading independent active managers. We are focused on allocating resources to the areas of highest growth and return.","Due to the successful execution of this strategy over time, we have built a global business which is well diversified across affiliates strategies, geographies and clients and today, AMG operates at scale, generating substantial recurring free cash flow which we are investing to enhance future growth across three principle areas, investments in new affiliates, investments in existing affiliates and investments in AMG to enhance the growth of our affiliates.","Let me expand further. Through new investments, AMG gains additional exposure to the fastest growing segments of the market which are aligned with future client demand trends and will generate long-term organic growth. Our unique ability to evolve and scale our business through new investment without the risk or cost of integration is a distinct competitive advantage. We are dedicating significant resources to this effort for their increasing momentum and our transaction pipeline includes a diverse array of high-quality growing firms that are self-selecting into AMG\u2019s unique partnership approach. We remain highly selective and have focused on further refining our discipline in structuring new partnerships to generate attractive shareholder return. And while the timing of individual new investments is inherently uncertain, we expect to generate incremental earnings growth for accretive investment in 2020.","Through investments in existing affiliates with attractive growth prospects, we have an opportunity to accelerate their ability to meet evolving client needs. For example, in the fourth quarter, we expanded our seed capital program and supported the launch of new products at Artemis, Pantheon and GWK. And we continue to identify additional ways to leverage our scale and expertise to create value for affiliates, including partnering on opportunities for differentiated distribution and working together to evaluate lift-out opportunities. And finally, we are reallocating AMG\u2019s resources to further invest in capabilities in support of our affiliates\u2019 strategic objectives. For example, we have recently repositioned our global distribution effort to focus on clients that represent the largest growth opportunities for our affiliates.","We have also added resources to enhance AMG\u2019s distribution of illiquid products to LPs globally and we have seen early success with Baring Asia. And we continue to explore strategic partnerships that leverage the collective strength of AMG\u2019s relationship on behalf of our affiliates. Taken together, we are focused on leveraging AMG\u2019s unique competitive advantages and allocating capital across investments in new and existing affiliates as well as high-value centralized resources that enhance our affiliates\u2019 growth potential. Our highest priority is to invest in these growth opportunities to create shareholder value and then to continue to return capital to shareholders through repurchases and dividend. Over the past year, given our focus on management transition and repositioning our business for the future we invested approximately one-third of our annual cash flow into growth initiatives. The remaining two-thirds was return to shareholder. As we continue to execute on our strategy, over the next several years, we see a shift in that mix towards growth investments, but at all times, we will remain \u2013 maintain our discipline in allocating our capital to maximize shareholder returns over the long-term.","Stepping back, during a period of ongoing change in evolution in the asset management industry, we took further steps in 2019 to position our business for the future. We have reshaped our resources and footprint and reallocated capital to areas of growth. We have collaborated with certain affiliates to reposition their businesses while also investing alongside affiliates with growth opportunities. We completed a new investment in Garda Capital, which has meaningfully outperformed in the first year of our partnership and we are highly confident in our forward new investment pipeline. And finally, the next generation of AMG leadership is firmly in place and fully aligned with business performance and shareholder returns. 2019 was a year of change in evolution at AMG. Moving forward with the quality of our affiliates in the strength and diversity of our business, we are well-positioned for 2020 and the opportunities ahead.","With that, I will turn it over to Tom to review the details of the quarter.","Tom Wojcik","Thank you, Jay, and good morning, everyone. As Jay described, in the fourth quarter, we implemented a number of strategic initiatives that position our business for growth. These actions led to several one-time item and update to our disclosure that I will go through in more detail. The strategic initiatives that AMG and certain margin-based affiliates effectuated in the quarter resulted in approximately $30 million of cost primarily related to resource repositioning and footprint rationalization. Collectively, these initiatives will free up approximately $50 million of capital annually to offset revenue declines and enable reallocation to higher growth areas, the benefits of which, we will realize in future periods.","Additionally, our economic earnings included a $60 million tax benefit related to the BlueMountain transaction. We are also collaborating with certain affiliates facing industry headwinds to reposition their businesses. And we have adjusted our AUM disclosure for the fourth quarter to better reflect affiliates, where we are focusing AMG resources. We included a line item in our AUM table called strategic repositioning which removed $44 billion of AUM associated with this effort that is not meaningfully contributing to AMG\u2019s financial results. The largest component for approximately $20 billion relates to the sale of our interest in BlueMountain and J.M. Hartwell. The remainder represents affiliates we are collaborating with to optimize outcomes for their clients and management partners while also retaining potential future upside for AMG\u2019s shareholders.","Having walked through the impact of our strategic initiatives let me now turn to our financial results starting with flows. Net client cash outflows of $11 billion moderated from Q3 levels and were driven by certain quantitative strategies and seasonal client redemptions. In alternatives, we reported net outflows of $7.5 billion driven by quantitative strategies and seasonality, partially offset by positive contributions from illiquid alternatives and fixed income products. Our near-term performance in certain quantitative strategies has been challenged, others, for example at Winton and Systematica are generating strong results. We also continue to see outperformance in our fundamental liquid alternatives book including in ValueAct and in relative value fixed income strategies at Capula and Garda, both of which continue to generate solid organic growth. We are benefiting from strong client demand in illiquid alternatives and private market. As our affiliates build on existing and new product capabilities with ongoing fundraising at EIG, Pantheon and Baring Asia, AMG\u2019s performance in this category remains very strong, with 94% of our recent vintages outperforming industry benchmark on an IRR basis.","Turning to global equities, we saw net outflows of $3.8 billion in the quarter split roughly evenly between global and emerging market strategies. Our affiliates continue to generate strong long-term performance in this category particularly in fundamental strategies with 84% of our AUM ahead of benchmark over a five-year period. In US equities, we reported net outflows of $1.4 billion, an improvement over recent periods particularly when taking into account retail seasonality in the quarter.","Turning to multi-asset and fixed income, we posted our 12th consecutive quarter of net inflows. And our affiliates generated $1.4 billion inflows primarily driven by muni bonds and wealth management products at GW&K and Baker Street respectively. Fixed income products at Artemis and AQR also generated positive net flows and we continue to be excited about the momentum in these strategies as well as more broadly within our fixed income and wealth management categories. As Jay said earlier, given strength across several high-growth areas including illiquid alternatives, wealth management and ESG strategies and excellent investment performance in many of our fundamental strategies, we are well positioned for long-term organic growth and earnings growth. And we are actively focusing our resources to support these areas.","Now turning to our financials, for the fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA grew 5% to $200 million driven primarily by stronger performance fees which offset lower contributions in certain quantitative strategies versus a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was impacted by approximately $30 million in costs related to the strategic repositioning initiatives mentioned previously. Economic earnings per share of $4.52 included $0.68 of performance fees.","Turning to specific modeling items, looking ahead, in an effort to simplify our guidance, we plan to provide an estimate EBITDA range along with an estimate of performance fees for the upcoming quarter. Given our increasing private markets carry opportunity, over time, our performance fees will trend for being less seasonal and more distributed throughout the year. Based on current AUM levels which reflect asset down 1% versus year end, we expect adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter to be between $215 million and $225 million with performance fees ranging from $15 million to $25 million. Our share of interest expense was $19 million for the fourth quarter and we expect consistent level for the first quarter. Our share of reported amortization and impairment was $162 million for the fourth quarter, including $98 million relating to equity method affiliates. We expect this line item to return to more normalized levels in the first quarter of approximately $50 million.","Our effective GAAP and cash tax rate were not meaningful in the fourth quarter primarily given the impact of amortization and impairments and the BlueMountain tax benefit. For modeling purposes, we expect our GAAP and cash tax rate to be approximately 25% and 20% respectively going forward. Intangible related deferred taxes were $32 million in the fourth quarter and we expect intangible related deferred taxes to return to more normalized levels in the first quarter of approximately $6 million. Other economic items were $5 million for the fourth quarter and are expected to be $1 million in the first quarter. Our adjusted weighted average share count for the fourth quarter was $49.1 million and we expect share count to be approximately $47.7 million for the first quarter.","And finally, turning to our balance sheet, Jay spoke earlier about the diversified nature of our business and the strong recurring cash flows that support our strategy to invest for future growth, including investing in new affiliates, investing in existing affiliates and investing in AMG to enhance the growth of our affiliates. Through the strength of our balance sheet and cash flow generation, we have substantial resources and flexibility to execute on growth opportunities to generate shareholder returns over time. We are disciplined in our approach to capital allocation as we seek to deploy resources to the areas of highest growth and return in our business before efficiently returning excess capital to our shareholders. We continue to maintain a prudent level of leverage and have repositioned our balance sheet over the last several quarters, extending duration while maintaining flexibility and capacity to capitalize on growth opportunities even in challenging markets.","Over the course of 2019, we deployed approximately one-third of our available capital and growth investments, which included our new investment in Garda and incremental investments in existing affiliates including seed and co-investment capital. We continue to manage our leverage levels paying down the remaining balance on our revolver earlier in the year and we then returned the remainder of our capital to shareholders through a dividend of $65 million and $360 million in share repurchases, including $110 million in the fourth quarter which reduced our share count by nearly 8% year-over-year.","As we look forward to 2020 and shift our focus from repositioning towards future growth, we expect to allocate more of our capital to investments in our business while continuing to return capital to shareholders. In the first half of 2020, we expect share repurchases to be approximately $150 million to $200 million subject to market conditions and transaction activity. We expect our quarterly dividend will remain at $0.32 per share as we prioritize allocating capital toward areas of higher growth and return.","And finally, given AMG\u2019s combination of distinctive independent affiliates that are well aligned with future client demand trends, our unique ability to make new investments that deliver both earnings and organic growth accretion, our stable cash flow profile and our flexible balance sheet, we are well-positioned to create long-term value for our shareholders.","With that, I will open it up to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Bill Katz","Okay, excuse me, thank you very much for taking the questions. Good morning everybody. So thanks for some of the new presentation and so forth. And maybe sort of kick off the questioning with on the deal side, so both Jay and Tom, you\u2019ve both mentioned sort of a refocused more deal-oriented type of capital deployment? Can you talk a little bit about maybe where you see the growth opportunity whether it be distribution side or product side and then maybe sort of a thought process on sort of where your pricing is right now? We have seen some pretty elevated deals in the wealth management space and then finally sort of the funding mix on that?","Jay Horgen","Yes, great. Good morning, Bill. Thank for your question. Really glad you asked it since you\u2019ve known us for a long time and you know new investment is core to our strategy and yes, I think you picked up that there is a focus on that and it\u2019s a growth opportunity. The short answer to your question is we are dedicating significant resources to the effort. As you heard me say, our pipeline has gained momentum in recent months and we are in advance discussions with a number of high-quality prospects. We do expect to make new investments in the near-term. We are focused on prospecting in areas of secular growth trends and client demand trends as you would expect. Those areas include private market, multi-asset solutions, ESG, fixed income alternatives, emerging markets. And today we have a pipeline that\u2019s representative of these areas. One thing to note is we don\u2019t necessarily need to do large deals. What\u2019s important is the growth potential of the new prospects than AMG\u2019s ability to accelerate that growth. On your point regarding pricing, you are right pricing in certain areas of the market is high, wealth management and illiquid businesses in particular, in other areas, come down pretty dramatically. We remain disciplined in structuring new investments to address future outcome and align that with shareholder value creation. Maybe stepping back for a minute, how are we positioned at AMG? That\u2019s worth noting. We are one of the very few firms that can execute transactions across the full lifecycle of a business from early transactions that provide growth capital through to succession oriented solutions to support generational transition which we have always been known for. As you know, we take a permanent partnership approach to preserve the culture and independent. It allows us to scale without the cost of integration. We\u2019ve built a reputation for being a successful partner that takes decades. And through those decades, there have been opportunities for us to learn and adapt both from our successes and our mistakes. We think we\u2019ve built an outstanding reputation industry for addressing the needs of high-quality independent entrepreneurial firm that want to build enduring franchises. And as I mentioned, we continue to think about refining our structure and finding additional ways to support our affiliates growth, to let them achieve long-term success. So taking all of that together, both the specifics as well as the positioning, we are bullish on our near-term pipeline equally bullish on building AMG\u2019s position on being the partner of choice to independent firms over the long-term. Thanks for your question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Craig Siegenthaler","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. First just on the strategic repositioning, if we back out the AUM from BlueMountain and Hartwell that are no longer with AMG today, how much of the remaining AUM will remain at AMG affiliates and also what is the EBITDA contribution from the remaining AUM in that bucket that still sits in AMG as of 1Q?","Jay Horgen","Yes, thanks, Craig for your question and good morning to you. Maybe Thomas can start, and I will...","Tom Wojcik","Sure. Thanks, Craig. Good morning. So Jay talked on the call about a number of the strategic initiatives that we have taken and that you just referenced with respect to affiliates, really both had better positioned their businesses for the future, and also to enable AMG to more effectively allocate our resources going forward. So just kind of to take your question at a high level, we revised our disclosure on AUM and added the new strategic repositioning line item this quarter, removed $44 billion of assets that are not going to be part of our reported AUM any further. I think very importantly, and to your question, the financial contribution of these assets is not significant from an EBITDA perspective. It has not been historically, we do not expect it to be going forward. As you noted, about half of that AUM is related to BlueMountain and J.M. Hartwell and the remaining portion really relates to affiliates, where we are continuing to work with those affiliate to reposition their business and to appropriately realign incentives. The arrangements, we are working on with them, not only really are designed to help better position those affiliates, but also to enable us to allocate our time and resources at the AMG level toward areas of growth in our business and also maintain optionality and upside for shareholders on those businesses. So to your question, the remaining AUM is really still with us right now. And as we work through those agreements, ultimately we will see how that transpires over time. I would say, lastly, before I turn it over to Jay, this change really just resulting in a reported AUM number that better reflects the asset to which we are actively dedicating AMG time and capital, and the strategies that we expect contribute to AMG\u2019s economics on a go-forward basis.","Jay Horgen","Yes. Thanks, Tom. That was a good summary. Craig, maybe I will even take it at a higher level. This work that we are doing is rooted in strategic initiatives that we took in 2019. And also to reposition ourselves towards these growth opportunities that Tom mentioned. At the highest level, we invest in successful growing firms with entrepreneurial management teams. We want to remain independent. As you know our structure preserves that independence in the culture. That is the guiding principle for us of aligning interest, which informs everything we do from the time of investment and thereafter. But naturally, all partnerships evolve. The vast majority of our affiliate partnerships have endured across generations and continue to endure, in the context of the evolving circumstances, we collaborate with our affiliates that are facing headwinds, try to help them position their businesses, consider alternatives, try to achieve the best outcomes for their clients, the partners, our shareholders. And that is what we did with BlueMountain and Hartwell. In other cases, the alternatives may be different. As you may recall, beginning of last year, we helped Trilogy and GW&K partner, and that combination has worked very well. Trilogy\u2019s products have grown within the GW&K system. But importantly, to land the point, this is not a change in our strategy. We continue to adhere to the permanent partnership approach. And finally, it is just worth saying that we spent a lot of time in 2019 on these efforts, but as we look to 2020, we expect to spend more of our time in our resources on growth opportunities, as I discussed on the prepared remarks, in new investment, affiliates positioned for growth and our centralized services.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Shutler","Hey guys. Good morning. Could you talk about the growing opportunity with some of your private equity affiliates, both in terms of the magnitude of any unrealized carry and timing of when that could start showing up in the numbers?","Jay Horgen","Yes. Let me have Tom take that one. It is a good opportunity for us. The performance fees and realized carry that comes, the private equity, but maybe we will take it, just the growth that we have experienced, and that duration that we have experienced it.","Tom Wojcik","Yes. So Chris thanks for your question, and good morning. So if you kind of take a step back and think about our liquid book overall, we have now got about $100 billion in AUM across our affiliates, primarily at Pantheon, EIG and Baring Asia. Those businesses have generated around $20 billion inflows over the course of the last couple of years and are now generating close to 20% of our overall run rate EBITDA. To your point on performance fees, we did recognize some carry from Pantheon earlier this year as you may recall. And over time as those businesses season and the funds that they have in the ground season, we do see a growing opportunity for us to realize performance fees. Importantly, to mention, we recognized performance fees on Method 1, so really only as they are earned. So we are not marking to market in the context of our financial results. We are only taking those as they earned. The other point I would make is, as we have shifted our guidance a bit on performance fees, now going forward versus what we have done historically, part of that is in recognition of the fact that over time as that carry opportunity continues to grow, we will have sort slightly less seasonality in our \u2013 in our performance fees and you will start to see results distributed a little bit more throughout the year as we realize carry.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Dan Fannon ","Thanks. Good morning. So I guess a couple of questions on the strategic repositioning. So I guess, how many affiliates are part of that extra two you have mentioned? And going forward, are you anticipating there to be, to this line item to still have the reported with go forward metric in it or is this kind of as you said a 2019, only type of restructuring, and going forward, we would not see it? And then lastly just from a forward guidance perspective, are we, should we expect to get just on a quarterly basis, next quarter\u2019s EBITDA on performance fee contribution? That is what \u2013 what you are going through now in terms of your consistent guidance.","Jay Horgen","Yes. Thanks, Dan and thank you for joining us early. I know it is very early on the West Coast after Super Bowl Sunday. To your point, and I will let Tom answer part of your question. To your point, we do given that the strategic initiatives really were born in the 2019 period and most of the work is well on its way to help these affiliates, we do not expect to see this line item to reappear. We believe is taking out those assets that are not material to AMG, and that is part of what we are , we want to land on the message here. Maybe Thomas will take the second, third part of this question.","Tom Wojcik","Sure. So I think just with respect to the names that are in there, as you can probably appreciate, we are still in ongoing dialog with lot of those affiliates. And at this point, it really would not be appropriate to go into further color. But as Jay said, they tend to be smaller affiliates and very importantly as we have mentioned a couple of times that are not really contributing in any significant way to our economics. On your EBITDA guidance question, I think, where we stand today, we would like to give you color on the period immediately ahead, a quarter ahead. We also gave you some half year guidance in terms of capital allocation. And I think for the time being that that is kind of what we feel most comfortable providing.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Mike Carrier","Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Maybe just on the \u2013 on the flows, I think, you guys mentioned there was some kind of year-end activity that we have seen across the industry. I just wanted to see if you can provide any color around that. And then just on the strategic repositioning, of that like $44 billion, has that been like a big driver, if some of the outflows, over the past few quarters, just wanted to try to quantify that, if it was material or not? Thanks.","Tom Wojcik","Thanks, Mike. Let me try and hit a couple of different parts of your question there. So with respect to the fourth quarter seasonality, we really see seasonality in two areas of our business. First, on sort of tax loss harvesting on the mutual fund side, and then we also have some alternative names that tend to have windows for liquidity in the fourth quarter. Overall, it was not a huge contributor. This is sort of what I would call more of a normalized seasonal quarter. If you recall, the fourth quarter of 2018 was quite an outside seasonal quarter for the industry. This was more normalized, so you can think kind of a, probably a couple of few billion across different strategies. With respect to the AUM, you know, that we have taken out via strategic repositioning, there are some areas there that have, are businesses that just have gotten smaller over time, whether that is been performance driven or flow driven. So we did see some outflows there over the course of the year. But I would not point to it as being anything materially outside. I think it is just a book that ultimately has not really been contributing and would not, on an EBITDA basis. And we are better trying to reflect for you, what the economic profile of AMG looks like and time that a little more closely to AUM.","Jay Horgen","Yes. And just to punctuate that, large majority of our flows has been driven by quantitative strategy. I think everyone is aware of that. So while there is a materiality to this AUM which is not material, the change in flows is not a noticeable amount.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Bernstein [sic] [Autonomous Research]. Please proceed with your question.","Patrick Davitt","Good morning guys. Thank you. Perhaps more broadly on flows to that last question, do you think there is a path to inflow this year when you look at the pool of AUM outflowing against the pool of AUM inflowing and what do you see as the key levers getting you there if so?","Tom Wojcik","Patrick, why don\u2019t I start and then maybe Jay can share some color as well. Thanks for your question. So, we spend a lot of time in our prepared remarks talking about our strategy. And really importantly, our strategy is all about driving long-term earnings growth. When you look at our existing affiliates, we feel very good about the combination of their positioning against long-term client demand trends and where those products can live and add the client portfolios as well as their long-term performance track record. So when we think about the organic growth profile of our existing affiliate base over the long-term, we continue to be very bullish. We are also confident that as we add new investments, we will continue to add new affiliates that also have substantial organic growth potential and can act as an accelerant to our organic growth overall. In the near-term as you know, we continue to have some performance challenges on the quant side. And as Jay just mentioned that\u2019s where we have really seen headwinds in recent flows. And as those performance challenges are addressed, we do expect to see continued near-term pressure from a flow perspective in that area. Importantly though, those areas are now really contributing less than 10% of our EBITDA on a run-rate basis, so while we are seeing it in our flow profile, the impact on our earnings is significantly less. I would also note that at the same time we are seeing significant positives in our business in areas that are contributing a much greater amount to our EBITDA. And Jay referenced a number of these, but I will recap them.","First, our illiquid alternatives, affiliates, really they are benefiting from record allocations in the industry and very strong fundraising at our affiliates. On the wealth management side, we have sticky assets that are contributing to stable and growing earnings streams. Jay referenced ESG where we have seen some strong fundraising and we think we have got some opportunities going forward and we have got very strong performance in our fundamental managers. So to recap, I think in the short-term, we will still see some quant headwinds, but over the long-term, we are very, very bullish both on our organic growth prospects, but perhaps more importantly on our earnings growth prospects.","Jay Horgen","Yes. Again, I would just not to belabor the point, Patrick and I think it is a nuance thing that you have to, I guess, digest. We are in this period where we are having outflows, but the impact to our EBITDA is muted. And so you very well could see a scenario where and it looks like, it\u2019s just \u2013 if you look at the guidance for the first quarter that are sort of based the core performance fee, EBITDA is flattening going back up even in the context of moderating, but still outflows. So I think you are going to have to watch that if you are an analyst and try to digest what that mean.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Lee","Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just kind of curious in all the restructuring initiatives that took place last year, just maybe dig down inside a little bit. I am just curious how much of that may have included kind of rethinking your kind of retail strategy versus kind of more broadly targeting institutional investors. I don\u2019t know if that was part of it, because well, I believe that\u2019s the first question?","Tom Wojcik","Thanks, Rob. Why don\u2019t I maybe give you a little bit of just detail on the numbers and then Jay can give you a little bit more detail on some of the strategic actions we have taken. As I mentioned, we had one-time costs that impacted EBITDA of about $30 million in the quarter, that was across both AMG and certain of our margin-based affiliates and was really primarily related to resource repositioning, footprint rationalization. And I think some of the changes that you mentioned impacted in particular the resource reallocation side of that. Collectively, we think these initiatives will free up about $50 million of capital annually both to offset revenue declines and enable reallocation to higher growth areas and we expect to recognize the benefits of that in future periods. A lot of that reallocation as we talked about last quarter, as we talked about in our prepared remarks this quarter is coming at the AMG level and Jay will talk a little bit about where some of that is impacting us. Importantly, also the Q1 EBITDA guidance that we provided does include the impact of these actions, so you should think about that as a clean number as it relates to the overall earnings power of the business going forward. And I guess I just land on, I wouldn\u2019t look at the sort of dollars, that $50 million as dollars that dropped directly to the bottom line, as much as I would think about it as dollars that are helping to stabilize margins at certain affiliates, and then capital that we are reallocating toward growth areas at the AMG level.","Jay Horgen","Yes. Thanks. And those really good summary and Rob, is a good question. Let me just recap a bit here, because I know a lot went on in 2018. Obviously, we went through a management transition in succession as I mentioned. We did some reallocation at the AMG level to pivot towards growth. That includes not only capital, but resources and people and time and effort. Some of our margin based affiliates took the opportunity to offset revenue declines. We worked with certain of our affiliates that we are facing headwinds and we talked about that. We have rotated to growth, and that is really the story for 2020 looking for new investments to be a driver, also existing affiliates positioned for growth and investing in those affiliates, we mentioned our seed capital program, but we also are investing directly with those affiliates, in those affiliates and then finding ways to help those affiliates grow at the AMG level. Specific actions that we took at AMG and Tom mentioned the cost number that went through our financials and the savings and total. But just to kind of put a finer point on it, we freed up about $25 million of capital resources at AMG. We have done a few things. We repositioned our global distribution resources to focus on clients that represent the largest opportunities for our affiliates. We are dedicating more resources to the largest asset owners and intermediaries. We have added resources to distribution on illiquid products, LPs globally with respect to our U.S. retail platform, we have focused our sales effort on the most attractive product areas, we right-size the fund family and related infrastructure. We have reshaped non-core and unprofitable operating activities. For example, we are outsourcing and have a strategic relationship now with ACA, a leading provider of legal and compliance services that allows our affiliate a greater breadth, but also lower cost. And finally, we have just reduced our global footprint, including selective headcount reduction. We have consolidated offices and we have closed some of our smaller satellite offices. So when you take all this together, we are trying to get through 2019 and towards growth in 2020 and the opportunities ahead.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Ryan Bailey","Good morning. This is actually Ryan Bailey filling in for Alex. This is a bit of a multi-part question. But over the next 12 months, when you think about some of your uses of capital, can you give us a sense of what, if any contractual direct investments or equity stake increases you\u2019ll be making? And in which types of affiliates those would be in? And then would there be any incremental discretion discretionary equity stake purchases on top of this? Thank you.","Tom Wojcik","Thanks for your question. So let me kind of take that at a high level and then I will try and address some of the specifics as well. Everything that you have asked about really sits squarely in the center of our overall capital allocation strategy. And our capital allocation strategy is ultimately what\u2019s fueling our overall growth strategy. So I think first and foremost, we are focused on investing for the future growth of our business and then efficiently returning excess capital to our shareholders. As we mentioned on the call, in our remarks earlier, there are really three primary areas, first, through new investments that enable us to gain exposure to the fastest growing segments of the market where we think we are going to see both earnings accretion as well as organic growth accretion. And we do firmly believe that new investments when price and structured appropriately represent the highest and best use of our capital, and Jay gave you a lot of color on that earlier. With respect to existing affiliates, these firms, we are looking to help them evolve their businesses to capitalize on client demand trends. We are investing in them through seed and co-investments. We are providing expertise on lift-outs and product development. And to your point, in line with some of our past investments, we are also investing in the equity of these businesses, and we are in the succession business, and we are working through that as well. And then lastly we are investing in some of the high-value centralized capabilities that exist at AMG and looking to reallocate our resources there, to try and deliver that expertise in the best way we can to our affiliates to drive returns. After we make those investments in future growth, we will continue to return excess capital to our shareholders through a combination of repurchases and dividends, as we have historically. I guess I just end by saying look we take a very focused and disciplined approach to allocating our capital. Every dollar we spend needs to generate an appropriate risk adjusted return, and we are going to continue to focus on allocating capital to the highest growth areas that we have, whether a significant return opportunities and we hold ourselves to a very high standard, when we make those investments.","Jay Horgen","Let me just add two points, and I will try to get specific with your \u2013 to your \u2013 specifically to your question. The first though at the highest level, we are managing our business for growth over the long term. We obviously have maintained a capital structure in doing that. We want to be prudent in that capital structure as well. So we have historically used a metric for us at a few times debt to EBITDA, which is kind of where we are today. So we are not over-levered or under-levered, but it\u2019s appropriate and prudent. We want to make sure that you realize that the goal is to allocate our capital that comes from our business into these highest growth areas, both growth and return. And if we find those growth opportunities in our business, we will invest in them. And then we will deliver capital to shareholders through repurchases as Tom said. As it relates specifically to your question, with some of the affiliates, with some affiliates as part of the original agreement, we do have repurchased obligations over time. With that, we actually get cash flow. It looks a lot like a repurchase of equity, similarly priced to where the equity is today. Those are long-duration incentive structure that \u2013 that hang off of long duration incentive structures, typically 15 years. We tend to own more of our winners, which is the right way to think about it as they grow. And obviously over the longest term we have to make sure that the incentives in the business are refreshed and aligned. But we do so, as Tom said, underneath our discipline of capital allocation.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question is a follow-up from Bill Katz with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Bill Katz","Okay, thanks. Just a couple, if you don\u2019t mind. So first one, just want to make sure on the EBITDA guidance, the $215 million to $225 million range is pre-performance fees, which I think is the case. And then just stepping back, Jay, sort of question for you guys, you sort of repositioned the footprint and more focus on things such as the illiquid. What is the appetite to migrate to a DE type of earnings release type of methodology, similar, to like a Blackstone or KKR, etcetera. And then is it possible to give us what the net accrued carry was at the end of the year versus maybe a year ago? Just trying to size what the performance fees might be for this year.","Jay Horgen","You want to take first part of that?","Tom Wojcik","Sure. You, got a few questions in there. Thank you. Thank you, Bill. So Bill, on the EBITDA piece, the $215 million to $225 million does include performance fees. So it is inclusive of performance fees.","Jay Horgen","Yes. And then, yes, you are right. We are positioning our business for growth and certainly the growth comes from additional new investments, but also the growth of our existing affiliates. And as we have established on this call, the pieces of our business that are growing perhaps the fastest are the private markets in the wealth management areas, but also certain of our alternatives, say relative value, fixed income and other parts of our business. So there are a number of growth areas. We like to think that the diversification across all these asset classes, both the secular demand trend, is also the cyclicality of these businesses. It\u2019s really a valuable aspect of why you are investing in AMG. We are an investment in active, diversified-active structured appropriately for shareholder value. There may come a time where the world migrates to all private markets. And at that point, clearly we have to think about the disclosure looking probably more like our PE competitors. I think we can selectively consider over time, some of these disclosure items that you mentioned, and I think that that is helpful as they increase the magnitude in our business. But for today, we are diversified group of affiliates with lots of opportunities across all of our affiliates and including even the systematic businesses which are going through a cyclical moment at this point, so that is a valuable aspect of our business. On the carry opportunity, it is increasing it is up year-over-year. We do report on Method 1 and as you know, we have a number of affiliates that are delayed reporting by one quarter. So, we do have some visibility on this, which just gives us some confidence as we look out each quarter and give you that guidance. So I think we are now ready to produce the accrued, but not realized carry number, but that\u2019s something we will consider in the future.","Operator","Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Horgen for any closing remarks.","Jay Horgen","Thank you all again for joining us this morning. As you heard, we are focused on our growth opportunities as we execute on our strategy. And at all times, we will maintain discipline in allocating our capital to maximize shareholder returns over the long-term. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jeff Parker, Vice President, Investor Relations for AMG. Thank you. You may begin.","Jeff Parker","Thank you for joining AMG to discuss our results for the fourth quarter of 2018. In this conference call, certain matters discussed will constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected due to a number of factors, including but not limited to, those referenced in the company\u2019s Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time-to-time. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the call.","AMG will provide on the Investor Relations section of its website at www.amg.com, a replay of the call, a copy of our announcement of our results for the quarter and a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of any estimate of the company\u2019s economic earnings per share for future periods that are announced on this call. As a reminder, we have also included an updated investor presentation on this section of our website. AMG encourages investors to consult the Investor Relations section of its website regularly for updated information.","With us on the line to discuss the company\u2019s results for the quarter are Nate Dalton, Chief Executive Officer and Jay Horgen, President and Chief Financial Officer.","With that, I will turn the call over to Nate.","Nate Dalton","Thanks, Jeff and good morning everyone. As we all know, the fourth quarter of 2018 was challenging for asset managers due to broadly negative returns across asset classes as well as the resulting client risk aversion, which impacted industry wide flows.","In addition, the quarter had several extraordinary items, so I wanted to briefly put into context our results and forward outlook. First, while net client cash flows were negative due to both heightened client risk aversion as well as the fourth quarter seasonality we discussed on our last call, our organic growth outlook is already improving in 2019. Second, our business is structured differently from other asset management firms. This includes not only diversity of our business and the quality of our affiliates, but also importantly, our investment structure, which limits our exposure to operating leverage at the affiliate level providing earnings stability. Third, we are actively positioning our business to focus on the highest growth opportunities ahead. And finally, because we have been disciplined in managing our balance sheet, we have the flexibility to execute on the opportunities this volatility will inevitably create.","Now, turning to the quarter, AMG reported economic earnings per share of $3.53 for the fourth quarter and $14.50 for the full year. While Q4 was down versus the year ago quarter primarily because of lower performance fees, our results for 2018 were in line with those for the full year 2017. The combination of the timing of the market declines at the very end of the year with the breadth of the declines across asset classes meant that while a number of our alternative strategies generated good relative performance, they still had low or negative absolute returns and therefore we realized lower performance fees than we expected. As we look forward, our performance fee opportunity is broad and diverse across a range of distinctive return streams, with very good track records of outperformance. As a result, we are confident that performance fees will be a meaningful component of our future earnings growth profile as they have been in the past.","Turning next to flows, there are a couple of high level themes that shaped our quarter. In general, elevated market volatility in the fourth quarter increased industry wide client risk aversion, which led to slowing sales activity and delayed funding. In addition, we had elevated levels of retail redemptions in equities and liquid alternative due to fourth quarter seasonality, which in the case of liquid alternatives was exacerbated by significant outflows from products with challenging recent performance relative to benchmark. While it\u2019s still early in the first quarter, we are off to a much better start in 2019. If we take a look at our publicly available data for January, our retail net flows are roughly flat. And while some of that is a reversal of the Q4 seasonality which was particularly acute for us in 2018, the best retail month we have seen since last April. Putting this all together, we expect good 2018 performance by many of our affiliates as well as improving flow trend dynamics driving much better Q1 net flow results and continued improvement throughout 2019. Now while it\u2019s an extraordinary quarter in terms of the breadth of negative returns and client risk aversion, it\u2019s important to remain focused on the key elements of our business as we execute our growth strategy.","Let me first start with the importance of diversity. Over the past decade, we have built an incredibly diverse business through both the addition of new affiliates as well as organic growth through product development and innovation by the collective efforts of AMG and our affiliates. Today, our portfolio is diversified not only by asset class and product category, but also client segment, geography and channel as well as by affiliate, with no single affiliate contributing more than a low-teen percentage to our EBITDA. In the fourth quarter, even with the extraordinary breadth of negative market returns, we saw the benefits of the diversity of our asset mix, which is approximately 40% in alternative strategies. For example, our blended asset mix declined by roughly 8% in the quarter compared to the 13% decline in the MSCI World.","While diversity is obviously important, even more important is the ability of our affiliates to sustain high-quality distinctive return streams across our broad set of asset classes. With the return of volatility, many of our fundamental strategies outpaced their respective indices and peers in the fourth quarter as well as for the full year. We believe that in general, volatility is good for active managers. As we noted last quarter, the data from our recently updated white paper, The Boutique Premium, illustrates that the long-term outperformance advantage of boutiques has been most significant during more volatile periods where their investment processes and disciplines are able to create significant alpha for their clients. This stands to reason as the elements that drive superior alpha generation by boutiques in the first place, an investment-led entrepreneurial culture, meaningful equity ownership by the investment professionals and the long duration alignment with clients and partners, all supporting long-term perspective, which encourages these firms to maintain their investment processes through volatile periods.","We are already seeing this reflect in our business as the fourth quarter provided a more favorable environment for the highest quality active managers, such as our affiliates to distinguish themselves. While our performance was broadly diversified across affiliates and geographies, global, U.S. and up and down the cap range, this outperformance was most prominent at some of our world class value firms, such as Tweedy Browne, Yacktman, Veritas, Beutel and River Road, with a combination of market volatility and very significant outperformance is leading to a noticeable uptick in client interest and demand across channels. In addition to our strong performance across many fundamental equity strategies and a number of our liquid alternative products with their affiliates, such as AQR, Capula, Artemis, PFM and Winton posted strong relative return, which should position them to raise assets going forward. While performance across our existing products and capabilities is critically important, we and our affiliates have been continuously innovating and developing new products with diverse, distinctive return streams to match evolving client needs across all market environments.","As we talked about on our last call, we have a differentiated product development approach. We benefit from product development that happens within our affiliates as well as from products that we develop jointly with affiliates and of course, our unique opportunity to add immediately saleable product with proven track record through our new investments effort. This unique product development opportunity has been successful in creating a significant number of new products in the last 5 years, including some of our fastest growing products. Examples are many and diverse, across our traditional managers firms, such as Artemis, Foyston and TimeSquare launching entire new products of suites of global international emerging market strategies.","In the case of GW&K, building out an equity franchise domestic and global as well as most recently adding Trilogy\u2019s proven emerging market capabilities. Within liquid alternatives, firms such as BlueMountain, Capula and First Quadrant are taking advantage of market opportunities to build out ranges of systematic products in areas such as alterative credit, market neutral, global macro and volatility. Our illiquid alternative managers also continue to diversify their product offering, with Pantheon offering infrastructure real asset and credit, Baring Asia extending the credit and real estate products and the introduction of credits direct lending and operating energy capabilities at EIG.","Lastly, AQR continues to innovate its existing equity and alternatives franchises and is in the early innings of what could be a very significant systematic fixed income build out. Alongside this product development opportunity, our unique distribution strategy, which combines the focused resources of each of our affiliates, with the scope and scale of AMG\u2019s global distribution platforms, is an increasingly valuable component of our overall growth strategy. This model affords our affiliates the opportunity to diversify their distribution capabilities and bring their expanding product sets to the most appropriate pools of capital worldwide. Moreover, as leading clients worldwide and the intermediary to serve them are consolidating their relationships with external managers and looking for more efficient relationships and even partnerships with a smaller number of investment management firms. AMG and our unique model are beginning to capitalize from those trends as we can bring to bear the largest collection of independently managed distinctive return streams in the world to meet client needs.","As we discussed last quarter, we have been making progress in formalizing some of these relationships. For example, we entered into a strategic relationship with Nordea Asset Management, where we work together to develop and place certain AMG affiliate strategies under European and Latin American platform. Simply put, we are collectively leveraging our affiliates manufacturing and product design and structuring work with Nordea strong brand, scale, packaging, and distribution expertise in a strategic and additive way to our existing efforts in these regions. We are currently very active in working on a number of near-term opportunities with them as well as the operational elements of this relationship. As we discussed on previous calls, while this is a relatively new initiative for AMG, we are making good progress towards establishing a range of these strategy relationships with some being more formal and some less so.","Finally, as we also discussed in recent quarters, we have been actively reviewing our business to identify opportunities to improve efficiency in general and in particular to make sure that AMG\u2019s and our affiliates\u2019 resources are focused on the best risk-adjusted return opportunities in the market. At the affiliate level, we continue to support the positioning of their businesses for future opportunities. And in some cases, this has included strategic activity, such as the combination of Trilogy and their emerging markets investment team in GW&K resulting in enhanced opportunities for their collective clients and increasing both the growth opportunity and efficiency for GW&K and AMG.","As Jay will explain further in a moment, we also reduced operating expenses at AMG and worked with many of our affiliates, including where we participate in categories of expenses to help them ensure they are aligning the infrastructures of their business with the opportunities and challenges they see ahead. Now in addition to these elements of organic growth in our existing business, we have another complementary growth engine. AMG\u2019s business model provides a significant opportunity to generate increased earnings as well as to add immediately salable products through investments in excellent new affiliates. AMG\u2019s equity ownership succession and solution is very attractive to asset management boutiques that value their independence, want a permanent solution and access to the scale of distribution platforms we have built. We continue to actively develop our proprietary relationships with leading boutiques. And while the volatility of the fourth quarter inevitably impacted some discussions and more broadly, the pace of activity is inherently based on the dynamics of each prospective affiliate, we have a good pipeline of high-quality new prospects, but we remain disciplined on pricing and alignment, particularly at this stage of the cycle.","In addition, as Jay will describe further, we continue to position our balance sheet to prioritize flexibility and prudent financial leverage in anticipation of continued market volatility, which in our experience often creates the most compelling investment opportunities. In addition to maintaining the financial flexibility to invest in new affiliates and continuing to execute on the other elements of our growth strategy, we also remain committed to consistently returning capital to our shareholders and we demonstrated this disciplined approach to capital allocation again in the fourth quarter.","Finally, while these are volatile times, we have built our business with diversity across multiple dimensions, asset class, geography, channel and affiliates. Across this diversity, we have very high-quality distinctive return streams managed by extraordinarily experienced investment teams. We also have a unique structure with low operating leverage as we think about the revenue sharing model, which underpins a significant majority of our business and we have prudent financial leverage. These characteristics differentiate us from other asset management firms, while providing stability as volatility continues, but also importantly position us to take advantage of the opportunities this volatility will inevitably create.","Now before I turn to Jay, I want to congratulate him on his appointment to President and thank him for a significant contribution as an integral member of AMG\u2019s senior team for many years. But in particular, I wanted to acknowledge his hard work and the true partnership he brought to Sean and to me through the CEO transition. Sean and I are looking forward to working with him in his new role as we grow our business and create long-term shareholder value.","And with that, I will turn it to Jay.","Jay Horgen","Good morning and thank you Nate for your kind comments. I echo the sentiment and I look forward to contributing in my new expanded role. And as Nate discussed, AMG\u2019s fourth quarter results were impacted by client risk aversion and declining markets, especially in the last 2 months of the year as reflected in both our net client cash flows for the quarter as well as our annual earnings contribution from performance fees. We also had a number of one-time items in the quarter, which I will describe in a moment.","In contrast to December, we have seen a marked improvement in both client cash flows and markets in January. Additionally, we are beginning to realize the benefits from expense management actions taken in the fourth quarter. And finally with an uplift in markets in a new calendar year, we expect material growth in the contribution of performance fees to our earnings in 2019. On flows generally, we experienced a higher level of redemptions from seasonality in the fourth quarter than in prior years, which included tax loss harvesting and selling ahead of year end mutual fund distributions in the retail channel as well as the expiration of annual liquidity lockups in single and multi-year vehicles in both the institutional and high net worth channel.","Taken together in the fourth quarter, we estimate the effect of seasonality in our quarterly flows, which was exacerbated by the market environment to be between $7 billion and $9 billion. In addition, elevated volatility in the fourth quarter increased industry-wide client risk aversion, which led to slowing sales activity and delayed fundings, especially in the institutional channel. Looking ahead, the first quarter typically brings a reversal to positive seasonal factors in our net client cash flows. Additionally, improvement in our fundamental equity performance is already contributing to positive publicly visible flow thus far in January.","Turning to our flows by asset class and starting with alternatives, which account for 40% of our AUM, we reported outflows of $9.5 billion driven by our liquid alternative strategies and partially offset by positive contributions from our illiquid product set. Our illiquids, which includes strategies such as global and regional private equity, co-investments, credit, real assets, infrastructure and real estate, had a solid level of fundings in the fourth quarter and we continue to see a steadily growing opportunity in illiquids as our affiliates build further on existing and new product capabilities. AMG\u2019s aggregate performance in illiquids is very strong, with 92% of our recent funds outperforming industry benchmarks on a net IRR basis and 82% outperforming on a net multiple basis.","In our liquid alternative category encompassing our multi-strategy systematic diversified and fixed income and equity relative value strategies, we saw significant outflows as a result of challenging recent relative performance, which was exacerbated by seasonality, especially in the retail channel in the last 2 months of the year. Our long-term investment performance in liquid alternatives remained strong with 56% and 82% of our assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over a 3 and 5-year period respectively.","Now turning to equities, which account for 46% of our AUM, in the global equities category, we saw net outflows of $3 billion in the quarter almost entirely driven by emerging market products. AMG continues to generate good long-term aggregate performance in this category with approximately 56% of our assets under management ahead of benchmark over a 5-year period, notwithstanding that our 3-year number was impacted by challenging performance in emerging market products. Among our affiliates in this category are some of the industry\u2019s leading global and emerging market managers who continue to have excellent competitive positioning. In U.S. equities, we reported net outflows of $3.9 billion due to fourth quarter seasonality and macro industry trends. However, looking at our public flows for January, we are beginning to see the benefits of significantly improved performance in this category. A number of our largest fundamental value equity managers are top quartile performers on a relative basis. We now have 51% of our AUM outperforming benchmarks on a 3-year basis in U.S. equities, a notable improvement relative to prior years.","Turning to the multi-asset and other category, which accounts for 14% of our AUM encompasses multi-asset and balanced mandates within our wealth management business as well as a number of specialty fixed income and multi-asset products. Here we posted $600 million in net inflows primarily driven by our systematic fixed income products, which continue to generate good flow momentum as well as our wealth management business where positive demand trends remain in place.","Now, turning to our financials, as you saw in the release, economic earnings per share decreased by 25% to $3.53 for the fourth quarter, including $0.15 of net performance fees. This decline was largely due to a decrease in net performance fees down from $1.09 a year ago. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of negative $2.88, reflecting the reduction in carrying value of Systematica. For the fourth quarter, aggregate fees decreased 27% to $1.2 billion from a year ago and the ratio of aggregate fees to average assets under management declined year-over-year from 82 basis points to 63 basis points, entirely driven by lower performance fees. Notably, the ratio of advisory fees to average assets under management remains flat year-over-year.","Adjusted EBITDA decreased 47% to $191.3 million from a year ago primarily due to the timing and impact of negative markets at the very end of 2018, which led to significantly lower performance fees and other income for the year. In addition, EBITDA was lower due to a number of non-recurring expenses, including fourth quarter items related to expense management and AMG\u2019s donation to Mass General Hospital. Excluding these one-time items, our fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA would have been $221 million. Relative to adjusted EBITDA, the smaller year-over-year declines in economic net income of 29% and economic earnings per share of 25% reflected lower taxes from U.S. tax reform, a one-time tax benefit from the liquidation of Ivory as well as lower year-over-year share count due to repurchase activity in the case of economic earnings per share.","Turning to more specific modeling items for the fourth quarter, the ratio of adjusted EBITDA to average assets under management was 9.9 basis points. However, excluding the one-time expenses I previously mentioned, it would have been 11.4 basis points or 10.8 basis points, excluding performance fees. In the first quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA to average assets under management to be in the range of 11.3 basis points to 11.7 basis points, reflecting a net performance fee range of $0.10 per share to $0.20 per share.","Stepping back on performance fee guidance for the full year 2019, we expect performance fee contribution to be in the range of $0.75 to $1.75 per share. This performance fee range incorporates product high watermarks, actual performance through January and a reasonable range around forward growth assumptions across all of our performance fee products. As you know, we have seasonality in our performance fee opportunity with a large majority of performance fee contracts having calendar year end crystallization and very few contracts crystallizing in the second and third quarters.","Our share of interest expense was $18.1 million for the fourth quarter. And in the first quarter, we expect our share of interest expense to remain at approximately $18 million. Our share of reported amortization and impairments was $288 million for the fourth quarter, including $261.9 million from affiliates accounted for under the equity method. As you saw in the release, this included the $240 million non-cash charge I mentioned earlier. Looking ahead to the first quarter, we expect our share of reported amortization and impairments to be approximately $45 million.","Turning to taxes, with regard to our tax rates in the fourth quarter, our effective GAAP and cash tax rates were impacted by one-time items. And as a result, our GAAP tax rate was negative and our cash tax rate was 15.7%. For modeling purposes, we expect our GAAP and cash tax rates to be approximately 26% and 18% respectively. Intangible-related deferred taxes were $49.6 million in the fourth quarter, which were elevated for the liquidation of Ivory and certain other non-cash items related to U.S. tax reform. For the first quarter, we expect intangible-related deferred taxes to be approximately $11 million. Other economic items were negative $0.5 million for the fourth quarter. And for modeling purposes, we expect other economic items to be approximately $1 million per quarter. Our adjusted weighted average share count for the fourth quarter was 52.7 million and we expect it to be approximately 51.8 million for the first quarter.","Turning to our balance sheet, on capital management broadly speaking, we have maintained a prudent level of leverage to be able to capitalize on growth opportunities even in challenging markets. In addition, we have continued to return capital to our shareholders within a framework of disciplined capital management. During the fourth quarter in the midst of a volatile market, we paid a $0.30 per share dividend and repurchased $76 million in shares, while continuing to position our balance sheet, including extending the maturity of our revolver and term loan.","Looking ahead, as you saw in the release, we announced a first quarter dividend of $0.32 per share, which reflects a 7% increase as well as a 3.3 million share increase to our repurchase authorization for a total of 5 million shares. In the first half of 2019, we expect to repurchase between $100 million and $300 million in shares. However, the amount and timing will depend on the potential new investments and market conditions.","Before we take questions, I would like to make one final point. Over the past 5 years, we have reduced our financial leverage as part of our disciplined approach to capital management. And as you heard Nate say, AMG\u2019s unique revenue share structure, which is in place across the large majority of our affiliate group, limits our exposure to operating leverage, which in periods of heightened volatility enhances the stability of our earnings. This combination of prudent financial leverage and limited operating leverage gives us the flexibility to deploy capital and capitalize on our growth opportunities, including in periods of market dislocation.","Now, we will be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Bill Katz","Thank you very much. Maybe Jay congratulations first of all on the promotion, maybe we could start there. Given the promotion, I was wondering what if any change in strategy there might be or maybe just tick off the top 2 or 3 incremental things you\u2019re looking as we think about 2019 and beyond?","Jay Horgen","Thank you, Bill. Yes, so look, you know this, and I think most everyone on the phone, I\u2019ve been at AMG for 12 years now. I\u2019ve been involved in the strategic decisions across multiple aspects of our business for some time, including distribution and so this new role is simply an evolution of my responsibilities. It\u2019s not a change or major change for our business I\u2019ve been working closely with the head of our new or the Head of our Global Distribution, Hugh Cutler, has been with us for a couple of years now on a number of projects he is doing a nice job he is got a great team and I look forward to helping him grow our business in this area in addition to my new responsibilities in distribution, I\u2019ll continue to be involved in all aspects of our business as a senior member of the team.","Nate Dalton","And maybe, Bill, I\u2019ll add something to that, which is look, we have this we talked about this, I think, a couple of calls ago, but we\u2019ve got this an excellent senior team with a really good balanced mix of people who have been with us for a long time, like Jay, obviously, and also newer perspectives and people we brought in across different functional areas and a lot of people have stepped up over this past year as we\u2019ve had some transition but it\u2019s clear we\u2019re better positioned than ever before in terms of the breadth and depth of the team we\u2019ve got and then finally, I\u2019d say also this is a good environment to attract new talent as well so look, we\u2019ve built a really strong senior management team, and it\u2019s great to watch how that team continues to evolve as we execute against our strategy.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW.","Robert Lee","Great thanks. Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, I\u2019m just you touched on the capital management, which always been I\u2019m just kind of curious I mean, just how do you think of your kind of deal capacity right now? And within that, understanding one of the key dry powder and but have you changed at all how you\u2019re thinking about ultimate kind of leverage that you\u2019re willing to run at if you find the right transaction? I mean, I guess, historically, in the past, you\u2019ve, at times, gone 3x or more, but do you, has that changed at all? I mean, given the environment that there\u2019s more of a governor on kind of the amount of leverage you\u2019d add per transaction?","Jay Horgen","Yes thanks, Rob. Let me start here. Well, yes, I appreciate the way you asked the question. I mean, taking a step back for a moment, our longer term view on our balance sheet is to position it for strength, make sure that we are able to execute on our growth opportunities over a cycle and we have prudently managed our balance sheet over this time I\u2019d say look at the last 5 years, we\u2019ve taken leverage down quite a bit that\u2019s led to increase in ratings it is just a reflection of that leverage coming down but during the same time, we\u2019ve been committed to returning capital to shareholders, and we\u2019ve returned $1 billion since the beginning of 2017 as far as capacity, let me walk you through that we did just extend our revolver new 5 year revolver in January, extended our term loan as well so we are well positioned today with leverage in a good place and also enough capacity on our revolver, nearly $1 billion on our revolver to execute on our new investment pipeline I think when you look at the capital model over time continuing to limit leverage and reduce that we think we can do that, while also returning capital to shareholders and we have repurchased shares in each of the last 8 quarters with $76 million being repurchased in this past quarter and maybe I\u2019ll just address that a bit further we met pretty volatile markets in December and so we did a bit less than we had initially expected to do in the fourth quarter really because of the extreme volatility in the last 2 to 3 weeks of the year and looking ahead, this year, we expect to continue to repurchase we mentioned in the prepared remarks $100 million to $300 million in the first half of the year as you also saw, we increased our dividend, we increased our share authorization, so that we could repurchase additional shares throughout the year we can give ample capacity under that authorization so taken together, we do think we\u2019re going to continue to reduce leverage, continue to repurchase shares, but the most important use of our capital is new investments we think that\u2019s a continued tremendous opportunity for us over the long term, especially in periods of volatility because after those periods, that tends to be times when executing a new investment is most attractive to shareholders.","Nate Dalton","Yes. And the only thing I would add to that is, I think the question ultimately becomes especially if you\u2019re going to do something larger, the question becomes when do you have that highest degree of confidence in the opportunities set ahead of you? And I think as Jay said, we\u2019re positioning ourselves to be able to take advantage of the opportunity to deploy capital.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch.","Shaun Calnan","This is actually Shaun on for Mike. Thanks for taking my question. Given the more challenging industry trends and the increasing need for scale, do you see opportunities to centralize more Affiliate cost to create some synergy and scale benefits?","Nate Dalton","Yes, so let me start with that. So we\u2019ve talked about on prior calls, there are parts of asset management where scale definitely advantage and there are parts of it where it\u2019s not and I think this is where it\u2019s important to understand the kind of the unique business model that AMG has, which is we are able to manage diverse set of distinctive return streams at effectively enormous scale in this Affiliate model that we have and the place where we have been investing and place where we have been working with our affiliates is how can you more effectively bring that significant scale of diverse distinct return streams to bear, which plays into some macro trends as well, and we talked in our prepared remarks about the consolidation of buyer behavior and centralization so that those are places we\u2019ve been investing and some of that is what we\u2019ll be doing with global distribution but some of it frankly, these things like and we announced, I think, the Nordea relationship today Nordea Asset Management, some of it is our ability to continue to do things like that which is through a single point of contact make it very efficient for large buyers or large intermediaries to understand all of the return streams our affiliates have and then make it really easy for them to get access to the streams they want, which could be a product or could be something new, but get access to the things they want and then get them into their client portfolios in a way that is both better in terms of faster getting the return streams faster and into the client portfolios but also, ultimately done in a way that\u2019s the higher margin for us and for them, as we make it really efficient for them to both understand the return streams and understand the evolution as well and then the final thing I\u2019ll say, there\u2019s a really good virtuous circle to this, which we learn a lot from these relationships as we\u2019ve been going through them, which informs not just our product development, but also informs our new investment activity as well so those are places we\u2019re investing we think there\u2019s a tremendous opportunity, and we\u2019re really just at the early stages of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Shutler","Hi good morning. So, on new investments, I know you missed out on some deals because of just being prudent around valuation but given the scarcity of strong growing asset management firms, I guess, curious to know how you are thinking about valuation in this environment? I know you have historically paid a 10x-ish EBITDA and more broadly, why are you convinced this business model is still the right one and are you contemplating any kind of changes or moves into adjacencies?","Nate Dalton","Yes, so let me start with a lot of pieces to that question. So first, we think there remains a very significant opportunity with the sort of fundamental approach we have, which is how do you partner permanent institutional partner, how do you partner with these outstanding manufacturing businesses that opportunity is, we think, still there we also think there\u2019s an opportunity to be a much better partner to these firms and this goes to some of the kinds of things I was talking about in the prior answer to the prior question, which is, we didn\u2019t we\u2019ve been building capabilities, which make us a better partner to those kinds of firms so we think that opportunity is really significant first you are right, we\u2019ve been disciplined but it\u2019s not just around pricing, we\u2019ve been disciplined around a lot of different dimensions so we\u2019ve disciplined about the quality of the organizations and I think we talked on earlier call about what we mean by high-quality firms and what are the kinds of firms we think are going to succeed in this environment so we\u2019ve been disciplined about quality we have been disciplined about alignment, making sure that we really get good long-term alignment in a way that can ultimately be multigenerational with the management team, which we think is important for our model, which we\u2019re which has a permanent component we talked about so we\u2019ve been disciplined about the quality of the firms we have disciplined about the alignment we get with them and absolutely, we\u2019ve been disciplined about pricing but I\u2019ll say that\u2019s really just an issue in a subset of the opportunity set in front of us it is an issue in our subset, but it\u2019s really just an issue in our subset of the opportunity in front of us in terms of adjacencies, we have looked and we continue to look at ways that we can extend what we do but we think there\u2019s such a big opportunity just in collecting these affiliates, which have these fantastic return streams, these distinctive return streams collecting those as part of AMG and on our platform and then helping them go into client portfolios in a more effective way. We think that opportunity is a really significant and differentiated rich opportunity we don\u2019t think there is anybody else out there who\u2019s able to prosecute that same opportunity.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Alex Blostein","Thanks. Hi. I was hoping just to get a cleanup question and I guess as we are thinking about the baseline kind of management fee EPS for the guys to start off the first quarter, obviously, lots of moving pieces given the painful end of the year and nice rebound here, but also it sounds like you guys are making various kind of corporate investments so I heard you kind of $0.10 to $0.20 in performances fees, but maybe help us with the baseline management fee run rate?","Jay Horgen","Yes. So Alex, it\u2019s Jay. Maybe I will make a couple of comments here the first just to put the framing out there, we give guidance in a number of areas, and I think you know this: first is just helping you estimate the run rate AUM and EBITDA, second is just the framework for modeling future growth and the third is performance fees on the first, the run rate, AUM and EBITDA, which is directly to your question, we started the year with $736 billion in AUM our January markets are up, and we\u2019ve have had good flows as well in the retail channel, a reversal from the fourth quarter so when you take that together, our market blend is up about 4%, maybe a little over at this point and so that gives you a sense for where AUM is and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we\u2019re in a range of take the midpoint of that range 11.5 of EBITDA to average AUM and you can get pretty close to what we think is a reasonable EBITDA run rate for the first quarter another way to look at it is we gave you what our EBITDA would have been before onetime items in the fourth quarter of $221 million we are off a little bit because the carryover effect of the fourth quarter being offset by the market and flows in the first quarter so far, we\u2019re down a couple of percent, call it so I think, $215-ish million on a run-rate basis so that\u2019s another way to get to the same number obviously, we go through all the other items to help you translate EBITDA down to EPS in the guidance as it relates to the framework for modeling future growth, I think we see consensus in The Street developing a good framework to track that as you know, here, we\u2019ve historically guided people 2% per quarter, but that\u2019s really up to you and I think almost everyone knows how to track that and then on the third item, we talked about performance fees, given you guidance in the first quarter that in that range of EBITDA to average AUM, we do expect $0.10 to $0.20 so at that 11.5, call midpoint of $0.15 for the first quarter second and third quarters, we typically don\u2019t have a lot of contracts that crystallize so a step down in those quarters and then for the full year, as you heard me say, we expect a range of $0.75 to $1.75 and I\u2019ll just comment that, again, given the uplift in markets, new calendar year, we\u2019ve really improved on our high watermarks from last year\u2019s performance and so we feel pretty good about that performance fee opportunity.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Bedell","Great. Thanks very much. Maybe Jay or Nate, if you can go a little bit deeper into some of the alternative outflows in the fourth quarter, and I think, Nate, you mentioned there are delayed funding pipelines, if those are actually turning around now in 1Q? And then just on the one-time in the fourth quarter, if you could \u2013 I don\u2019t \u2013 sorry, if I missed this, if you could parse out the Mass General versus the other one-time items that you guys took for AMG expenses? And then as you think about expenses going forward, Jay, on the global distribution effort, does it make sense to actually maybe invest more in that given you think you can obviously leverage the good performance across a lot of your strategies going forward?","Nate Dalton","Maybe I\u2019ll start \u2013 I mean, we\u2019ll try \u2013 maybe try and do those in \u2013 maybe we\u2019ll try to do that one question in reverse order. So, let me start with the spending point because we talked about this a little in our prepared remarks and how we invest in the business. And so if you look, Brian, I think we\u2019re pretty decisive \u2013 we and affiliates were pretty decisive in the fourth quarter in terms of \u2013 and we\u2019ve been \u2013 look, we talked about this on earlier calls. We\u2019ve been looking at this for the last couple of quarters, which is how do we make sure we\u2019re allocating our resources to the right things? And so we\u2019ve reduced spend and we\u2019ve clearly reduced resources allocated to kind of products, packages, channels that are subject to commoditization, all those kinds of things, some of it by us, some of it by affiliates, some of it is just kind of rightsizing resources, some of it is kind of critically examining opportunities. But then at the same time, we\u2019ve been investing and increasing spend against both on the product development side, where the places where we can enhance distinctive return streams exist, and this has been a good environment also to add and invest in building out. Again, this volatility creates opportunity to build out at some affiliates, where there\u2019s opportunity to really accelerate product development. And then as you said, a place we have been investing both people and operational build is how do we make sure we get these return streams into the appropriate client portfolios? Now, some of that is sort of specifically what we would have referred to as global distribution. And I think we talked about last quarter, for example, opening Japan, where we think there is a very large opportunity, very early innings and we continue to see good traction. And some of our affiliates, Pantheon and AQR already have also opened up alongside that. Some of it is also the - building against these kind of what I\u2019ll call kind of channel partnerships or strategic relationships and some of them were complicated mandates we\u2019ve talked about on earlier calls is building those resources so that we can get affiliate return streams efficiently in the field for both. So, we\u2019re absolutely doing that on that part of the question.","Jay Horgen","Yes. So, I just wanted to add on the expenses to Nate\u2019s. The first thing I would say is, the \u2013 as you know, large majority of our affiliates are under revenue share, but where we do have exposure to expenses at AMG and at certain of our equity method affiliates, we and they had reduced expenses pretty decisively in the fourth quarter, gave rise to kind of about $10 million of one-time items in the fourth quarter. We will experience that sort of savings in \u201819. So, if you look at where we\u2019re exposed to expenses, again, at AMG and at certain of our equity method affiliates, we\u2019re going to take expenses down 2% to 3% year-over-year, and so that\u2019s already in place. The other one-time expenses just to kind of keep on that theme, obviously, MGH, so the total of MGH and those one-time expense management actions has brought our EBITDA from kind of $191 million to $221 million, that was in my prepared remarks I mentioned that. We had a couple of other one-time items. Of course, the tax benefits in recovery from Ivory, as well as the re-valuation of Systematica, those were the kind of four one-time items in the quarter if you\u2019re tracking that. They all go through different financial statement line items. So, I\u2019m happy to kind of follow up with you if you like on that. So, I think that\u2019s on expenses. And I believe there \u2013 was there one more question? I can\u2019t remember if there was now.","Brian Bedell","That\u2019s \u2013 if that\u2019s turning around \u2013 ","Jay Horgen","Oh, yes, on alternative, yes. So, on alternative flows and maybe I\u2019ll take flows, sorry, that was the \u2013 I was tracking back in reverse order through your one question. So just the bridge flows for a moment. You did hear me say on the \u2013 in the prepared remarks that we did see some seasonality, pretty significant seasonality, which exacerbated \u2013 was exacerbated by the December volatility. So, when we took a look at the data \u2013 and we do have pretty good visibility into the institutional book, as well as retail seasonality, so the institutional, the expiration of multi-year locks and single-year locks. And we had about $3 billion to $4 billion of seasonality there with another $4 billion to $5 billion in retail that kind of get you to that $7 billion to $9 billion number that I mentioned on the call.","The other factor, which is a little harder to assess, but we still, I think that there\u2019s a real number here, the risk aversion, which was causing lower sales given the extreme markets impacted our flows in kind of that $1 billion to $2 billion number that level. So, when you take all that away, there was still some softness in our flows and that really was alternatives in retail, liquid alternatives, but seasonality really did \u2013 exacerbated and risk aversion exacerbated. When we look more broadly kind of over the course of the year, we look at first quarter and say in retail, you\u2019ve got positive flows through January, improving performance in U.S. equities, solid illiquid capital raising activity, the trends for us remain intact. Volatility is good for active management. And we do, broadly speaking, have a lot of good performing products across the diverse business that we have. When you add on to it ample capacity, new products starting to gain traction, like the Systematics fixed-income business that Nate mentioned together with our distribution efforts, our evolving partnership with Nordea, we do think that we\u2019re going to be able to take these distinctive products into new channels, new regions, new partnerships and pulling all that together, where our long-term kind of growth outlook at least for \u2013 through this year \u2013 I should say, the medium-term growth outlook for this year, we do expect to return by the end of 2019 to something like 2% organic growth.","Nate Dalton","And then the only thing I would add to that is, because I think that\u2019s a really good bridge to sort of think about the year, but the only thing I\u2019d add to that is, there\u2019s a couple of just sort of underlying dynamics and Jay touched on one, which is this kind of balance between the development of product that has \u2013 we believe is distinctive and has good opportunity with the evolution of the book and, frankly, the roll-off in the book of a product that we think is more sort of commoditized or susceptible of being commoditized. And you did see that over a period of time in some of our U.S. equity book in the institutional phase as an example. So, some of it is just simply that kind of evolution if you look at the mix of our products. We\u2019re feeling really good about the distinctive nature of most \u2013 of an increasing percentage of those products. And then the other dynamic I\u2019ll just mention is that the pull back in the fourth quarter and some of the volatility combined, we have a number of products that are \u2013 there are fantastic products with very strong long-term track records that have been closed and are reopening or kind of making progress in that way and sort of where they\u2019re starting to sort out how are they going to put some of the capacity they\u2019ve got, both from the fact they\u2019ve been closed and so you can\u2019t have inflows, you have had outflows. But also from the standpoint of \u2013 with all these outflows we seeing real opportunities. So, I think that \u2013 those are other dynamics that put together, business extends, but these are longer-term trends. I think business extends beyond this year. We think the opportunity ultimately is we can get back to kind of where we were in the first half of the decade.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Dan Fannon","Thanks. Good morning. Excuse me, so just first one to clarify, Jay, positive flows in January versus I think Nate said breakeven. So just clarify that on the retail or maybe that was all-in? And then in terms of institutional activity, just curious if we see the retail data which obviously is only a subset, but is retail within the liquid alternatives acting different than the institutional client base or you\u2019re seeing kind of broadly institutional kind of demand changing for some of the alternative strategies particularly at AQR?","Jay Horgen","Yes. So yes, let me \u2013 I\u2019ll clarify. Yes. No, we did see about $100 million positive in the publicly visible, so I think Nate characterized that \u2013 ","Nate Dalton","I think it\u2019s in that roughly \u2013 ","Jay Horgen","Yes, and I characterized that as positive. Clearly, that was a significant reversal from December. And just \u2013 I think Nate will probably pick up on the alternative point here and how it\u2019s acting in institutional. But I would just say when you look at the retail flows publicly visible this quarter and that\u2019s not all of retail, Dan. We do have sub-advisory and some non-reporting retail, that\u2019s harder for us to see even given that it is just early February. But just commenting on what trends we\u2019re seeing in the publicly visible, clearly, the sort of value managers, both the U.S. and global, have seen a pretty strong reversal in both investment performance and flows. We\u2019ve had good flows in U.S. equities. And so, one of the themes that I think is emerging here for us is when we \u2013 where we\u2019ve had pretty significant outflows for a significant number of years here in U.S. equities. We\u2019ve seen really good things and the decreasing of outflows or maybe even positive flows. Names like Yacktman, Frontier, River Road have top quartile performance over the long term. And we\u2019ve seen our U.S. equity kind of 3-year numbers in aggregate for the first time go above 50% and that\u2019s probably 3 years or 4 years since that happened. So, we\u2019re very positive about that. Among global equities, we have also seen there a really good performance especially in global and international mandate, as well as the regional \u2013 sorry, regional \u2013 global international and regional products. We\u2019ve been plagued a little bit by EM performance. It\u2019s been a tough go for active in EM. Still have great affiliates positioned well in EM and some of those affiliates are opening products back up. When you look into the underlying data, you\u2019re seeing global mandates international really being driven by that outstanding performance. So those themes really are emerging here in 2019 and then as it relates to alternatives \u2013 liquid alternatives and institutional maybe.","Nate Dalton","Yes. So maybe I\u2019ll make a couple of comments there. So, I think \u2013 look I think \u2013 so 2018 was an extraordinary year. I mean, it was a really extraordinary year in terms of the breadth of the negative returns across asset classes, I mean, sort of historic. So that was an extraordinary year. But the underlying thesis around why people are trying to get these alternative return streams into their portfolios, they\u2019re all remain intact. And I think you\u2019d even see \u2013 even we talked about this in our prepared remarks, even with that, that extraordinary breadth of negative returns across asset classes, it really did serve a diversifying effect now, that didn\u2019t serve a fact that they were up and so therefore, we would realize performance fees and we talked about that, but they do serve a diversifying effect. And so look I think the fundamental thesis about why people are using return streams remain fully intact. And we look at the decision-making around the \u2013 in the institutional channel around alternatives and we see \u2013 we continue to see very strong sales activity across a wide range of products, both liquid and illiquid, but certainly in liquids. So, it\u2019s not a challenge of pipeline and sales, an opportunity to develop new products on the rise, so that all remains intact. I will say there is one other point, which is \u2013 and Jay touched on this before, which is in the retail channel, part of what happened was really just the combination of the performance plus the seasonality as people went through, whether it was selling ahead of distributions or tax loss selling, that was part of what we experienced as well. And then even in the institutional channel and I think Jay mentioned this, there was seasonality in institutional, there\u2019s just typically is as you get to the expiration of kind of single and multi-year locks right at the end of the year. So we think that demand trend \u2013 the underlying trends are intact. We think there is really good activity in the pipeline. And so we do think it should be \u2013 it\u2019s not acting the same as retail, if that\u2019s kind of part of the question and we think that \u2013 again those underlying trends should continue. All that said, of course, it\u2019s ultimately the return streams have to be distinctive and performing.","Jay Horgen","Yes, one last thing. I didn\u2019t want to leave these underlying trends without also mentioning just the PE fundraising and illiquids. We had a solid quarter. We had a solid year off of 2 years. We look forward and we see continued growth in illiquids, both kind of new products and the partnerships with large pools of capital. We do see this as an enduring growth opportunity for us as kind of the other major trend this year.","Nate Dalton","Yes. And a place where there\u2019s really good product development going on.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Lee","Great, and thanks for taking my follow-up. Would it be possible to \u2013 if we think of the \u2013 maybe the flows in the quarter kind of characterize that in terms of its EBITDA impact, if organically it was maybe on just the asset base to stand just under 2%. Would the EBITDA impact be kind of similar? Was there some mix issue that will make it greater or lower? And if we think, Jay, kind of thinking that you can get back to the 2% organic growth maybe by the end of \u201819. I guess, similar question given how you\u2019re looking at the mix going forward from what you can see, would that be indicative of kind of the EBITDA contribution?","Jay Horgen","Yes. So, let\u2019s take the EBITDA contribution first. Yes, the asset-weighted EBITDA contribution, it\u2019s a little hard to see in the underlying data because performance fees had such an impact on our results in the fourth quarter. But one of the things you can see, as I mentioned, if you kind of track EBITDA from third to fourth to first quarter and I mentioned the $221 million before one-time items in the fourth quarter EBITDA going to something it looks like $215 million, that\u2019s just a couple of percent down. And the way you can also see that, that\u2019s tracking, that was consistent with your inference, that\u2019s tracking to when you look at average EBITDA to average AUM, it\u2019s actually going back up. So, what that suggest is that the assets that were lost had an average weighting that was consistent with our overall business and the mix shift for us is actually going back the other way after several quarters, 6 quarters, 7 quarters rather than going the reverse direction, we see it actually improving on profitability. So, our EBITDA to average AUM is improving as we go. So I would say that I think that\u2019s partly because of where we\u2019re growing and it\u2019s also partly based upon the ownership mix of our business.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our time for questions. I\u2019ll turn the floor back to Mr. Dalton for any final comments.","Nate Dalton","Thank you all again for joining us this morning.

You may begin.","Selene Oh","Thank you for joining AMG to discuss the results for the fourth quarter of 2017. In this conference call, certain matters discussed will constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those referenced in the company\u2019s Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time.

AMG reported record economic earnings per share of $4.68 for the fourth quarter and $14.60 for the full-year, representing growth of 23% and 14% over the respective periods of 2016. Our assets under management also grew 21% to a record $836 billion. Our excellent results for the year reflects strong organic growth, including the long-term investment outperformance of our Alpha generating affiliates and positive net client cash flows along with the ongoing execution of our growth strategy. Given the increased scale and diversity and earnings power of our business, we are confident in our ability to continue to generate strong growth going forward.","We're pleased with the organic growth we generated in 2017 with assets under management having increased nearly $150 billion in the year. Our results demonstrate AMG\u2019s ability to generate strong growth in a rising equity market environment, notwithstanding our substantial exposure to uncorrelated alternative strategies, which are optimally positioned for periods of market volatility and provide stability and resilience to our business across market cycles. We also were pleased to generate positive net client cash flows during both the quarter and the year, notwithstanding continued industry wide net outflows enacted in actively managed strategies.","Looking ahead, we're seeing increasing demand for Affiliates global equity and alternative strategies, as clients around the world continue to seek differentiated return streams in anticipation of an environment of increasing dispersion of asset returns. The fourth quarter was a record of gross sales quarter for us and has enabled described further we are seeing strong business momentum across our Alfa oriented product set. Given the underlying fundamentals in many non-U.S. regions both U.S. and non-U.S. investors are expanding their allocations to these markets and we're seeing ongoing opportunities for growth in global activities, which today account for 35% of our assets.","In addition, we see strong growth going forward across our alternative product range which accounts for nearly 40% of our assets. Investors are increasingly seeking uncorrelated sources of Alpha and with one of the industry's broadest and most diverse ranges of alternative strategies, including relative values, systematic diversified, private equity multi-strategy and other alternative products, AMG offers clients true diversification from traditional fixed income and equity market.","Global clients increasingly recognize the advantages of specialist boutique firms in managing the Alpha portions of their portfolios, but there are some continuously [ph] concentrating their manager relationships. Given this ongoing trend, it is clear in the future excellent investment performance won't necessarily be enough for smaller specialized managers lacking product breadth and global reach. Through AMG\u2019s global distribution strategy which combined centralized distribution resources which complement our Affiliates marketing efforts, we offer our Affiliates and ultimately our clients, the advantages of global scale and distribution compliance while also providing the excellence in alpha generation of focused and aligned boutiques. ","As large institutions and intermediaries' consolidator manager relationship, they are attracted to AMG\u2019s single point event that to the world's broadest array of boutique alpha-oriented strategy and are building strategic relationships with across Affiliates and asset classes and we believe these kinds of relationship will be an increasingly important element of our organic growth going forward.","Turning to new investment. Given our outstanding track record as a permanent strategic partner to our Affiliates over the past two decades, AMG has a tremendously attractive secular opportunity to continue to create incremental earnings growth and shareholder value through investments in additional excellent boutique around the world. ","Given the favorable market environment and the strong performance generated by many boutique firms along with recent changes in U.S. tax law, we are seeing increasing new investment opportunities and have a diverse and growing pipeline. With our unique competitive position as the partner of choice to outstanding independent firms, we will remain highly selective and disciplined in the execution of our new investments strategy.","In addition, given the increasing scale of our business, our strong recurring free cash flow is an important source of shareholder value and we are positioned to consistently return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Reflecting our confidence in our forward prospects, our board of directors has approved a 50% increase in our dividend along with a meaningful additional share repurchase authorization.","Looking ahead, AMG is well positioned on a global basis across all elements of our growth strategy and the increased breadth and scale of our business along with our unraveled reputation as a partner to outstanding boutique firm will continue to create additional avenue to growth through expanding the marketing reach of our Affiliates, building strategic relationships with key global clients and enhancing our capabilities across client types. We look forward to continue to generate strong earnings growth and outstanding long-term shareholder value in the years to come.","With that, I'll turn it to Nate to discuss our Affiliates results in more detail.","Nathaniel Dalton","Thanks, and good morning, everyone. As Sean said, AMG ended the year with the very good fourth quarter as we participated in rising markets, our Affiliates of the growth added to their excellent long-term track records and our Affiliates and AMG together added positive net flows. We are entering 2018 with great momentum across our diverse range of actively managed strategies, absolute and relative performance continue to be excellent and the level of execution of both AMG and our Affiliates business development team is very high moving across the channel at all stages of the pipeline.","Before turning to the details though, I wanted to review some of the highlights from our flow profile last quarter. While the net number was positive 1 billion that really understates the size of the opportunity we\u2019re executing against. ","From a sales standpoint, this is our best quarter ever with nearly 40 billion in gross sales as a result of good execution across all of our client types. While we did some lumpy winds in the quarter. We also had a couple of lumpy partial redemptions in the quarter as clients rebalanced in some accounts that significantly appreciated. ","Finally, this excellent sales quarter was also impacted by some fourth quarter seasonality including tax loss harvesting and dividend and capital gains distributions within our retail business. ","As I said, we feel very good about the forward pipeline and opportunities as we enter 2018. With a high level of institutional activity across one that unfunded mandates, finals and RFPs across our diversified equity, multi-assets and alternative strategies. And our fund-raising pipeline with illiquid strategy is in private equity, infrastructure, real estates, credit and co-investment product is not only beginning to convert, but is also continuing to extending grow. Overall, we see tremendous ongoing opportunities for performance-oriented strategies, providing high-conviction alpha and true diversification and we are increasingly able to leverage our scale to bring these products to sophisticated investors and intermediaries.","Now turning to the details for the quarter. As a reminder, our product categories include alternatives, global equities including both developed and emerging markets, U.S. equities and multi-asset and other strategy. In addition, we will continue to discuss our alternative product at the sub category level to dimension underlying return and flow dynamics that are hard to see at the aggregate level. ","Now starting with our alternative strategies, which account for 39% of our business by assets, within private equity and real assets, our Affiliates, including Baring Asia, EIG and Pantheon, continued their strong long-term track records across their flagship offerings in categories such as global and regional private equities, primary secondaries and co-investment and infrastructure, including energy. Each of these Affiliates has broadening their product lines to diversify their growth opportunities in complementary areas such as co-investments, credit, infrastructure, real assets and real estate. The increased breath of these franchises across those legacy flagship strategies and scalable product line extensions has created a strong and organic growth opportunity. ","We\u2019re also working closely with these firms to expand their distribution reach across new geographies and product types. We believe these businesses will make a substantial contribution to what is enhanced growth profile for AMG. ","In fixed income and equity-relative value most major indices were positive for the quarter. The HFRI Relative Value Index posted 1.1% return and the HFRI Equity Hedge Index returned 3.5%. On the other hand, the HFRI Venture-Driven Activist Index was an out layer the loss of 0.9%. ","In terms of Affiliates, ValueAct had a very good quarter outperforming both its peer group and benchmark. Outside of ValueAct performance in the categories were mixed across key products at AQR, BlueMountain, Capula and Systematica. But all of these strategies continue to maintain very good long-term track record and after a good start in 2018. ","Between our multi-strategy and other category our primary index, the HFRI Fund Weighted Composite returned 2.7% for the quarter. Against that backdrop, most of our Affiliates\u2019 key strategies generated excellent absolute returns and relative returns in the quarter benefiting from strong market betas across multiple asset classes and these strategies also continued into 2018. ","Products that performed particularly well last quarter included AQR\u2019s multi-assets style premier, alternative beta and risk-bearing strategies and multi-strategy products as well as First Quadrant\u2019s prosperity and commodity strategies. ","In our systematic diversified category, industry returns were good in the quarter with the SocGen Trend Index rising by 7.7%. While experiencing weak absolute performance in the first three quarters of the year the group capitalized on the strong trends in the fourth quarter pushing overall 2017 returns in the positive territory. This positive performance has continued into 2018, although obviously early dated. ","Amongst our Affiliates in the fourth quarter of 2017, Systematica outperformed the index and their high-quality periods while we managed these products with other affiliates all generated good absolute return, we were mixed relative to the index.","Now turning to flows in our alternatives category. We had another good quarter of organic growth supported by continued sales momentum across both institutional and retail clients. While gross sales are very good in the quarter net flows were positive 1.1 billion were bit below trend. As we experienced some portfolio rebalancing activity within our institutional business and some seasonality in our retail business. ","Looking at the quarter on a sub-category basis, constituent with recent trends we continue to see good flows in the multi-strategy and other subcategory, while systematic diversified continued to be in the redemption, both improving performance in the fourth quarter and into January, we would anticipate this to reverse, there continues to be significant broad-based demand for algorithmic investing and our Affiliates among the leaders in developing products to meet this demand. ","Finally, we also had another strong quarter in our private equity and more illiquid product set as we saw some significant wins and interim fund closings again.","Looking ahead, we continue to see very good momentum in both our liquid and illiquid pipelines, and expect continued outstanding growth across our product set.","Turning next to our global equities category, which accounts for approximately 35% of our business by assets, it was a great quarter for global developed markets as the MSCI World Index returned 5.6% with investors rewarding those stocks and sectors with especially high growth characteristics. ","Against that backdrop, our affiliates generated mixed relative results in the quarter with the flagship global strategy in Harding Loevner outperforming, while more value-oriented strategies Tweedy, Browne and Veritas underperform the broader index. However, overall performance in 2017 was very strong with the larger strategies of AQR, Harding Loevner, Times Square, Trilogy and Veritas outpacing their indices but the group as a whole continued its excellent long-term track records. ","Emerging markets also posed very strong returns with a benchmark MSCI emerging market index, up 7.5% in the quarter. Among our Affiliates, the Genesis flagship products outpaced the index, while AQR and Harding Loevner lagged for the quarter, but continued to maintain their excellent long-term track records.","Moving to global equity flows, we have meaningful improvements in the third quarter with a return to positive net flows behind a very strong sales quarter and we continue to see high level of activity within the category across both developed and emerging market products. ","As Sean said we are participating in a broad-based trend in which investors are increasingly shifting away from their home country bias, but ultimately recently investors seem to be interested in rebalancing further away from US equities, given the recent relative performance in the U.S. market. We\u2019re very well-positioned as this continues to unfold as AQR, Harding Loevner, Tweedy, Browne and Veritas while maintaining excellent long-term track records of their primary products, but also as we have a significant level of product development and there are number of new products beginning to get traction.","Turning next to U.S. equities, which accounts for 14% of our business by assets. Markets were meaningfully positive as the large caps outperformed the small caps and growth outperformed value. For the quarter, the S&P 500 returned 6.6%, while the Russell 2000 Index returned 3.3%. We have very good relative performance in a number of smaller cap strategies, an area where many of our affiliates, including Times Square, Frontier, GW&K, River Road, and SFM outperformed across their flagship products. Affiliates with US largecap strategies, including SFM and Yacktman, also outperformed their benchmarks and peers this quarter. ","Now within U.S. equities, we saw $1.6 billion in net outflows, as the institutional search activity and retail demand for actively managed U.S. strategies continues to be relatively muted across the industry. That said we continue to see an improved institutional redemption profile and some sales growth in particular within our quantitative and factor activity strategies, partially offset by the seasonal impact of dividend and capital gain distribution outflows within our retail business.","Finally moving to the multi-asset and other category which accounts for 12% of the business by assets and encompasses multi-asset and balance mandates at our wealth management Affiliates, as well as a number of specialties, fixed income and multi-asset products. We had an excellent quarter producing net flows of $1.3 billion as we continue to see growing sales activity across all three of our client segments within our specialty, fixed income and multi-asset product set as well as some good new business growth within our wealth management affiliates.","Performance for most of the products in this category remain good versus our benchmarks and the customized portfolios were wealth management Affiliates, broadly speaking continue to perform well across their ultra-high net worth client basis.","The business we have developed is very well positioned to perform across the market cycle, we\u2019ve an outstanding group of performance-oriented affiliates, this diversity across a number of important dimensions including product category, client segment and geography. Together with our Affiliates, we are one of the largest providers of alpha-oriented strategy in the world especially alternatives in global emerging markets equity. The combination of focused excellence by our Affiliates and the scope and scale of the global asset manager provides us with a number of significant opportunities to continue to improve, we together meet evolving needs of clients.","As Sean said, we are making very good progress, and we see tremendous opportunities ahead, as we continue to execute, we continue to enhance our position as the partner of choice to the best boutiques in the world, and drive significant growth across our Affiliate group.","And with that, let me turn to Jay to discuss our financials.","Jay Horgen","Thank you, Nate. As Sean discussed, we are pleased to report strong earnings growth for the fourth quarter and the full year driven by strong organic growth and assets under management and a solid contribution from performance fees in the fourth quarter. With a record AUM of $836 billion at year end and the positive contribution from changes in the U.S. tax law, the scale and earnings power of our business has meaningfully increased and we are well positioned for continued earnings growth in 2018 and beyond.","As you saw in the release, we reported economic earnings per share of $4.58 for the fourth quarter and $14.50 for 2017, which excluded the one-time benefit from changes in the U.S. tax law that I'll describe in a moment. Economic earnings per share for the fourth quarter included net performance fees of $1.09 bringing our total to $1.45 for 2017. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $5.50 for the fourth quarter and $12.03 for 2017.","Turning to our performance metrics. During the quarter, we remained aggregate revenue to aggregate fees, but there was no change in the calculation of this operating measure. Aggregate fees grew 29% both in the fourth quarter and for the full year to $1.7 billion and $5.5 billion respectively, driven primarily by strong markets and organic growth and alternatives together with a full effect of our 2016 new investments.","For the full year 2017, the ratio of our aggregate fees to average assets under management increased year-over-year from 66 basis points to 71 basis points, reflecting an increase in performance fees. Excluding performance fees, we also saw a modest increase in this ratio, as our AUM composition shifted towards a greater contribution from higher fee alternative products.","For the fourth quarter, adjusted EBITDA grew 25% to $361.3 million from a year ago, an increase by 18% to 1.1 billion for the full year 2017. Economic net income grew in the quarter by 24% to $261.3 million from a year ago and increased by 17% to $824.4 million for the full year 2017.","Turning to more specific modeling items for the fourth quarter. The ratio of adjusted EBITDA to average assets under management was 17.6 basis points or 12.8 basis points, excluding performance fees and for the full year 2017 this ratio was 14.3 basis points or 12.6 basis points, excluding performance fees.","Looking ahead, we expect this ratio to be between 13.1 and 13.5 basis points in the first quarter of 2018, reflecting a range of performance fees between $0.20 to $0.30 per share. Our share of interest expense was $19.6 million for the fourth quarter and 85.3 million for the full year 2017. We expect interest expense to remain flat at approximately $20 million in the first quarter and $80 million for the full year 2018. ","Our share of reported amortization impairments was $143.9 million for the fourth quarter including $127.6 million from Affiliates accounted for under the equity method, which was elevated primarily due to a non-cash impairment charge taken at one of our equity method Affiliates totaling 93 million. ","For the full year, our share of reported amortization and impairments was 265.4 million including 199.2 million from Affiliates accounted for under the equity method. Going forward, we expect our share of reported amortization to return to approximately 47 million for the first quarter and approximately 190 million for the full year 2018. ","Turning to taxes. In the fourth quarter, changes in the U.S. tax law resulted in a one-time net benefit of 194.1 million, primarily from a non-cash re-measurement of our deferred tax liabilities associated with our intangible assets and our convertible security. This amount included the effects of the repatriation tax, which was not material to our results or our cash flow. And as you saw in the release, we excluded the affects with these changes in U.S. tax loss from our economic net income. ","With regard to our tax credit in the fourth quarter, our GAAP and cash tax rates were impacted by the changes in U.S. tax law. Our effective GAAP tax rate turn negative in the quarter and was only 6.8% for the full year. Going forward for modeling purposes, we expect both our GAAP and our cash tax rate to be meaningfully lower and estimated 25% GAAP tax rate and the 20% cash tax rate. As a result, we anticipate $50 million in run rate tax savings, which is expected to grow overtime. For the fourth quarter intangible related deferred taxes were negative 12.9 million and for 2017 were positive 48.8 million, which included the tax effect of the impairment charge of 35.7 million reducing intangible related deferred taxes. ","We expect intangible related deferred taxes for the first quarter to be approximately 10 million or approximately 40 million for the full year 2018. Other economic items for the fourth quarter were 9 million and 14.8 million for the full year, which included non-cash expenses related to adjustments in our contingent payment obligations of 5.2 million and 6.6 million respectively. As we look forward for modeling purposes, we expect other economic items to be approximately 2 million per quarter or 8 million per year. ","Our adjusted weighted average share count for the fourth quarter was 55.8 million and we expected to be approximately 55.5 million for the first quarter. ","Turning to our balance sheet, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately 140 million in shares bringing our total to 416 million of repurchases for the year and we pay our quarterly cash dividend. Given our strong 2017 performance and the increased cash flow of our business, our Board authorized a 50% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.30 per share payable in the first quarter and also increased our share repurchase authorization to 5 million shares. ","Looking ahead with run rate EBITDA of over 1.2 billion and given the significant and growing scale of our business, we are confident in our ability to continue to generate meaningful earnings growth to accrete [ph] of new investments will also consistently returning capital to shareholders.","Now turning to full year guidance. For 2018, we expect economic earnings per share to be in the range of $16.50 to $18.50. Our guidance range reflects market performance through last Friday for the current quarter and our normal model convention of 2% quarterly market growth beginning in the second quarter. ","At the mid-point of our guidance range, we expect performance fees to contribute approximately 13% and the ratio of our adjusted EBITDA to average assets under management to be approximately 14.1 basis points. ","We also plan to repurchase approximately $300 million in the first half of 2018, which is included in our guidance. ","Lastly, we expect our weighted average share count to be approximately 54.9 million for 2018, which includes to share repurchases I mentioned.","As always, these assumptions do not include earnings from future new investments and are based on our current expectations of the Affiliate growth rates performance, the mix of the Affiliate contribution to our earnings and tax savings under the new tax law. Of course, substantial changes in markets and earnings contribution of our Affiliates would impact these expectations.","Now, we\u2019ll be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Dan Fannon"," Thanks, good morning. I guess, Jay, just to follow up on the last question with regards to guidance, a couple things. It sounds like the first-quarter performance fee number looks -- you said $0.20 to $0.30. I guess maybe that you give us the context for the year as well as some of the other -- your general outlook for flows or other assumptions as you think about 2018 in that $16.50 to $18 range. ","Jay Horgen","Okay. Yeah, thanks. Thanks Dan. Well, let me start, I\u2019ll address the first quarter in a moment. So, let me just start by talking about the model convention again. We start the year obviously at $836 billion which is the record for us, but as of Friday our market blind is up about 4%. Quarter-to-date which means our AUM is nearly $870 billion at this point just based on markets. And as you know we don't assume anymore markets in the quarter, for model convention put 2% in our models per quarter thereafter. ","You also know that you can track our market blend over time based upon the indices that we've indicated in our innate script. If you could be able to track that and adjust throughout the year, but obviously we're starting the year at a high level and we we've gone higher. ","I also mentioned that for the full year we see EBITDA at average AUM at about 14.1 basis points and we anticipate about 13% contribution from performance fees. ","In 2017 we had about 10% contribution from performance fees, I think people are aware that we had a very good fourth quarter across all of our business, but in particular in the systematic diversified and that sets us well for 2018. As we did last year, we expect to give you quarterly updates on performance fees and talk about seasonality because there isn\u2019t seasonality business with respect to performance fees.","Lastly, like we did last year we're going to indicate the forward repurchases, we have put $300 million into our model for repurchases in the first half. We\u2019ll update you next quarter as we reflect on the pacing of new investments. And clearly with us repurchase scenario as well as our new dividend we only are putting in $400 million of capital in our model, but we have up to $1 billion of after tax cash flow expected. ","So, the $600 million of cash, is just not in in our model that would be upside to the extent that we deploy it throughout the year or early in the year. So, we do think this is a very conservative estimate. ","Now to your seasonality question. As you recall number of our affiliates are in a one quarter lag together with really good fourth quarter performance it bodes well for the first quarter and we did come out with the performance fee, guiding for $0.20 to $0.30 which is up from $0.18 a year ago so it is shaping up to look like we\u2019re going to have more performance fees in the first half frankly, but certainly in the first quarter. Just reminding you that the first quarter tends to be outside of the fourth quarter, our second largest performance fee or at least by contract the most opportunity for performance fees in an average year and scaling down second and the third quarter thereafter. ","But when you reflect back on the range again, 30% at the mid-point given the performance that we are coming off of doesn\u2019t seem like too much of a stretch kind of the neutral to middle estimate could be a lot higher and of course we put the capital where it could be a lot higher as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of William Katz with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","William Katz"," Okay, thank you very much for taking the questions. I apologize for the hoarse voice. Could you maybe pick up on that last point, Jay -- or actually Sean? Now that we have the tax reform behind us, obviously markets are doing what they are doing. Could you give us a sense of how that may be changing the dialogue in terms of new opportunities on the deal side? And then maybe facilitating seeing a bit of a pickup on pricing as well. Sort of talk about maybe both the pipeline now that we know where we are on taxes as well as the pricing associated with that pipeline. Thank you. ","Sean Healey","Thanks Bill. Away from the direct impact of the tax law on our earnings which Jay commented on, there is an effect on new investments I would say first it contributes along the tax law, contributes along with a very attractive market backdrop to what we\u2019re seeing at least so far in the year I expect it to continue and accelerate which is an increasing level of interest on the part of excellent boutique firms and pursuing succession-oriented transactions. ","It\u2019s clear that at the end of last year, there was uncertainty around what happened with the tax law and the new tax law creates the certainty is there and of course there is more value that I am sure will be shared with sellers and buyers, but that contributes to a very attractive environment and opportunity for us.","I would remind you that if you just to get a sense of the size of the opportunity set if you take the top hundred prospects that we have in our universe firms with which we built strong relationships over time, the transaction value interpolating from the size of these firms and what we know of them, the transaction value would be over $50 billion so it\u2019s an enormous opportunity, a tremendous secular opportunity for AMG. ","The last thing I would say is that this is a bit more nuance, but its real the competitive dynamics are more favorable for us relative to non-U.S. firms than they have ever been. Historically, non-U.S. firms as I am sure you realize had an advantage and their ability to earnings strip and achieve a lower rate for those firms that were in jurisdictions with our home country rates and now that advantage has been removed and in some ways even there is actually a disadvantage to those firms and inverted entities that who we inevitably compete with. So, the overall affect, as I said away from the direct effect of the tax law, I think will be quite positive for us. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. ","Michael Carrier","Thanks, guys. Maybe just a question on the flows and the organic growth. When we look at your mix, both on the alternatives and international, you are fairly well positioned, just given some of the industry dynamics. But Nate, maybe for you. If you can give us some color around where you are seeing some of those rebalancings, some of the seasonal distribution impacts on the retail side. And then when you look across all the affiliates, areas where things are going well, you are seeing the demand performances there versus any pockets where you have some performance challenges that may or may not rebound in 2018 or 2019.","Nathaniel Dalton","Perfect. So, let me start with -- I'll try to hit all these pieces, so as you heard us say in our prepared remarks, obviously growth sales were very strong this quarter kind of possibility. So that was kind of both very positive sign and I\u2019d say they were three things that impacted us on the kind of redemption side, which, if I am going to try to dimension in my public dimension together it is about kind of 4 billion or so across the three things, I\u2019m going to hit here. One is seasonality and the retail across products, but primarily that came through in all points in a second. ","There was some seasonality in both the institutional line of work, chance as well and I\u2019ll describe that. And then there were some of these institutional rebalances and some of that actually also came through and also if you look at all growth outflow numbers, you\u2019ll see that showing up there as well.","So, to take those in order maybe the seasonality in retail, some of that\u2019s kind of across much of the retail book, which is kind of distribution and that will be invested amount. But also, there is tax law selling and that came through primarily in the alts book, you can think of something like managed features, which have been kind of down for the year and we talked about that and there was a period when lots of equity products appreciated. So, people were taking those losses. We saw the same thing last year. And then we also saw those flows reverse into the first quarter. And if you look at what\u2019s happening in January so far, you\u2019re seeing exactly that. You\u2019re seeing those flows kind of reverse into the year. ","So that was the first piece is now in retail. There is also some seasonality in the ultra-book and institutional. And that\u2019s really, because you have lots of products, where the lock, kind of single year or multi-year locks tend to expire right at year-end and subscription and might come in on January 1st, just the way, the product is set up or other quarters. But there is a lot to have, at year-end. So, there is that piece as well. ","And then on the institutional side, we did have a couple, just rebalance at the year and an example in all three, we had one kind of very sizeable rebalance. I mean those being used to balance portfolio risk at the client level and the client reduced this diversifying mandate by a significant amount. ","So, there were a few of those things you got about that. You sort of put all that together, that\u2019s kind of in that kind of 4 billion range, kind of split equally among the three. ","To the other part of the question, look we have a, as we look ahead and hopefully you heard this optimize in our prepared remarks as well. Especially in the alternatives book liquid and illiquid both the sort of existing scale of product, but also a lot of really interesting new products coming on. We feel really good about that product side. And then also in global equities and I also adding, in multi-assets, there is some interesting things being developed as well. So really those are the areas, where we see lots of opportunity. ","On the U.S. equity side, there is obviously industry level dynamics we talked about which we continue to face, but there are a number of -- especially as you have heard us say in this market area, a number of very good performing and in demand products as well. But I think that\u2019s a place where just the industry dynamic is challenging.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Ryan Bailey","This is actually Ryan Bailey filling in for Alex. Actually, I had a quick question on the impairment charge. I was wondering if you could give us any additional color there? And maybe if you can't speak to which affiliate it came from, could you take us through why you took the charge? Thank you.","Jay Horgen","Yes. Thanks. So just the backdrop of -- we account for our affiliates and amortize, the intangibles over time, and to the extent that any point in time and again that's based upon the original purchased assets. So, what we don't count in accounting is the growth of new clients. So, I want to first say this is an accounting charge and it\u2019s a non-cash accounting charge and we think we've been conservative here just given that the client in one of our equity method of affiliates, but again it's based upon the original clients not on its new clients. To take it in a bigger broader perspective as you know the sum of all of our affiliates have grown dramatically over the years and so we don't marke up our affiliates as they grow.","And then just specifically on this one affiliate, yeah, I think we can describe it as a small equity method affiliate, it only contributed about $0.03 to our earnings. So, it did not have -- it does not have a contribution. This doesn't reflect any material economics to AMG. Again, it's just an account charge and frankly we're confident that that business has big prospects and will benefit from a different investment environment. Do you want to give a little more context?","Nathaniel Dalton","Sure. And again, I want to kind of reemphasize the point Jay just mentioned, this is us I think being conservative and its just non-cash account charge that doesn\u2019t really say much more than that to the firm and it\u2019s a firm, we\u2019re confident over the short, medium and long-term frankly. ","The firm is Ivory which is, a of couple of billion AUM long, and short equity term. They have a very good long-term track record, but over the last couple of years, they've had this kind of -- I will describe it as sort of a bearish value-oriented bias both in how they are constructed on the loan side, but also the short side of book and they had roughly loan exposure. So, that positioning has made some challenges performance and then also some client withdrawals which obviously are not material to AMG on any level. But look at the end, begin to reemphasize the point, we\u2019re very confident a firm and we\u2019re working together on just the best way to take this forward, but overall, great long-term track record, really good investment process and people and we\u2019re very confident on them.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Lee","Thanks for taking my questions. Just curious -- could we -- maybe update us a little bit on if we look at your gross sales, could you give us a sense of how much of that today do you attribute to being helped -- flowing through or being helped by your global distribution? And then maybe also update us on some of your AMG funds in retail initiatives where I believe it's probably been, given the environment, a little bit more of a challenge. But maybe update us on where that stands?","Sean Healey","Sure. I\u2019ll start and then ask Nate to add. I think with respect of global distribution, we don\u2019t break out the specific contribution quarter to quarter. over the last five years more than $50 billion in net flows have been true or are involving our AMG\u2019s global distribution effort and I think prospectively the opportunity as I described and you hard us talk about this and I think others know the trends of increasing concentration by the largest global institutional clients of their manager set and I think all that plays very much to our advantage. ","We continue to invest and build our global distribution effort. I think the most recent or most material update I would give is that we are beginning very good traction in Japan and we expect to open later this year an office in Japan which will be our major step forward.","With respect to AMG funds I think there are two, scale is increasingly important and you will have seen news in the industry around the major distributors also concentrating their relationships and I think we\u2019re well positioned across AMG\u2019s overall business including Affiliates, but also at the AMG funds level and we feel good about it. Obviously, U.S. retail is a very difficult competitive space, but I believe I know we\u2019ve brought the scale and I feel good about how we\u2019re positioned and our performance this year, we\u2019re very pleased with the flows to date.","Nate, do you want to add anything to that?","Nathaniel Dalton","Well I think maybe one high level one point and one detail. The high level point I think everybody is tracking but especially on the institutional side but are increasingly on the retail side both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. There is really three categories of kind of wins; one is where the Affiliates all have their own sales, marketing kind of services, infrastructure and themselves, one is where our infrastructure is really leading the sale and then the third is where we\u2019re collaborative to a greater or lesser extent and that third bucket is growing more and more, which plays into the theme that Sean just described because as buyers are centralized and intermediaries are centralizing, they are all recognizing whether the Affiliates are coming directly or not, but the relationship with us and they are also working with us more broadly it\u2019s just the volume of those conversations and the interactions just continue to increase. And then the D-side [ph] that part was actually quite incorporate [ph] in our distribution teams where I think we're pretty impactful on some in the flows, is great to see and is coming across a number of Affiliates and many of them are -- and that\u2019s just working very well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Shutler","Good morning. In private equity, it feels like a lot of the big flows are yet to come. But would you just please talk about the private equity flows in the quarter? And then I don't know if it is too specific, but I know EIG was in the news winning a big subadvisory mandate with FS Investments in December. I think the number was around $4 billion or so. Just want to better understand how or if that will flow into the net flow picture. Thanks.","Nathaniel Dalton","So, as you heard us say, in the illiquid which again I would describe as including PE but certainly much broader than just PE and we went through some of the weather infrastructure, real assets credit, real estate those kinds of things as well. But when you think about our illiquids business in general, I\u2019d say very good quarter, we had some sizable wins in the quarter and we had kind of a relative, what I\u2019ll describe as kind of relatively normal level of realization, realization activity kind of on the other side. So, at the highest level, that\u2019s what it is. ","Obviously as you alluded, there is lots of rules what we can and can't say and both of those kind of on the legal side, but also a bunch of clients have confidentiality requirements and things like that. But I would say about both the quarter and the pipeline is what the people is definitely building both growing in size and extending in duration, so those, let\u2019s say dynamic. And I would say the main components of that are, let\u2019s talk about some of those, sort of flagship funds. We\u2019re starting to see some interim closings, we\u2019re seeing some additional funds beginning to market. And then also, there is a separate account pipeline that\u2019s also really building kind of alongside that. And some of these are complicated mandates and in some cases, these are actually better to think about, it\u2019s kind of programs, other than mandates, because they are intended to expand kind of multiple products and even multiple cycles where this place into the theme of consolidated relationships as well frankly, which is people are trying to figure out how to get all these exposures on in a predictable fashion over long period of time and again across our set, Affiliates by themselves. These and frankly in a couple of places across them, there is that opportunity. So that separate account pipeline is, again sort of complicated mandate, but also, you can think about these programs. ","And then what we have been calling sort of product line extensions and we\u2019re seeing good momentum here some funds with both interim and final closing, some separate account activity. But I think important point is, that the line between these three segments kind of blur, because as you think about these separate account programs especially in the multi-product ones, sometimes those gets expressed as investments in funds plus customized additions and once product line extensions obviously get traction, I think you thought it as clearly Affiliate. At the highest level, the overall pipeline and illiquid is growing, extending and there is some very large many, I\u2019d say, many large opportunities in the sort of coming quarters. So, it\u2019s part of the reason why we feel so quite good about them. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. ","Brian Bedell ","Good morning, folks. If we could just focus back a little bit on some of the dynamics of the flows. Thanks for the comment on realizations. Maybe if you can talk a little bit about the private equity gross fund raises. I think originally you were indicating about $10 billion from that. I think that's expanded since that original outlook. If you can maybe talk about what you've raised so far on the gross side. And then what it's looking like for the 2018 trajectory. And then also comment on the -- it looks like the sales -- gross sales picked up pretty nicely in US equities. Double the pace of the quarterly run rate. Maybe the driver of that. And then, Jay, just within your 2018 guidance, what your sort of range is for flows within that.","Nathaniel Dalton","I\u2019ll try to capture, at least all of the, parts of the, first year products. So, on the illiquid one, I think the way I would describe it is pretty much the way I'll describe it to the earlier question, which is definitely larger and extending. And sort of hard, because the way we describe it is, kind of a 10 billion over a finite period. I do think we\u2019re going to exceed, I think it\u2019s a [indiscernible]. We\u2019re going to exceed the number. But it is, again it is both growing and extending and I think if you look at it kind of year-on-year I think we think that the contribution in 2018 [indiscernible] will certainly be -- we think will be larger than the contribution in 2017 just looking at the schedule and some of these kind of mandates and programs and conversations that are happening. That\u2019s\u2026","Sean Healey","And that\u2019s an enduring rather than episodic, I think, is the way I think about it.","Nathaniel Dalton","Yeah. Absolutely. So, I think that's on the first part. And then as you -- to the second piece on U.S. equity, I think as you know there, right, we had good kind of sales growth in U.S. equity, while our overall continues to be frankly, a bit of a challenging, right, we saw little bit better institutional redemption and we did see sales growth and probably going to describe where the sales growth is coming from, I think it is mostly described as coming from the sort of more [indiscernible] or factor kind of equity strategies. ","The other note I will have it on the redemption side, while it did improve, there's still that seasonal impact kind of dividends and capital gains distribution etcetera within the retail business. So, I think we do see an improving trend, but I think the overall dynamics as we described.","Sean Healey","Behind your question the flow trends in global equities were actually quite positive and as you heard in our prepared remarks, we see very good and improving, increasing opportunities there in that category. Jay do you want to\u2026","Jay Horgen","Just on guidance - maybe I will just up the level, Brian, we do have some structural conservatism in our range always. Obviously, everybody is well aware of the capital. So again, just to repeat we have about $600 million of capital that is not in our guidance. I would also just point out that on the tax side, while we didn't conservative, I think estimating a $50 million run rate number that number will grow of course with incremental growth comes a higher margin on those earnings, if you will. ","And I think there's some refinements in our business that will prove out that that we will actually experience a higher than a $50 million run rate. So, we have capital, we have tax and we also have flows because we don't really forecast flows. We put a very conservative number really to just show some upward momentum, but the reality is the words that Nate and Sean have commented on here with respect to our momentum in flows just really is not in our model.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your question.","Patrick Davitt","Good morning. My question's around the global -- the US to global dynamic you were talking about. I guess the first part is does that suggest that we should expect accelerating outflows in the US equity bucket? And to what extent are you seeing those redemptions look elsewhere within the AMG affiliate group, maybe on the global side? Is it rotating within the complex, so to speak? ","Sean Healey","I\u2019ll start and then I ask Nate to add. No, the answer is the U.S. equity flow trends have been improving and I think the way our business is works is, sure, you realize it is, it's not integrated. And so, the opportunities that we're seeing in global equities across affiliates don't relate to our U.S. equity products that that there aren't going to be fundings from redemptions in our U.S. equity book. I mean, it just doesn't work that way. So, I think we remain positive and optimistic around U.S. equities, which as you know is only 14% of our earnings. But especially positive and optimistic about global equity opportunities which is partly around the performance of individual affiliates, but also representing a view that the overall backdrop of the market environment we mentioned that is home country by us eroding relative valuations between U.S. and non-U.S. markets, relative growth rates of other economies and finally the decline in the dollar obviously benefits non-U.S. markets and us to our greater exposure to global equity. So, I think all of that contributes to a very positive backdrop certainly in the year, but these are trends that we\u2019re seeing in place and accelerate it. Do you want to add?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from the line of William Katz from Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","William Katz","So early on in your prepared comments, you had mentioned that you are seeing a pickup in some of these strategic alliances. Maybe that is embedded in some of the back and forth we've had with Nate in some of the other Q&A. Could you talk a little bit about just in terms of what you are seeing in terms of economics on these mandates? Are these just longer-lived assets that are slightly lower in terms of fee rates? Or how is this working, if you will?","Sean Healey","Well at the highest level, the trend represents just a kind of obvious move toward greater efficiency. I think global institutional clients and intermediaries with very large pools of assets and just the increasing challenge of overseen numerous managers is itself a reason for concentrating relationship obviously also a desire to have certainty and comfort around operational and legal due diligence items as well also driving this concentration. ","But I think there is an important strategic component which relates to these large global institutional clients wanting to have flexibility and choice around a range of alpha-oriented products and AMG is very, very advantaged in this respect because we have the broadest array of independent alpha-oriented products especially in global equities and alternative. ","And so of course there is an effort on our part with our Affiliates to coordinate an offer the efficiency advantages that an integrated firm can provide, but if you think about over time what the competitive dynamics are yes, scale matters and large integrated firms have an advantage in that respect because they can more easily coordinate among their product. But ultimately the most important competitive dynamic is going to be around through alpha generation and the broadest set of differentiated sources of alpha and on that basis, we together with our Affiliates are enormously advantage and well positioned. ","Maybe Nate you can address the more specific question around how some of these mandates, what the economics can be although the answer is quite broad. ","Nathaniel Dalton","I think the way we think about this sort of a range, right. At one end of the -- and sort of easiest to execute on one end is sort of a bit of simple coordination and making the lives of clients and intermediaries a bitter easier in accessing the down streams [ph] do that many, many places right now. At the other kind of extreme and as Sean said, we have the largest collection across our Affiliates group, maybe the largest collection, this is truly outstanding return-oriented stream, recurrent streams. And the challenge for the intermediaries or the large end clients is how do you get those streams into portfolios, right. How do I do that both efficiently, when I get that done efficiently? But ultimately, they need something that\u2019s the fact that when they produce it to their end clients. ","So that\u2019s a couple of performance, but also can we make the servicing and the oversight of the products and et cetera and operational infrastructure, could we make that all work easily for them across their entire platforms or across the entire -- their client base in the case of intermediary. And so that\u2019s kind of the continuum. ","The point on PE is, I do think there can be PE dynamics relative to these large mandates especially these large scale multi product and we\u2019re talking across many things. But the other related point is, the effectiveness with which we can bring products to market but also the effectiveness with which they can access those products creates margin benefits on both our side and their side, right. And so, which ultimately [indiscernible] the benefit of the end client. So, I think, you have to think about it not just on fees, but you also think about it, in terms of the benefits in both kind of efficiency and doing it in the margin benefits there as well so effectively getting along to the portfolios. ","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that is the end of time for question. I\u2019ll turn the floor back to Mr. Healey for any final comment. ","Sean Healey","Thank you again for joining us this morning. We\u2019re pleased with our results for the quarter and confident in our ability to continue to create shareholder value through the organic growth for our existing Affiliates, accretive investments and new Affiliates and consistent capital return to investors.

And welcome to the AMG Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]","As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Selene Oh, Vice President of Investor Relations for AMG. Thank you. You may begin.","Selene Oh","Thank you for joining AMG to discuss the results for the third quarter of 2016. In this conference call, certain matters discussed will constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to those referenced in the company\u2019s Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the call.","AMG will provide on the Investor Relations section of its website at www.amg.com a replay of the call and a copy of announcement of our results for the quarter, as well as a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of any estimates of the company\u2019s economic earnings per share for future periods that are announced on this call.","With us on the line to discuss the company\u2019s results for the quarter are, Sean Healey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Nate Dalton, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Jay Horgen, Chief Financial Officer.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Sean Healey.","Sean Healey","Thanks, Selene, and good morning, everyone. We were pleased to report strong results in the third quarter, including economic earnings per share $3.02 and record assets under management of approximately $730 billion, which represents a 23% increase year-over-year.","Our results reflect consistently strong execution across all aspects of our growth strategy, including the completion of several new affiliate investments during the quarter, along with the continued excellent investment performance and strong positive net client cash flows of our existing Affiliates. As Jay will describe, we continue to see strong earnings growth ahead for AMG.","We were pleased with our third quarter net client cash flows of $5.8 billion into our Affiliates\u2019 actively-managed strategies during the quarter, particularly across an array of alternative products. As Nate will discuss, our net inflows were positive across each of our institutional, retail, and high net worth channels and also across all client geographies.","We believe that the quality of our independent boutique Affiliates and the unique breadth and diversity of our alpha product set have together driven the consistency of our organic growth results over the past seven years.","AMG has now generated net inflows in 24 quarters of the last 26 quarters, including year-to-date net inflows of approximately $11.5 billion, notwithstanding, continued muted industry-wide flows into actively-managed products.","The strength of our results reflects the success of our strategy of partnering with outstanding performance driven boutiques and our focus on attractive alpha-oriented product areas, especially global and emerging market equities and a select set of alternative strategy.","The best independent boutiques have meaningful competitive advantages in generating excess returns and value-added alpha generating product areas as demonstrated by the outstanding long-term performance records of our Affiliates.","Even in a period of growth in passive products, on the back of cyclical and to some extent secular trends, select high-performing differentiated active equity and alternative managers will continue to generate organic growth and gain market share as evidenced by our long-term record of net inflows.","In an environment of lower returns, clients around the world from sophisticated large institutions to individual retail investors recognize the importance of alpha generation in meeting their obligations and objectives.","In seeking alpha, investors increasingly turn to differentiated high conviction strategies and given their focused and distinct investment approaches in the most attractive product areas, our Affiliates are positioned to benefit from this dynamic. We continue to see significant client demand for high conviction, active equity, and alternative strategies across client geographies and channels.","Through our long-term strategic focus on areas where boutiques excel and we see secular client demand trends, AMG has assembled one of the largest and most diverse books of alternative products in the industry focused on the product areas most attractive to clients.","These strategies include both liquid and illiquid products, and offer not only alpha but also true diversification relative to traditional fixed income and equity markets, a feature increasingly valued by clients.","We are already benefiting from growing client demand for this alternative strategy and given our investments in some of the highest quality firms around the world, which specialize in these areas AMG is uniquely placed to continue to meet this enduring demand trend.","AMG\u2019s array of alternative strategies is a strong complement to our outstanding equity offerings, and we believe that the advantages of our strategic position across our broad alternative product set will be increasingly avid.","Turning to new investments, we continue to be well-positioned to execute on our substantial forward opportunity set and further enhance the diversity and breadth of our performance-oriented product offering by partnering with leading independent firms around the world.","The transaction environment remains highly favorable for AMG, and we are very pleased with the quality and diversity of our new investment pipeline, which includes both traditional and alternative firms.","Looking ahead, AMG has a unique ability to make additional investments that are not only earnings accretive but also add excellent new products with substantial capacity in defined areas where we see ongoing client demand.","Given the outstanding opportunities we see to invest in excellent independent firms globally, along with the organic growth of our existing Affiliates, we are well-positioned for strong earnings growth going forward.","Finally, I wanted to discuss the management change that we announced this morning. As you saw Andrew Dyson is stepping down as Head of Global Distribution to take a CEO role at a subsidiary of Prudential Financial called QMA.","Andrew has been a great friend and colleague over the past five years and has made a valuable contribution to AMG. We wish Andrew all the best in his new role. As you would expect, we have a search underway and plan to move forward with a new Head of Global Distribution early in 2017.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it to Nate to discuss our Affiliates results in more detail.","Nate Dalton","Thanks, and good morning, everyone. As Sean said, against the backdrop of muted industry demand for actively-managed strategies, we generated strong net flows in the quarter across all three of our distribution channels. This continues our broadly positive flow results of the past seven years, which ultimately stems from our Affiliates\u2019 excellent long-term investment performance and track record.","In addition, as Sean said, we are also continuing to benefit from our strategic product positioning against some positive client demand trends, as well as our unique distribution approach which includes each Affiliate\u2019s dedicated distribution capabilities complemented by AMG\u2019s global distribution efforts. While these flows have been remarkably consistent, positive in 24 quarters of the last 26 quarters for example, it is important to look at the long-term performance, long-term strategic positioning, and our fundamental distribution strategy.","As we regularly remind, flows, particularly in the institutional and sub-advisory channels are inherently lumpy in any given quarter. So looking over a longer period provides a clearer picture, and on that basis, we continue to generate consistent positive net flows.","Now picking up on a point Sean made, one of the most important drivers of our organic growth over the last several years has been our decision to increase our participation in alternatives and within alternatives the areas we\u2019ve chosen to focus on. Through our active and consistent new investment activity and significant product development by our Affiliates, we are one of the largest managers of alternatives in the industry.","While one key point is our Affiliates manage a very diverse portfolio of alternative strategies across a wide range of investment categories, an equally important point is that we have substantial participation in areas of alternatives that are in high demand from institutional and retail clients as they seek returns, while also trying to diversify their allocations.","Finally, we also see tremendous business diversification benefits from these high quality alternative firms and products when they are coupled with our excellent traditional boutiques and product.","Let me now turn to the performance in alternatives category. Performance in the fixed income and equity relative value segment was strong, including positive performance from key products at AQR, BlueMountain, Capula, and ValueAct, results in our multi-strategy and multi-asset category was mixed, risk parity strategies generated strong returns in the quarter and year-to-date, while multi-asset style premier AQR was down slightly in the quarter.","Within our Systematic Diversified category, this quarter was a challenging one for trend followers due to several sharp trend reversals. However, these strategies feature important diversification benefits at the overall client portfolio level and we continue to see strong demand globally for the category. Because of their diversifying characteristics, we believe relative returns are a much more important determinant of client demand than absolute returns.","However, down for the quarter both AQR and Winton outperformed trend following indices, while Systematica underperformed in the quarter. In addition, all three firms feature excellent performance over the long-term.","Our private equity and real assets focused Affiliates and teams continue to put money to work and feature excellent long-term performance as well. And we see significant opportunities from firms like Pantheon, Baring Asia, EIG to continue to broaden and diversify their industry-leading investment platforms.","As it relates to our public equity products, a very strong -- a strong quarter across broad market indices saw outperformance from stocks that were typically higher risk and volatility, as well as lower quality. Against that backdrop, the relative performance of our Affiliates given this environment was more mixed, as many of our Affiliates emphasize valuation and strong fundamentals in their investment processes.","Starting with the global developed markets category, we had good performance from flagship strategies as part of Harding Loevner and AQR, both of which delivered strong performance on an absolute and relative basis in the quarter, adding to their already strong long-term track records. Elsewhere, performance was more mixed at Artemis, while Tweedy, Browne Global Value underperformed, although, it continues to have an industry leading long-term track record.","In the emerging markets category, all of our strategies were up on an absolute basis, but performance against [ph] BM (2.51\/6) index was more mixed, with AQR and Trilogy Emerging Wealth outperforming and Genesis and Harding Loevner trailing in the quarter.","Finally, with respect to our U.S. equity, performance across our book of products was mixed in the quarter, although many of the largest strategies at firms such as Frontier and Systematic outperformed their indices in the quarter as did the recently launched suite of U.S. equity products at our U.K. Affiliate, Artemis.","Now turning to flows for the quarter. Let me first reiterate the importance of looking at our flow trends over the little longer term to understand our ability to drive organic growth. We\u2019ve always said in any given period our flows will be lumpy and if anything, the volatility has only increased in the current environment.","Starting with the institutional channel, we had net inflows of $2.8 billion with gross inflows again over $13 billion. As I discussed earlier, we had especially strong growth in net flows in several parts of our alternatives book, including CTAs, multi-strategy and commodities. In our high net worth channel, we had net flows of $1 billion. Flows remained strong from separate accounts both directly, as well as through our Wealth Partners Affiliates.","Speaking more broadly about our Wealth Partners business, last week we reached agreement to invest in a sixth Wealth Partner Affiliate, Forbes Family Trust. And when that investment closes, our Wealth Partners Affiliates will advise on a total of nearly $40 billion in assets. We\u2019re very excited about our investment in Forbes Family Trust, which is based in New York City and Philadelphia and provides outsourced CIO services, as well as wealth advisory and planning to ultra high net worth client.","In the mutual fund channel, we had net inflows of $2 billion. We saw mostly a continuation of the positive trends from the last few quarters in the channel. Asset class drivers were once again alternatives and emerging market equities through firms such as AQR, GW&K and Harding Loevner, while we once again saw moderating outflows on our U.S. equities book.","Looking ahead, our industry leading array of high quality equity and alternatives products features excellent long-term performance. While flows in any given period are volatile, we remain well-positioned to generate positive organic growth through both our Affiliates on distribution, as well as AMG\u2019s complementary global distribution platform.","With that, let me turn it over to Jay to discuss our financials.","Jay Horgen","Thank you, Nate. As Sean and Nate discussed we generated strong net client cash flows of $5.8 billion in the quarter and successfully closed all of our announced new investments, which brings our assets under management to approximately $730 billion, increasing the strength, diversity and earnings power of our business.","As you saw on the release, we reported Economic earnings per share of $3.02 for the third quarter, which included net performance fees of $0.02. On a GAAP basis we reported earnings per share of $2.","Turning to more specific modeling items, during the quarter we updated our non-GAAP disclosures to rename EBITDA to adjusted EBITDA, but there was no change in the calculation of this performance measure. For the third quarter our adjusted EBITDA was $219.8 million, which did not include our recent new investments given the one quarter lag in reporting.","The ratio of our adjusted EBITDA at the end of period assets under management was 13.1 basis points or 13 basis points excluding performance fees. In the fourth quarter, we expect this ratio to increase to approximately 16 basis points reflecting a higher performance fee contribution that we typically realize in the fourth quarter.","With regard to our taxes, our effective GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 31.9% reflecting a further decrease in the U.K. corporate tax rate and our cash tax rate was 19.7%. In the fourth quarter and for the full year 2016, we expect our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 33% and our cash tax rate to be approximately 20%.","Intangible-related deferred taxes for the third quarter were $19.5 million. We expect this number to increase to $21 million in the fourth quarter. For the full year 2016 we expect our intangible-related deferred taxes to be approximately $84 million.","Our share of reported amortization for the third quarter was $34.2 million, which includes $14 million of amortization from Affiliates accounted for under the equity method. For the fourth quarter we expect our share of amortization to increase to approximately $37 million as a result of recently closed new investments and for the full year 2016 we expect our share of amortization to be approximately $143 million.","Our share of interest expense for the third quarter was $22.4 million, in the fourth quarter we expect our share of interest expense to remain approximately $22 million and for the full year we expect our interest expense to be approximately $88 million. Other economic items in the third quarter were $1.6 million and for modeling purposes we expect other economic items to be approximately $1 million per quarter.","Turning to our balance sheet, at the beginning of the third quarter, we closed our investment in Capula, which was partially funded with $150 million in forward equity proceeds. And at the beginning of the fourth quarter we closed our investment in Winton, which we initially funded under the revolver.","We expect to settle another $250 million in forward equity proceeds by the end of the fourth quarter. Given the scale and diversity of our business, together with our flexible capital structure, we have successfully funded over $1.3 billion in new investments year-to-date.","And looking ahead, the earnings power of our business has increased with the addition of Capula and Winton, generating run rate EBITDA of over $1 billion along with approximately $1 billion of undrawn capacity available at year end positions us to create meaningful earnings growth as we continue to execute on our new investment strategy and return capital to shareholders over time.","Now turning to guidance, we are leaving our 2016 and 2017 guidance unchanged. Our 2016 economic earnings per share range of $12.30 to $13.30 reflects market performance through last Friday, our current yield of fourth quarter performance fees of its company and weighted average share account of approximately $55 million for 2016.","Our 2017 economic earnings per share range of $14 to $16 assumes the full year impact of Capula and Winton, as well as the equity issuance under the forward our normal model convention of 2% quarterly market growth beginning in the first quarter of 2017 and each quarter thereafter, and includes our normal model convention for share repurchase -- share repurchases in 2017 equal to 50% of our annual economic net income. As a result, we expect our weighted average share count to be approximately 56 million for the full year 2017.","The lower-end of our guidance ranges include, a modest contribution from performance fees and organic growth, while the upper-end assumes a more robust contribution from both performance fees and net client cash flows.","As always, these assumptions do not include earnings from future new investments and are based on our current expectation of Affiliate growth rates, performance and the mix of Affiliate contribution to our earning, of course, substantial changes in markets and the earnings contribution of our Affiliates would impact these expectations.","Now we\u2019ll be happy to answer any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Craig Siegenthaler","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Sean Healey","Good morning, Craig.","Craig Siegenthaler","Just wanted to start on the strong flow result, and I know it\u2019s very difficult to predict flows on a short three-month time period, but can you provide some backdrop behind metrics like RFP activity, new sales levels, the institutional pipeline, I mean, that would be helpful in the institutional channel, and then on the mutual fund channel, I was wondering if you have any data points in terms of how flows are tracking quarter-to-date in the U.S. and outside the U.S. in your retail channel?","Nate Dalton","Okay. Thanks. So, as we said, sort of in our prepared remarks, we feel really good about the underlying trends and activity levels, and so we\u2019re focusing on the institutional channel, the ones I\u2019d call out is sort of the our levels of RFP activity and then sort of the levels of finals activity, which were really strong and actually up again this quarter, so good finals activity in the third quarter.","I think, as you say, it\u2019s hard to predict on sort of short-term looking three months. But I will say, looking to the fourth quarter, that\u2019s often kind of a seasonally weak quarter for us, I think couple of the reasons for that are, we\u2019ve got kind of the year-end redemptions from both quarterly and annual lock vehicles and we\u2019ve obviously got the distribution of performance fees that are earned during the year, so those put a little bit of a headwind in. And then, in retail, you often see people sort of reticent to buy ahead of kind of taxes reason and stuff.","And then, as I said in the prepared remarks, this year there is actually more volatility in flows than normal, I think, that\u2019s due to the macro environment. So, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you also saw some retail flow downs due to just macro stuff like election.","But that said, underlying and fundamentally both with respect to the quarter and then sort of looking at that longer term trend, as I said in the prepared remarks, institutional pipelines were really strong and RFP activity is good, finals activity continues to tick-up.","And then, if you look at the medium term, obviously, we still think the trends -- look there are some headwinds, obviously, but the trends are benefiting from remaining intact, so investors have to get returns into their portfolios. We do think people will continue to barbell between sort of passive on the one side and then return oriented on the other, and our Affiliates are really well-positioned to compete for and win those mandates and take share.","Craig Siegenthaler","Thanks, Nate. If I could just squeeze one more in on Andrew Dyson, I just want to see how this move will impact the business model and if we could see any impact of flows or the business over the short-term from this move? And also when do you think we could learn of his replacement by?","Sean Healey","Well, the short answer to the first part of your question is, no. When we launched our distribution strategy 15 years ago, the core vision was to offer Affiliates the benefit of scale and institutional, especially global institutional and retail markets on a basis that was bespoke, best suited for them and complementary to each of their own distribution strategies and efforts. We established our U.S. retail platform in 2004 and opened our first non-U.S. institutional distribution office couple years later in Australia. In fact, in a few weeks I\u2019ll be in Sydney celebrating the 10th anniversary of our office founding.","Andrew has been a valued member of our team, for sure, since he joined five years ago, but our strategic vision, commitment to the business remain completely consistent. And remember for clients, we\u2019re providing a unique offering, where the clients, especially global institutional clients, but increasingly retail clients get the benefit of the focused expertise of industry-leading specialist firms, combined with or backed by the scale, resources, and operational risk management of a global franchise.","And they get, especially in these far flung markets, the benefit of in-market client service and a single point of access to this very broad array of many of the industry\u2019s best boutique firms. And if you want any demonstration of or validation of the effectiveness of the strategy, you have only to look at the success that we\u2019ve had over the past seven years. As you know, 24 quarters out of the past 26 quarters, strong positive flows in our active equity and alterative product set. It\u2019s a record that we\u2019d compare to any in the industry.","Sorry, the one other question that you asked is when you\u2019ll get an announcement, and I think, in my prepared remarks, I said, early 2017, and I think, I\u2019m going to stick with that. Thanks, Craig.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Alex Blostein","Hey. Good morning, everybody.","Sean Healey","Good morning.","Alex Blostein","Just sticking with the flow question, I was wondering if you guys can spend a minute on the high net worth channel, it\u2019s just third quarter in a row with pretty robust flows and it seems like the activity there has been a little bit stickier recently than over the last couple of years. Maybe comment, I guess, kind of on what\u2019s different in this channel today versus last few years. And then if there is any particular product or Affiliate that\u2019s driving this strength that will be helpful too? Thanks.","Nate Dalton","Okay. So, this is Nate. So, I think, you\u2019re right. We\u2019ve had some really good traction in the high net worth channel. I think the driver really -- I\u2019d really sort of highlight two main drivers. So one is strong flows into separate accounts and that includes through our AMG platform, probably the one that\u2019s doing the best there would be GW&K and that\u2019s both on some of their equity products, as well as their muni bond products.","But then the thing that\u2019s also different is we\u2019ve begun to build in more consistent over the last couple of quarters, positive net flow contribution from our Wealth Partners Affiliates and we continue to develop the traction there and as you heard we\u2019re continuing to grow out that platform. So, I think, that\u2019s also building some nice stability and diversity into that channel.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Dan Fannon","Thanks. Good morning.","Sean Healey","Good morning.","Dan Fannon","I guess, Jay, just looking at the guidance in the fourth quarter in particular, I guess, into the next year, can you go through the moving parts from what we heard from you last of when you -- first when you gave guidance last. And then the range from fourth quarter seems a bit larger, usually I think you typically narrow that. I guess some context around performance fees and where they sit today and how you\u2019re thinking about those into the fourth quarter.","Jay Horgen","Sure. Thanks. Thanks, Dan. I\u2019ll -- just bear with me here, I\u2019ll try to give you all the pieces and as you said, we did leave guidance unchanged primarily because the impact from market today was only modest. It will only have a modest impact on the fourth quarter as you would expect given that we\u2019re three quarters of the way through the year.","But just on the components, when we last gave guidance which was August 1st. Our market bond at that time was 2% up in the prior transcript. As you can see from our AUM tables, we experienced approximately 3.1% in market changes, which included FX I put those two numbers together for the entire quarter, so 3.1% versus a 2% that we knew about. It had a positive impact of 1.1% relative to the last time we gave guidance going through the end of the quarter. So that was through the end of the third quarter. Since the beginning of the fourth quarter though, we have seen markets including FX off about 1.5%, so it took that positive 1% down to negative 0.5%.","I think the other thing that you\u2019re probably aware of is that, when we remove our 2% market growth assumption for the fourth quarter, relative to our model that has a negative impact. So, really down 2.5% from the model.","All that being said though, given it\u2019s the fourth quarter, we will only have a small impact on 2016. So we left guidance unchanged because, setting markets aside, our 2016 range is primarily a judgment on performance fees as you had mentioned.","And when we look at various performance fee scenarios for the remainder of the year, both up and down scenarios, we have considered a few lumpy performance fees, as well as the timing between 2016 and 2017 realization in certain products, so considering all of that, that\u2019s why we left the range unchanged.","Just remind you of a couple of other items for 2016. There is a quarter lag in the financial reporting for Capula and Winton so we felt no impact of Capula in this quarter other than the funding of Capula. We will see an impact in the fourth quarter with Capula being included but we will not see Winton till next year.","Second, we will assume no more -- for model purposes no more share repurchases for 2016. None of these items will affect \u201817, so we\u2019ll have a full effect of Winton and Capula, and we\u2019ll return to our normal model guidance.","And then lastly just to touch on 2017, even though we removed the 2% market and we were down a little bit quarter-to-date, we feel comfortable that our 2017 guidance range still captures our forward opportunity set, especially since we have a full year of both Capula and Winton in the numbers for next year.","We also have included the full year effect of the $400 million of equity, $150 million has already been issued, $250 million in the fourth quarter and reminding you of our model convention again, all of these numbers are included in our 56 million share count -- average weighted share count for 2017.","And then, finally, just on performance fee expectations for next year with the addition of Winton and Capula, as well as just the broad diversity within our performance fee opportunity, we see kind of mid-teens at the midpoint of the guidance range for next year in terms of performance fee contribution.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Katz with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Bill Katz","Okay. Thanks very much. I\u2019m sure you had mentioned that you still feel pretty good about the new investment pipeline, I guess, there has been sort of a seminal transaction in the space in between last time you spoke and today. So why don\u2019t if you can talk a little bit about how you see the M&A backdrop and in fact that you\u2019re seeing some public-to-public deals happening, does that help or hurt your opportunity and for yourself?","Sean Healey","Sure. I think most of the activity in the industry generally including the kinds of transactions you described is either not a fit with our strategy or not interesting and attractive to us. We continue to build relationships with outstanding boutique firms, which are generating alpha, generating strong organic growth and investments in those firms will arise as they always have out of these relationships that we\u2019ve built over years and occur at a time that is appropriate and driven by the firms themselves.","As always and in this environment, and maybe I\u2019ll say especially given the uncertainty in the environment, we are very careful and very disciplined in our approach to pricing and structuring new investments.","But we feel, as I said in the prepared remarks, very optimistic about our prospects both in the near-term and long-term to continue to in our own unique way generate incremental shareholder value through this strategy.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Lee with KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Andy McLaughlin","Hi, everyone. Good morning. This is actually\u2026","Sean Healey","Hi.","Andy McLaughlin","\u2026 Andy McLaughlin in for Rob Lee. We just had a quick question about institutional flows. We know that mutual funds are strongly driven by AQR. We\u2019re wondering if you\u2019re seeing something similar on the institutional channel and if you could add that that at all.","Nate Dalton","Yeah. So, I guess, I would say -- I wouldn\u2019t describe it that way, I would say the themes to sort of think about in the institutional flow side for the quarter and then maybe I\u2019ll talk a little bit looking forward. As we talked in the prepared remarks, there was significantly higher gross sales on alternatives, AQR has contributed there, but it was -- AQR were down and Pantheon it was a number of firms that contributed significantly there.","Also we had relatively lower redemption rates in alternatives, so that was sort of the alternatives category did play well. We also saw an uptick in gross sales in U.S. equities and sort of same things have been moderating out in U.S. equity. So, I think, there was a couple of things there.","I\u2019ve talked already about sort of fourth quarter and some of the seasonality there, but I think, again, the main thing to focus on, as you look forward in the institutional channel is the trends that we think we\u2019ve been benefiting from, put the headwinds aside for a second.","Those remain intact and it\u2019s how the people get returns in the portfolios, it\u2019s how the people continue to barbell passive and active, and how well-positioned we are to compete for those active allocations, right. We\u2019ve a large number of very good performing products in high demand areas, global and emerging markets, and also as we\u2019ve talked about and now we\u2019ve got -- as Sean mentioned, we\u2019ve got this unique sort of go-to-market distribution strategy combining Affiliates focus teams at their level with the scope and scale of a large institution with significant sort of expertise by geography or by channel to bring to bear for the Affiliates as they wanted. So, I think you put those things together and we feel really good about the opportunity set in the institutional channel.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Bedell","Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks.","Sean Healey","Good morning.","Brian Bedell","Maybe, Sean and Nate, can you talk a little bit more about the AMG distribution strategy in light of Andrew Dyson leaving, I guess, first of all, just what proportion of sales are coming from AMG distribution, say, in the third quarter and year-to-date and how does that compare with the trend over the last five years? And what type of replacement are you looking for, are you looking to anything different in that global distribution strategy? And then, maybe if you could just comment on Department of Labor, how you\u2019re looking at that coming into the next couple of quarter?","Sean Healey","You squeezed quite a few questions in that one question there Brian. So I\u2019ll try to address some and then, Nate, I\u2019ll ask you to fill in. The distribute -- contribution to our flows from core AMG distribution varies quarter-to-quarter and we don\u2019t track it in a direct way because a lot of the influence is going to be in indirect way.","So, I would say, over time it is in aggregate over the past six years, seven years about $50 billion in incremental contribution at least and in any given period it\u2019s been half, sometimes more than half and sometimes, of course, given the dynamics of a particular quarter, it\u2019s a less significant contribution.","So, I think, the trend lines remain very much consistent and intact, as you heard Nate describe, we feel very good about our forward opportunity, especially, I mean, ultimately, fundamentally driven by the quality and performance of our Affiliates. But their distribution and our distribution alongside theirs is absolutely contributing to our continued organic growth.","Looking ahead, as I said, we see no change there\u2019ll be, of course, inevitable evolution, adaptation, growth in our distribution capabilities and strategy, but no fundamental change to the vision or strategy. We\u2019re looking for a -- and I\u2019m very confident we\u2019ll find a very high quality, experienced, driven, motivated person who\u2019s a cultural fit with our team, and of course, with our Affiliates and our overall corporate philosophy. So, I\u2019m quite confident that we\u2019ll complete a search in a very expeditious way with somebody who were enthusiastic to have join the AMG team. Nate, I think, I left DOL and maybe something else.","Nate Dalton","Certainly. I\u2019ll -- let me pick up on the DOL piece there. So, I\u2019ll do it in probably at least two parts, right. So, first, I think, as we\u2019ve said before, we don\u2019t believe that the DOL fiduciary rules will have a significant direct impact on the business and all of our Affiliates that are interacting with retirement investors are already fiduciaries.","And frankly -- and this goes beyond the direct fees -- and frankly, the retirement area is actually one on our U.S. side, this is part of a business is relatively modest and is actually an area at least sort of look out over the medium to long term an area we should be able to really grow.","I do think -- look the other thing I think we\u2019ve also said before is, we\u2019re probably doing much of the same thing as many other people similarly situated, which is we\u2019re trying to help our distribution partners, the people that we work through and we\u2019re trying to figure out how we can best partner with them as they evolve the way they bring their offering to market.","I do think there are some other things I\u2019d add though, which is, I think, while we have a small share, we\u2019re relatively well-positioned as you look at how those partners may be evolving their businesses. So, we don\u2019t really have brokerage, we\u2019re almost all in the advisory side, we have, by and large, the right kinds of share classes to, that will be attractive.","And then, importantly, and this picks up on a point Sean made earlier, we have -- this is a place where we can be enormously useful to our Affiliates, because having the scope and scale and breadth to be a good partner to while have with others, as they go through their product rationalization may be very, very important.","So, again, it\u2019s not a direct impact and the retirement piece is small -- relatively small part of our business today. And while there will be a bunch of sort of noise and work as we go through this, I do think there are opportunities on the kind of medium-term to long-term for us to partner well with our channel partners here.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Shutler with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Shutler","Hey, guys. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on one of the questions from earlier. Just curious, have you sensed any pick-up in the deal pipeline which you would attribute to the DOL or just broadly an increasing recognition, particularly within the U.S. retail of the importance of scale?","Sean Healey","Well, I would say and, Jay, tell me if you disagree or have something to add. I would say there has been a pickup in the activity level or the number of firms who are \u201cfor sale\u201d or looking for a transaction. But in the main those really aren\u2019t firms that we would include in our pipeline and pursue as prospective Affiliates.","So, I think, on the margin, the scale and expertise that we provide and to your question retail distribution and more broadly in global institutional distribution, global compliance. These kinds of scale benefits when delivered or packaged with a two-decade plus proven track record of being a good partner and providing protection for the unique operating and investment culture of our Affiliates, which is absolutely critical fundamental, that really is distinguishing.","And so we\u2019re looking for Affiliates -- prospective Affiliates who appreciate the advantages of that capability but are themselves making a decision to move forward from a position of strength. These are strong growing firms which recognize that on the margin we can help them but we\u2019re not interested in opportunities, of which there are absolutely some, where firms are struggling with the changes in the environment and \u201cneed a partner\u201d that\u2019s for other firms with different strategies.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Carrier","Hi. Thanks, guys. I guess, the question, just on the alternative speed of Affiliates and the demand that you\u2019re seeing. I think on one hand, we see a lot of interest in that area. On the other hand, it\u2019s been a tough year for certain strategies on the hedge fund side. So, just wanted to get maybe an update on the Affiliate mix, how you see that playing out, where are you\u2019re seeing demand and maybe where are you\u2019re seeing some lack of demand?","And then, Jay, if I can sneak in a quick one, just given the Affiliates that you have been acquiring, any change in like the tax rate or the bias to the tax rate going forward, just given more of an international thing? Thanks, Jay.","Sean Healey","Right. I\u2019ll start with a high level response to your question, which is for all of the industry talk and the news that you see in the media around the decisions that certain clients have made around limiting their alternative or \u201chedge fund\u201d manager universe or the challenges that we read about regarding certain firms and certain strategies especially long, short equity and macro, that obscures the underlying reality which we\u2019re seeing, which you see in our results this quarter.","And I think with the very best alternative firms globally you\u2019re seeing as well, which is there is increasing demand by global institutional clients especially, but also to some extent retail clients, for high quality, differentiated, uncorrelated or less correlated strategies, which have a track record of generating alpha. And our approach to alternatives is very focused and strategic in a set of defined product areas, which Nate described and we find for the best of those firms absolutely ongoing demand both in the short and in our view long term for those products and those firms. Do you want to...","Nate Dalton","Yeah. Maybe just like a couple of things. So I do think we\u2019re seeing -- we described the four kind of general groupings within our alternatives book, private equity and real assets, Systematic Diversified, fixed income and equity relative value and multi-asset and multi-strategy, and within each of those categories we\u2019re still seeing strong flows to the best performing products.","I think the point I\u2019d make and this is consistent with the point Sean was just making, which is, look, the pressure is coming when you have poor returns in a space that\u2019s relatively crowded even if people want that space and so, those are the places where you\u2019re seeing the pressure. But even in those areas, the strongest managers are both continuing to do well and continuing to track assets and then also will ultimately benefit from that evolution or shakeout or what have you. And then, again, as Sean said, the long-term fees are also attractiveness of these kinds of products in terms of the need for people to get into their portfolios is, because we think absolutely intact.","Jay Horgen","Then on the tax rate, you\u2019re right, our tax rate has been coming down both our GAAP reported tax rate but also our cash tax rate that is a trend that\u2019s been going on for three years now, each of the last three years we\u2019ve seen a decrease in those rates.","I do think it\u2019s stabilizing at the current level, it has -- it is a structural change and that structural change is because of new investments offshore, we spent some money offshore and the effect of non-U.S. corporate taxes or lower than U.S. corporate taxes.","So having AMG avail ourselves of a global rate has lowered our both GAAP and cash rate. For the moment, I think that level of 33% GAAP and 20% cash going forward is the right rate to consider, but that is certainly down year-over-year and over the last two years.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Sean Healey for any closing remarks.","Sean Healey","Thank you again for joining us this morning. As you\u2019ve heard, we\u2019re pleased with our results for the quarter and confident in our ability to continue to create shareholder value through both organic growth and accretive investments and new Affiliates.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Ms. Selene Oh, Vice President, Investor Relations for AMG. Please go ahead.","Selene Oh - Vice President-Finance & Investor Relations","Thank you for joining AMG to discuss the results for the first quarter of 2016. In this conference call, certain matters discussed will constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected due to a number of factors including, but not limited to, those referenced in the company's Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time.

Healey - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Selene, and good morning, everyone. AMG reported economic earnings per share of $2.94 for the first quarter of 2016 which is an increase over the first quarter of 2015 notwithstanding declines in global market indices over the past year. Assets under management were $642 billion at quarter end, an increase of 5% in the quarter driven by a successful execution across all aspects of our growth strategy including the completion of two new Affiliate investments during the quarter and the excellent investment performance and net flows of our existing Affiliates.","As Jay will describe further even in a relatively difficult environment for the asset management industry, we see continued earnings growth ahead. We were very pleased with our net client cash flows of over $5 billion into our Affiliates actively-managed strategy this quarter which were notable especially given the muted investor risk appetite across the industry more broadly.","With more than $110 billion in net inflows over the past five years, we continue to benefit from the ongoing success of our global distribution strategy including the marketing efforts of our Affiliates as well as the strength of our global distribution platform. And importantly our organic growth also reflects the quality of our boutique Affiliates and the impact of our strategic focus on high value rapid alpha generating products including global equities and alternatives.","The best boutique firms have a competitive advantage in generating excess returns in these product areas as demonstrated by the outstanding long-term performance records of our Affiliates and it is clear from AMG's organic growth results that clients continue to prefer boutiques across a range of differentiated return oriented strategies.","The advantages of boutiques in alpha oriented products are especially evident in the alternatives area. While there has been much discussion recently about the challenges facing hedge funds especially in certain strategies there are two points that are important to keep in mind. First, volatility among managers is both evitable and healthy and over time it will benefit the best firms with the strongest franchises. Second, the alternative product area encompasses a much broader range of strategies than hedge funds alone and during the first quarter of 2016 AMG's Affiliates continued to generate strong investments performance and net flows across a wide array of alternative products.","In an environment of low returns, clients around the world from sophisticated large institutions to individual retail investors increasingly seek diversifying and uncorrelated return streams and they are expanding allocations to a wide cross-section of alternative strategies. With a broad range of liquid and illiquid strategies from industry leaders including AQR, BlueMountain, Pantheon, and ValueAct, AMG is well positioned to meet an increasing client appetite for the best alternative products.","Likewise, we also see substantial opportunities for global equity managers given the ongoing erosion of home country bias and continued globalization of client portfolios and the outstanding global equity managers such as Artemis, Harding Loevner, Genesis, Veritas and Tweedy, Browne; are clearly positioned to benefit and while the prevailing popular narrative is that active investing under performs passive, as we all known averages by definition do not tell a complete story. AMG recently published the results of research focusing on the investment performance of boutique firms over 20 years with a finding that boutiques clearly outperformed broad indices over the period. Our Affiliates long-term performance track records across many market environments speak for themselves, and it's clear to us that there will always be strong client demand for high conviction differentiated actively managed strategies.","Finally turning to new investments, we were very pleased to complete our investments in Systematica and Baring Asia during the quarter, two outstanding new Affiliates which enhance the diversity of our alternative product set. As exemplified by these and other new Affiliate investments, the founders of leading independent investment firms want to create an enduring franchise which will persist across generations while preserving their operational and investment culture and autonomy, and they need a permanent ownership solution to enable them to achieve these goals. The largest and most successful boutiques around the world attach special importance to finding a permanent partner with global scale and a demonstrable and outstanding long-term track record of partnerships with other excellent firms.","It's clear from the discussions we're having with prospective Affiliates that AMG's preeminent position as a partner to leading boutique firms is becoming more important than ever, and we're extremely optimistic about our forward prospects to invest in the finest boutique firms globally.","While volatile markets create challenges, they also reveal opportunities and the transaction environment remains highly favorable for AMG. We are very pleased with the quality and diversity of our new investment pipeline. We're confident in our ability to make additional accretive investments in new Affiliates, and together with the organic growth of our existing Affiliates we are uniquely positioned for continued strong earnings growth going forward.","With that, I'll turn it to Nate to discuss our Affiliate results in more detail.","Nathaniel Dalton - President & Chief Operating Officer","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. As Sean said, in a quarter marked by significant volatility, our Affiliates including especially our largest Affiliates performed very well. We generated good organic growth with $5.1 billion in positive net client cash flows coming in across all three of our distribution channels.","Before getting into the details of the quarter, let me start with a couple of the themes that cut across our business. First, we continue to benefit from some durable trends you've heard us talk about many times before, and Sean mentioned a couple of these. The highest quality boutiques are able to generate outperformance across return-oriented product categories. Institutions and their intermediaries are continuing to barbell their portfolios between passive exposures on the one side and active exposures on the other, where they were seeking their excess return. Because of their ability to outperform, high quality boutiques such as our Affiliates are very well positioned to gather these return seeking assets.","There's a related point here also which is that boutiques are very well suited to nimbly evolve their products for these opportunities. This is a trait inherent in the entrepreneurial spirit of successful boutiques and one that we see in our own Affiliates. We believe all of these trends contributed to the $110 billion in net positive flows over the past five years that Sean referenced.","Second, let me take a moment to frame our alternatives book for you. Our alternatives business is made up of private equity, infrastructure, various macro, multi strategy and other non-traditional products as well as traditional hedge funds in areas such as long\/short equity, relative value credit and managed futures. All of these provide different alternative exposures to client portfolios. We continue to have very strong alternative flows across all three of our distribution channels. In fact, this was the fifth consecutive quarter that our alternative strategies have had positive flows in all three channels which is a testament to the breadth of our offerings as well the ability of our Affiliates to evolve their products for the various channels while staying true to their investment disciplines. We think the strong investor interest in alternative product is likely to continue or even accelerate.","Third, specific to the institutional channel, I would note a couple things. In terms of the first quarter, growth inflows were muted relative to our very strong longer term track record, as investors slowed down the pace at which they put capital to work during the market volatility last quarter. On the other hand, we did not have any significant idiosyncratic outflows in the quarter. Now, while institutional flows will always be lumpy, looking ahead we feel very good given the long-term trends we've talked about and the activity level in terms of RFPs, searches and finals (9:280).","Fourth and finally, we obviously had a very good flow quarter in our Mutual Fund channel, particularly in alternative and global equity funds. In addition. the outflows from our U.S. equity funds slowed significantly as especially Yacktman has been performing very well during the volatility of the last four quarters. Looking ahead, given the strength in our position, the diversity of products with good traction and the evolution of new products, we continue to believe there is a significant long-term opportunity to drive material growth in retail.","Now, turning to our product categories and performance for the first quarter and starting with alternatives. Across our Affiliate group we are one of the largest managers of alternative products in the world, and as I described earlier, we have a diverse portfolio across product categories, investment styles, and including large scale exposure to both liquid and illiquid products is truly a differentiating feature.","In terms of performance, and starting on the more liquid side, in the quarter a number of strategies at AQR delivered solid absolute and relative performance, notably managed futures, global risk premium, long\/short equity and equity market neutral. Our new Affiliate Systematica also had a good quarter as its flagship BlueTrend strategy featured strong positive returns in the quarter. Although you may have seen from publicly available data that many managed features products including some managed by Systematica and AQR had a pullback in April. Lastly, major strategies at First Quadrant including currency and essential beta delivered good returns in the quarter.","On the illiquid side, returns from Pantheon's infrastructure offerings and co-investments remained quite strong and they continue to diversify their product set. For example, broadening their successful infrastructure team into real assets in 2015 and they will be in the market raising real assets fund later this year.","Finally, ValueAct had a more challenging quarter, as they underperformed their benchmarks, although they continue to have an excellent long-term track record.","Now, turning to our equity products, one theme I would highlight is that we have a number of Affiliates with significant value disciplines as part of their investment process. For the first time in several years, value meaningfully outperformed growth in the quarter and a number of our Affiliates benefited from this. Starting with the global developed markets category, this value theme was evident as Tweedy, Browne's flagship Global Value Fund outperformed its benchmarks and peers by a sizable margin in the quarter, further improving their category leading track record.","In addition, Harding Loevner continued to deliver good returns in the quarter across their international and global equity strategies as they added to their excellent long-term records while AQR also delivered solid performance in the quarter. On the other hand, Artemis underperformed these benchmarks while they still maintain good long-term performance records in their major non-U.S. equity strategies.","Emerging markets had the best returns of the major equity asset classes and our Affiliates performed well in the quarter. In the category, Genesis and Harding Loevner put its solid, absolute and relative returns adding to their excellent long-term track records of outperformance. Trilogy also generated good relative returns in their emerging markets strategy while AQR was in line with the MSCI EM Index in the quarter and has excellent relative returns over the long term.","Finally, with respect to our U.S. equities, Affiliates with a significant evaluation component generally outperform their benchmarks and peers in the quarter. This include Yacktman whose recently reopened funds featured top decile rankings in the quarter. In addition, major products at GW&K, River Road, SouthernSun and TimesSquare outperformed in the quarter.","Now, turning to flows and starting with the institutional channel, while I remind you that flows are inherently lumpy. In the quarter, we had net inflows of $285 million. In addition to the major themes I noted earlier, the key drivers of net inflows from an asset class perspective were alternatives both liquid and illiquid and emerging markets equities offset by outflows from U.S. and other equities. From an Affiliate perspective, key contributors to positive flows were AQR, Harding Loevner, Pantheon and Systematica.","In the Mutual Fund channel, we had net inflows of $3.4 billion in the quarter, in addition to the major positive themes I noted earlier. This quarter we also benefited from some seasonality in U.S. as tax deferred accounts funded in the first quarter some of which have a meaningful allocation to return seeking assets. From an asset class perspective net inflows were driven by alternatives in global and emerging markets equities and continue to be offset a bit by U.S. equities although further trends are continuing to improve there.","In our High Net Worth channel we had record in flows of $1.3 billion for the quarter. Key contributors to this quarter's strong flows were global and emerging markets equities, alternatives and municipal bonds.","Finally let me give you some color more broadly on the contribution of our global distribution teams this quarter. Within AMG Funds, we've established real traction from the investments we've made over the last 18 months with growing gross sales and especially in platform driven sales this last quarter. Institutionally, we've good traction with clients across the world dominated by alternatives and global equities very much consistent with the broader trends I described earlier. We continue to have a strong and growing pipeline of new opportunities including some that got pushed from the fourth quarter given the market volatility.","Looking ahead, our Affiliates have excellent long-term track records across a wide range of strategies and a proven ability to adapt to the evolving needs of the marketplace while staying true to their investment disciplines. Because of this, we are very optimistic about our ability to continue to drive significant positive flows across all three of our distribution channels both from our Affiliates selling efforts as well as those of our complementary global distribution teams.","With that I will turn it to Jay.","Jay C. Horgen - Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer","Thank you, Nate. As Sean discussed we are pleased with our first quarter results which included an increase in assets under management of 5% as compared to the prior quarter primarily due to significant growth from net client cash flows and new investments. Given the strength and diversity of our Affiliates and the substantial cash generated by the scale of our business, we continue to produce stable and growing earnings even in periods of market volatility. As you saw in the release, we reported economic earnings per share of $2.94 for the first quarter which included net performance fees of $0.09. On a GAAP basis we reported earnings per share of $1.92.","Now turning to more specific modeling items. For the first quarter our EBITDA was $215.7 million and the ratio of our EBITDA to end-of-period assets under management was approximately 13.4 basis points or approximately 13 basis points excluding performance fees. These figures include a full quarter impact of EBITDA from Systematica and Baring Asia which closed at the beginning of January.","In the second quarter of 2016 we expect this ratio to be approximately 13.5 basis points. With regard to our taxes, our effective GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 34.3% and our cash tax rate was 20.4%. Going forward, for modeling purposes we expect our GAAP tax rate to be 33% and our cash tax rate to be 20%.","Intangible related deferred taxes for the first quarter were $22.1 million, and in the second quarter we expect this number to remain at approximately $22 million.","Our share reported amortization for the first quarter was $34.4 million, which includes $14.2 million of amortization from Affiliates accounted for under the equity method. For the second quarter, we expect our share of amortization to remain at approximately $34 million.","Our share of interest expense for the first quarter was $22.3 million, and in the second quarter, we expect our share of interest expense to remain at approximately $22 million.","Our economic items for the first quarter were a negative $1.1 million which included non-cash imputed gain of $1.7 million related to our contingent payment obligations. For modeling purposes, we expect other economic items to be approximately $1 million per quarter.","Turning to our balance sheet, given the outlook for new investments that Sean described we continue to position our balance sheet to have the capacity and flexibility to execute on our new investment strategy while also returning capital to shareholders. In the first quarter we closed on two new investments and repurchased $33 million in shares.","Now turning to guidance, we are raising our 2016 guidance as we now expect economic earnings per share to be in the range of $12.70 to $14.20. This guidance range assumes our normal model convention of actual market performance through yesterday for the current quarter and 2% quarterly market growth beginning in the third quarter of 2016.","We also assumed share repurchases equal to 50% of expected annual economic net income over the course of 2016 which results in an expected weighted average share count of approximately $54 million for the year.","The lower end of our guidance includes a modest contribution from performance fees and organic growth while the upper end assumes a more robust contribution from both performance fees and net client cash flows. As always, these assumptions do not include earnings from future new investments and are based on our current expectation of Affiliate growth rates performance in the mix of Affiliate contribution to our earnings. Of course, substantial changes in markets and earnings contribution of our Affiliates would impact these expectations.","Now we'll be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of William Katz with Citigroup. Please proceed with you question.","William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, thanks so much, good morning everyone. I appreciate taking the questions. You mentioned, I think during the quarter you had accelerated, I think some movement with the shelf financing and I guess taking the concert with just the ongoing description of \"excellent pipeline\". Can you talk a little bit about maybe the motivation behind that and what kind of deals you might be looking at this point in time?","Jay C. Horgen - Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer","So on the, just on the shelf specifically Bill, of course, shelf is just a normal course filing, it lets you issue securities off of it. We had to do it anyway later this year in August, but we did accelerate it. And of course we always want to be in a position to be prepared to execute on our new investment pipeline, which as you heard from Sean is a strong pipeline. So I think we're in a good position to do that for the balance of the year.","Sean M. Healey - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I wouldn't add much to what Jay said and to our prepared remarks, as you could hopefully tell from the tone. We were in a very strong position and working very hard on -- broadly but especially in the new investment area. Of course no fundamental change in strategy. So I wouldn't read anything into the shelf other than the normal kind of preparation for new investment opportunities.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Kim with Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with your question.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Hey, guys; good morning. Maybe just a question for Jay on the new guidance range. Just wondering if you could maybe give us a bit more color in terms of the different moving parts, particularly as it relates to the incremental market appreciation last quarter. And then sort of just a sense of the marks thus far this quarter relative to kind of that 2% convention, Thanks.","Jay C. Horgen - Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer","Thanks, Michael. And as you know it was a volatile quarter. So let's start from the beginning. We did raise our guidance for 2016 to $12.70 to $14.20. And it was really based on two factors, the higher mark for AUM since our last call and an updated performance fee assumption for the year, and so I'll take both of those. The building blocks on the market assumption -- we last gave guidance on February 2, which is our fourth quarter call. At that time our market blend was down about 4%, but has since rebounded towards the end of the quarter, which you can see in our AUM table.","In the second quarter to date, through May 2, we estimate our market blend up approximately 1%, which is in line with broader markets. Just to remind you and you mentioned the model convention, in the quarter we removed for model purposes the 2% beta assumption and we replace it with what we experience quarter-to-date which is the 1% I just mentioned. So in summary from the point of our last call till the updated guidance today, our model is up 4%. And then as you know, thereafter starting in the third quarter we assume 2% quarterly market growth for the third and fourth quarter to round out our 2016 market assumption.","On performance fees, we've updated that assumption as well, given that we're four months into the year, and while it's still early, we now expect our performance fees to be approximately 8% at the midpoint of our range, just down modestly since the last time we gave guidance. As you also know the breadth and diversity of our performance fee opportunity creates a positive asymmetry. It decreases the probability of achieving the low end of our guidance while at the top end there's a greater expected value, so there is asymmetry in our performance fee opportunity. And then finally, just to remind you, as I say every time we talk about performance fees, we only account for performance fee when we recognize them to cash.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please proceed with our question.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Thanks; good morning. If we could talk a bit about flows, you kind of characterized the institutional kind of gross sales number as being low, and we can see it's the lowest number since the second quarter 2014. I guess a little more color, if it's just, you think it's just timing, I think you gave a pretty positive outlook, but a little more color maybe at the Affiliate level or product level or even region as to maybe where you are seeing strengths or even the weakness.","Nathaniel Dalton - President & Chief Operating Officer","Great; so this is Nate; I'll take that one. So as you know we said that gross sales were a little lower than prior periods and I think there was no single factor that really drove it. We called out one which is this quarter sort of risk aversion, delayed funding and we definitely saw some of that. Also, I'll just say in the last quarter we didn't really see any lumpy capital commitments to sort of loan lock periods which is something that happens with some frequency. And then, again, a little bit at the margin seasonality, Q1 is often a somewhat light quarter.","But again, so now moving to looking ahead to the current quarter the second quarter and looking ahead, repeat that the institutional flows are all lumpy and it's still early, but we feel very good both because of the long-term trends we talk about as well as we can see the things that have already funded this quarter, and some of those are the ones we talked about that slipped, a few of the things that we already funded this quarter, and then just look at the level of activity in RFPs and finals and whatnot.","So, we feel very good about that. And in terms of geography and product, I said the geography is quite broad U.S., non-U.S. really globally, the activity level is very high and then in terms of product, I think it's themes we've been talking about which is especially alternatives in non-U.S. equities are the places we still continue to see the strongest institutional traction.","Sean M. Healey - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And broad based among Affiliates, majority of the largest Affiliates all had positive flows.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks, good morning. So, mutual fund channel AQR contributed a very high percentage of your total flows in 1Q, but did AQR also contribute a high percentage of institutional sales in 1Q or is it more balanced?","Nathaniel Dalton - President & Chief Operating Officer","So, the institutional sales were very balanced and broad based just to do that piece first, but then when you look at the gross sales in the mutual fund channel, look obviously AQR had a very good quarter and is doing a very good job building up their mutual fund business. But if you sort of look at the five or six largest contributors it was AQR, but it was also \u2013 there was couple of very strong global equities, global international equities through firms like Harding Loevner and even on the U.S. equity side especially on sub-advisory firms like Frontier with their Vanguard relationship continue to do very well. So it's \u2013 there is good contribution from a number of Affiliates there as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Chris C. Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, guys, good morning. As you look at the strategies that have been generating the most flows in recent quarters, are you approaching a point where there are capacity constraints in any of those strategies? Thanks.","Jay C. Horgen - Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer","So, look I think when you talk about the capacity issues, I guess what I would do is I'd probably sort of say is let's step back for a second, just make sure we are all grounded. And there's absolutely some places where there are capacity issues. When you look at the largest contributors to flows in recent quarters, I don't think it's been so much of an issue and I will say that for a couple of reasons. So one is we do have Affiliates in there who are managing their capacity, certainly managing their pace of flows as they're coming in, but a lot of the places we are seeing flows and we alluded to this in our prepared remarks with talking about the product development opportunity from our Affiliates that are seeing good flows. There is a lot of good large capacity product coming online at Affiliates and so when I say coming online what I mean by that is they're getting into that sweet spot where they've got the track record, they've got enough assets that's critical math and they can drive flows and so that good three-year track record kind of range.","But even in some of these newer areas it's \u2013 even that's less important. So plenty of new products coming online and some of it's also, and I think we talked about this as well, the new packaging theme, right which is \u2013 and that is a place where we can really be helpful, which is bringing institutional products into retail channels or bringing products that are performing very well in one geography into another.","And then the final thing I'll say, it's also very important to remember that we have a sort of unique product development opportunity, which is this ability to bring on new Affiliates right. So, as you look back at the last firms we talked about Systematica and Baring, those are very different, unique, highly attractive product sets today, as well as good product development opportunities within each of those firms and we're starting to work with both of them on ways to both broaden the geographic reach of their distribution, but also, to work with them bringing their newer products to market. And so, we're very excited about the new product development opportunity.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, good morning folks.","Sean M. Healey - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Nate maybe just talk a little bit about again about the new sales rate if you can comment on, is the pace so far in the second quarter on a pro rata basis exceeding that in the case new funded wins in the first quarter. So I guess that we're running a bit above say $3 billion to $4 billion \u2013 or $3 billion actually.","And then secondly if you can talk also about how you are thinking about, maybe Sean, how you're looking about Department of Labor for the share rules whether that changes any kind of strategy within your sales into 401(k) plans and IRA.","Sean M. Healey - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Maybe I'll try both and Nate add in if I miss something. I think starting from the second part of your question the DOL, I think we said at the time that we didn't really seen an impact. In fact the thing that was ultimately put in place was more benign than I think many industry observers had feared and definitely not having any kind of a material impact in our business. With respect to flows and this is really just echoing what Nate and I have said in our prepared remarks and Nate earlier in response to a question. We see continued good momentum in retail which is growth in the funds that are having positive flows and kind of abatement or lessening of outflows in some other areas and generally good performance across the group. And then institutionally we see very good momentum and there were some elements of Q1 that were a little anomalous but without guiding specifically we feel very positive and optimistic about our forward flow opportunity in institutional as well and you put them together and that's obviously a very good momentum.","Jay C. Horgen - Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer","The only thing I'd add is, you can look certainly on the our Mutual Fund channel. You can sort of see a firm momentum continuing or I think we're running somewhere over $400 million in across the whole complex in U.S. Mutual Funds and again just to be clear that's not including sub-advisory and that's not including in non-U.S. But yes, so a good flow momentum is continuing there and then yes as we said what we can seen in the institutional channel both from things we've already funded, and some of that stuff that slipped as I said before, as well as the activity level, we feel like we should be getting back on pace in terms of gross sales in institutional.","Nathaniel Dalton - President & Chief Operating Officer","And then one thing I should also say, it was obviously a good, very good quarter High Net Worth as well, and there especially in the intermediated High Net Worth channels and the momentum is continuing there as well. And that's, international equities in SMA that's munis and it's definitely some alternatives by a number of Affiliates are on good platforms there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your question.","Patrick Davitt - Autonomous Research US LP","Hi, good morning and thanks. Kind of a longer term question around what feels like a much more increased regulatory environment perhaps at mangers. Curious, one, do you feel like you're equipped to provide compliance in risk management for smaller boutiques that may not be prepared for what's coming through the pipeline and is that starting to factor into your conversations with potentially new Affiliates?","Sean M. Healey - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think there is nothing on the horizon that is more than sand in the gears I would say. I mean, the environment is increasingly complex both here and around the world and we understand that, and there is certainly heightened awareness among firms broadly and it is probably more of a conservation, more of an element in the conversations that we have with prospective Affiliates. But it's certainly not a dominant feature.","The very best firms are well equipped to manage these issues, but recognize that if you have a global partner with capabilities and experience around the world both directly and then coordinating among other Affiliates that there is of course an advantage. And so I think, that the regulatory effects generally are setting aside the element of regulation that is positive and needed much out of the regulatory regime as I said is probably decreasing efficiency and making the business more challenging for all asset management firms. But I think on a relative basis it certainly positions us and our Affiliates very well. So, there's nothing as we look forward that that gives us any particular concern.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Roger Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, thanks guys. When we look at the Affiliates like line up and then when you think about performance, I think from an allocation standpoint, you guys definitely have the product areas where we're seeing flows going. I guess just on performance overall particularly on the alternative and the international equity if you look at the overall kind of AMG portfolio with all the Affiliates, when you compare may be like this three to five-year track record versus a year ago or three years ago, like how are things looking from like the competitive standpoint? Meaning the allocation trends are favorable, but are the performance trends across most of the Affiliates relatively strong?","And then just a quick one on the High Net Worth just wanted to get any color on that because obviously that was strong and just wanted to see if there is anymore outlook in terms of what's driving that? Thanks.","Sean M. Healey - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Maybe I'll answer at a higher level and talk about client demand trends and then let Nate me pick up the second part of your question around specific Affiliates.","I think the trends that have been in place \u2013 well, across the industry, I think we are still a bit swimming against the current in terms of where industry flow trends are generally, and you can judge that by the results that you've seen our peers put up and what you know about the industry generally. But I think if you look underneath and say, where are the most successful firms gaining share and getting positive flows, and it really is around barbelling and recognizing, that notwithstanding what we read in the popular press, the very best high-active share alpha-oriented equity managers, especially non-U.S. equity and alternative managers -- and alternative is a much broader category and it's for all that we hear about individual hedge funds and certain isolated strategies -- the truth is that broadly speaking around the world there is increasing interest in allocation toward the best alternative firms.","And so we feel like we're playing that -- this consistent product strategy that we've been executing now for almost 20 years is increasingly attractive to clients and you're seeing that in our results and we're increasingly positive about the forward opportunities. And the last bit is this in our view appreciation that clients have more and more in the alpha-oriented products set of the advantages of the very best boutique firms and their focus and discipline and nimbleness and all of the other attributes that make boutiques, the best boutiques. attractive. So all of those broad themes very much in place, very much playing into our core product strategy.","Nate, do you want to talk about specific Affiliates or Affiliates broadly?","Nathaniel Dalton - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yes, let me add one, I think really just add one piece on top of that. So, you have \u2013 you understand obviously there is 500-plus products and new products being developed, as we talked about earlier, all the time. When we think about the framework you're using, which is where the flow opportunity is and sort of how we think about mix and the evolution, let me walk you through just a sort of simple exercise here, which is, look, we believe overall there is a very high quality level across our boutiques and they do obviously a wide range of different things. Those things will come in and out of favor over time. And they each have their own dedicated strong distribution teams in their own regions and channels as we find them, and they're growing organically very well and they're excellent businesses.","We can marry that. This relates a little bit to the prior question as well, which is we can marry to the scope and scale of our organization. Whether that's in -- again, as appropriate -- whether that's in distribution or in legal and compliance or what have you, and we can help bring their products and the products as they evolve them, bring them into the most appropriate marketplaces in the world for that product or process or the amount of capacity that they want to us and where is the best place to find the best matches for them with the most appropriate distribution channels and clients.","And that opportunity to sort of combine the best of boutiques with some of the scale, in scale activities, distribution and legal clients, are good examples. And you need both in order to effectively bring a product around the world and into different channels, so that's part of it.","And then the other part is increasingly as we're interacting with the marketplace on behalf of our Affiliates we're able to bring the Affiliate's product to the marketplace in a way the marketplace wants, right?","So we're having a marketplace joined up conversation sort of partnership with the consultants or intermediaries or end-users, large scale end-users in these marketplaces. And we can get the Affiliate product into the right package for those end-users. And so there really is a very powerful sort of dynamic, which is, as the products move in and out of favor, we can take the ones that are in favor, get them matched up at right places and again as the Affiliates wants. So (40:26).","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks, good morning, everybody. Was hoping you guys could comment on the contribution of AQR to flows kind of overall. We obviously can see the retail channel, but I guess more broadly when it comes to performance of your quant Affiliates whether it's AQR, First Quadrant et cetera, first quarter was a pretty funky quarter with a lot of volatility. So I was just wondering if you could comment on how each of them have performed over the course of the first quarter may be on an absolute basis as well as relative to the benchmark?","Nathaniel Dalton - President & Chief Operating Officer","So, I think broadly and I think we said some of this in our prepared remarks. I think broadly the quantitative measures, including AQR and we called that in a number of their products as well as I believe we called out FQs products in both currency and risk parity. I think they had good quarters and both \u2013 so from a performance standpoint both were strong positive contributors. From a flow standpoint, again as we said earlier I think the AQR guys are doing a fantastic job, but when you look at the flow profile that really is a combination of firms like AQR as well as the fundamental global and even this quarter as I mentioned sort of U.S. equity firms you could see contributing.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Alex Paris with Barrington Research. Please proceed with your question.","Alexander Paris - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.","Hi, guys most of my questions have been asked and answered. I did have one last question though. Based on your comments with regard to the pipeline, the pipeline appears strong. I think you even said Sean that the volatility of the first quarters may have pushed out some discussions from the quarters into future quarters. Jay, I guess this question this for you. Looking at the current balance sheet what is the capacity for additional acquisitions, excluding potential future financings?","Sean M. Healey - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Let me answer that, maybe Jay you can add in as appropriate. I don't think I said that the volatility in the first quarter has pushed things out. I think that reference was around the pipeline in terms of new client mandates as opposed to new Affiliate investments. And so with the new Affiliates investments, I think the opportunity set, the environment, our relative position are really as good as they can be. And we feel quite positive about the opportunity to add new Affiliates from a universe of a broad universe of outstanding firms and where we're going to choose to invest and really the most outstanding firms who fit both within our culture and philosophy, but also of course the quality and commitment to building and enduring franchise.","And so we see that opportunity set that challenge that Jay always has is to manage our capital position in a way that maintains substantial flexibility. I think if you look over the last five years or beyond indeed that, almost the entirety of our corporate history we've had I think very effective capital management, we've had a commitment to not holding a lot of cash on the balance sheet, to returning cash especially in the form of repurchases to shareholders. But also to make sure that we're positioned to execute on new investment opportunities when they arise and they often arise in groups and at times where you can't necessarily choose and so you just have to be ready.","Jay can answer the question, but at a high level it's how the business generates over $1 billion in EBITDA. We have lots of cash that is available to invest in new affiliates. We have a revolver that has lots of spare capacity and we could of course increase it. But the other point is, in your question, without additional financing look, we don't have an issue with going to the capital markets and quitting with equity. Where we see an opportunity and any time we do that, it will be a highly accretive, attractive transaction set for and I say set, because by definition that would mean it's at some scale. So those kinds of opportunities however financed, I think are very attractive to our shareholders and we'll pursue them. So it really \u2013 there's no constraint in the way we think about capacity. Jay do you want....","Jay C. Horgen - Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer","I think, that was perfect.","Sean M. Healey - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Michael Kim with Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with your question.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Hey guys thanks for taking my follow-up. Just curious to get your thoughts on a potential exit in terms of how that might impact any of your Affiliates from more of a structural standpoint. And then, assuming a step up in cost related to some type of transition, just how you're thinking about that dynamic just given kind of the revenue sharing arrangements?","Sean M. Healey - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think, we are not that concerned even for the UK-based Affiliates, they're making their plan as you would expect prudently. But don't expect any major disruption, and at the highest level we don't expect it to have of course, it's possible. And so, prudence dictates that we make contingency plans both at the highest level but at each individual Affiliate as appropriate. So it's something that of course we'll all pay attention to but not, not something that we're losing a lot of sleep over.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Alexandra Lynn. Thank you. You may begin.","Alexandra Lynn","Thank you for joining Affiliated Managers Group to discuss our results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2013. In this conference call, certain matters discussed will constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected due to a number of factors, including, but not limited, to those referenced in the company's Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the call. AMG will provide on its website, at www.amg.com, a replay of the call and a copy of our announcement of our results for the quarter, as well as the reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.","With us on the line to discuss the company's results for the quarter are Sean Healey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Nate Dalton, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Jay Horgen, Chief Financial Officer.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Sean Healey.","Sean M. Healey","Thanks, Ally, and good morning, everyone. We were pleased to report record earnings for both the quarter and full year with economic earnings per share of $3.66 for the fourth quarter and $10.31 for the year, an increase of 34% over 2012, and assets under management of over $540 billion, an increase of approximately 25% year-over-year.","Our results for the quarter and the year reflect excellent execution across our business, including the ongoing success of our distribution strategy, the addition of 2 highly regarded new Affiliates and above all, the continued strong investment performance of our Affiliates, including the outstanding results of our alternative managers, which in turn generated exceptional performance fees.","We continue to benefit from our strategic focus on alpha-generating equity and alternative products as global clients increasingly seek return-oriented strategies for the alpha portions of their portfolios to complement their passive beta exposure. And unlike in more scale-oriented product categories such as fixed income or passive equity, sophisticated clients around the world use specialist firms as having a competitive advantage in alpha generation. In U.S., global and emerging market equities, Affiliates such as Tweedy, Browne, Harding Loevner, Genesis, Artemis and Yacktman, are recognized as among the best managers globally. While Affiliates such as ValueAct, AQR, First Quadrant and BlueMountain are for a broad array of the most highly regarded alternative strategies in the industry. On this note, we were very pleased to see that AQR was recently named Morningstar's alternative Fund Manager of the Year.","With the outstanding investment performance of our Affiliates and the ongoing success of our global distribution strategy, we continue to generate industry-leading organic growth from net client cash flows with $5.5 billion in net flows during the fourth quarter and over $40 billion for the full year, and now 15 consecutive quarters of strong positive net flows.","Given the opportunities we see for our Affiliates to gather new business around the world, we are continuing to build out our global distribution platform by expanding the breadth and depth of our capabilities with additional coverage and personnel in key markets and channels worldwide. As Nate will describe further, in 2013, we made senior hires in several major institutional markets, and we're continuing to enhance our position in U.S. retail, which is an increasingly important strategic priority for us. The investments we've been making in our global distribution platform continue to yield excellent results as evidenced by new mandates generated in every institutional coverage region with net client cash flows broadly spread across all product areas and distribution channels during the year.","Turning to new investments. During the quarter, we were pleased to announce an investment in SouthernSun, an exceptional small- and mid-cap equity manager, and looking ahead the deal environment is very favorable to AMG. Our opportunity set is extremely strong and our 20-year track record of successful partnerships, combined with the strength of our distribution capabilities, gives us a unique competitive advantage. We've entered 2014 with a substantial transaction pipeline, which includes a diverse array of traditional and alternative firms around the world, and we continue to be very optimistic about our prospects for making additional investments in outstanding new Affiliates.","Looking back on 2013, I'm very pleased with what we accomplished. Through the successful execution of our growth strategy, including the organic growth of our existing Affiliates, as well as partnering with new Affiliates, we have continued to broaden the scale, diversity and earnings power of our business. Going forward, we are uniquely positioned on a global basis. We have a remarkable group of performance-oriented Affiliates, which are recognized as industry leaders in highly attractive product areas. We are effectively executing our global distribution strategy across an increasing number of markets and channels, and our new investment opportunity is better than ever.","As always, we know the future success requires an ongoing focus on excellent execution across our business, and we look forward to continuing to create outstanding long-term shareholder value in the years to come.","With that, I'll turn it to Nate to discuss our Affiliates results in greater detail.","Nathaniel Dalton","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. As Sean said, 2013 was a great year for AMG with strong organic growth and excellent investment performance. Our Affiliates' outstanding long-term investment track record combined with our robust global distribution strategy and resources resulted in another year of exceptional net client cash flows.","During the year, we continued to build out our very successful global institutional platforms while at the same time, we have been increasing our focus on retail distribution channels, especially in the U.S. We believe we have a unique opportunity to bring an unmatched array of boutique firms with a exceptional long-term track records into retail markets by leveraging scale and distribution. We recently announced several steps towards building upon a scale we've already achieved and in particular, to leverage the AMG brand into our retail business.","Now I'll talk more about those specific steps in a moment. But first, turning to investment performance and starting with the global developed markets category. Against the backdrop of generally rising equity market last quarter, our Affiliates generated good investment performance. Highlights included strong performance from significant products at AQR, Artemis and Third Avenue; Tweedy, Browne with its deep value strategy not surprisingly lagged in such a sharply rising market but the long-term track records remain outstanding and relative performance so far in 2014 has improved.","In the emerging markets category, we continue to have generally strong performance as all of the major products managed by Genesis and Harding Loevner are well ahead of their respective benchmarks for the quarter 1-, 3- and 5-year periods. Looking at the performance of various emerging and frontier markets recently, it seems very clear that this is the time for active management in the end, generally. And we expect that sophisticated clients will continue to maintain and even increase their allocations to our Affiliates' emerging markets products.","Turning to our alternatives product category, where, as Sean noted, we offer a broad suite of strategies. For the quarter and full year, many of our Affiliates' most significant products performed very well, including high-quality products at BlueMountain, First Quadrant, ValueAct, Pantheon and AQR. In addition to the strong performance of our alternative managers, Affiliates which offer both alternative and traditional strategies with incentive fee structures, delivered exceptional performance fees in 2013 and the year ended well for a number of our products.","","Also, during the fourth quarter, several large clients with multiyear performance fee contracts decided to recommit their assets under new long-term contracts. Obviously, a very positive endorsement, which resulted in the realization of the fees and then earned on the contract through 2013.","Turning to our U.S. equity products. We had a mixed quarter end year on the performance side, where Yacktman, like Tweedy, lagged in such a sharply rising market as you'd expect. Although relative performance so far in 2014 has improved and the long-term records are outstanding. TimesSquare, Systematic, and GW&K finished a very strong year delivering outstanding performance across their respective suites of equity products.","As Sean noted, we are also very pleased to welcome SouthernSun Asset Management to our Affiliate group. SouthernSun offers industry-leading U.S. small- and mid-cap strategies with top-rated investment products to the trailing 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year periods.","Now turning to flows for the quarter. As I said, we had another good quarter with $5.5 billion in positive net client cash flows. As we emphasize on every call, flows, especially in the institutional and sub-advisory channels, are inherently lumpy. However, overall flow momentum continues to be strong.","Turning to the channel review and starting with the institutional channel. We had positive net flows of approximately $2 billion. These flows came primarily in global and emerging markets products and alternative strategies, including notable contributions from Pantheon, Harding Loevner, AQR, BlueMountain and Artemis. Similar to previous quarters, we had a number of high-quality wins coming from leading institutions located around the world.","Moving to the Mutual Fund channel. We had positive flows of $3.6 billion. From a product category standpoint, we had strong flows into U.S. and global equities and alternative strategies. The breakdown of flows in those channels also very broad as we had a number of Affiliates make significant contributions including AQR, Artemis, Harding Loevner, Tweedy, Browne, Beutel Goodman, TimesSquare and Yacktman. In our high net worth channel, flows were essentially flat for the quarter as rebalancing outflows from some products with annual liquidity features offset inflows principally in U.S. and global developed markets products.","Now turning to an update of our distribution platforms, which complement our Affiliates' dedicated marketing sales efforts. We continue to generate strong flows among a diverse set of products and across geographies and remain very pleased with the success of the global distribution business to date. As Sean noted, during the year, we generated significant new business in each of our coverage regions including Australia, Europe, the Middle East and Asia with 2013 being a real breakthrough for us in Asia. As you know, we opened our Hong Kong office just over 3 years ago. In addition, we made several investments in our European team over the last year with a new office in Z\u00fcrich, notable senior hires for the Benelux, German and Swiss markets and the new head of Europe, who brings with her a significant additional U.K. expertise and relationships.","In the U.S., as you saw, we recently announced several initiatives related to the increased strategic focus on our retail distribution business. While this business is already generating good flows for a number of our Affiliates, we see significant additional opportunities. It is clear that over time, retail investors, just like global institutions, will need to increased their allocations to return a range [ph] of products to achieve their investment goals. With our wide array of outstanding boutique Affiliates, we are very well positioned to capture additional market share as we increasingly leverage our scale and brand.","Now as we announced 2 weeks ago, part of the strategy includes bringing Aston Asset Management into the AMG retail platform, enhancing our scale. Next, leveraging the success we've achieved building the AMG brand in global institutional channels both with end clients, as well as intermediaries, we also announced 2 weeks ago, that in the spring, we'll begin to use the AMG brand for our U.S. retail distribution business. Through this process, the approximately 40 mutual funds available as manager's funds will be rebranded as AMG funds, and we will be able to leverage our brand across channels and geographies. The combined AMG funds business will service over $70 billion of mutual fund SMA and sub-advised products.","Finally, 2014 is off to a good start as we continue to see increasing demand for return-oriented products managed by leading boutique firms, we are confident we can continue to generate strong organic growth.","And with that, I'll turn it to Jay.","Jay C. Horgen","Thank you, Nate. As Sean and Nate discussed, our exceptional fourth quarter results completed an excellent year of earnings driven by organic growth from net client cash flows and continued outperformance by our Affiliates. As you saw on the release for 2013, we reported economic earnings per share of $10.31. For the fourth quarter, we reported economic earnings per share of $3.66, which included net performance fees of $1.41. These performance fees reflect the upside earnings potential in this element of our business, which we normally expect to contribute between 5% and 10% of our economic earnings in a typical year, but which always have the embedded asymmetric upside opportunity to generate a larger earnings contribution. In addition, we continue to take a conservative approach to the recognition of performance fees, which are included in our earnings only in the quarter in which they are realized as cash. Finally, on a GAAP basis, we reported earnings of $2.79 for the quarter.","Turning to more specific modeling items. The ratio of our EBITDA contribution to end of period assets under management was approximately 25 basis points in the quarter reflecting the exceptional contribution from performance fees. We expect this ratio to be approximately 15.5 basis points in the first quarter of 2014, and for the full year we expect it to be approximately 16.7 basis points which includes a normalized assumption for performance fees.","Holding company expenses were approximately $33 million in the fourth quarter reflecting final year-end expenses, and we expect them to return to approximately $27 million in the first quarter for 2014. With regard to our taxes, our effective GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 34.5% and our cash tax rate was 32.9%. For modeling purposes, we expect our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 35% and our cash tax rate to be approximately 25%. Intangible-related deferred taxes for the fourth quarter were $8.6 million. We expect this number to return to approximately $17 million per quarter in 2014. Our share of reported amortization for the quarter was $23.7 million and together with $10.5 million of amortization from Affiliates accounted for under the equity method, AMG's controlling interest portion of amortization was $34.2 million. We expect AMG's amortization to decline to approximately $27 million per quarter in 2014. Our interest expense for the fourth quarter was $24.1 million and for the first quarter of 2014, we expect it to decrease to approximately $22 million.","Turning to our balance sheet. With the increasing scale of our annual free cash flow and our $1.25 billion bank revolver, we have ample capacity to execute on our new investment pipeline, and we continue to consider opportunistic access to the capital markets as part of our ongoing effort to lower our cost of capital and simplify our capital structure while maintaining a liquid and flexible balance sheet.","Now turning to guidance. We continue to expect our 2014 economic earnings per share to be in the range of $10.50 to $11.70. Our guidance assumes our normal convention of actual market performance through yesterday for the current quarter and 2% quarterly market growth beginning in the second quarter of 2014. We also assume a weighted average share count of approximately $55.5 million for the year. The lower end of our guidance range includes a modest incremental contribution from performance fees and organic growth, while the upper end of the range assumes a more robust contribution from performance fees and net client cash flows. As always, these assumptions do not include earnings from future new investments and are based on our current expectation Affiliate growth rates, performance and the mix of Affiliate contribution to our earnings. Of course, substantial changes in markets and earnings contributions of our Affiliates would impact these expectations.","Now we will be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So I'm just wondering, have you spent any time looking at nonbank, noninterest SIFI regulations and other regulations that could impact the industry? And I'm what I'm getting at is, it looks like certain regulations may attack at the product level, which could have a greater impact on smaller asset managers that don't have the same infrastructure like a larger asset manager has. So I'm wondering, do you have any thoughts on kind of longer-term consolidation and sort of the benefits you can provide on the compliance back-office risk management side? And do you think this will sort of be a bigger trend going forward?","Sean M. Healey","Wow, that's a big question. I think the answer is, of course, we think about all of those regulatory initiatives and the breadth and increasing complexity of regulation across jurisdictions. And I guess what I would say is it is increasingly evident to us, not only in our own business but, of course, we have global scale and for us it's just part of doing business. But for boutique firms, who are considering in the mix of criteria to decide whether they want to seek a strategic partner and which strategic partner would be best for them, increasingly they are thinking about the breadth and complexity and expense of global compliance. And we have a business that, obviously, has global scale we're effectively marketing and distributing together with our Affiliates' products in a large number of jurisdictions, I think, over 40 different jurisdictions, over 50 regulators, all of which have ongoing transition and change in increased complexity. And so the ability for us to offer our Affiliates and perspective Affiliates the opportunity to connect not just to our marketing and distribution platform but also to our global compliance platform is becoming increasingly important and is a real strategic advantage for us going forward.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then, I just have one follow-up to Nate. And sort of a more shorter-term focus question but we know fourth quarter seasonality tends to be a little weak on the institutional side. But I'm wondering were there any large institutional decisions that were sort of pushed off into January? Or maybe pushed forward into September, which caused sort of a kind of below trend fourth quarter flow quarter for the institutional channel?","Nathaniel Dalton","So look, of course there's always a sort of pipeline one but not funded and, of course, there are aways, again, given the scale of business, there are always some things that are slipping from one quarter to the next. So I'm not going to say there wasn't that there. I don't think -- I think if you were going to sort of say, \"Look what was the seasonality, if any, right, this last quarter?\" That's probably not what I would -- not specifically what I would focus on. Although again, there's, of course, some of that. I think the thing I would focus you on is there were some rebalance decisions. There were a number of rebalance decisions, which again is not sort of surprising given the real run in especially U.S. equity, but U.S. and developed markets equities with some Affiliates who have done very, very well obviously in the relative basis as well, and so there was some rebalance both in the institutional. And then I'd also say in the U.S. sub-advisory space, there were some rebalance decisions that impacted the net number by impacting the growth out for a number.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Nate, were the rebalances from a specific investor like corporate defined-benefit plans or sovereign wealth funds, insurance companies?","Nathaniel Dalton","Yes. No, I think it really was less the -- I understand this part of the question. I think it's less the type of investor kind of thing. And I think -- again, if I were -- again, it's anecdotal and authentic and all that but if I were drawing a conclusion, I really would say, I would bring it back to the just to the movement and just the performance in the product category. The other thing that I'd say, looking ahead, the momentum in the channels, including for U.S. equity product, remains really, really strong and so it's less a decision, say, about U.S. equity interest. I think is just a set of different investors who'd had really good performance and who are rebalancing back to sort of long-term objectives. So the pipeline, including the pipeline for U.S. equities, still remains really good both here in the U.S. and throughout the whole distribution platforms.","Operator","And the next question comes from the line of Michael Kim with Sandler O'Neill.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","First, just a broad question as you and your Affiliates have discussions with existing and potential clients. Are you getting a sense that there's been a broad-based pick-up in demand for smaller boutique firms, particularly those managing high value-added strategies? And then, within that trend, it seems like boutiques continue to put up strong performance. So just wondering to what extent those factors may be driving market share gains and sort of the outlook for the gains going forward?","Sean M. Healey","Thanks, Michael. I think there's no question that you're right and we have been seeing for a while, I mean, as I said, 15 straight quarters of strong positive flows, much of that outside the U.S. but increasingly I think we're seeing U.S. institutional and retail investors rerisk. We think that if you're focused on the alpha-generating side of your asset allocation, you're thinking in active equities, specialist equity categories and certainly in alternative strategies. If you're thinking of the client, you think of the best firms in the world as being very largely the very best boutique firms in the world. And if you can, if you're a client outside the U.S., if you can get the best of the focus-performance oriented boutique firms in, let's say, a given alternative strategy but yet all of the benefits of a global scale asset management company when it comes to end market client service and distribution support but also global compliance, that's really the ideal. I mean, Nate, would you add anything to that?","Nathaniel Dalton","No, I think that captures exactly right. I think we agree with the broad trends, performances, the ticket. You need to obviously have performance and then, as Sean said, I think it's both -- it's our ability to combine access, right, because people do have limited time and bandwidth and you have to understand the end users and find effectively to partner with them. And then, it's providing comfort to other parts of the same organizations, but providing comfort with the operational compliance and infrastructure support. And so I think we can sort of do all of those things, be big where big is helpful, right, and then and get out of the way with respect to the thing, as you say, that they think they're really looking for which is the performance of the -- ultimately, the performance of the boutique.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then, can you maybe talk about potential step-up and flows related to opening up access to SouthernSun's funds by sort of plugging them into your distribution platform? And then, any color on sales trends for Yacktman more recently just given the recent fund closures?","Nathaniel Dalton","Okay. So SouthernSun, you're understanding it exactly right. I mean, I think we are adding into the platform. I think they have very good short-, medium- and long-term track records and we certainly think there's opportunity to leverage our distribution and relationship and add distribution appropriately where it's a good match for them, as we've done with Yacktman and others. So I think you understand that piece exactly right. On the Yacktman flows, I'd say 2 things, right, so one, obviously, the soft close had an impact, of course. But it was a soft close. The performance has been -- had been, if you sort of look back up last year, had been softer and I'm sure that's had an impact as well and I know that's had an impact to us as well in part as they built up cash and all the rest of it. I think if you look at their recent performance, the recent performance this year-to-date so far has been very, very good. So I think looking ahead, the question will be -- again, if you remember back to when they closed, the close wasn't a really a capacity-problem close. It was a -- they were building up cash and they needed to find places to put it work. And I don't know the answer. I'm not speaking for them, but maybe they'll find some opportunities to do some of that. So I think that's -- those are the factors there.","Sean M. Healey","But I think it's a great question and important to underscore an element of our strategy, which has a real virtuous circle. In other words, we've been generating very strong organic growth from net client cash flows among the existing Affiliates. And you've seen that, as we said, very consistently and really, industry-leading, especially among return-oriented products. And then you think separately about the new investment opportunity and I think, historically, we view the investment opportunity as certainly very accretive,b But accretive on a standalone basis. And what we're really seeing and we've executed this, if you look at recent new investments and where we've been asked by Affiliate partners to help with distribution, whether it's retail distribution in the case of Yacktman or global distribution in the case of, let's say, some of the alternative firms or emerging market equity firms, global equity firms, and as we look forward, we know that an increasingly important element of the decision-making by perspective Affiliates is the strength of our distribution capabilities. In turn, as we think about adding new Affiliates, we see an opportunity to enhance our organic growth because we're bringing and building into an existing distribution pipeline, a whole set of very attractive products that in some cases are being offered and a new and different way into the channel or into the geography. So it's a great opportunity for us and as we look forward, we think all elements of our growth strategy will come into play as we make incremental new Affiliate investments.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then, maybe just one for Jay. Nice to see you maintain the guidance range despite the rough start to the year. So just wondering where you're maybe seeing a bit better-than-expected trends to sort of offset the quarter-to-date market losses? Or is it just really a function of being so early in the year?","Jay C. Horgen","Thank you, Michael. Just a reminder of the convention first. We do assume 2% per quarter and the last time we gave guidance was November 5. And clearly, most recently markets are down but since that third quarter call, we're off about 1.5% on the market blend basis, so we are down. It's not significantly down. But it is relative to 2% convention, we're down 3.5% relative to the model. So notwithstanding markets and notwithstanding that, we continue to see our earnings net range of $10.50 to $11.70 and this guidance really reflects the scale and the stability of our business, including the run rate carryover effect of the 2013 organic growth, as well as the expected closing of SouthernSun and the accretion associated with that, which really hadn't changed materially. So that's what is reflected in the current guidance. I mean just to also remind people on performance fees, we're going to, again, assume a typical year and expect our performance fee opportunity being at 5% to 10% of the number that we just gave.","Sean M. Healey","So, obviously, if we -- as we showed in 2013, there is this asymmetric upside and there are opportunities, which, starting this year, I'm just as optimistic as I was last year about the prospects for having a tremendously strong earnings contribution from performance fees.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Sean, I have a question for you [indiscernible] to every quarter. And I guess every quarter, we try to leave of comments around the pipeline and whatnot, and I guess, at least my take on maybe tea leaves is that you feel a little bit better about the deal pipeline heading into this year, whether it's the scope of it or how far down into the pipeline things may be. So can you maybe -- if that's the case, could you maybe give us a sense of what do you think has kind of evolved or changed maybe over the past year and if I'm reading it right that maybe makes you feel a little bit better about things?","Sean M. Healey","Sure. Well, I've been feeling very good about AMG's prospects in the medium- to long-term for a while. And I see that in the strength of our competitive position, including, as I said, the distribution capabilities and the track record of success in terms of helping our Affiliates, the track record of success in terms of being a good partner following the financial crisis and so in our systematic, now, 20-year calling effort where we build relationships with the very best boutique firms around the world. And we know that, inevitably, whether they're traditional or alternative, inevitably, in almost all cases, the firm's principals are going to seek some kind of solution to their succession and transition needs. And the demographic reality of senior partners getting older and needing to think more about that than perhaps they ever have before is -- it is clear. And we have a very compelling story to tell around that. And so, as you have seen in, of course, strong equity markets, not in every category, but generally strong equity markets, generally good performance and very good -- as we were discussing earlier, very good client-demand trends in active equities and alternative products, generally, so strong business momentum certainly for the very best of these boutique firms. You're seeing more and more of these principles thinking about doing a transaction, and so we see that in our calling efforts and relationship building. If you sort of say, why now? Well, to some extent, it's hard to gauge. Waves of M&A activity are very common in this industry and more broadly and I think I said last quarter we're in the midst of a wave, I think, of activity in the industry broadly. And you'll see some of those transactions. Certainly, you'll transactions that may be great for some other business but don't make any sense for AMG. And so keep those in mind. But with respect to investments in outstanding boutique asset management firms that have or seeking to continue to build and create enduring franchises and where we've -- you've got a great multigenerational partner group, we see some from transactions that are in the industry, banker-led transactions, but especially in our, what I'll call, relationship-driven investment opportunities, we see a lot of activity. And as I said, we have a very strong pipeline. We have this firm policy that we don't announce deals until we announce them. So I can't really say more than that. But there is a strong level of underlying optimism and I think, of course, if there's a severe bear market, that is going to dampen activity. But I think if it's a sort of a typical correction, which I think it seems to us is more likely, that's not really going to do anything to activity. I could even argue that it might accelerate activity. So we continue to feel very optimistic about our new investment strategy.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And maybe just one last question for Nate, if that's okay. I'm just curious if the -- with the refocus or increased focus maybe on the retail channel, are there any particular segments within that, that you feel offer a particular opportunity, whether it's made to the DCIO channel or the RIAA channel, I mean, when you're looking at attacking that in these specific pockets of more opportunity or -- than others?","Nathaniel Dalton","Yes. And I think I will answer it in a couple of ways. One, I think some of it is driven of where we are today, right? So if you look at our business today, the managers business is relatively stronger in the sort of BD [ph] kind of channels. The Aston business is good in the BD [ph] channels, but also relatively strong in RIAA [ph] channel. And I think we have a big opportunity ahead of us in the DC markets, I think in general, right? So I think that's -- but that's partly driven by macro things; it's partly driven by where are we today relative to the opportunity sets we see, right? That's the first thing I'll say. And the second thing I'll say is we do see a really large opportunity for us if you sort of look at us from a product mix standpoint, because again, good global and emerging markets, I think, there's some things we can do on both of those and certainly in the emerging market side. But also if you look at the mix of alternative products that we have across our Affiliate group, I think there were some really strong -- there's really interesting opportunities to sort of bring those products out there in a couple of those channels, maybe in all those channels. And so I think those are -- maybe that's a different way to dimension it, but I think that's another way of that we're thinking about it.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I guess, Nate, just thinking about the backlog and your outlook for 2014 in terms of demand for certain products and\/or Affiliates, is it -- would you characterize it as very similar to how you ended a year ago or in recent quarters just in terms of puts and takes around demand in various regions?","Nathaniel Dalton","You have to look at it -- at a very high level, I'd said the long-term trends remain intact. I do think, look, it's very early in the year and, obviously, there will be things that affect it. I think, for example, looking backwards, and I think I said this in my prepared remarks, this was the year for us where our distribution in Asia really came on, right? And so I think another way to think about the distribution opportunity for us is looking at the increased scope and scale of the resources we're bringing to bear. And a lot of it is not necessarily right after we bring things on, but it's over time. And so we're having a really good set of conversations in the Nordics, bringing stuff along that's been there for a few years. We're pretty early in Germany and Switzerland, but those are growing faster, right? We had with good European coverage, we just increased our debt. So I think you're seeing more resources coming on and so I do think that from that perspective, the opportunity set at the big end is growing. Now again, how long it takes to really translate that to wins, that's obviously something we're working hard at. But -- so at a very high level, I think the opportunity set and all that looks reasonably similar. But we are bringing more and more resources online and that was institutionalized both, too. And obviously, on the retail side, we think there's a big opportunity there and we need to get ourselves organized to go execute on that, too. And I think that's a big potential opportunity. And also I'd say, so far we've really been talking about U.S. retail, right? There's also an opportunity in retail outside the U.S. And one other thing we're working on is in geographies where we built very strong sort high-end institutional business, we're also looking at how do we extend that into sub-advisory and more platform-driven sales and retail, as well.","Sean M. Healey","And this is all in a backdrop of real secular trends favoring alpha-generating active management, favoring alternative strategies that generate alpha. And so for us, we see broad industry trends, institutional and retail, U.S., non-U.S. all coming increasingly in our favor. And for us, we feel that notwithstanding the very strong organic growth that we put up, that were buried [ph] in very early days in some very large markets and in very large channels. So for us, there's lots of optimism and I think we're in the early innings of executing this opportunity.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Great. And then, just a follow-up, I think you mentioned that some of the performance fee crystallization in the quarter was a result of some clients reupping some longer-term agreements. Maybe if you could discuss -- is it similar terms that they reupped? And then also just the performance fee contribution in general, just kind of the breakdown of number of Affiliates or number of funds or a little more granularity on that would be helpful.","Nathaniel Dalton","Sure. So broadly speaking, it was some large institution reupping which, again, very positive endorsement and into sort of similar kinds of products and structures. So I think that's to the first part of your question. And then, in terms of the performance fees in the quarter, I think it was -- there was a number of Affiliates that contributed. It was a, I'd sort of say, especially the sort of the more alternative firms, so AQR, BlueMountain, ValueAct all had very strong years and very, very strong quarters in some of their sort of significant performance fee products. And -- but there were a wide set of other ones that contributed as well. And I think that's -- I think I covered most of them.","Sean M. Healey","And Jay mentioned this, Dan, I know you know this, but it's worth emphasizing relative to other firms that have alternative products. We're -- we always have a very conservative approach to the guidance that we give around performance fee contribution. And it starts with a very conservative approach to the way we account for and talk about performance fee opportunity. So we have, right now, we have every quarter -- I'm knocking on wood here a little bit, but we have a broad business with some really excellent firms that have outstanding products and they generate a lot of performance fees and there's a level of earned alpha that we don't talk about. We don't talk about performance fees until we realize amounts cash. And so you'll see some lumpiness because of that and -- but it's important to understand it's a real asymmetric opportunity. We guide at a very, very conservative base level, but there will be years -- we just had one and we could have another one, will have another one, I'm confident, whether it's this year or the next, et cetera. But we have a terrific upside opportunity in the way that our business is structured and positioned.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler with William Blair.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So in emerging markets, you continue to see strong investment performance. I know, I think, that you saw inflows in Q4. So maybe just talk about the tone around DM [ph]. I know it's a relatively small piece of the business today, but the tone and any movement that you're seeing of clients from passive strategies into more actively-managed strategies?","Sean M. Healey","Yes. No, I appreciate the question. I would say that in the main global institutional investors have long-term strategic asset allocation models and they very much, in our experience, favor emerging markets. They recognize that there's inherent volatility and they view opportunities like the current environment as periods where, certainly, they will maintain and, indeed, in our experience we've seen them even enhance their and increase their allocations to emerging markets. I think if you step back and you sort of say, \"How are we positioned?\" I think we have a meaningful position on a relative basis. We have a number of Affiliates that are recognized as among the best of emerging market equity managers in the world. And given the period of volatility that we're in, it is very clear, and I think clients recognize this and will increasingly recognize this, it's a period which favors the very best active managers. It's a period where stock selection is more important than ever. It's a period where country selection is more important than ever. And so a lot of the competition is sort of index-hugging or is passive and those kinds of products, I think, are in for a really difficult period. And for us, you have to sort of live through the volatility, but we think it's, I mean, we think there are big, big silver linings to the period of volatility that we're going through. And we remain very optimistic about our long-term opportunity in emerging market equities.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","All right, great. And then, just one more on the retail platform. Obviously, you guys announced the rebranding. So just thinking about the retail opportunity. What should we really expect to change over the next couple of years beyond the name that's on the funds? And do you expect the new deal pipeline to be tilted to a little bit more towards retail firms? Or are you focusing more on retail-oriented firms going forward?","Nathaniel Dalton","Okay. So in terms of what should you expect going forward, I guess I'd kind of focus you on 2 or 3 just big themes, right? So the first theme is, and I know I've touched on these before, I think the first theme is just scale, right? So you're going to see -- we think this is absolute scale business and so you'll see us adding additional scale to this from a sales marketing client service standpoint. Certainly from a product packaging standpoint and you'll see us doing some things there so we can be a better partner to sort of the big intermediaries, both U.S. and global, right? So I think you'll see -- so scale's definitely a theme and you'll see us doing things there. We think brand is absolutely a theme and you'll see us be able to invest more in the brand because we'll have a consistent brand across geographies and channels. And so what I mean by this is we're already interacting with some of the largest global platforms, but we're interacting with them in different ways in different places. And now and this will allow us to bring all of those things together. So I think those are 2 things I'd focus you on. The first thing I'd say, look, it's already a successful platform. It is driving good flows and so this is building strength on top of that strength. And then, maybe just one last thing on the question of -- and again, on what product this means, I think there's certainly the opportunity to add other sort of retail-oriented or more retail-oriented firms, a SouthernSun or what have you, to it and to accelerate their growth, expose them to additional opportunities and all that. But there's also this real opportunity that we talked about to bring much more institutionally-focused firms, historically institutionally-focused firms, especially alternative firms through this platform as it's building out. And so I think there's a lot of opportunities this will work out for us.","Sean M. Healey","Yes, I think that's exactly right. I mean just to add a little bit to that. First, there's this virtuous circle component where as we add new products, new Affiliates and new products, we're an even more attractive than helpful partner to the large distributors. And so we're aware of that, we've seen that institutionally and I am certain we're going to increasingly see that in retail, both U.S. retail and then non-U.S. And I think there's no question that for retail-oriented firms but I think Nate said it well, also, institutional firms the agree to which our distribution capability, both in terms of the number of people and the number of funds in all of that and offices but most importantly, and I think this is where we really distinguish ourselves from other entities in the market, the track record of success. I mean we are generating very strong flows on behalf of our Affiliates when they ask us to. And I think there's no question that as we build up U.S. retail, which is already large and very successful, I mean, we'd be happy to put our U.S. retail organic growth against anyone's on a base of now $70 billion so it's not small. But we think there's lots of opportunities and our capability, as it expands and broadens, is increasingly compelling to Affiliates as they -- perspective Affiliates, as they think about what they're looking for in a partner. But with respect to who were looking for, we're going to continue to look for the very best firms all around the world, whether they're traditional, alternative, U.S., non-U.S., and that's our focus. And then, we will find ways, whether it's U.S. retail or global distribution, to serve those Affiliates and enhance our overall growth as a business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And I apologize that you may have covered this and I might have missed it. But in terms of rebalancing, I'm sort of curious, where is the product going? And then, if you could maybe more specifically quantify how the pipeline looks versus either the third quarter or perhaps year-on-year to get some perspective about the opportunity to the new year?","Nathaniel Dalton","Sure. So in terms of the rebalancing side, I think -- well, the thing I can speak to, the rebalancing was largely out of U.S. equity. Again, sort of institutional and also sub-advisory were both places we saw that. So it was largely out of U.S. equity. Again, exactly where it went, probably hard for us to specifically say. And then, to sort of the question of year-over-year, yes, I think I would describe it -- I think I did describe in sort of 2 ways. One is at a very high level, I think the broad long-term trends remain the same, right? So if you sort of look at where our conversations are happening, sort of our fees and finals and one but not funded, those kind of things that we track, the long-term kind of looks about the same as sort of where it was at -- I'm sorry, not long-term. High-level kind of looks about the same as where it was a year ago. But again, as I said, the thing that is different is I do think we entered the year with additional resources both at Affiliates, but also at AMG that are coming online. And so there's just not the same kind of year-over-year kind of comparison is coming online. And so there's -- there, it's just not the same kind of year-over-year kind of comparison is coming online. Now is it this year or next or whatever? I -- that kind of stuff is hard to tell.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then, maybe Sean or Jay or whoever wants to take it. But in the past, you sort of gone through the pipeline a little bit parsing it between sort of early stage versus late-stage discussions putting the market aside. How does that look today? It seems that the variable is a little strong or less being equal compares to the last quarter. I'm just trying to gauge sort of that pipeline opportunity.","Sean M. Healey","I think I'll let what I've already said stand by itself. I think we've said what we can say about the pipeline. We feel extremely optimistic about our new investment prospects.","Operator","Thank you. It seems we have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Sean Healey for closing comments.","Sean M. Healey","Thank you again for joining us this morning. As you've heard, we're pleased with our results for the quarter and the year, and we're confident in our prospects for continued strong growth ahead. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's teleconference.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host Ms. Ally Lynn, Senior Vice President Corporate Strategy and Investor Relations for Affiliated Managers Group. Thank you, you may now begin.","Alexandra Lynn","","Thank you for joining AMG to discuss our results for the third quarter of 2014. In this conference call, certain matters discussed will constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected due to a number of factors including, but not limited to those referenced in the company's Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time. ","We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. AMG will provide on its website at www.amg.com a replay of the call and a copy of our announcement of our results for the quarter, as well as a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. ","With us on the line to discuss the company's results for the quarter are Sean Healey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Nate Dalton, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Jay Horgen, Chief Financial Officer. With that, I'll turn the call over to Sean Healey.","","Sean Healey","Thanks, Ally, and good morning everyone. AMG generated economic earnings per share of $2.76 for the third quarter of 2014 which is the 26% increase over the same period of last year. Our results reflect continued momentum across all aspects of our business including strong organic growth from net client cash flows, the outstanding long-term investment performance track records of our affiliates and the excellent execution of our new investment strategy including the addition of our newest affiliate Veritas Asset Management which closed last week. ","Notwithstanding increased volatility in global equity markets, especially in non U.S. markets, we generated $5 billion of net client cash flows during the quarter marking our 18th consecutive quarter of strong positive net flows with a cumulative total of approximately a $125 billion in net flows over this period. The ongoing success of our global distribution strategy reflects our ability to excellent long-term investment performance but also our strategic focus on global and emerging market equities and alternatives which collectively generated approximately 75% of our EBITDA across a broad range of industry leading products. ","Our boutique affiliates are recognized worldwide as leaders in their respective disciplines including global and emerging market equity managers Artemis, Genesis, Harding Loevner and Tweedy Browne and alternative managers such as AQR, BlueMountain, EIG and ValueAct with a broader way of liquid and illiquid strategies across the credit, controlled equity, energy, infrastructure and private equity areas. AMG is now one of the largest alternative managers in the world. ","Our success in generating consistent and substantial organic growth from net client cash flows reflects both the marketing efforts of our Affiliates as well as meaningful contributions from our global distribution platform during the quarter, including new or expanded funding in every coverage region worldwide. ","Looking ahead, we see strong ongoing demand around the world for our differentiated value added strategies as global institutional clients increasingly recognized the competitive advantage that boutiques have in generating outlook. With our Affiliates\u2019 exceptional long-term investment track records across the wide range of return oriented products, we are well positioned to continue to benefit from high end demand trends such as, portfolio globalization and the increasing separation of alpha from beta portfolios. And overtime, we see similar trends unfolding among U.S retail clients and with our enhanced focus on our retail platform we are positioned to capture additional market share when these trend take hold.","Turning to new investments, we continue to make progress to our partnering with additional outstanding Affiliates. Our diverse pipeline includes both traditional and alternative firms and includes an increasing proportion of non-U.S based firms. Last week, we are very pleased to welcome Veritas Asset Management to Affiliate group. Veritas is a leading global and Asian equity manager headquartered in London with $17 billion in assets and an excellent record of investment performance which further diversifies and enhances our exposure to some of the fastest growing product areas in the industry.","The Veritas transaction is also great example of how we execute our new investment strategy. Through our consistent calling efforts over the past 20 years we have built proprietary relationships with hundreds of outstanding boutique firms worldwide, virtually all of which will inevitably need a succession planning solution. In the case of Veritas, our relationship began with a direct call to the firm\u2019s single partner Charles Richardson. And then overtime we build a strong relationship with Charles and his partners. And when they decided to pursue a transaction to address there long-term succession planning objectives they approached AMG on an exclusive basis. ","Given our unparalleled competitive composition including our two decade track record of successful partnerships along with the relationships we built with leading firms over those 20 years were uniquely positioned to execute on our outstanding opportunity set, going forward.","Finally, as you heard me say before through the successful execution of our strategy we\u2019ve created a virtuous circle. The addition of new Affiliates increases the earnings growth of our business, while also enhancing our position in value added product areas and in reaching strategic dialogues with clients, making us an even more attractive partner to other perspective Affiliates. ","And most importantly, our reputation is a partner to our Affiliates along with their individual reputations as outstanding firms create a hole that is undeniably more than a sum of its part. We saw evidence of this effect, a few weeks ago at our Affiliates CEO forum, where we gathered the senior leaders of our 30 Affiliates to discuss market trends, distribution initiatives, strategic positioning and best practices for boutique firms across all aspects of business management. ","As more outstanding firms joined our Affiliate Group, our partners increasingly benefit from the network effect of this unique array of some of the world\u2019s best boutique firms. We built our business from an idea into one of the largest global investment managers and our Affiliates are now friends as well as partners. Through their collective efforts and the power of their positive recommendations of AMG is a trusted partner we\u2019re confident in our ability to continue to build shareholder value through both accretive investments in new Affiliates as well as ongoing outstanding organic growth. ","And now I\u2019ll turn it to Nate to discuss our Affiliates results in greater detail.","Nate Dalton ","","Thanks Sean. Good morning, everyone. Our results in the third quarter demonstrated the strength and diversity of our business and the multiple ways AMG can drive significant growth. While our investor risk appetite permuted in several channels last quarter. We generated $5 billion in positive flows. As you know we have now have strong positive flows every quarter for the last four and half years. As Sean said, we continue to benefit from some favorable trends. Especially among sophisticated institutional clients, as they continue to separate their portfolios in the passive date exposures of one end and active out for the other and for the outer portions of their portfolios clients will like continue to be attractive boutiques. We also continue to benefit from our strategic focus on global and emerging market equities, and alternative products. These are the areas where we generated the bulk of our positive net flows over the last four and half years. Now, as risks appetites increased and as our Affiliates track records remains strong and we enhance our distribution resources we\u2019ll be even better positioned to drive significant positive flows. ","Turning to investment performance by category and starting with global developed markets area, overall we had a good quarter with highlights including very strong performance from the global product Artemis and Harding Loevner as well as many of AQRs products in the category. In addition, Tweedy Browne\u2019s flagship product performed exceptionally well relative to peers. Their global value fund was the top-performing fund in this Morningstar category for the quarter, and is in the top decile for the trailing 5, 10 and 15-year period.","In the emerging markets category, we had mixed performance during the quarter however long-term performance among major products including those managed by AQR, Gensis and Harding Loevner remain very strong. In our U.S equity category, AQR and River Road service notable stand off during the quarter. While Yacktman unperformed in the third quarter this was not surprising giving a defensive positioning. Relatively, Yacktman had strong performance during the volatility earlier this month reminding me that serves the value of their conservative approach. ","Finally, turning to our alternatives product category, looking across our Affiliate Group, as Sean said, AMG is among the largest alternative managers in the world, with our Affiliates managing a very broad array of liquid and illiquid strategies including best-in-class credit, control equity, currency, energy, global macro, infrastructure, managed features and private equity product. As you think about that array of products it includes many that are absolute return oriented, but also a broad suite and have significant underlying data components. For the quarter, performance continued to be generally strong, although obviously the beta-sensitive products were impacted by the underlying declines in certain of the relevant markets.","Now, turning to flows for the quarter. As I said, we are pleased have another strong quarter with 5 billion in positive net client cash flows, particularly given immediate risk appetite among investors and some channels. As we emphasize on every call, flows especially in the institutional and sub-advisory channels are inherently lumpy, but looking ahead overall flow momentum continues to be good. ","Turning to the channel review and starting with the institutional channel, we have very strong quarter with positive net flows for approximately $6 billion. These flows came primarily and alternative and global equity products. Notable contributions came from AQR, BlueMountain, First Quadrant and Pantheon. Similar to previous quarters, we had a number of great wins coming from leading institutional investors located around the world. In our high net worth channel, flows were roughly $500 million for the quarter with contributions coming primarily from, GW&K, Harding Loevner and SouthernSun, including through our U.S. retail distribution platform. ","Moving to our mutual fund channel, we have outflows about $1.6 billion, we had positive flow into many global and emerging market equities and alternative strategies, which came from a number of Affiliates including especially Artemis, Harding Loevner and Tweedy, Browne these were more than offset by outflows in our U.S. equity products. Obviously, this was against the backdrop of a difficult period pre-U.S. retail flows for return-oriented meters generally and especially in U.S. equities. ","Now, turning to our U.S. retail platform, AMG Funds. Even though the challenging the flow quarter for the reasons I mentioned, we continued to make good progress in positioning the business for the significant opportunities we see to build a reading, retail distribution business. As we\u2019ve discussed on previous calls, this is impart because we believe that overtime clients and intermediaries must allocate through alternative products to meet their objectives. But also fundamentally, we think there is a unique opportunity to create the point of contact through which platforms and intermediaries and other channel partners can access the world's broadest array of return-oriented boutiques. There are really only a very few asset managers in the world than same type of performance oriented product that are Affiliates manage. We just recently finished building up the senior team at AMG Funds with the additional bill sent again from MFS\u2019 Chief Marketing Officer. He started last month. And Jeff Ceruti and the rest of the senior team there are very optimistic about the opportunities and execute against their unique ability to help our Affiliates to have significant growth in U.S. retail channels. ","Finally, in terms of updating you on our global institutional distribution platform, we continue to help our Affiliates generate strong flows on diversified better products and across geographies. This past quarter, we saw a number of significant wins coming through our European and Middle Eastern platforms in particular. The other item I would highlight here is the progress we\u2019re making into additional market segments and geographies such as Australia and the Middle East, where we have already made significant progress building relationships with the largest investors and their intermediaries. ","Looking ahead, as our Affiliate maintain their excellent long-term performance records and as we continue to see global demand for performance oriented products managed by some of the best investors in our respective disciplines, we are confident that we can continue to generate strong organic growth. ","And with that I\u2019ll turn over to Jay.","Jay Horgen","","Thank you, Nate. As Sean discussed, despite a volatile market environment, we are pleased with our third quarter results including another quarter of strong and organic cash flows. Given the strength and diversity of our Affiliates and substantial cash generated by the scale of our business, we continue to produce stable and growing earnings including in periods of uneven markets. As you saw on the release, we reported economic earnings per share of $2.76 for the third quarter, with net performance fees contributing $0.06. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of a $1.84 for the quarter. ","Now turning to more specific modeling items, for the third quarter our EBITDA increased 28% year-over-year to $218 million, reflecting the continued organic growth of our business and the strong execution of our new investment growth strategy. The ratio of our EBITDA to the end of period assets under management for the third quarter was 14.6 basis points or approximately 14.2 basis points for third quarter performance fees I mentioned earlier.","In the fourth quarter, we expect this ratio to be approximately 17 basis points reflecting the higher performance fees that we typically expect in the fourth quarter. With regard to our taxes, our effective GAAP tax rates for the quarter was 36.7% and our cash tax rate was 25.3%, both of which were elevated relative to our July expectation as a result of the delay in a very tough closing. For modeling purposes, we expect our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 34% and our cash tax rate to be approximately 25%. Intangible related deferred taxes for the third quarter were $19.6 million and for modeling purposes we expect this number to be approximately $19 million for the fourth quarter. Our share of amortization for the quarter was $29.6 million, including $7.3 million of amortization from Affiliates accounted for under the equity method and we expect AMG\u2019s amortization should remain approximately this level for the fourth quarter. Our interest expense for the third quarter was $21.7 million, including $2.8 million of pre-tax non-cash imputed interest expense. ","For the fourth quarter, we expect our total interest expense to be approximately $22.5 million including $2.8 million of pretax non-cash imputed interest expense.","Turning to our balance sheet, through the continued growth and increasing scale of our business, we have simultaneously reduced our leverage while also executing on four new investments in 2014 including a closing of Veritas last week and the funding of approximately $50 million of share repurchases in the third quarter. With run rate EBITDA of more than $1 billion combined with another $1.25 billion of undrawn revolver, we continue to have substantial capacity and flexibility to execute on our significant opportunity set in new investments. And the increasing scale of our business will continue to create incremental opportunities for earnings growth.","Now turning to guidance, we are updating and narrowing our 2014 guidance as we expect economic earnings per share to be in the range of $11 to $11.60 which reflects the impact of markets to date as well as our expectations for fourth quarter performance fees. For 2015, we expect our economic earnings per share to be in the range of $12.50 to $14. We also assume a weighted average share count of approximately 56.5 million for 2014 and approximately 57 million for 2015. As always, we assume our normal convention of actual market performance through yesterday for the current quarter and 2% quarterly market growth beginning in the first quarter of 2015. The lower ends of our guidance ranges include a modest contribution from performance fees in organic growth while the upper ends of these ranges assume a more robust contribution from performance fees and net client cash flows. As always, these assumptions do not include earnings from future new investments in our base on our current expectation of affiliate growth rates performance and the mix of affiliate contribution to our earnings. Of course, substantial changes in markets and the earnings contribution of our affiliates would impact these expectations.","Now we\u2019ll be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we\u2019ll be conducting a question-and-answer session (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Michael Kim with Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Kim - Sandler O'Neill","First, Sean, curious if you could maybe flesh out your comments a bit about the deal pipeline, just in light of the more recent step up in market volatility. I think in the past you've talked about outsized volatility either on the upside or the downside that tended to make getting deals done a bit more difficult. Just wondering, if you maybe seen some potential sellers or partners stepping away a bit more recently.","Sean Healey","Well, good question, and there is no doubt that extreme volatility, as you say, on either side, has a dampening effect on new investment activity. I think moderate levels of volatility actually can be helpful. They have a way of focusing the mind on what can be lost as well as what can be gained. And so who knows what\u2019s going to happen on a near to medium term basis with equity markets. But if one assumes that we\u2019re past the recent bit of volatility, I think at this point it actually will be helpful going forward. We have, as we\u2019ve indicated, a very strong pipeline.","Michael Kim - Sandler O'Neill","Got it. In terms of the retail channel, I understand the reasons why Yacktman has underperformed and that's why this amount flows. But just focusing on the mutual fund channel, curious to get your thoughts on where you see opportunities to maybe offset those redemptions as you look across other funds or regions, particularly assuming retail risk appetites remain somewhat muted.","Sean Healey","So, before I go right into the questions obviously just maybe one that it is partly Yacktman as you indicated relative performance. But overall, our product mix in retail, really in U.S. retail, is more heavily U.S. equity centric, and so that\u2019s really even more than just sort of Yacktman point that really is I think something to observe, right. So the more heavily U.S. centric product mix in U.S. retail I think is part of the channel and just the challenge crossing that channel. In terms of the opportunities to offset that, let me focus here on two things, right. So one is I think geography as you indicate and their non-U.S. retail has been and continues to be area of opportunity for us and that\u2019s UK, European increasing and never building out in Australia. So I think the non-U.S. retail is definitely an opportunity for us. And then within U.S. retail, it\u2019s the evolving product mix, right. And so it\u2019s both working with the existing set of affiliates but also you heard us talk about this in the past as we bring additional affiliates online that\u2019s also another very strong source of opportunity for us in the retail channel to work with those affiliates and bring retail products there.","Nate Dalton ","The other thing I would add is that as you know our focus on retail has come mostly this year with the addition of a new senior team, the last of which Nate mentioned we just hired this month, building out infrastructure, building out importantly increased awareness and a brand, using the AMG brand for the first time. So of course to some extent it depends on broadening of our product set and inevitably to some extent on planned demand trends coming toward our return oriented product set, which we're convinced will happen. But even before then we feel very good about our prospects looking ahead.","Michael Kim - Sandler O'Neill","","Got it. And then just one last one for Jay. In terms of the updated guidance range for this year, in particular, any sense of the underlying mix between the mark-to-market impacts versus maybe a bit more conservative outlook on performance fees as we stand here today.","Jay Horgen","","Sure, Michael. Let me -- maybe I'll address that in all of guidance, so answer a bit more than you even asked, but it's the highest level -- we updated the 2014 and 2015 guidance. But we also narrowed the 2014 range, which is our normal practice, because we have visibility and more visibility on the fourth quarter performance fees. So we just take those into two pieces, on the market beta part, I'll just start by reminding everyone our convention, we last gave guidance on our second quarter call July, 29. At that time, we assumed 0% markets for the third quarter and 2% markets for the fourth quarter, in each quarter thereafter. And so since that call we've seen this pullback. Our blend was down or is down about 2.25% across all products through last Friday. So a little bit better than the third quarter AUM table shows 2.25%. Given that we're now in the fourth quarter, our convention is to assume no more beta for this year, so we removed the 2% assumption for the fourth quarter. And as a result, the realized performance through Friday is a 4.25% lower than our model, and so that explains most of the shift in 2014 and really all of the shift in '15. The 2014 range also is affected by the delay in Veritas, which moved from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, so that you're conservative that -- you didn't mention Veritas, I think there is a piece of it is just Veritas it does not have an impact on '15 it does have a small impact on '14. So just a recap, our '14 guidance reflects markets, the delay in Veritas and the partially impact of the deal that we did throughout the year while our '15 guidance reflects a full year impact of all four investments and mark-to-market and then our normal convention of 2% per quarter starting in the first quarter next year. ","So then the last bit to get to the second piece, with only two months left in the year, when we narrowed this range to reflect our current expectation of the fourth quarter performance fees. As you know we've already booked $0.22 through this year, we continue to see this year is a 5% to 10% of our total economic earnings year in performance fees. We only experienced performance fees when crystallized just to remind everyone, but given the pullback this year, we have narrowed the range and that does sort of an account for the rest of the range move.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Dan Fannon - Jefferies","","Just on flows, you highlighted the Middle East and Australia as regions of success. Wondering -- you saw some flows, you mentioned, in this quarter. It seems like the backlog is building in those regions. Can you talk about where you are in terms of the build out and generally how long it's taking you to ramp these regions? And then ultimately what other regions are you looking at to expand, to get a sense of the laddering effect that will take place as you have been building out these new regions for some time, and it seems like it's expected to continue.","Sean Healey ","","Got it, so, I'll try to sort of describe the structure here, because I think your question sort of tees up a bunch of the different ways we think about. You used the word laddering the way we think about the ladder the curves of these things build right. So, we have some regions Australia and Middle-East parts of Europe that we've been in now for a while have done a good job as I said building relationships with the largest pools of capital, with the biggest intermediaries in those geographies and so we're well into those curves in places like that. But you've to be careful not to generalize for the whole geography, so I would describe that at least two dimensions right, so geography and then channel within the geography. So at the sort of high end institutional channel, the high end biggest intermediaries consultants especially in these geographies I think we've in some geographies been for a while, I think we've now built businesses that are sort of past that beginning stage, so we've built a good brand and reputation, we've made some significant sales working with our affiliates and we're well into thinking about how to bring additional affiliates -- a multiple affiliates into those relationships and building diverse mature relationships. At the same time in those geographies we're also adding additional resources to move into other channels. There, we did highlight Australia and the Middle East as examples where we\u2019ve added additional resources to move into sub-advisory and sort of moving to the smaller ends of the geography and we\u2019ve also been building packages so I also talked about the build of Australian trusts for example. So there is certain in market like that we\u2019ve been done very good job penetrating some channels and we\u2019ve building out in diverse finding too other. In their other areas Asia\u2019s example where we\u2019ve made a very good progress we\u2019ve won some very significant mandate from many of the largest institutions of regions but there is still a lot more we can do at the large and building out. So I think there are regions like that okay so that\u2019s another category. And then the third one I would mentioned is talk about places like Europe where, we talk about it as a one region but it\u2019s obviously very, very diverse. And so there are places where we\u2019ve been working with our Affiliates for quite some time but there are also places where over the last year, year and half you\u2019ve heard us adds specific country resources and so we\u2019ve talked about our German hire, Swiss higher and those folks are making really good progress now and are just starting to really come on line and build, beginning are significant wins but there pipelines are really growing so that is a part of this ramp that you described right.","And then final thing I\u2019ll say is obviously as you indicate there are plenty of still what, advertisement call white spaces and places where we still could add additional resources places where we\u2019re really not doing dedicated coverage day and we\u2019re continue to work on those. And so you\u2019ll have a number of ladders or curves that are moving along nicely have a lot of ladders occurs that are just starting to grow and some of are really still have lots of untapped opportunities.","Nate Dalton ","The only thing I would Dan you\u2019re aware of this but I think when we talk about market position generally or do you think about what other public asset managers talk about in terms of market position if generally more they\u2019re positioned in more mature markets whereas more of a market share gain then a underlying market growth and the first in Australia and Middle East and markets like Korea where we not as developed although they have strong and growing position and some of the important client relationships those markets have tremendous underlying growth momentum and so you\u2019re getting the benefit, we\u2019re getting the benefit of not just our strong position sort of those relationship maturing but as the underlying growth continues in those markets, we can get if you will an acceleration of that contribution to our overall flows.","Dan Fannon - Jefferies","Great that\u2019s helpful and then Jay I believe you mentioned 50 million in share repurchases in the quarter. Can you talk about I guess first with the level was where your buyers your stock and then kind a how you are thinking about that in the context of 2015 and just as opportunistic or we at the point where we are generating of cash flow where we could see a little bit more of a consistent buyback coming into the numbers.","Jay Horgen","","Yes so just on the sort of the top level we have noted several times as to size and scale and the growth of our business as well as just a restructuring of our balance sheet to maintain flexibility it gives us the opportunity, to not only execute on our new investment activity which has been significant year-to-date and that is our priority but it also gives us the opportunity to buy back stock. I think the way they characterize this quarter approximately $50 million it was simply to maintain our share account, it roughly the same level and so there was described the completely as opportunistic but it was opportunistic to keep our share count at 566, 567. But when you look forward I think that\u2019s the more interesting comment because we have $1 billion on run rate EBITA and $1.25 billion under on our revolver of course we will continue to focus on new investment. But depending on the timing of those new investments or the size of those near term transactions the scale of our business allows us to comfortably buyback some shares and in periods of lesser activity and so we will continue to monitor that.","Jay Horgen ","Yes I would say buybacks will become an increasingly important thing in our earnings contribution, just inevitably doesn\u2019t say anything about the scale and attractiveness of the new investment opportunities that which is, you\u2019ve heard me say Dan really better than it\u2019s ever been but really the increased contribution from share repurchase that I see perceptively over the coming years is just reflects the very strong growth in our business, the substantial scale and cash generation of a business that\u2019s making over $1 billion a year in EBITA.","Operator"," ","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Bill Katz - Citigroup"," ","Just coming back to maybe an opportunity to build out the U.S retail business and maybe you offset some of the weakness that you are seeing at Yacktman. How quickly do you think you can bring on you mentioned the Southeast and Sun was little bit on the high network side. How quickly can you bring that in Veritas into the retail channel we might set to see some step up of flow?","Sean Healey ","Yes so again I\u2019d remind, I think it is not just a Yacktman story, I do think it is this in the U.S. equity story more broadly that I mentioned, and then on the other side I think the bringing new product to there is a combination of a few things, right. So, one is product that already exists in the appropriate form, these called mutual funds existing in appropriate form where the track record is good and it's coming up on a long enough duration that is the kind of thing that couldn\u2019t really be sold. So, that\u2019s one part, so those are products where we\u2019re already working with the firm, we\u2019ve already got the package filled, the distribution team is already familiar with it, it's already probably on some thought comes already and maybe beginning to the broad and to modern portfolio. So, I think there is a category of those even before you get to either new product from existing Affiliates or new products from new Affiliate. But you\u2019re right there is a very big opportunity in those large category, so it's new products from existing Affiliates and whether and we\u2019ve talked about this before, but working with our existing Affiliates to our alternative managers especially and helping to bring those products to their in the retail channels in the U.S. and outside the U.S., so that\u2019s a very large opportunity for us. And then the last one is the one that you mentioned, which is if you go through the Affiliates that we\u2019ve had for most recent Affiliates SouthernSun and River Road, we are working with both of them already in retail channels and bringing them into additional retail channels.","And then for both EIG and Veritas, we\u2019re having -- conversations are underway and those are involved both building the product as well as working with an distribution U.S. retail. But the conversations go underway with both of those go already and again there are kinds of firms that have the capability that is in high demand. And so this should be a very some medium-term opportunity this sounds like that.","Bill Katz - Citigroup"," ","Second question I have is just conceptual nature, our given the strong free cash flow and so the optionality to deals and\/or buyback, should we be watching that if they stepped up repurchase that, that might single that you don\u2019t have transactions coming. Or, can you do both simultaneously just make [indiscernible]?","Sean Healey "," ","Well, I think you\u2019ll see in period for example of extreme volatility more repurchase, just because there will be inevitably some dampening of activity. But in general I guess, I would say you will, if you saw a lot of repurchases, significant amount of repurchase activity that would say something about the immediate near-term pipeline, yes, I think if you saw us building cash in a period where you otherwise would have expected us to be doing significant repurchase activity or reinvestment of the cash, it would probably be a signal that there is substantial medium-term new investment opportunities that we, that we\u2019re sort of preparing for. But I think on a -- that\u2019s sort of hard to read and we\u2019ll give as a clear guidance as we can and I think what we expect going forward again absent market volatility is an ongoing level, elevated level of new investment activity where there are more opportunities than ever where our market position is stronger than ever and simultaneously although I think the repurchase activity will probably be at a lower level in the early years ongoing repurchase and reinvestment, repurchase of our stock and reinvestment of the cash. So, we are quite confident in our new investment opportunity set and also quite willing committed to reinvest the cash the business generates where we don\u2019t have mediate opportunities.","Bill Katz - Citigroup "," ","Just one last one, thanks for taking all the questions, you mentioned in your prepared remarks showing that 75% your business is coming from global equity emerging markets alternatives; you have done a nice job there. As a step back and think about some of the structural demands, shifts that are going on, as well as some of the turbulence that comes the other way, does that change your view at all about adding on fixed income managers looking out of next few years?","Sean Healey "," ","No, at the end of 30 year bow market in bonds it doesn\u2019t seem, however uncertain it is when rates will rise and the -- and what has been a tremendous tide running in favor of fixed income managers and fixed income products. However, difficult it is predict that term or committed or convince that there will be that term and maybe one or two more years but it won\u2019t be another 30 per that way. We also believe that the only way that institutions and individuals will ultimately generate returns that provide for their retirement needs and plan objectives is by investing increasingly and return oriented products and we\u2019re seeing that of course you recognize in our results, we\u2019re seeing that from global institutional clients and we think that we\u2019ll continue and broaden across other client channels and client types. So, going forward we are extremely optimistic about our prospects for ongoing organic growth. And the last thing I would say is that the strategy is borne partly by from a judgment where secular growth opportunities are greatest in the industry, the alpha side of the barbell if you will and also a view of what product areas boutiques sell in and for sure alternatives and global and emerging market equities and niche areas of U.S. equities are among them. And arguably core fixed income isn\u2019t. But we certainly have substantial exposure and niche fixed income or credit alternatives phase and that will continue.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Shutler - William Blair & Company","Good morning. Sean, stepping back for a second, if you look out over the next let\u2019s say five years. Based on the discussions that you\u2019re having with perspective affiliates today, how would you expect the mix of EBITDA to change kind of by asset class or geography over a long period of time?","Sean Healey","I don\u2019t expect that the product categories i. e. the contribution from alternatives and global and emerging market equities at 75%. I don\u2019t expect that to change dramatically I think there will be increasing depths in diversity in let\u2019s say the alternative products that with more and more strategies that we have significant breadth of strategies and exposures and the alternatives there but lots of areas where we don\u2019t have any exposure, and the same in a different way in the active equity product area. So I think we like the rough level of product exposure, I think, in any given period through the fortuity of new investment opportunities. We may get a little more in alternative or a little more in global and emerging market equity.","But I don\u2019t see a dramatic change in the composition of our products in terms of contribution to earnings. I do see an increasing globalization in our product set, in our client base, in our affiliate geography, meaning more and more non-U.S. affiliates. And I think that represents a different kind of diversity and opportunity for growth. And we\u2019re seeing more and more outstanding perspective affiliates in non-U.S. markets and I think that will continue so that theme of diversity and non-U.S. clients we\u2019re already with roughly half of our clients from outside the U.S. where we already have a strong position I think that will continue.","Chris Shutler - William Blair & Company","That\u2019s very helpful, and then just a couple of questions on U.S. retail. So first, could you update us on at least roughly how many sales flush we have in that channel today versus maybe a year ago? And secondly, to what extent do you think some of these new retail products are going to need to build the track record so a three years sort of track record? Or is it possible given the record of some of these firms and just the client demand that you could see flows quite a bit sooner? Thanks?","Nate Dalton","Yes, okay. So I think the overall level of sort of headcount on the sales force right now has been pretty stable. But I think as we look ahead I do think there\u2019ve been it\u2019s been more sort of reshaping of that way, the mix, internal and external and also by channel within the channels they cover. So, thinking about the wires in the RAs and how they adjust that mix. But I think the overall headcount has been pretty stable. On the second part of the question, I think probably the way to describe it would be to think about it by product category, right. So in product categories that are mature I think it\u2019s much more, it\u2019s going to be in and we\u2019re experiencing it is more important that we have the track records and that\u2019s because easy to people slot you into a competitive universe and for that they will want or they do want a track record of the certain duration and asset levels of certain size.","You\u2019re absolutely right, there are places where we believe that because it\u2019s either a relatively new product area or because the offering is so different and compelling and the institutional track record is so strong and I do think those are slightly different. But the institutional track record is so compelling so strong that we have the opportunity to work with folks to get the products into especially in the model portfolio kinds of places where people are looking for additional diversifying return streams and we can bring them to them. This is much more like an institutional sale. And we are absolutely experiencing that and we\u2019re experiencing that across channel. So within the wires but even in the DC channel which is the place that hasn\u2019t been historically area of particular strength for us we\u2019re having some very good conversations to bring especially sort of new diversifying return streams to people.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank","Nate maybe on the U.S. distribution side, Nate if you want to maybe talk a little bit about -- a little bit more in depth on the U.S. retail distribution in terms of where you've seen the outflows, you mentioned a little bit on the sales force side, wirehouse, the RA segment. The defined contribution investment, where have you seen the outflows coming more recently and then what have you missed within that U.S. mix, would you missed optimistic about turning around over the next few quarters?","Nate Dalton","","Got it, so, first, I think if I were going to call out a trend to focus on, it is that product trend which is the U.S. equity area within U.S. retail distribution. If you don't look at channels within that, our experience has been more wires and IRAs, but I want to caveat but that's our experience, that's also I think as much a function of those happen to be places where we have had -- where we have the most assets right. So making much more of an AMG specific comment there than something that has broadened our capability, so for us it has been both from a broker-dealer side and in the RAs and those again in large parts those were the places where our assets are. In terms of the thing that I think changed the flow pattern for us in U.S. equity, I think it's going to be probably a couple of things right, so first, performances going to be of course a part of that right. So relative performance no question that will absolutely be a part of it. The other thing I'd remind people and this is a Yacktman specific question -- comment or that would apply in few other places is, we do have products like Yacktman which have been outflows, so while part of the outflows are certainly performance part of the outflows are certainly product category has been out of favor in a difficult place, part of there is also the products are soft closed and so the gross sales number it just can't be there. ","The reason those products are closed just to remind everybody is not because of capacity, the reason those products are closed is, they have high cash levels although they have been declining, but they have high cash level given the opportunities that they see to put assets to work and so the soft closed products those projects will reopen and so the things so I think it's a combination of things, it's certainly performance I think it will product like there is and there are others like there is reopening to opportunities when they see only few of the opportunities I think those are the things. And then I'll say one last thing which is and we mentioned it before is additional U.S. equity products coming online and we mentioned SouthernSun earlier, River Road as well earlier and so it's from existing affiliate but also a new affiliate with very attractive U.S. equity products come online. ","Sean Healey ","","I think it's worth stepping back also, because we've had a couple of questions focusing on a relatively small part of our business and where there's apparent visibility on a part of the products that meaning a lot of our U.S. retail is less visible and harder to gauge trends, but the important point is really the to underscore the degree to which we're primarily a global institutional asset management company. This quarter we haven't talked about it, but this quarter our active equity and alternative flows were so part is I can tell with maybe one or two exceptions far ahead of the industry average -- far ahead of any of our or virtually any of our public company competitors. And I think on a gross inflow basis Nate this was this was one of our stronger quarters and in several years. Even in the midst of the period of market volatility. So the point to emphasize that I'm trying to emphasize here is that, while a piece of our business where we see substantial forward opportunity in the coming years is worth understanding the biggest part of the business which obviously has more than offset any outflows that we might have in U.S. retail products is the global institutional opportunity whereas you've heard I say we think we have a very strong position doing much better than the industry and where we see ongoing strong opportunities for growth.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank","","Yes and that actually could leave one of my question Sean I was going to say the -- you seem to be doing very well in active versus passive trend as you have led in terms of more allocation to the boutique where that trend is hurting other managers, so you can answer two questions within one. And maybe just switching over to Jay on the guidance the bottom and the top of the range for 2015 is I've seen the 5% performance fees and 10% contribution performance fees, Jay can you talk about the performance you have implied in October for the firm and then the range for 2015 in terms of your net flow assumptions on the high end and low end?","Jay Horgen","","So, I think the Brian, the comment to both as we don't go to that level of details, it is assumed in our guidance range, it's the purpose of giving guidance. I made this comment earlier but I will talk about performance fees first here and then we can talk about flows of that, with respect to performance fees, we have seen historically that our range has been about 5% to 10% and that we feel comfortable with that range because of the diversity of the performance fees in terms of both strategies that underlay that performance fees and obviously there is a lots of different strategy and lots of different products more than half of our Affiliates have performance fee opportunity. As well as the underlying contracts because they all have different ways to express those performance fees some of them are absolute returns, some of them are relative return et cetera. So we are in a unique position given AMG\u2019s Affiliate model and the ability and to have the diversity that we do across all this difference performance fees streams that when you stress test that or look at in different ways you can see how the 5% to 10% is a pretty estimate. Now one of the interesting things of our performance fees is they can never go below zero and so in good years like last year you can go well above 10%. And what we\u2019re doing in this October November I guess call is really give you a sense for where we are today because ultimately we only express performance fees when crystallize and we seeing 10 months of performance. It doesn\u2019t mean that we can plan that exactly because we still have two more months to go but we do have sense for volatility around where we see group and not realize is not a number we report but we get a sense for that, so that\u2019s really that was informs our decision to narrow the range the way we did.","As it relates to flows on a 2015 basis and really close generally, we obviously reflect on our historical performance but we wanted to be conservative I think Michael came earlier and asked the level of conservativeness I think we do have a an ounce of conservatism across all these different assumptions and there you assume you\u2019ll being relatively conservative and how we think about flows but we don\u2019t give a flow estimate.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Lee - KBW ","Most of my questions have been asked but one I did have was I guess capital management related and specifically talked a little about seed capital is a sense meaning past you guys really haven\u2019t had to put up too much in terms of seed or commitment or I guess most of the Affiliates have funded that on their own but as you look to expand into retail or sometime seed capital and new products financing have gone up over the years and as I mean could you just talk about how that\u2019s evolving do you see that could be an incremental use of capital of compare to the past coming years just as you deepen week health penetration roll out new alternative strategy across different Affiliates just your any thoughts there.","Sean Healey ","Nate, why don\u2019t you talk in about product development broadly and then we can.","Nate Dalton ","Sure for us seed capitals and the way we think about it integral part of the way we work with Affiliates and product developed and as you observed I think the work we do at Affiliates and product development that\u2019s increasing over this years and so that coming from a places which is working we have a feedback to look now but we didn\u2019t have several years ago which is the feedback from all of these distribution professional is working closely with these large pools of capital. We are able to bring all that information back into our dialogue Affiliates are beginning to work within that all the way as early as that level which is for a conception but we\u2019re working with our Affiliates where we see demand where they see demand where obviously they think they\u2019ll be excellent and then working with them in patching as part of that conversation is of course other things we can do to help them if the product needs a level of capital either doing it as AMG or doing it in partnership with helping them get those first seat investors from among the institutional relationships that we\u2019ve build round the world and so we\u2019ve been doing more and more of that as another part of our work Affiliates and product development that does include more work with them in seed capital. ","Sean Healey ","I have a point add, I hear people talk about seed capital and seed capability. Frankly in many cases it comes as a response to net outflows, to pour performance and organic growth where it\u2019s sort of don\u2019t worry it will somehow change because we\u2019ll throw some money at it our experience is done it of course supporting Affiliates and Affiliates some cells are investing in new products, which is incredibly important. But it just want component and at the end it\u2019s the most important measure is of course what\u2019s the actual level of organic growth what\u2019s the consistency of the organic growth what\u2019s the diversity of the products set in for us all of our virtually all of our flows are in active equities and alternatives and the industry flows virtually all of what the public the company periods are reporting are in passive products or fixed income, very few firms have positive flow and after back equities and alternative. So we see the continued development of products and there continued growth as part of something that\u2019s a long-term story and clearly working and continuing to work going forward. The other point I would make which is unique for AMG is that we have this feedback little bit Nate describe where we have real insight from our distribution platform about where forward client demand is in terms of specific types of products. And through our new investment strategy, we\u2019re able to find firms or focus more on firms which have products where we see substantial future client demand and when we\u2019re investing in a new Affiliate and if you will sort of acquiring that exposure by definition instead of set investing new product which will have to incubate mature and we\u2019re not sure it's going to work, when we invest new Affiliates, we know by definition that it's a very successful product, that it's readily saleable immediately. And of course if we\u2019re focused on it in this regard it\u2019s got substantial capacity. And so, that really is a very unique and important way that AMG offers product development and our distribution relationships increasingly with the largest clients and their advisors actually focus on asking us for insights and opportunities to get exposure to broader more diverse clients that products had.","Operator"," ","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Greggory Warren with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","Greggory Warren - Morningstar ","","Yeah, good morning guys. Just real quick, I don\u2019t think you mentioned directly, but I sort of did the math on the Veritas field, it looks like when you brought in it had about 17.5 billion and the assets at the end of September, I just want to clarify on that and also just sort of your feel on how flows are looking for that particular business and more exposed sort of the Asia Pacific region?","Jay Horgen "," ","Yes, so, you\u2019re right pro forma it was 16, 17 and I think I have on table shows just around 599.5, so that is the math and you\u2019re correct about that, I don\u2019t know maybe want to comment. I would say that at the Asia products were relatively small, it's more global equities exposure but they are meaningful as products. The firm is actually having very good year in terms of organic growth, I mean there like other fully is focused on measured growth and building and enduring franchise, but now we feel very good about near and long-term prospect for organic.","Greggory Warren - Morningstar "," ","Okay, good. And then I am not sure if anybody asked this or not, didn\u2019t speak out, but on the institutional flows, could you point to it was stronger than what I was expecting for Q3, really sort of point out certain field where the products that we\u2019re working where we actually picked up things and whether I expect continue?","Sean Healey ","So, I think, so the post this past quarter if I were going to characterize anything, I\u2019d say stronger alternative. So more in alternative institutional flows. We have a very strong pipeline. It is lumpy. But, we look ahead.

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Selene Oh, Vice President, Investor Relations for AMG. Thank you. You may begin.","Selene Oh - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Thank you for joining AMG to discuss the results for the second quarter of 2017. In this conference call, certain matters discussed will constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected due to a number of factors including, but not limited to, those referenced in the company's Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the call.","AMG will provide on the Investor Relations section of its website at www.amg.com, a replay of the call and a copy of our announcement of our results for the quarter, as well as a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of any estimates of the company's economic earnings per share for future periods that are announced on this call.","With us on the line to discuss the company's results for the quarter are Sean Healey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Nate Dalton, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Jay Horgen, Chief Financial Officer.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Sean Healey.","Sean M. Healey - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Thanks, Selene, and good morning, everyone. AMG reported strong results for the second quarter, including economic earnings per share of $3.33 and record assets under management of $772 billion, a 19% increase over the year-ago quarter.","Our results reflect ongoing momentum across all aspects of our business, including the continued excellent investment performance of our Affiliates, positive organic growth from net flows, and the impact of new Affiliate partnership.","During the quarter, our Affiliates generated positive net client cash flows of $1.8 billion, with strong new business momentum across a broad array of global equity and alternative strategies partially offset by net outflows in U.S. equity.","Looking ahead, we see increasing demand for our global and emerging market equity product, as well as for our diverse set of alternative strategies. Our track record of positive organic growth for each of the past five years reflects the consistently strong investment performance generated by our Affiliates across a wide range of attractive alpha-oriented product area.","Against the backdrop of rising global equity markets, our long-only equity Affiliates continue to generate excellent investment performance, especially in global and emerging market equities. Given improving underlying fundamentals in many non-U.S. markets, we see ongoing opportunities for growth in these product areas.","Separately, while returns of most alternative strategies in the industry did not match the recent gains in the equity market, as Nate will describe, across a broad set of alternative products, our Affiliates continue to generate strong performance in their respective strategies.","Focusing on alternatives for a moment, we believe that AMG's wide array of liquid and illiquid alternative strategies, many of which are uncorrelated with equity markets, both enhances the balance and stability of AMG's earnings stream, while also positioning us ahead of strong and enduring client demand trend.","Clients recognize the competitive advantages that focus boutique managers have in generating excess return, especially in alternative strategies, but are also increasingly concentrating their alpha-oriented relationships with the more limited number of managers offering the highest quality specialized products.","With one of the largest and most diverse sets of alternative product in the industry, managed by leading Affiliates such as AQR, ValueAct, BlueMountain, Winton, Capula, Pantheon, EIG, and Baring Private Equity Asia; AMG is well-positioned to continue to generate strong organic growth from our liquid and illiquid alternative products.","AMG's global distribution strategy provides global investors with access to best-in-class boutique firms and alpha-oriented product areas with attractive secular growth opportunities, combined with the scale, resources and risk management of a global asset management partner with end market client service and a single point of contact.","Our strategy allows us to leverage our scale on behalf of Affiliates in areas where scale is a benefit, but importantly, AMG's partnership approach protects the unique investment culture of each Affiliate and the close alignment of client interests.","We believe that this combination of scale and breadth of products, together with excellent alpha generation by focused specialist managers offers unique advantages. Together with our Affiliates, we are increasingly building strategic relationships spanning multiple Affiliates and asset classes. With the largest institutional clients and intermediaries around the world, and we believe that represents a tremendous opportunity for future growth.","Finally, given the growing scale of our business, our strong recurring free cash flow is an increasing source of shareholder value. We continue to have an outstanding opportunity to add excellent new Affiliates, further enhancing the diversity of our Affiliate group and product offering. With our unmatched competitive position and track record as the partner of choice to leading boutique firms over the past 2.5 decades, we're confident in our ability to execute on our substantial forward opportunity set and generate meaningful incremental earnings growth through accretive new Affiliate investment.","In addition, we remain committed to consistently returning capital to our shareholders through our quarterly cash dividend, which we initiated earlier in the year, as well as through share repurchases. Looking ahead, we are well-positioned to continue to enhance the scale, diversity and earnings power of our business, and build long-term shareholder value.","With that, I'll turn it to, Nate to discuss our Affiliates results in more detail.","Nathaniel Dalton - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Thanks, and good morning, everyone. As Sean said, we generated good organic growth in the second quarter, and our Affiliates continue to extend their excellent investment performance and track record across a broad range of alternative and traditional active equity products, especially in global and emerging markets.","I'll cover our performance in more detail in a moment, but first, let me review a couple of themes in the quarter that we believe will continue to endure. First, alternatives continue to experience very good demand and sales activity across the most strategies and client types.","Second, within traditional active equity category, we see continued demand for global, international and emerging market equity strategies offset by ongoing weakness in U.S. equities. Obviously, these trends align very well with our overall strategic positioning and focus.","Now, in general, we were pleased with our net client cash flows for the quarter, despite a handful of items I'll highlight in a bit that masked even better underlying flow trend. Looking ahead, we see the potential for significant future organic growth across our business, given the combination of our strategic positioning, and the strength of our Affiliates track record in these areas.","Now, turning to the details for the quarter. As a reminder, our product categories include alternatives; global equities, including both developed and emerging markets; U.S. equities; and multi-asset and other strategies. In addition, we'll continue to discuss our alternative products at the sub-category level to dimension underlying return and flow dynamics that are lost at the aggregate level.","Now, starting with our alternative strategies, which account for 38% of our business by asset; within private equity and real assets, our Affiliates, including Baring Asia, EIG and Pantheon continue to maintain good long-term track records across their flagship offering.","As we enter a significant capital raising cycle starting in the third quarter, these historical investment returns combined with very strong underlying demand from many of their strategies will drive organic growth for these firms for the coming quarter. In addition, these firms are working to enhance and broaden their product set, which over time will produce additional significant growth opportunities.","Now, on fixed income and equity relative value, major indices posted positive returns in the quarter as indicated by the HFRI Relative Value Index with a 0.5% return, the HFRI Equity Hedge Index with a 2.1% return, and the HFRI Event-Driven Activist Index with a 2.6% return.","Performance across our Affiliates was generally good on an absolute basis, but a bit more mixed on a relative basis. Our largest products in this area, including the AQR, BlueMountain, Capula and ValueAct continue to maintain excellent longer-term relative performance record.","Within our multi-strategy and other category, most indices were slightly positive for the quarter as indicated by the HFRI Fund Weighted Composite return of 1.1%. Against that backdrop, most of our Affiliate strategies generated good absolute and relative returns in the quarter. The majority of AQR's and all of First Quadrant's largest strategies in the category, including multi-asset dial (09:49) premia, tactical currency and risk parity strategies produced solid positive returns benefiting from continued broad portfolio positioning in the quarter.","In our systematic diversified category, the SocGen Trend Index fell by 5% as mostly flat to positive performance across the industry turned negative for the quarter as trends reversed in the last week of June. Against that backdrop, each of our largest systematic diversified strategies outperformed the index, albeit posting negative absolute returns for the quarter. In addition, our Affiliates have a number of other diversifying strategies within the category that performed very well and are beginning to gain traction.","Turning to flows in our alternatives category in the quarter, we continue to produce good organic growth with $4.8 billion in net inflows. This was supported by a pickup in institutional sales and continued solid retail sales.","Looking at the quarter on a subcategory basis, we saw good flows in both the fixed income and equity relative value as well as the multi-strategy and other subcategories, notwithstanding the meaningful return of capital by ValueAct in the period.","Net flows across our private equity and more illiquid product set were only slightly positive in the quarter, but as I mentioned earlier, we are entering a period of more meaningful fundraising across this product set starting in the third quarter of this year.","Finally, we had a challenging net flow quarter in the systematic diversified subcategory, as weak performance against strong traditional market betas in recent quarters resulted in some net redemption activity.","That said, sophisticated institutional and retail platform investors continue to believe these returns seem to represent an important, diversifying allocation in portfolios as they provide uncorrelated return, and they have the potential to perform very well in a strongly negative trending market.","Moving to our global equities category, which accounts for approximately 35% of our business by asset, it was a strong quarter for global developed markets with the MSCI World Index returning 4.2%. Our Affiliates generated excellent results in the quarter as well with the flagship strategies from AQR, Harding Loevner, TimesSquare, Trilogy, Tweedy, Browne and Veritas all outperforming the benchmarks.","Emerging market indices also posted strong returns with the benchmark MSCI Emerging Markets Index up 6.4% in the quarter. Among our Affiliates, the flagship products at AQR, Harding Loevner and Trilogy outpaced the index, but Genesis lagged for the quarter, but still maintains a very good long-term track record.","Turning to flows within global equities, we had $200 million in net inflows as sales activity improved across each of our client types. Looking ahead, AMG's largest Affiliates; AQR, Artemis, Genesis, Harding Loevner, Tweedy, Browne and Veritas, all continue to maintain excellent long-term track records. In addition, a number of other Affiliates have been building their global investment capabilities with excellent products that are gaining traction.","Turning next to U.S. equities, which accounts for 14% of our business by assets, market performance was positive and large cap and growth stocks continue to outpace small and value stock.","For the quarter, the S&P 500 returned 3.1%, while the Russell 2000 Index returned 2.5%. Our performance was particularly strong in less efficient areas of the market, such as small cap, an area where several of our Affiliates, including GW&K, River Road and TimesSquare all outperformed.","On the large cap side, Yacktman's flagship underperformed last quarter but has an outstanding long-term track record. Within U.S. equities, we saw $3.2 billion in net outflows, in line with industry-wide trends, but overall, even including a significant one-off institutional redemption, we saw continued improvement relative to recent quarters.","While there's a continued move towards formulaic exposures for the U.S. equity portion of portfolios, we believe true alpha-oriented U.S. equity managers will continue to produce excess return, which in turn will drive client demand, especially following the next period of significant volatility.","Finally, turning to our multi-asset and other category, which accounts for 13% of our business by assets and encompasses multi-asset and balanced mandates in our wealth management Affiliates, as well as a number of specialty fixed income and multi-asset products.","In the category, we produced net inflows of $55 million, and we continue to see good sales activity, especially for high net worth investors. Performance from most of the products in this category remained good versus our peers, and the customized portfolios of wealth management Affiliates continue to gain traction among a very diverse set of ultra-high net worth clients.","Now, while the broader investment management landscape faces a number of challenges, we believe that the business we have built is very well-positioned. Together with our Affiliates, we are one of the largest providers of alpha-oriented alternative and active global and emerging markets equity strategies in the world.","The combination of focused excellence by our Affiliates, and the scope and scale of a global asset manager provides us with a number of significant opportunities to continue to improve how we together meet the evolving needs of clients. As we do that, we will continue to both enhance our position as the partner of choice to the best boutiques in the world, and drive significant organic growth across our Affiliate group.","With that, I'll turn it to Jay to discuss our financials.","Jay C. Horgen - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Thank you, Nate. As Sean discussed, our second quarter results reflect a substantial increase in the earnings power of our business as we ended the quarter with record assets under management of $772 billion, reflecting strong organic growth from positive net client cash flows and markets as well as the impact of our 2016 new investment.","As you saw in the release, we reported economic earnings per share of $3.33 for the second quarter, which included net performance fees of $0.13. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $2.22.","Turning to our performance metrics, for the second quarter, aggregate revenue, which is the sum of our GAAP revenue and our equity method revenue, grew 23% to $1.2 billion from a year ago, driven primarily by strong markets and organic growth in alternatives, together with the full effect of our 2016 new investment.","The ratio of aggregate revenue to average assets under management increased year-over-year from 62 basis points to 64 basis points, reflecting slightly higher performance fees. Excluding performance fees, we also saw a modest increase in the ratio as our mix shifted to higher fee alternative products from net flows and the addition of new investment.","Adjusted EBITDA grew 16% to $254.8 million from a year ago, reflecting the mix between consolidated and equity method Affiliates. Economic net income grew 13% to $188.7 million from a year ago, reflecting strong growth in adjusted EBITDA offset by higher cash tax rate in the quarter. Finally, economic earnings per share increased to $3.33 from $3.07 from a year ago, which includes a modest increase in share count.","Turning to more specific modeling items for the second quarter; the ratio of adjusted EBITDA to average assets under management was 13.3 basis points or 12.6 basis points excluding performance fee. In the third quarter, we expect this ratio to be approximately 12.7 basis points, reflecting a more modest level of performance fees in the range of $0.01 to $0.03 per share, which is typical in the third quarter.","With regard to our taxes, our effective GAAP tax rate was 32.5%, and our cash tax rate was 22.2% in the second quarter. Going forward, for modeling purposes, we expect our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 33%, and our cash tax rate to be approximately 21%. Intangible related deferred taxes for the second quarter were $19.1 million. In the third quarter, we expect this number to increase to $21 million.","Our share of reported amortization for the second quarter was $40.9 million, which includes $24 million of amortization from Affiliates accounted for under the equity method. For the third quarter, we expect our share of amortization to remain at approximately $41 million. Our share of interest expense for the second quarter was $22.4 million.","In the third quarter, we expect our share of interest expense to decrease to approximately $21 million, which reflects the retirement of our senior bond in August. Other economic items for the second quarter were $2.4 million. For modeling purposes, we expect other economic items to be approximately $1 million per quarter. Our adjusted weighted average share count for the quarter was 56.5 million, and we expect it to be 56.4 million for the third quarter, reflecting the full impact of our Q2 share repurchases.","Finally, turning to our balance sheet. Reflecting the scale and diversity of our business, we were upgraded by S&P in June and are now rated A3\/A-. In the second quarter, we also paid a cash dividend of $0.20 per share, and repurchased $120 million in shares to bring our total to $200 million in the first half of 2017.","Looking forward to the second half of the year, we will retire our $200 million senior bond in August, which will be accretive to earnings given its relatively high cost, and also anticipate additional share repurchases of up to $100 million by year-end.","With record assets under management of $772 billion, together with the increased earnings power of our business of approximately $1.2 billion in run rate EBITDA, we are well-positioned to generate substantial shareholder value through the execution of our growth strategy, and the consistent return of capital to shareholders in the future.","Now we'll be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Hey, guys. Good morning.","Sean M. Healey - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So Jay, maybe a couple of questions, just around the P&L dynamics this quarter. I guess, if we look at the operating income on a four-year consolidated Affiliates, you guys are putting up revenues up slightly, but expense is essentially flat. A little, I guess, inconsistent with what we've seen previously, so just maybe some color on what's going on there would be helpful.","Jay C. Horgen - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Yeah, well, obviously you know, Alex, that quite a bit of our operating income comes from income from equity method. So that will not be included in the revenue line. But when you look at it on an aggregate basis, both GAAP revenue and equity method revenue, you'll see, increase is about 23%. So about 7% comes from GAAP and something much higher than that comes from every method that makes this 23%, translating into an EBITDA growth rate of about 16%.","As it relates to operating expenses, most of those operating expenses are for the account of our Affiliates, you'll see a slight decrease in the SG&A line, mainly because of FX at our non-U.S. Affiliates, again that's for their account. We've done a pretty good job here at the holding company, holding our expenses constant year-over-year, so really, we're experiencing some margin albeit small as it relates to AMG. And so when you look at it on an EBITDA basis, which is really our top line, you see quite a bit of growth.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, guys. Just wanted to get an update \u2013 just given that you've been active on the buyback front, and then, you're paying down some of the debt, just on the opportunity for additional managers out there, and maybe just the environment, what you're seeing, given maybe where market levels are, kind of some of the shifting trends in the industry, increasing regulation, how do you kind of see that outlook playing out over the next couple years?","Sean M. Healey - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Sure. Well, we continue to have an excellent pipeline as we indicated. I would say that, given the phenomenon which continues, I think, driven as much by uncertainty in macroeconomic and geopolitical environment of the highest quality boutiques being relatively less active, and so, as you think about that in the short-term, it means that our deal activity this year is going to be more back-end loaded, and even into next year. But with the medium to long-term, our opportunity to build and diversify our business through investments and additional Affiliates is just tremendous.","Even in a period which is, I should say, a matter of months at this point, where we're announcing fewer transactions, we're continuing to build relationships with some amazing firms, and given the inevitability of demographics, it's just a question of when, not if we proceed with investments in the set of outstanding boutique firms with whom we build relationships.","And our competitive position is better than ever as scale, stability, especially permanence relative to private equity vehicles, and the real strategic capabilities we offer become even more important. So we remain extraordinarily optimistic about the contribution from new investments.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Hi. Maybe a question for Nate. Is it possible to kind of, with the fundraising cycle I guess you're entering this quarter with a bunch of your Affiliates, is it possible to kind of scale that in the aggregate and kind of what your current thoughts are about fundraising, and then should we think of this as kind of an 18-month kind of cycle? And then maybe, on the flipside, were there noticeable realizations from some of these kind of noticeable in your flows this quarter or maybe year-to-date?","Nathaniel Dalton - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Okay. Yeah, so let me take that in a little bit of reverse order. So I think, as it relates specifically to this quarter, I don't think there was anything I'd sort of call out from either a honestly specifically fundraising or realization standpoint on what we've thought about as sort of the illiquid book.","And so, then maybe then moving to the bulk of your question, and what I'll do is, I'll answer it in terms of the pipeline overall, including the illiquids, and I think that's an important way to think about it, and you'll understand it as I go through this.","So if you think of the pipeline overall, we feel really good about the activity levels, and it's mostly consistent with the underlying trends we've talked about, often global. And there's a little bit of overlap in the way I'm describing that between illiquids and which I'll come back to. But even outside of the illiquids, the number of searches, RFPs kind of consistent with history, and all that. But the thing that's really interesting about the pipeline right now is the magnitude of some of the pieces of business, sort of in the late phase of that pipeline.","It's not really just one thing; it's sort of a pretty couple of handfuls of things across Affiliates, across geographies, across client type. And so, while we always talk about the kind of inherent lumpiness of the institutional business, there's really some very large piece of business in the pipeline, and some of that speaks to the scale and breadth of the largest Affiliates, and their capabilities, some of it speaks a little bit to some of the strategic conversations that you've heard Sean reference in the prepared remarks.","And it also supports and points to, we think, a little bit this idea that people are kind of consolidating relationships. So some of these may include illiquid and liquid, also for example are illiquid in the global equity piece. So it's really some of that kind of good broadening out that we've been talking about.","Now, so specifically on the illiquid side, as we've started mentioning a couple quarters ago, in the third quarter, we're entering this, what we've talked about as a significant cycle of fundraising in the number of flagship products, as well as obviously some newer products seem to be \u2013 that are coming to market at roughly the same time.","And then, in terms of dimensioning it, what I'd say is, we feel really good about and delivering on, yeah, we've sort of talked about a $10 billion net number over this next kind of, 12-plus months, here. But I would say, if anything, it's feeling good about that, and maybe a little of upward bias to it. But then the reason I'm sort of pushing on this idea of whether we should talk about it as a cycle or not is, it's sort of feeling that way going into it, but we're also starting to get visibility beyond kind of that end that we put into when we were saying 12 to 18 months.","So as more products; both as products are building and then as people are building capabilities, and as people are building their separately managed account capabilities in some cases into these broader relationships we're talking about, it kind of feels like a cycle going in, but it may \u2013 we don't think that's really the right way to think about it in terms of the back-end, we only (27:15) think it continue.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Nathaniel Dalton - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","So in 2Q results, for a lot of your peers, we learned that a lot of them were forced to spend more, really investing in areas like technology. How is AMG impacted by this trend as a lot of the raised costs at your Affiliates may not be passed back to AMG due to the rev share structure? But is AMG also working on some centralized initiatives at the holding company that it can actually scale across the Affiliates?","Sean M. Healey - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Well, we've made material investments in global distribution and compliance, really since the financial crisis; and that continues, but not in a way, I would say, that is fundamentally different now.","Indeed, we believe that our scale in both of these areas is a strength, and at this point, Nate and I both have mentioned the increasing opportunities we see with the largest global institutional clients and intermediaries, and the way in which we're building relationships and increasingly seeing traction from those relationships.","Across the industry, there are obviously areas which are more process-oriented, which are more impacted by these issues. We have a predominately institutional business, where the clear distinguishing competitive advantage is around alpha generation in these specialized strategies. And that's the clear focus. So we of course continue, as our Affiliates do, to invest in the business, but the focus is on leveraging the outstanding alpha generation across specialized products and leading with that as opposed to some of the considerations that perhaps peer companies are talking about.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Good morning. I guess, Jay, if you could kind of update us on your outlook, and kind of midway through the year, I know that you're only doing guidance annually, but maybe talk about some of the broader assumptions versus the actuals through the first half of the year, and then think about performance fees at this point in the year, and looking towards, obviously fourth quarter being the big component of that.","Jay C. Horgen - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Yeah, thanks, Dan. So I guess, first just starting from the press release, you can see we began the third quarter at $772 billion, and that was a record. We actually kind of had momentum all the way through to the end. Our average AUM for the quarter was only $764 billion, so we were already a spot rate up, about 1%, as we ended the quarter, which is a carryforward. And then since that time, so far in the third quarter we're up another 1.5%, so bringing our year-to-date market blend to a little over 8%.","So in addition to that carryforward in the quarter and another 1.5%, and as you know, our model convention is 2% for a quarter, so we're experiencing higher market levels through July than our convention. And I think most people are tracking that.","The other two main assumptions that impact 2017's economic earnings per share are performance fees and capital, capital deployment. And as you had mentioned, the majority of our performance fees crystallize in the fourth quarter, just noting that year-to-date we've had $0.31 of performance fees, but the majority is still crystallize in the fourth quarter.","It's still early I think, it's still only July, but you can see from our AUM table under market changes for alternative managers that in total the combined mix of our alternative products have posted kind of more modest returns year-to-date. But when you look at it more granularly, which Nate did, it's really, most of our alternative categories are experiencing positive performance with just the systematic diversified category being down, so that's kind of a mix issue. And as you also heard from Nate, we continue to see strong performance across a number of our products, especially in the relative value and multi-strat categories. Again, just still early to predict.","On capital deployment, consistent with our expectations for the first half of the year, we did repurchase $200 million. As we've told people, we are going to retire $200 million of our senior bonds, that'll be accretive $0.05 this year. It's more of a $0.14 run rate accretion for next year. We anticipate repurchasing another $100 million, as you heard me say in the prepared remarks, by year-end. Given that timing, it will only have a modest impact on 2017, but it's probably worth a couple of pennies.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks very much for taking the question. Good morning, everybody. Just coming back to capital management for a moment, I guess I'm a little surprised not to see a little bit more of a buyback given what sounds like a bit of a push-out on deal activity.","And then within the deal activity, I was just a little bit curious, Sean, a number of your peers are talking about the fact that companies of the sort of $10 billion to $30 billion of size are losing traction in a post-deal (32:54) world, sort of more consolidated world. Does that shift your focus from an acquisition strategy a little bit more tilted towards alts? Sort of curious your latest thinking on that. Thank you.","Sean M. Healey - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","I'll start with the second part of your question, which is \u2013 and I'm not sure what context you're referring to. I think we see outstanding boutique firms in \u2013 certainly in the alternative category, but also more broadly across long-only equity categories, especially global and emerging market equities.","And so for us it is really all about finding complete firms with outstanding track records of alpha generation. And we absolutely believed and we see and happily have partnered with a number of firms in the size range you describe which have an enduring opportunity to generate organic growth and create additional franchise value. So we feel very good about that. The very short-term opportunity set and the cycles around that I think is something we've seen before and says really nothing about the tremendous medium to long-term opportunity.","And with respect to capital deployment, as we've said, we see all elements given our scale today, coming into play. And you've seen that \u2013 if you look over any rolling period over the last five years really, you see substantial new investment activity, return of capital through share repurchase and now a dividend. And obviously, to the extent we have additional opportunities as Jay described to pay down expensive debt, then we'll reduce leverage and build capacity for further future deployment.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, thanks. Good morning, folks. Nate, maybe just to circle back on some of the flow commentary, appreciate the $10 billion in net new investments. When you say net new capital raising, are you including realizations in that number? And then, if not, if you could just comment on sort of your view on realizations in the private equity firms? And then, you mentioned a return of capital from ValueAct; if you could size that and the large \u2013 I think, you cited a large redemption within institutional U.S. equities?","Nathaniel Dalton - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Okay. So, let me start with back one. I think we're not \u2013 of course, I think we're not going to be able to give you the precise amount. I think the two lumpy \u2013 or the two redemptions we talked about in the prepared remarks, both the ValueAct one and the other specific U.S. equity one, look, they definitely impacted it; but I think I'm not \u2013 there's not much more that we're going to say beyond that. I think moving to the $10 billion; that was a net number. So when we gave it, and until today, the color that I gave around feeling that there's actually kind of upside to it; that was a net number.","But I do want to reinforce the point, which is, it's really interesting how that number, how we're seeing really large opportunities, again, some of which actually incorporates some of those \u2013 what was in that $10 billion number plus other things. But it's \u2013 yeah it's the base business excluding that, if you were going to look at it that way. We feel good about the pipeline fee, really some significant opportunities in the near end of the pipeline.","And then, yes, that $10 billion was a net number; and then, as I said before, if anything, kind of an upward bias to that. And then also, the back end of it, feeling less \u2013 may feel like a little bit like a cycle going into it, but the back-end of it, it seems like it's really expanding as the number of the firms that have these type of products have also continued to extend their investment capabilities as well. And as well as not just investment capabilities, but also operational and distribution capabilities into new channels, and into new kind product packages, including separately managed accounts that will be more like evergreen.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. I was intrigued by the comments from both Sean and Nate around the broader strategic relationships and AMG helping their Affiliates. Maybe just dive into that a little bit more, and talk about AMG is assisting in those efforts for some of these broader mandates?","Sean M. Healey - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Well, I'll start and ask Nate to add further context. I can't give you, for obvious reasons, specific examples, but already, and then as you heard us say on an increasing basis going forward, we're seeing the benefits of large sophisticated global institutional clients who are wanting to have stronger relationships, a narrower set of relationships, while simultaneously appreciating the benefit for the alpha portion of their product allocations, the benefit of access to a broad range of specialty products, both long-only as well as alternative, and within alternative, of course, the more diverse, the better including liquid and illiquid. And that's \u2013 that I think is an enduring trend, and one that plays very much to the strength of our product set and the scale and diversity of our business. Do you want to add something to that, Nate?","Nathaniel Dalton - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Yeah, I agree with all of that. I think, if you sort of step back a little bit, and you've heard both of us talk about it before, we're at a place where you have a combination of many great asset managers, boutique asset managers \u2013 we talked a little bit in the prepared remarks about kind of focused excellence who are very, very good at a set of things. And then you combine that with \u2013 and many firms are excellent in packaging and distribution into one or more channels, and that's fantastic, but you package that, you combine that with the opportunity to partner with us, if they want, in accessing additional markets and additional channels.","And then, on the other side, the opportunity to go into channel partners, whether it's intermediaries, as Sean said, or whether it's large sophisticated end clients, institutional or retail, many of whom have global reach themselves. And to be able to have conversations which allow them to see how they can access all of that or much of that or some of that, depending on their needs, of that capability easily and then partner with us on the other side in terms of how they make sure they can get all those return streams into what it is they're trying to achieve for themselves or for their clients and then hopefully our shared clients.","Yeah, you put those together and then \u2013 and I think the other thing I'd add is that we do have a somewhat unique additional and increasingly recognized, from the client's perspective and I think the media's (40:40) perspective, a product development capability which is our continuing to add additional new Affiliates; and you've heard us talk about this in other settings as kind of that virtuous circle.","So bringing all of that to bear, and look, these are very long conversations; and almost partner-like conversation with the channel or with the end-users, and again, we've engaged in that for a while, and it's good to see some of those really gaining some traction.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Great. And thanks for taking my follow-up. I just wanted \u2013 a couple of questions actually on the high net worth business. I mean, it's been a pretty \u2013 or at least the channel it's been pretty consistent source of inflows, I'm just curious, if you can maybe break that down a little bit more, how much of that is being driven by your RIA Affiliates versus maybe how much of that is a reflection of demand for SMAs in bigger distribution channels; just trying to get a little more feel for that, and kind of how you think about its sustainability?","Nathaniel Dalton - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Okay. So I think it was \u2013 so I think you understand the channel exactly right, and I think it's been pretty consistent contributions from both. So if you sort of \u2013 as you saw, we had $800 million or so in net inflows, $4.3 billion (42:07) of gross sales, $3.5 billion (42:09) of redemption, a little bit underlying your question, I think this is now 14 straight positive quarters in a row for this channel.","And in the quarter, it was both wealth management Affiliates generating positive net flows; and second quarter is not a traditionally especially strong quarter there, but it was a fine quarter for us and there's (42:35) to be clear, there's a little bit of seasonality there in the second quarter.","And then SMA flows were also positive; and for us, that's coming through particularly in global equities and municipal bonds. And looking ahead, we think we have good momentum on both sides, I do think we see a good kind of, you call it sort of a tailwind or something, a good tailwind in the separately-managed account market on major platforms; and there should be opportunity for us to continue sort of both driving sort of the global and international equities as well as muni bonds, and then also maybe broadening that out, I would say, kind of as a medium-term thing, especially if we can figure out ways to bring some of the more specialty, including alternative products into some of those platforms.","Obviously, the muni bond market has its own very specific dynamic, and we're participating well there. So I think, that's where I'd say so, has been a strong, stable kind of contributor, and we see that continuing.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Bedell - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks for taking my follow-up also. Can you describe the $3.4 billion reduction in that high net worth channel (43:57) that's the transfer of assets from Forbes Family Trust to Wealth Partners Capital Group, can you describe exactly what's going on there?","Sean M. Healey - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Sure. In the quarter, we restructured our wealth management business in the following way. First, the $40 billion of scale boutique wealth management Affiliates remains with absolutely no change, but the team that was focused on building that business, some of which stayed with, but some went to start a new business that is focused on smaller wealth management firms with an underlying aggregation strategy. And I think there's every chance of success for that business, and by contributing our Forbes interest, we took back a minority interest in this new entity.","But the new entity, to be clear is independent, and really doing things that are less a fit with AMG's core business. I think, over time, we will absolutely make incremental investments in scale boutique wealth management firms, but at the moment, the pricing in the M&A environment strikes us as uneconomic, and in many cases driven by an influx of new competitors. And so, for the moment, we'll be happy to continue to work with our existing Affiliates and benefit from, as Nate said, their ongoing organic growth.","I just wanted to address the, the financial impact. So obviously it ran through our other AUM, because we contributed it; it's no longer an Affiliate. As it relates to the P&L, it had no material impact. In fact, the restructuring will add benefit to us in EBITDA over the next 12 months of $4 million just as we save some money, and contribute the business, so the net effect is actually positive to us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next follow-up comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","William Raymond Katz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks as well for taking the extra question. A number of your peers in the publicly-traded alternative manager space were also talking about this consolidation of strategic relationships among the bigger players, which I think, is the theme you've been mentioning as well, Sean. They also mentioned that, it is coming at a bit lower fee rate, but potential longer duration in terms of the opportunity set. Could you talk about the net economic impact to AMG among these relationships versus more standalone type of opportunity?","Sean M. Healey - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Well, it I'm sure runs the gamut. As I think about the forward opportunity set, it is absolutely net positive. These are, in the main, high fee products with \u2013 certainly for the broad illiquid category, locked up vehicles in many cases. And so, the overall contribution to our business is very positive. As Nate described, we see this as a long-term opportunity, and not one of short-term cyclicality. And that's based on the breadth of our business and our exposure across illiquid alternative, as well as the continuing product development and innovation across the various Affiliates who manage these products. Would you...?","Nathaniel Dalton - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Yeah. The only thing I'd add is, and this may be something that others are talking about as well, but the only other thing I'd add is, these relationships can also be quite helpful. They can be true partnerships and quite helpful and also working with us and Affiliates to extend their capabilities even further, right? So they're sort of a second derivative, which is it may be that it's duration. Duration and fees and use of capacity and all those things have to be part of the analysis as does the derivative, which is okay, and if you're going to be building things in the context of a relationship, what else can you do with the things that you're building.","So if a firm is a private equity firm and a relationship allows them to extend into infrastructure or real assets or something else, and then that can then become something that you go do other things. But so, the relationships can evolve into somewhat partnership-like where you can work together to continue to drive.","Sean M. Healey - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Yeah. And one other point which may be not clear from your question, the universe of \"alternative firms\" in the industry of course includes a range of firms with a range of capabilities. But I think if you step back and look at the breadth and depth and diversity of our overall product set, more than 550 products, even within the alternative category, a very large number of products in liquid and illiquid capabilities which we would put against literally anybody in the industry in terms of the quality and breadth of our alternative product set.","Operator","Thank you. Our next follow-up comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Just to follow up on the potential redemption trends within the systematic bucket of alternatives. We've seen the underperformance, and this year, as you kind of talked about, Nate, and it seems like it was a little more magnified towards the back half of 2Q. I guess as you kind of think about looking ahead, how are you thinking about the redemption trends within that kind of sub-bucket?","Nathaniel Dalton - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Okay. So maybe just to step back, and again, I was sort of reporting on the quarter, but look, I think when you look at the space, absolutely has been a challenging space lately, but there's very long-term data series supporting the strength of kind of trend-following strategies, and included in that are periods of drawdown as well.","But as we've said on other calls, I mean, look, they play a very important part in investor portfolios, very high-quality uncorrelated return, make it lower realized (50:43) when included within that portfolio context. And so, sophisticated investors obviously understand that. And they also are strategies we continue to like because they have really significant scalable capacity because they can invest in sort of almost \u2013 or you can think about them as investing in sort of all tradable asset classes.","And so, the opportunity to continue to develop new product as well has lots of long-term promise, and in fact I think we said this in our prepared remarks, you are actually seeing many of the firms with these capabilities among our Affiliates continuing to do product development, many of which are getting some traction, we saw some of that, a little bit in the last quarter, and we've already seen some of that this quarter so far.","And so, I think, while no question it's been a challenging phase, we feel like these are excellent right? We've invested in some just fantastic firms, great people running them, lots of opportunity to continue to take those uncorrelated return streams into both the existing sets of clients that they work with today, but also many, many both other both geographies and channels. Combine that with the product development capabilities, we feel good about the space.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line with Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Alexander Blostein - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. Again sorry, nitpicky follow-up. I guess, if I look at the retail channel, surprisingly weak given the positive data we've been able to see through some of the public channels both in the U.S. and the non-U.S. side of the mutual fund domain. Any particular outliers that drove the decline in the quarter either by kind of channel, geography or Affiliate level that drove the gap between the observable flows in the quarter versus the $0.4 billion outflows you reported?","Nathaniel Dalton - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Yeah, so let me take that. So again, and you understand it exactly right. So we did have net outflows; gross sales about $11.4 billion (52:45) and redemptions, about $11.9 billion (52:46). Despite the overall negative number, I think you're right, sort of overall retail trends I think for us were pretty stable. The way I'd describe the underlying trends would be sort of strong, good; alternative trends, good; global equity trend and offset by continued weakness in U.S. equities.","In terms of the quarter in particular, and apologize if this didn't come through as we did the description at a product level, but this is actually where some of those \u2013 there was a lumpy sub advisory outflow here, and then, also in addition to that, there were \u2013 this is the reason it's not published splitting (53:20) exactly to the publically available stuff. There were outflows within sub advisory offset by good non-U.S. if you're looking at the U.S. retail-only, so that was U.S. retail, negative sub advisory offset by good non-U.S., and within sub advisory, there was actually some breadth (53:42) U.S. equity and probably some of it was platform rebalancing.","When you turn \u2013 now turn to July, obviously now focusing on the things that are visible. If you look at July flows in the U.S., it's looking pretty good, I think it was $400 million (54:03) or something and change in the visible U.S., and then another $200 million (54:03) and something change in the visible non-U.S., so which is ahead of where we were last quarter. And so, again, just going by the stuff that's visible, quarter shaping up well, and kind of ahead of where we were last quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks. So just one follow-up modeling question here for Jay. The guidance, the $21 million interest expense in 3Q, does this include or exclude the imputed interest expense, and also what type of range of imputed interest expense are you guys looking for, for 3Q?","Jay C. Horgen - Affiliated Managers Group, Inc.","Yeah. So on imputed interest expense, it's only in the neighborhood of $1.5 million now because it's just on a recurring basis related to our convertible. It is on contingent payments that can come through, but we don't have any, really expected contingent payments in the future, so really it's just that $1.5 million. The $21 million is the interest expense for \u2013 on a cash basis, and we do see it coming down because of the high cost bond that we're retiring.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have come to the end of our time allowed for questions. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Healey for any final remarks.","Sean M.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Ally Lynn, Vice President of Investor Relation and Corporate Strategy for Affiliated Managers Group. Thank you. Ms. Lynn, you may begin.","Alexandra Lynn","Thank you for joining Affiliated Managers Group to discuss our results for the first quarter of 2013. In this conference call, certain matters discussed will constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those referenced in the company's Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the call.","AMG will provide on its website, at www.amg.com, a replay of the call and a copy of our announcement of the results for the quarter, as well as a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.","With us on the line to discuss the company's results for the quarter are Sean Healey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Nate Dalton, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Jay Horgen, Chief Financial Officer.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Sean Healey.","Sean M. Healey","Thanks, Ally, and good morning, everyone. AMG reported economic earnings per share of $2.27 for the first quarter of 2013, which is a 44% increase over the same period of 2012, while our assets under management, now $463 billion, grew by 27% during the same period.","Our results were driven by successful execution across all elements of our growth strategy, including outstanding organic growth, accretion from new affiliated investments and the ongoing strong business momentum of our existing Affiliates, including the excellent performance of our alternative managers, which continue to produce meaningful performance fees.","We generated a record $12 billion of net client cash flows in the first quarter, which was our 12th consecutive quarter of strong positive flows. Importantly, our flows were broadly distributed across our equity and alternative product set, and positive across all channels and client geographies including Asia, Australia, Europe, the Middle East and, of course, the U.S., reflecting the marketing efforts of our Affiliates as well as a material contribution from our global distribution platform. As Nate will describe in more detail, we're continuing to make strategic investments to build on the success of our global distribution strategy and further enhance the marketing reach of our Affiliates by expanding the breadth and depth of our capabilities with additional coverage and personnel in key markets around the world.","Our results reflect the ongoing success of our strategic focus on high-value added, alpha-generating products, including especially global and emerging market equities and alternatives. These are product areas in which boutique firms excel, and our boutique Affiliates are recognized worldwide as leaders in their respective disciplines, including Tweedy, Browne; Harding Loevner; Genesis and Artemis in global and emerging market equities; and Pantheon, ValueAct, BlueMountain and AQR across an array of alternative strategies, along with outstanding U.S. equity managers such as Yacktman and TimesSquare.","Our Affiliates continue to build on their exceptional, long-term track records of investment performance, and we're seeing strong demand from clients around the world for these differentiated value-added strategies as 2 key trends continue to unfold. The ongoing globalization of client portfolios and clients' increasing emphasis on alpha-generating strategies to complement passive beta. To the extent that there's a broader reallocation to risk-oriented products, including by U.S. retail and institutional clients -- which we see as just a question of when, not if -- this shift will generate strong incremental growth for AMG on top of the organic growth we're already generating.","Now turning to new investments. We continue to make progress toward adding new high-quality Affiliates. Over the past 20 years, we've established a unique partnership approach and an unparalleled track record in investing in boutique asset management firms. Through our calling effort, we've also built proprietary relationships with many of the best boutique firms around the world. We have a strong current pipeline of prospective Affiliates, and looking ahead, we're very confident in our ability to continue to create meaningful incremental shareholder value through accretive investments in new Affiliates.","With that, I'll turn it to Nate to discuss our Affiliates in further detail.","Nathaniel Dalton","Thanks, Sean. Good morning, everyone. We had another very strong quarter with record net flows. And as Sean said, these flows were broad-based across all 3 of our distribution channels and driven by a diverse set of our Affiliates. Our performance for the quarter reflects the overall strength and diversity of our Affiliates, the outstanding long-term performance track records they have generated, ongoing product innovation from a number of our Affiliates, and good execution by both our Affiliates and AMG's distribution team.","Starting with investment performance, where our Affiliates continue to build outstanding, long-term track records, in particular, in global and emerging market equities and alternatives. In the global developed markets category, highlights for the quarter included strong investment performance at AQR and Artemis. And while Tweedy, Browne and Harding Loevner had mixed performance for the quarter, most of their products remain well ahead of their benchmarks for the medium- and long-term periods. In the emerging markets category, most of our products had good performance in the quarter and track records for the trailing year and longer periods remain excellent. In fact, all of the products managed by Genesis, Harding Loevner and AQR are well ahead of their respective benchmarks for the quarter 1-, 3- and 5-year periods.","Turning to the alternatives product category. We had strong performance among a number of our largest product, including at AQR, BlueMountain and ValueAct. At BlueMountain, the outstanding performance continued across all products and funds, including the flagship Credit Alternative Fund, as well as the long\/short credit fund and the recently launched Credit Opportunities Fund.","At AQR, their largest alternative products, including some of their newer funds, such as Managed Futures and hedge fund beta, continue to build impressive track records over, now, multiyear periods. ValueAct also had another strong quarter and continued to deliver excellent returns.","Now I'd like to focus on performance fees generally for a moment. Given our broad array of performance fee opportunities, from both alternative and traditional products, in both fund vehicles and in separate accounts, we're able to generate consistent and meaningful performance fees. Some of the opportunities are correlated to the markets and each other, but many of them are not correlated to either broad markets or each other.","This quarter included an early realization of some performance fees, extending from both strong performance in the quarter and also because clients at several Affiliates changed products or share classes and revised their performance fee arrangements. These triggered performance fees in the quarter, most of which we had forecast to receive later in the year. As the performance fee opportunities among our Affiliates grow and diversify across products but also across different structures, and as our Affiliates continue to perform well, we believe that performance fees will continue to contribute in a consistent and meaningful way.","Now turning back to a review of investment performance and to our U.S. equity product. We had generally good relative and absolute performance for the quarter, with highlights being all the products at Yacktman and TimesSquare outperforming. Over the 1-year and longer-term periods, the vast majority of our U.S. equity products at Affiliates including Frontier; Tweedy, Browne; TimesSquare and Yacktman are well ahead of their benchmarks.","Now turning to flows for the quarter. As I said, we had another terrific quarter with $12 billion in positive net client cash flows. Now that headline number is a record for us. But as we emphasize on every call, flows in the institutional channel are inherently lumpy. That said, our flows have been consistently strong over the past 3 years, and we see this momentum continuing.","Turning to the channel review and starting with the institutional channel. We had positive flows of approximately $5.9 billion. These flows came mostly in global and emerging markets products and alternative strategies, with notable contributions from BlueMountain, Pantheon, AQR, Genesis and Harding Loevner. This was a quarter was a number of high-quality wins coming from leading institutions in the U.S., Europe, Australia, the Middle East and Asia.","Moving to the Mutual Fund channel. We had positive flows of $4.8 billion, continuing the momentum we've had over the past several quarters. From a product category standpoint, we had strong flows into global and alternative strategies as well as U.S. equities. The flows this quarter once again included very strong flows in the sub-advisory channel as well. We had a number of Affiliates make significant contributions to our flows in the Mutual Fund channel, including AQR; Artemis; Harding Loevner; Tweedy, Browne; Frontier and Yacktman.","In our High Net Worth channel, flows were about $1.3 billion for the quarter. The most significant contributors included GW&K, which continues to attract flows through their sales force, as well as through our U.S. retail distribution platform, with Harding Loevner and BlueMountain also making meaningful contributions.","Finally, turning to the continuing build-out of our global distribution platforms. We are very pleased by the success we've had over the last several years. As we've said on recent calls, and as you've seen through our new Z\u00fcrich office and recent German and Swiss hires, we continue to focus our efforts on deepening our regional coverage in Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Australia. Enhancing our coverage and expanding into new channels in the geographies we are already covering, remains a key part of our long-term vision for global distribution, as does expanding into new regions.","Now while we're very pleased with the successful execution of our global distribution strategy, we've been increasingly focused on building out our U.S. retail capabilities, and we see a number of areas where we can capitalize on the long-term growth opportunities in this channel as investors inevitably rerisk. Looking ahead, we believe we are still in the early days of executing on the opportunity to combine the distribution, scope and scale of a global asset management firm with our broad array of outstanding performance-oriented Affiliates. And we remain confident in our ability to continue to generate significant organic growth going forward.","With that, I'll turn to Jay to discuss the financials.","Jay C. Horgen","Thank you, Nate. As Sean and Nate discussed, we are pleased with our first quarter results, which reflect outstanding organic growth, as well as the strength and diversity of our Affiliates. As you saw on the release, we reported economic earnings per share of $2.27 for the first quarter. Net performance fees contributed $0.25, including approximately $0.03 that were expected in the first quarter with the remainder coming from the early realization of performance fees, most of which we expected to earn later in the year. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings of $1.15 for the quarter.","Now turning to more specific modeling items. The ratio of our EBITDA contribution to end-of-period assets under management was approximately 17.1 basis points in the first quarter, again reflecting performance fees earned in the quarter. We expect this ratio to return to approximately 15.8 basis points for the second quarter, and for the full year, we expect it to be approximately 16.3 basis points, which include a reasonable assumption for performance fees and organic growth.","Holding company expenses were approximately $23 million in the first quarter, and we expect them to be approximately $24 million for the second quarter. With regard to our taxes, our effective GAAP tax rate for the quarter was approximately 35% and our cash tax rate was 22%. For modeling purposes, we expect our GAAP tax rate to increase to approximately 36% and our cash tax rate to be approximately 25% for the second quarter.","Intangible-related deferred taxes for the first quarter were $12 million, and we expect this number to remain flat for the second quarter. Our share of reported amortization for the quarter was $28 million, and together with $10.4 million of amortization from Affiliates accounted for under the equity method, AMG's controlling interest portion of amortization was $38.4 million. We expect AMG's amortization to remain at approximately this level for the second quarter. Our interest expense for the first quarter was $38.4 million, including $14.2 million of pretax, noncash imputed interest expense. We expect our total interest expense to be approximately $30 million for the second quarter, including $6.4 million of pretax, noncash imputed interest expense.","Turning to our balance sheet. Today, we closed a new $1.25 billion, 5-year unsecured bank revolver. This new facility, which lowers our cost of funding and increases our capacity, extinguishes our existing term loan and provides AMG with over $1.1 billion of undrawn revolver capacity.","Now turning to guidance. We are raising our 2013 guidance as we expect economic earnings per share to be in the range of $8.80 to $9.60. Our guidance assumes our normal convention of actual market performance through yesterday for the current quarter and 2% quarterly market growth beginning in the third quarter. We also assume a weighted average share count of approximately $55 million for 2013.","The lower end of our 2013 guidance includes a modest, incremental contribution from performance fees and organic growth, while the upper end of the range assumes a more robust contribution from both performance fees and net client cash flows. As always, these assumptions do not include earnings from future new investments and are based on our current expectations of Affiliate growth rates, performance and the mix of Affiliate contribution to our earnings. Of course, substantial changes in markets and the earnings contribution of our Affiliates would impact these expectations.","Now, we will be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Kim from Sandler O'Neill.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","First, more broadly, can you just talk a little bit about sort of the outlook for allocation trends, maybe coming out of the quarter? I know you're less reliant on sort of prevailing patterns or trends. But do you get the sense we'll continue to see some follow-through on the rerisking front, assuming the broader markets remain constructive? Or is there a risk that we kind of fall back to more of a holding pattern, if you will?","Sean M. Healey","I'll start, and then I'll ask Nate to fill in. I think we are seeing early indications of rerisking across the industry. But it's not, so far, a rotation out of fixed income into equity. In fact, I think our view is that the degree to which there continue to be strong flows into fixed income is troubling for the industry. We all know the amount of risk in long-duration fixed income at these levels, and I think to the extent that rates rise and there is actually a rotation with outflows from fixed income into risk assets, I think it has the potential to be destabilizing on a broader basis. Of course, for AMG, our product set is composed almost entirely of risk assets. We're generating, in a period where industry flows continue, even in this quarter, to be into predominantly fixed income and passive equity, we're generating in our active equity and alternative product set very strong flows, very broad-based flows. And so to the extent there is this rerisking on a broader level, a rotation, it will be, in our view, strongly incrementally positive. Nate, do you want to talk about the breadth of our organic growth across products and any trends we may be seeing?","Nathaniel Dalton","Sure. So I'll try to add a little bit of -- maybe some of the shorter-term color to that. So as Sean said, we are seeing our flows coming through from sort of across channels and then from a wide array of Affiliates with, for us, mostly the same trends we've been talking about from a product standpoint, global, emerging and alternatives. And as you sort of implied in your question, some of that has been -- or a lot of that has been counter trend. As Sean said, we've been generating these 12 strong quarters of organic growth against some -- the backdrop of some other prevailing trends to fixed and passive. In terms of shorter term, I think I would divide it into maybe retail on the one hand and institutional on the other. And obviously, the inputs we have are things that are sort of broadly read or pretty public, and then sort of our own -- sort of the insight from our Affiliates and from our distribution. So I'd say, on the institutional side, I think we're -- our sense is it's just a continuation of the things we've been seeing. I think it is people searching for -- that we've been saying we've been seeing, people searching for risk, ways to get risk on into their portfolios, and that's driven a lot of the strong flows in alternatives but also sort of different and evolving equity, and also specialized fixed income, right? So I think on the institutional side that's a continuing prevailing trend. And then on the retail side, I do think there's been sort of this move where people are getting risk on, including just simply saying we need to get more equity into the portfolio, not even necessarily at the expense of fixed, maybe at the expense of cash. But people are just getting equity exposure on. I think we saw some of that last quarter, I think would be our view. And I think we, again, are very, very early in the next quarter, right? But we are seeing that continue this quarter. So we're seeing that trend, I guess, I would say.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of capital management, how are you thinking about deploying capital beyond sort of the more traditional deal flow? Are you seeing some opportunities to do something a bit out-of-the-box, if you will, just given the strength of the balance sheet? And at what point do you maybe start to circle back to share repurchases?","Jay C. Horgen","Yes. So, Michael, it's Jay Horgen. Just in terms of positioning the balance sheet this year and the sort of the strategy that we have, clearly, you're seeing us continue to posItion our balance sheet for flexibility, simplicity and capacity. And we're taking advantage of the rate environment ourselves, and we'll continue to do that. We -- the near term, the nearest term, we have the opportunity to lower our cost to funding with a convert that's sitting out there. We can't call it until August. Clearly, we'll wait to see the position that we're in at that time. But that can reduce our cost and our share count, which I note has some modest dilution that we're experiencing. So that's a near-term use of funds. Longer term, I think, clearly our new investment strategy, which we can talk more about, as well as share repurchases, we've done it in the past. I think we are mindful of share count creep and also efficient capital deployment. So I think it's a balance, but we're willing to do both.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then just finally, coming back to the guidance range. Any sort of change in assumptions beyond just kind of updating the market returns? So if I'm doing the math correctly, maybe the markets are up 2% to 3% on a blended basis thus far this quarter. Plus you had sort of an incremental, let's call it, 2% of market gains in the last 2 months of the first quarter. So just trying to box that with the updated range.","Jay C. Horgen","Yes, so you're tracking all of that -- I'll just be slightly more precise. I mean, since the last call, which was January 29, our blend's a little bit over 3%, so call it 3.25%, which means, relative to our model, right, because we, at that time, in January, we had assumed 2% for the second quarter. But as you know, our model convention is to assume what we've got through yesterday and then nothing else. So that means that we are 1.25% above where we were in January from a market perspective. That is offset, of course, by a slightly higher tax rate, as well as a slightly higher share count. Together with a performance fee that, while most of our performance fee opportunity was a result of early realization, and so all things being equal, it doesn't increase our range by virtue of that. It does provide a slightly higher degree of certainty, and I note that we narrowed our range slightly in light of that. But it's still early to refine performance fee further.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Fannon with Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","I guess a question or clarification from how you guys talked about the pull-forward of performance fees. I think it was mentioned that there's new performance fee arrangements, they switched share classes or funds. So is the economics any different in terms of how you guys will be accruing or booking performance fees going forward based on those changes?","Nathaniel Dalton","Yes, I don't think there should be any change in the way we sort of guide and explain the overall book. And maybe it'd be helpful to sort of step back and try and put it in some context, right? So as we said, we've got some very broad range of products across Affiliates. And there's a range of the ways in which they come, right? So some are percentage of gains, some are tied to benchmarks, some have hurdles, some are sort of traditional funds, 1 or 2 in 20, some are very highly customized, and so we've got this broad array. And then sort of what happened in the quarter was we had -- obviously, we had good performance in the quarter. But then, we had sort of several unconnected events that all just happened in the same quarter, which sort of triggered this, what you've described as sort of the pull-forward. So there's no real change. If you sort of think about it over the long term, there's no change in the way we think about the opportunities.","Sean M. Healey","And just to clarify, the realization of performance fees obviously is reflected in earnings in the period of realization. The guidance around performance fees is based on our judgment of a number of factors. And what we don't talk about, but is implicit in our guidance and judgment, is unaccrued performance fees, where at any given point, we may have -- do have, typically, a fair amount of alpha that we can see. But we -- but obviously, we're not describing specifically.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay that's helpful. And I guess next just in terms of capital deployment around new deals or new investments. You guys have talked about a very healthy backlog and opportunity set for some time. I guess, anything you would say differently about your outlook today or what you would see as potential deals in terms of maybe scope or size than you would say previously, say, a year ago?","Sean M. Healey","Well, a year ago, there was a favorable market environment, but then a period of volatility in the equity markets. And I think as we all know, the volatility is inevitably dampening, at least in the short term. I think to the extent that the markets continue to be positive or at least stable, the deal environment will remain quite favorable. We're pleased with our pipeline. We have a pipeline that includes prospects on a global basis -- alternative, traditional and wealth management. I guess to the extent that I'm describing -- and I think this is mostly anecdotal, but to the extent that I'm describing any changes that we've seen through the first part of this year, I think that our pipeline is, more than normally, based on one-on-one transactions, negotiated transactions arising out of our calling effort and the relationships we've built over time. I think the banker-driven processes are never a huge theme for us for obvious reasons. But I would say this year, even less so. So transactions that we have seen through banker processes have really not been -- opportunities have not been fits for us, I think, even more than normal, I would say. What does that mean? I'm not sure it's enough of a trend to indicate anything on a long-term basis. And to the extent that our pipeline of discussions includes one-on-one transactions, that's obviously to the good. It means that we know these firms better. It means that our structuring of the transactions is more refined. And I think the only way in which it's not a good thing is it makes the always-challenging effort to give some sense or have some precise sense of timing even more difficult because you don't have a banker organizing a process. But both in the current pipeline and certainly over the medium to long term, we remain quite optimistic.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I apologize if you had gone over this earlier, but I got to the call a bit late. I'm just curious with Yacktman. I'm trying to get a sense of where you're seeing this strong flows? I know when you did the acquisition, one of the things you had talked about was really kind of being able to leverage that through the Managers platform. And I don't know if it's possible to provide some insight or color into -- if you look at their flows today, how much of that is kind of being driven by some of the new distribution resources you've been able to bring to bear to Yacktman? And then maybe as a follow-up to that, what other opportunities do you see that maybe have been relatively untapped at this point with that platform to leverage other Affiliates?","Sean M. Healey","Thanks, Rob. So I'll start and then turn to Nate to answer the specific part of your question. Your question gives me the chance to repeat something, which I'm happy to say again, which is that our flows were broad-based across our equity and alternative product set, across a broad array of Affiliates, positive in every channel, positive in every coverage region. So we feel very good about the strength and momentum of our business. With respect to Yacktman, specifically, and Managers, Nate, why don't you add to that?","Nathaniel Dalton","Sure. So as you said, Yacktman has been experiencing good flows. I think we all would say when we talk about flows at Affiliates whether they're -- where they're working with our distribution, it is all about the Affiliates and nothing really happens without them, right, so I think they're responsible for all of it, first point. But it is hard to unpack, as you say, right? So there is no question there's a contribution from the Managers platform and indeed from other parts of our distribution platforms for Yacktman. Some of that's easy, right, where we've been able to leverage them onto a distribution platform, because we had a selling agreement in place, we were already covering and they weren't on the platform, that's very easy to see, right? The things that are harder is where you're seeing acceleration on platforms. They were maybe already on with a selling agreement, but didn't have a sales force of scale behind and those sorts of things. Actually separating out how much of it precisely is due to us, how much of it is due to their just continued, very good investment performance, which, again, the performance last quarter was again. So we're definitely contributing. I think there is opportunity with Yacktman to do more, both within the U.S. and the Managers platform, but also with global distribution outside. And then to your other question, which is the opportunity to leverage other Affiliates with the Managers platform. We think over the, let's call it, medium term -- it's very hard to do exactly when. But we do think -- this is something we've talked about for a few calls now. We do think there is an opportunity coming in the U.S. to leverage what we're doing today with Managers, but also some things we aren't really doing that much of yet today with Managers. So let me do -- I'll do a very simple example, which is, I think, there is no question we can bring additional institutional quality product, equities and alternatives. And there's lot -- I think there's a lot of opportunity in alternatives still, into the channels where we have very good coverage today. So the wires and the RA channels now, I think, we have good coverage and all that. And I think there are some things we can be doing with -- in channels where we -- helping build out Managers to take advantage of opportunities in other channels, D.C. or something would be an example of that, where I think we can do much more. So it's a combination of bringing more product through Managers into some channels and also expanding the Managers capabilities.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And maybe just one follow-up on the Pantheon. And I know there's always some reluctance to go talk too much about any 1 specific affiliate. But -- if I think of the Pantheon business in a very stable quarter-to-quarter the way fees are generated. But can you maybe -- just curious, update us a little bit about their capital raising. I mean, certainly, there's been a fair amount of M&A activity within the fund-to-fund space broadly and it certainly feels -- some of that's obviously hedge fund to funds, not private equity. But can you maybe update us, are they in market currently with some funds that you think could be sizable? And maybe even update us on if there's any kind of pipeline of capital that's actually being committed to them but isn't yet showing up in AUM? And at least provide a little bit of kind of backlog, so to speak, of some high-fee assets, for them at least.","Nathaniel Dalton","Okay. So as you know, this one, it's a little difficult to give too much specific visibility, in part because there's a bunch of rules around when you're doing fundraising and whatnot. They are -- but I'll talk to 2 -- there are 2 broad trends. So one is, they are out raising money right now for sets of products, and the products that are scalable or sort of potentially very significant-sized products are things like infrastructure and co-investments, so they're out raising right now. They're also out raising emerging markets as well, which is another big opportunity. They're very well known for their, especially, Asian capabilities. So they're out raising that way. And then the other thing I'd say, which is -- I think we've talked about this maybe on earlier calls, which is definitely part of a, I would say, a trend, is this evolution from asset raising in fund format versus asset raising in what's more sort of funds of loans [ph] or sort of separate account format. And I think that's a part of the business that's absolutely a growing and an evolving part of the business, too.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Cynthia Mayer with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So maybe just a couple of questions. One on flows. A couple on flows. You mentioned that sub-advise was a big part of the mutual fund flows. So what kinds of products are generating those? And is the fee different enough that we should begin to think about factoring that into the overall fee rate in that channel?","Nathaniel Dalton","Okay. So one thing I'll say and this is -- this was true of this quarter. I think the trend has been sub-advisory -- for some quarters, sub-advisory has been a significant contributor. I think there's 2 parts to that market from a product standpoint. And this plays a little bit also into your fee conversation. There's a part of it which is sort of simply replacement searches, sort of more traditional assets generally, so equity managers and those sorts of things, right? So that's a part of it. And there is some of that -- the fee dynamic you're describing. The other part of it, which has been sort of significant for us, is bringing -- we've talked about this more broadly with the retail channel as well, but that's bringing alternative product into the sub-advisory channel. And that's coming at maybe for the product category -- sorry, maybe for the channel. So if you think about sub-advisor, specifically retail, more broadly, that's -- those are coming in at higher fees, understandably, right? It's a -- so I think you have both of those trends sort of playing through. One is the sort of replacement searches, traditional product, and the other is, for us, bringing high-quality alternative product into sub-advisory at higher fees than other sub-advisory mandates would be -- can be.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And it looks to you like both will continue same pace?","Nathaniel Dalton","Well, pace -- this is another one where sub-advisory is a very lumpy channel. Wins and losses, right, and we have some of those, too. So a very lumpy channel, much more like the institutional channel. From a trend standpoint, I think the replacement search part of it is sort of -- I don't know if it's exactly zero sum, but it's -- because the overall underlying clients may be growing. But the replacement search, I think, is much more sort of episodic and hard to predict, that sort of trend. The search trends look like replacement institutional searches. I think the other, sort of the newer products, I think, the broad background -- again, very lumpy, but the broad background trends, I think, are long-term favorable.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great. Okay. And then in the High Net Worth channel, it looked like the best quarter ever. And I'm wondering, is there anything lumpy in there that was similar to -- I think a few quarters ago, GW&K took over a whole portfolio. Was there anything lumpy like that? Or seasonality that we should factor in?","Nathaniel Dalton","I don't think there were any large one-offs. I do think there was -- there were maybe some more products gaining traction kinds of things. But I don't think there were any large -- I'm not thinking of any large one-offs.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up for Jay. I think you said the cash tax rate is going from -- to 25% from 22%? What would be driving that? And that's a little bit higher than normal, right?","Jay C. Horgen","Yes. There's -- the main issue with our tax rate is just higher overall earnings because the elements that reduce our tax rate are fixed in dollar terms. And as you go to the incremental dollar, we're getting taxed at our highest marginal rate on that. So that's -- it's really mainly that is going on.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Marc Irizarry with Goldman Sachs.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just, I guess, Jay, a quick clarification question on the performance fees. So what we saw this quarter, the dynamic, should we expect that this is sort of an annual occurrence for those Affiliates? Or the sort of the nature of those Affiliates and the funds that they manage suggest that we will see this on and off throughout the year?","Jay C. Horgen","So the short answer is no, this is not a trend. And I think it's unique in its appearance, although it can happen again. We can't predict it. But it can happen again. We don't think it necessarily will. We had expected a level of performance fees during the year. So these are just fees that have moved from later in the year to this quarter.","Sean M. Healey","Part of what's occurring, Marc, is that the alternative product set is broadening, the asset base is increasing as the firms grow and generate performance and organic growth, and that includes sort of complexity of products. And so I think the -- you may see these sorts of one-off items repeat. But the broad backdrop is very positive. And as Nate said, we feel very good about the -- both the consistency and the growth potential for our performance fee revenues.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, Sean, just on that same note, if you will. The outlook for sort of deals in the alternative space, do you still see pretty ripe opportunity there? And are you willing to -- just sort of a threshold where -- that you're thinking about in terms of the level of performance fees that you're willing to sort of tolerate in the business, any update there?","Sean M. Healey","I think we still feel very positive about the opportunity broadly, but including to invest in great alternative firms. The constraint around performance fees and the percentage of the firm's revenues that come from performance fees would be more around the appropriateness of a firm with that dynamic for us, generally. In other words, what I mean is that the alternative firms that are most attractive to us and most appropriate for us are firms that are institutionalized, that have a diverse product set, a multigenerational management team and some reasonable scale without drawing a fixed line, let's just say, generally, north of $5 billion in assets under management. And those firms, if you take all of those dynamics together, will almost inherently tend to have pretty significant management fee revenues. And I would say, as I was sort of indicating earlier and talking about the broad M&A trends and what we're seeing, there are a lot of firms out there, a lot of -- including a lot of alternative firms. And only a subset are firms where we view them to be appropriately high-quality and firms where we share a philosophical orientation. And so, we're going to continue to be, in all respects, very highly selective, and how a firm's revenues break down will be just one element of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just coming back to deals for a moment. These are more negotiated at this point in time. Are these typical sort of wealth succession type deals and then -- should we be thinking sort of typical deal size here? Is a couple of hundred million sort of right down the fairway in terms of what you're looking at? Or is there another way to be thinking about that?","Sean M. Healey","Well, when you say wealth succession, I'm not sure what you mean by that. I would say the transactions which tend to be -- which arise out of one-on-one relationships and one-on-one discussions are inevitably more around us providing a solution to succession and transition needs. But that may include for alternative firms where the demographics are less of an issue and it's more around the institutionalization of the equity incentive structure, let's say, as well as traditional firms, where it is largely around demographically driven succession issues. Sizing of investments, I think, is -- it runs the gamut as you would've heard us say. We're focused in general on making sure that we're investing in firms that are meaningful. What does that mean? Again, with no fixed line, I would say, in general, it means that we're putting at least $100 million to work in a single investment. Perhaps in the wealth management space with AMG Wealth Partners, some transactions will be lower than that. But in general, that's been a very consistent approach and we're seeing plenty of opportunities really all across the board.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's helpful. Second question is -- and you may have said this and I apologize -- a couple of calls going on at the same time today. In terms of the institutional business, very strong showing once again. I heard you on -- answer the High Net Worth question, but was there any \"pull-forward\" of mandates this quarter relative to maybe the out quarters? Because I heard Nate say that the pipeline was still pretty full. But just from a sizing perspective, anything unique this quarter?","Nathaniel Dalton","So I -- look, I think we say pretty consistently the flows that come through this channel are going to be very lumpy. And some quarters -- I think the long trend has been consistent, right, we've been generating good flows in the institutional channel and across the business for 12 quarters now. I think -- I wouldn't say there's pull-forward. I think the way I look at it is I would look at the underlying trends that sort of help you get a sense. And I would look at what's the pace of our fees, what's the pace of finals, what's the won but unfunded debt as well, obviously, that's the easiest. And again, those long-term trends that I talked about, and our fees continue to be strong and positive, and finals continue to be strong and positive. And the won but unfunded pipeline continues to look good. So I think the long-term trends remain in place. I think from a very top-down sort of conceptual standpoint, we feel very good about it because we also are bringing additional resources online,  if you will. So think about the Swiss and German resources, we talked about that earlier or what have you. There are -- there's -- we've talked about this sort of curve as additional resources come up. So more and more resources are coming online. But I don't -- I think as you look quarter-to-quarter, it's just -- I'd go back to the oft-used lumpy. It really is hard to predict.","Sean M. Healey","One other thing to say, implicit in Nate's comments, at the most fundamental level, what drives forward flows for us over, to some extent, the near term, but certainly the medium to long term, is our product positioning, the product set that we've had a strategic focus on. And, of course, our Affiliates' performance and those -- that performance remains generally quite strong across the equity and alternative product set.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And just one last question. I was intrigued by your comments on sort of the retail focus at the margin? $135 billion of assets, 15% growth this past quarter, obviously, Yacktman doing well, among others. How are you thinking about scaling the business from now? Is it just combining what you have, through Managers and others? Or is there incremental investment need that needs to be done to further take advantage of some of this performance?","Nathaniel Dalton","I wouldn't say there's a sort of significant new investment need. I think some of it is focused, some of it is reallocation of existing resources as you look across the whole. I'd say those are the biggest things. There might be some things on the margin that you'd want to be adding from a resource standpoint.","Sean M. Healey","And also positioning the business for what we anticipate to be strong flows prospectively as retail clients in the U.S. increasingly rerisk and we have this \"great rotation.\"","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler with William Blair.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","As you look at your top 5 or 6 Affiliates, is there anywhere that you see a capacity issue today? I mean, looking specifically at AQR and Harding Loevner, it doesn't appear like there are any major capacity constraints. But maybe just comment a little bit more broadly about some of the other large Affiliates that have been generating your flow, so Genesis, Tweedy, Artemis, et cetera?","Nathaniel Dalton","Yes. So I think the way I would -- the way I will answer that question is I'll answer it across the group. I think I don't -- I think doing it Affiliate by Affiliate is probably not the right way to do it, but I'll do it across the group. So I would say there's definitely some areas -- because also it's a product thing more than an Affiliate thing, frankly. There are definitely some areas where Affiliates are looking carefully at capacity. And I'd say that, that breaks into a couple of buckets, right? One is, there may just be limits to what you can manage on strategy. They may also be managing capacity carefully because you want to match it with the investment opportunities you see at a particular point in time. And we definitely have Affiliates that do that. They'll say, \"Look, right now, we're going to slow down the asset that we're taking in. And when the market environment looks better for what -- the specific thing I'm trying to do, we're going to take assets on faster.\" So there's definitely those things going on. But what I would say is -- and I tried to allude to this maybe in the prepared remarks, which is I think that's more than offset by new products that are coming online at a range of Affiliates, including those -- many of those top ones you mentioned. So if you think about something like a BlueMountain Credit Opportunities Fund, which is a brand new product and a new opportunity set for them, there's lots of things like that. I mentioned earlier, Pantheon doing infrastructure or something, a place where they had a small opportunity and much growth -- a much larger opportunity now. So there are places where there are truly new products. And then there are also places where there are products -- and there are a lot of these as well, where there are products that are not really new, in the sense that they've been around for a few years, but they're just now starting to get to the point where the track records are 3, 4, 5 years old. And so now these products, again, including at firms you mentioned, now have been around long enough that they're now really saleable. And there's a lot of that, and those products getting traction and becoming contributors. And then -- yes. So I'm guessing that's most of it. And then there's obviously the other bit, which is also the evolving products. But that's less to your question. So I think, yes, there are some, but I would say more than offset by these new products coming online.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, Nate. And then the only other questions, as you guys look at RFPs and finals, to what extent do you feel like your success in recent quarters has been institutional investors looking for more exposure in the asset classes that you're in versus your win rates improving?","Sean M. Healey","Do you mean the past 12 quarters, Chris, or just the last few?","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Good point, Sean.","Nathaniel Dalton","So look, it's very hard to sort of bucket it the way you describe. But look, I think it's a bit of both. I think it's institutional clients -- so I'd break it into a few categories. I think it's institutional clients looking for the set of exposures, how can they get return into their portfolios, and looking for new ways to get returns in. And we have, as Sean said, we have Affiliates who have done a fantastic job over long periods of time generating performance in asset classes that people are trying to get exposure to, global and emerging markets, the globalization trend Sean spoke to, and alternatives. And people looking for different ways to get returns. So that's definitely a part of it. And our Affiliates, to reiterate again what Sean said, our Affiliates have done a really good job generating strong track records -- investment track records over this, again, sort of medium- to long-term trailing. So that's -- those are the biggest drivers. And then I would put on top of it the fact that we are adding additional distribution resources to augment what our Affiliates are doing. And so we're bringing this in-demand product set with very good performance into or helping our Affiliates bring into markets geographies and channels where those projects weren't. And so that's -- I think you put all those together and that's what, I would say, is a big part of what accounts for those 12 quarters.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Unknown Analyst","Actually, this is Julian Amina [ph] from Craig's team. With the stronger performance fees -- performance in U.S. equities year-to-date and a stronger U.S. dollar, are you seeing improved demand for U.S. equities versus global?","Nathaniel Dalton","So I wouldn't -- so again, very, very -- a bit of what I said in the last question, very hard to attribute motive, right, why are people doing exactly what they're doing. But I would say -- I wouldn't say it's instead of, right, I don't think it's this pivot where people are moving from desiring global and emerging to desiring U.S. equity. But I do think we are seeing a pickup in demand for U.S. equity. It's -- when I'm talking about the institutional channel here, I think it's anecdotal data, right, at this point. It's not enough data points that I would sort of say, \"Here's some trends,\" or what have you. But there does seem to be a pickup in non-U.S. institutional demand -- anecdotal pickup in non-U.S. institutional demand for U.S. equity product. Now again, part of that may be the environment, here's what people want, part of it may be just the relative performance so someone's changing one to the other. But some of it may be also we're bringing them to geographies where they weren't. Hard to break, among those, which is exactly why. But we are seeing a little bit of that pick up. But I don't think it's instead of global.","Sean M. Healey","And I would emphasize the degree to which our strong organic growth across products and channels and geographies is really countertrend. If you look across the industry, including through this quarter, flows are coming into fixed income and passive equity, and active equity flows have been very muted. I mean, in many cases, still an outflow. So I think our experiences with a different set of products and a different distribution strategy and a broad-based -- both in terms of channel as well as geography -- set of clients.","Unknown Analyst","And then can you provide us an update on your aggregate European cross-border seekout effort? How large is this consolidated AMG effort versus the boutique-led effort?","Nathaniel Dalton","So I'll work my way backwards to that question. So today, the vast majority of that effort is at the Affiliate level. So we have a number of Affiliates who have products. Now the vast majority is at the Affiliate level, both from a product packaging standpoint, as well as, I would say, from a distribution standpoint. Although from a distribution standpoint, where we have coverage and we're able to play the UCITS or seekout product through, that's happening. But it's also -- it's not really exactly always the target market for our sales force at this point. Although as we talk about channel growth within geographies we already cover, that will evolve over time. And from a packaging standpoint, we're still at the very, very early days ourselves and so the vast majority of that is at the Affiliate level.","Sean M. Healey","Yes, I think emphasizing the degree to which our results reflect, of course, reasonable breadth and scope in our business and distribution strategy. But there still a great deal of white space in terms of geographies where there are attractive client opportunities and where we have strategies to develop those opportunities, as well as in other elements of distribution, such as retail distribution, more broadly. And our -- relative to the overall scale of our business and the opportunity set ahead of us, our UCITS business is, as Nate said, at the very early stages with lots of opportunity ahead of us.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Robert Lee from KBW.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I had one follow-up, and not to focus so much on Pantheon, but a question kind of maybe around that. If I understand it correctly, that's one of the few Affiliates where you actually do operate a lot of their infrastructure or middle or back office. And I'm just kind of curious to what extent you see an opportunity for your -- some of your Affiliates to actually get more day-to-day involved in running some of their own infrastructure more efficiently? Not that this -- you expect that this would be a moneymaker for you, but generally, just to make their lives easier in places where you think you can add more efficiencies than what they're doing? Do you see that as a potential trend we should expect over time?","Nathaniel Dalton","So first on -- of the 2 parts. So first on Pantheon. I think you may -- you may have a bit of a misconception. We did do some infrastructure work, largely that was driven by getting through that transition. We do, do some of it still in the technology area, which is in addition to other things we do, which are -- I'm drawing distinctions between Pantheon and others. So we do legal and compliance alongside them. We do lots of distribution things alongside them, all the rest of that. But there was some additional things we did at Pantheon, especially in the technology area. And that was largely around this transition, to sort of like grow that. We definitely learned from it and I'm not trying to minimize the really good work a lot of people did around that. You used the phrase sort of day-to-day involved and I think our view is we're very careful what areas of the firm we try to offer the Affiliates the opportunity to sort of leverage the scope and scale of AMG. So distribution is one where the benefits are very clear and there is a real operational component to that as well, right? So another thing everybody should have is when we talk about our U.S. retail distribution platform, what we're offering Affiliates is not only the ability to do sales, marketing, client service in a bunch of channels, but we obviously have built all of that operational infrastructure to do the different product packaging, whether it's mutual funds or separate accounts or what have you. So there's a significant operation component there, which is complicated. And then obviously, the legal and compliance area and other areas like that, we have ongoing interaction with all of our Affiliates, of course, but we also offer a sort of very compete outsourced solution, I'll use [ph], but it's customized to each, which is very important from a number of reasons. One, it allows them to get leverage from the scope and scale of AMG, but also it goes alongside what we're doing on the distribution side. Because as we're helping them enter geographies, we also -- obviously, there's a very significant sort of legal component around that. And also, same point across channels, going to -- getting into the mutual funds business, there's a significant legal component to that as well. So I think you'll see us -- we do have a long list of things we think about. I think -- but I think you'll see us be very, very sort of thoughtful and careful about what we bring out, why it's a really good place for them to leverage the scope and scale of the overall organization. And I don't think there's really a sort of desire. It's not our business model, really, to sort of try to do things just to get involved into that day-to-day for each Affiliate.","Sean M. Healey","Yes, I agree with all of that. And I think, Rob, what I would say is that a way to understand the importance of the capability -- especially in the IT infrastructure area is, it's partly around what we can do to help x amount [ph] Affiliates, of course, in all the ways that Nate described. But the operational transition piece of it is, I think, especially important to understand where we have opportunities to invest in high-quality subsidiaries. Now you know that's a subset of the opportunities that we have on an overall basis and relatively few of the subsidiaries that are for sale are, in our view, really high-quality businesses and ones that are appropriate for us. But when we find them, and we do occasionally, it's very helpful relative to, let's say, private equity alternative to be able to offer a true strategic capability so that we can easily replace the kinds of functions that their parent might have provided and then help them over time to transition into -- manage them on a freestanding basis.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Cynthia Mayer with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","You partly answered my question, which was just looking at -- now you guys bring more and more distribution capability to the table and you can do infrastructure and you have the -- more breadth. So does that really alter the way you might structure a deal? Or does it allow you to buy on more attractive terms? Or does it -- I think you partly answered this, does it change the kinds of potential Affiliates you can look at because now you're able to bring in subsidiaries more easily?","Sean M. Healey","Well, it's clearly helpful to be able to offer a broader set of capabilities that Affiliates -- prospective Affiliates can take advantage of if they wish, and I put it in the broad set of considerations that prospective Affiliates [indiscernible], the most important element of which has been and continues to be our track record [ph] and the way in which existing Affiliates talk about us as a partner in good times and bad. And answering your question in a different way, what I would say is, of course, we have, through our distribution strategy and professionals around the world, we have insights into client demand, which helps us target a little bit. But in general, we still are focused on the same kind of firms we've always been focused on. The really -- the best firms in the world, the firms with a multigenerational management team, a partnership orientation, building long-term, enduring franchises. And in every one of those situations, it requires, notwithstanding all of these capabilities and all of our track record, it requires us to do a very good job selling and convincing these firms and these partners that they should trust us and give us their confidence. Now obviously, we think we're pretty good at doing that. But the best firms in the world have a number of great options, inevitably, including doing nothing. And so what we're not going to do -- what we could do, but we're not going to do, is start investing in firms where we think they're not complete firms, where we think they're somehow just okay and we can make them better. We really don't ever want to think about our investing opportunity in that way. So it's always going to be a subset of the opportunities around, and we're always going to be very highly selective and willing to wait in order to find the very best firms as opposed to just making investments because there are firms out there.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Sean Healey for closing comments.","Sean M. Healey","Thank you again for joining us this morning. As you've heard, we're pleased with our results for the quarter and confident in our prospects for continued strong growth ahead. We look forward to speaking to you in July.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. We thank you for your participation.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions).","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Alexandra Lynn, Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Investor Relations for Affiliated Managers Group. Thank you. Ms. Lynn, you may begin.","Alexandra Lynn","Thank you for joining Affiliated Managers Group to discuss our results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2011. ","In this conference call certain matters discussed will constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected due to a number of factors, including but not limited to those referenced in the company\u2019s Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.","AMG will provide on its website at www.amg.com, a replay of the call and a copy of our announcement of our results for the quarter, as well as a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.","With us on the line to discuss the company\u2019s results for the quarter are Sean Healey, Chairman and CEO; Nate Dalton, President and COO; and Jay Horgen, CFO. ","And now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Sean Healey.","Sean Healey","Thanks Allie and good morning everyone. AMG reported economic earnings per share of $1.76 for the fourth quarter and $6.62 for the full year. Despite the volatile markets in 2011, including 15% to 20% declines in non-U.S. equity markets, AMG generated strong results with year-over-year earnings growth and outstanding net client cash flows of $23 billion.","Against an industry backdrop of muted client demand for alpha generating products, we were very pleased with our organic growth from net client flows of $4 billion in the quarter, marking our seventh consequent quarter of strong net inflows. Our net flows which lead the industry in return oriented products reflect the quality of our specialist affiliates, our unique position in highly attracted product areas and the ongoing success of our global distribution strategy. Our strategic focus on global and emerging market equity and alternative products, which collectively account for three quarters of our EBITDA, continues to drive the growth of our business. ","Our highly regarded affiliates are leaders in their respective investment disciplines, including global and emerging market equity managers such as Tweedy, Browne, Genesis and Harding Loevner and alternative firms like Pantheon, AQR, BlueMountain and ValueAct. Our affiliates continue to generate excellent relevant investment performance in these areas and we are particularly pleased and proud that Tweedy, Browne was just named Morningstar\u2019s International Stock Manager of the Year for 2011.","Our global distribution strategy combines the resources and scale of a global asset management company, with the investment expertise of our boutique affiliates and continues to generate strong client cash flows, especially from non-U.S. clients, which accounted for all of our net flows this quarter.","We are seeing strong momentum in the East region, including Australia, the Middle East, Europe and Asia and given the ongoing success of our global strategy, we are continuing to invest in our distribution platform worldwide, with the addition of new personnel and incremental coverage regions.","","Given our forward new business pipeline and the strong execution of our global distribution strategy, we continue to be confident in both our near and long-term organic growth prospects. We\u2019ve generated strong organic growth from net client flows in a difficult period for return oriented products and we expect that we will see even greater growth as markets stabilize and institutional and retail investors, including especially the U.S. investors, increasingly return to risk oriented products. This trend will benefit our affiliates broadly and we expect continuing and even accelerating client demand for our global and emerging markets equity and alternative products. ","Finally we are making significant progress in the new investments area. As we noted, our market position and opportunity set are outstanding and we\u2019re having active discussions with traditional, alternative and wealth management prospects around the world, with prospective affiliates at all stages of the pipeline. While the timing and execution of transactions is inherently difficult to predict, we are confident that we will continue to materially enhance our earnings growth through accretive investments and new affiliates going forward. ","Looking ahead, we are very well positioned across all aspects of our business. We have a fantastic group of performance-oriented affiliates, which are recognized as industry leaders in highly attractive product areas. We\u2019re successfully executing our global distribution strategy and generating outstanding net client cash flows even in a volatile market environment. And finally our new investment opportunity is better than ever. ","While there are ongoing concerns about the macro economic and political environment, we come into 2012, poised to build on our strong momentum and are feeling very optimistic of our business and forward prospects.","Let me now turn it over to Nate, who will discuss our affiliates results in greater detail.","Nate Dalton","Thanks. Good morning everyone. Against some challenging backdrop, we and our affiliates executed very well in 2011. While we\u2019re speaking, our affiliates continue to generate strong, relative returns, particularly in the global equities, emerging markets and alternatives areas. The combination of this strong performance and our global distribution strategy, which Sean outlined, resulted in industry leading flows for 2011. ","As we described in the release, net client cash flows were over $4 billion for the fourth quarter and $23 billion for the full year. With seven straight quarters of strong, positive client cash flows, we are very pleased with the execution of our organic growth strategy. This success is especially notable, given the predominant flow trends last year favored fixed income products. ","We are very encouraged not only by the ongoing tactical opportunities we see to further enhance our affiliates reach on a global basis, but also by the long term macro opportunity as investors re-risk their portfolios and move back to return oriented products. As we said before, we believe institutional and retail investors both will have to do this in order to achieve the returns they need.","Now I\u2019m turning to the most important element, investment performance. In the global equity category we had another strong quarter. The majority of Tweedy, Browne outperformed on a relative basis for the quarter and year and remained well ahead of benchmarks across all relevant time periods. As Sean mentioned, we are very proud of the team at Tweedy, Browne, which received Morningstar\u2019s International Stock Manager of the Year award for 2011. ","Harding Loevner also had a very impressive year overall, with the majority of their global equity funds outperforming for the quarter and still remaining ahead for the full year, as well as longer term periods. AQR and Trilogy, each also had a good quarter among their largest global equity products.","In the emerging markets category, we had another strong quarter and year. The flagship strategy at Genesis continued to post excellent results and is significantly ahead of it\u2019s benchmarks for the quarter one, three and five year periods. Similarly, Harding Loevner\u2019s emerging market products significantly outperformed their benchmarks in the fourth quarter and for the full year.","Now turning to our alternatives category, we have strong absolute performance among many of our largest products, which despite the difficult market environment delivered meaningful performance fees. Highlights include good performance from major products at AQR, BlueMountain and ValueAct. ","At AQR this included especially strong performance from their global risk premium, aggressive multi strategy and diversified arbitrage funds. While at BlueMountain this included their flagship credit alternatives fund, as well as their newer long-term credit fund. ","We had more of a mixed performances for First Quadrant, with strong performance from their data oriented products and a slightly negative quarter, but a strong full year from their tactical currency products. Global PA on the other hand was down slightly for the year. Finally, ValueAct had another great year, with excellent performance across all strategies.","Turning to our U.S. equity products and starting on the value side. As I noted earlier, Tweedy Browne generated outstanding performance across its global products. Their U.S. equity products missed for the quarter, but were ahead of benchmarks for the full-year as well as longer time periods. ","Third Avenue\u2019s U.S. equity products generally missed for the quarter as well, while Systematic Financial Management delivered very strong performance across its value product set in the fourth quarter.","On the growth side, fundamentally it was a challenging market environment for many managers. We saw this at Frontier where the firm\u2019s products trailed their respective benchmarks, as well as with Friess Associates, which continue to face challenges from a performance and flow perspective. Times Square on the other hand generated outstanding performance really across a suite of growth strategies. ","Now turning to flows in more detail. As I said, we had another quarter of strong growth with approximately $4.1 billion in positive net client cash flows, coming principally in the global equities, emerging markets equities and alternatives areas. ","We do continue to see outflows in U.S. equities, reflecting broader industry trends. From a geographic standpoint, on a net basis, all of our flow growth is coming from clients outside the U.S. ","Now, let me describe the flows for the quarter by channel. Starting with the institutional channel, we had positive flows of approximately $3.1 billion. Looking at flows in greater detail, it was a quarter where we had significant flows in global and emerging markets products and alternatives strategies, with notable contributions from Genesis, AQR, Harding Loevner, and Pantheon. ","As we always say, flows in the institutional channel are inherently lumpy and this quarter was no exception as there were some sizable wins. That said, the long-term trend remains very good, in terms of pipeline of won business, finals and RFPs. ","Moving to the mutual fund channel, we had positive flows of over $600 million, again, continuing the positive trend over the past several quarters. From a product category standpoint, we had strong flows into alternative and some global strategies, offset by outflows in U.S. equities. ","I\u2019ll reiterate that while we are benefiting from the trend to alternative products, we believe our affiliates outstanding and diverse product set enables us to continue to generate positive flows in this channel, despite the fact that fixed income is a very small portion of our business and we do not offer any passive products. ","This quarter we again had strong flows in the sub-advisory channel and especially for alternatives and global equity products in the sub-advisory channel. As I said before, our sub-advisory distribution platform has done a good job of generating new business for our affiliates. ","In our High Net Worth channel, flows were about $300 million for the quarter. We had positive flows from Gannett Welsh & Kotler, which continues to attract flows for our U.S. retail distribution platform, while Canadian affiliate Beutel also attracted positive flows. ","Finally, turning to our overall global distribution efforts. In 2012 we\u2019ll celebrate the fifth anniversary of our first international office, which we opened in Sydney, Australia. We saw the growing demand for performance-oriented boutiques among sophisticated institutional investors worldwide and we continued to build out the platform even during the financial crisis, bringing new regions online and recruiting outstanding teams to cover the Middle East, Europe and Asia and opening offices in London and Hong Kong. ","As we look at this initiative today, we are obviously pleased with our execution so far. But looking ahead, with the hiring of Andrew Dyson to lead the team, we are very optimistic for continued growth within the regions and channels we are covering and we continue to work towards expanding into additional regions and channels as well. ","Now with that, I\u2019ll turn it to Jay to discuss our financials.","Jay Horgen","Thank you Nate. As you saw in the release, we reported economic earnings per share of $1.76 for the fourth quarter with performance fees contributing $0.26. On a GAAP basis we reported earnings of $0.77 per share. The ratio of our EBITDA contribution to end of period assets under management was about 16.8 basis points for the fourth quarter, reflecting the strong contribution of performance fees. We expect this ratio to return to approximately 15 basis points for the first quarter and 16 basis points for the full year 2012, which includes a reasonable assumption for performance fees. ","Holding company expenses were $21 million in the fourth quarter and we expect them to continue at this level, reflecting our ongoing focus on operational efficiency, while at the same time we continue to invest in our global distribution effort. ","In the fourth quarter, there were two GAAP accounting items to point out, neither of which impacted our economic earnings per share. The first was a $9.2 million expense, resulting from a reduction in indefinite-lived ACR and the second was a $4.8 million gain, resulting from adjustments to our contingent payment liabilities. Together and after adjusting for taxes, these items reduced our GAAP earnings per share by a net $0.07, but as I mentioned, these were non-cash items, that have no effect on our economic earnings per share. ","With regard to our taxes, our effective GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter was 30.6%, reflecting flow-through items and an adjustment resulting from U.K. tax law changes. Our cash tax rate was 22.5% for the quarter, primarily due to the strong contribution of performance fees, as well as flow-through items. ","For modeling purposes we expect our GAAP tax rate to be 36% going forward and we expect our cash tax rate to decline to approximately 15% in the first quarter and then trend upward in 2012 with organic growth and performance fees. ","Intangible-related deferred taxes were $7 million for the fourth quarter, also reflecting the U.K. tax rate change and the ACR adjustment I mentioned earlier. Going forward, we expect intangible-related deferred taxes to return to approximately $13 million per quarter. ","With reported amortization of intangible assets of $31.3 million, our share was $27.9 million and together with $8.2 million of amortization from affiliates accounted under the equity method, AMG\u2019s controlling interest portion of amortization was $36.1 million in the quarter. We expect our amortization to return to a normalized $27 million per quarter going forward. ","For the fourth quarter, our portion of total interest expense was $20.7 million, which included non-cash imputed interest of $2.5 million pre-tax. We expect our total interest expense to return to approximately $26 million for the first quarter and going forward. ","Turning to our balance sheet, in November we refinanced our bank facility with a new $1 billion, five-year, unsecured revolver in term loan, together with our flexible and liquid capital position, strong recurring cash flow and low leverage, we are well positioned to execute on our growth strategy. ","Now turning to guidance. We are raising the bottom end of our 2012 guidance and expect our economic earnings per share to be in the range of $6.70 to $7.40. This guidance assumes our normal convention of markets through yesterday with 2% quarterly growth beginning in the second quarter and a weighted average share count of $53 million. ","The lower end of our 2012 guidance includes a relatively modest contribution for performance fees and organic growth, while the upper end of the range is simply a more robust contribution from performance fees and full expectation. ","As always, these assumptions do not include earnings from future new investments and are based on our current expectations of affiliate growth rates, performance and the mix of affiliate contributions to our earnings. Of course, substantial changes in markets and the earnings contribution of affiliates would impact these expectations. ","Now, we would be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","","Operator","","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question is from the line of Bill Katz of Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Bill Katz - Citigroup","Okay, thanks very much. Just sort of starting with the new investment opportunity, I think Blackrock earlier in the quarter had suggested that the supply-demand is sort of asymmetric to the benefit of the other buyers. I think that\u2019s what you\u2019ve been talking about for a bit of time. So just sort of curious, what\u2019s going to be the trigger to actually get a deal done and then secondarily, can you talk a little about some of the pricing dynamics as you see them on a sort of a go-forward basis?","Sean Healey","Thanks Bill. I think we have been saying for quite some time that the supply-demand balance among buyers and sellers is highly favorable to us, and I\u2019d note that relative to other public asset management companies, as well as the mix of other buyers, which of course as a whole has contracted significantly. The opportunity set that we\u2019re looking at is relatively differentiated and unique. Many of the opportunities that we are working on are one-on-one transactions that are the product of years of relationship building, for example. ","I think going forward the only trigger that we\u2019ll need is time. We need to execute to completion the transactions that we are working on. We need the market to avoid falling off a cliff, but as you could tell from the tone of our remarks, we are highly confident in the new investment opportunity set that we have. ","Pricing continues to be favorable. Obviously, it varies according to the quality and nature of the firm, but we are seeing a great set of opportunities, both what\u2019s in the market as well as what I\u2019ll call more proprietary opportunities and are optimistic about this year.","Bill Katz - Citigroup","And sort of a follow-up question. I think you continue to sort of mention Friess continues to be challenged and I can appreciate the diversification of your business, but how much of a drag on flows is it and where are they in terms of assets and EBITDA contribution to the overall story?","Sean Healey","Nate, do you want to\u2026","Nate Dalton","Sure. So I\u2019ll spend a minute on Friess in general. So, I think as you know right, so a difficult period for U.S. equities in general, especially active U.S. equities and I don\u2019t remember the exact number, but it\u2019s something like 10% or 15% of active managers in the large-cap growth category, sort of beating the benchmarks, so it\u2019s a difficult environment for them. ","It\u2019s especially difficult for firms with sort of their style, right, where they are looking for high earnings growth with reasonability. So the fact that the market, sort of moving in such a highly correlated way, sort of risk-on, risk-off ways, it\u2019s just tough for them to get rewarded for identifying those kind of stocks they are identifying, and they are actually doing a good job identifying stocks here, but are going faster. ","So you\u2019re right; it\u2019s a challenging environment and they have been in and out flows. The only thing I\u2019ll say is \u2013 and again, we said this before, but I\u2019m going to say this, it\u2019s the same team, same process and we are very confident in that group. So we do feel good about that. But yeah, it\u2019s a challenging space and they have been going through a challenging performance period.","Sean Healey","I think if you step back more broadly, part of what\u2019s going on is just an industry-wide phenomenon, where active U.S. equities as a group are in massive outflows. I think our view is that that\u2019s going to change and reverse and you\u2019ll have equity inflows, active equity inflows, both in the U.S. as well as -- and this I think is the point that we want to emphasize, as well as in global and emerging market equities and alternatives. ","So we\u2019ve been generating very strong growth, notwithstanding the drag, which is common across U.S. equity managers of U.S. equity outflows and also notwithstanding the drag last year, which I think is easy to forget, because we think, Oh! The market ended up flat. ","Global EAFE and the emerging market indices were down 15% and 20% respectively. So it was a very tough year for beta and as we look forward, we see that beta, hopefully no one knows of course in the short term, but we are confident that hopefully in the short term and absolutely in the long term, that that beta is going to be strongly positive in global and emerging market equities and we see continued strong inflows and to the extent that we have market stability and flows generally positive into active equities, we think we\u2019ll get more than our share going forward.","Bill Katz \u2013 Citigroup","And just one last one, thanks for taking my questions. I think this one maybe for Jay. I\u2019m sort of struggling with the low end of the guidance discussion a little bit. I can appreciate \u2013 obviously, it\u2019s only January 31 and a dose of conservatism, as well as the averaging of asset issue. ","That being said, with growing at 4% to 5% organic growth rate what appears to be a pretty good pipeline and new business, plus what seems to be in aggregate a good performance, notwithstanding Friess, I don\u2019t understand why the low end of the guidance is as low as it is, particularly given your run rate earning is only to the new year. Maybe one or two more sentences on that would be helpful.","Jay Horgen","Sure. Thanks Bill, it\u2019s Jay. Yes, no I think if you look at the market blend from the October call to now, it\u2019s up just around 3%. But as you remember, our market convention is 2% per quarter, so 2% of that was expected and 1% is really the delta. So on a beta basis we have gotten a little bit of lift, but it\u2019s modest. I think we certainly feel good about our prospects this year and we feel good about this range.","Bill Katz \u2013 Citigroup","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Lee \u2013 KBW","Thanks. Good morning guys.","Sean Healey","Good morning Robert.","Robert Lee \u2013 KBW","Sean, I have a question for you. I\u2019m just curious with the transaction pipeline. I guess this really relates mainly to things you may be thinking about or in the pipeline in the U.S. To what extent does the perspective, fairly significant increases in capital gains and Medicare taxes and all that next year kind of do you think \u2013 do you think that could actually spur some activity at least in U.S. deals as the year progresses?","Sean Healey","I do, I do. I think the pipeline that we are working on includes a mix as we said of traditional, alternative and wealth management prospects and including on a global basis, and most of that pipeline consists of firms, where as you would expect given the timing of the year where we\u2019ve been in discussions for some time and in a number of cases as I mentioned, exclusive discussions that are the product of a long-term relationship. ","So I think we\u2019ll continue to have those kinds of opportunities going forward, but I think there will be a catalytic effect, assuming markets are at least stable of the prospect of impending taxes that will encourage a number of independent firms that know that they must find a solution to their succession oriented issues and they don\u2019t have any imperative to do it this year versus next year. ","But there\u2019s been as we\u2019d talked about, a long build-up given the market volatility over the past few years and so inevitably we think that there will be an acceleration of transactions and I think you\u2019re right. As we get later in the year, there could be an even bigger pick up in these transactions as people start to do their long-term planning.","Robert Lee \u2013 KBW","Okay, thanks. And maybe one follow-up. I\u2019m just curious; this is specific to AQR and I know you\u2019re probably going to be loathed to comment on it, but if I think back to that thing, it was maybe \u201807 or \u201806 when there was all kinds of things going around about them doing a kind of corporate strategic transaction in terms of an IPO or something. ","I think to where they are now, it looks like they\u2019ve substantially rebuilt it. They\u2019ve done a pretty good job building a mutual fund platform along the way, which I think has been growing at a pretty rapid pace. So just curious to anything you can comment on it? Do you think they\u2019ve kind of given up a lot of those thoughts? You think there is some possibility as they rebuilt the firms substantially and remade it, that they could be thinking along those lines since you\u2019re still a minority holder?","Sean Healey","I think there is absolutely no news to report on that front. Their focus has been 100% on building their firm. They\u2019ve done a fabulous job over the past two years in a whole bunch of ways and of course with any of our investments, where we have a minority interest, there\u2019s the theoretical possibility, but that\u2019s certainly not in the prospect.","Robert Lee \u2013 KBW","Great. That was it. Thanks for taking my question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Michael Kim with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Kim - Sandler O\u2019Neill","Hi guys, good morning. Maybe just to kind of approach the deal pipeline a bit differently, can you just kind of talk about where you are in terms of the different stages of getting something done, so where you might stand as it relates to potential transactions that are maybe more sensitive to the markets or the environment versus those that just need to get through some kind of final due diligence if you will?","Sean Healey","I don\u2019t there are any firms where we would expect that there\u2019s an unusual exposure to or lack of exposure to market volatility. I think it\u2019s obviously going to vary to some extent by firm, but in general, I think as long as markets are stable, we feel confident in our ability to execute a number of transactions this year. ","I said, as much as you can really say, in our prepared remarks I said we have investments or prospective affiliates at all stages of the pipeline. So that means all stages, but I can\u2019t be more specific about timing and inevitably it is quite difficult to predict, even when we are very close to a transaction, sometimes it gets pushed off or deferred, but we look at our entire set of opportunities and feel very good about it.","Michael Kim - Sandler O\u2019Neill","Okay, fair enough. And then moving on to capital management, I don\u2019t think you bought back a meaningful amount of stock during the quarter, so was that more a function of maybe a bit better visibility into deals like you talked about or how much of that was related to kind of price sensitivity?","Nate Dalton","We just bought a few shares, I think less than 200,000 in the quarter Michael and it was earlier in the quarter. It really is a view of the pipeline or forward pipeline and use of cash.","Michael Kim - Sandler O\u2019Neill","Okay, and then finally just another one for Jay. In terms of the guidance range, can you just walk through what you\u2019re expecting or how you\u2019re thinking about performance fees at both the low and the high ends?","Jay Horgen","Sure. Maybe I\u2019ll take a step back and just talk about performance fees. We had $0.50 for the year, $0.26 in the fourth quarter. I think I would characterize that as a good year. I think we have the potential to do better than that in performance fees. ","In the main we do not have high-water mark issues. I know that\u2019s talked about a lot. Of course you can pick a product here and there that might, but in the main we do not have high-water mark issues. It\u2019s just a question of return, absolute and relative, depending on the type of performance fee. ","So I think we look at 2012, when we say our opportunity for performance fees is at least as good as it was in 2011, in part because we are having net flows and quite a number of alternative managers and their performance fee products. ","So when we look at this year, of course we are more conservative on the low side and just frankly slightly more positive on the upside. We could actually go above our own estimate, if you will, internally on performance fees, because there is quite an upside opportunity there. But in the main we have kind of stuck to this 5% to 10% range on performance fees as a percentage of our earnings. We did about 7% this year and so that\u2019s kind of the range that we are looking at.","Michael Kim - Sandler O\u2019Neill","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Daniel Fannon of Jefferies & Co. Please proceed with your question.","Daniel Fannon - Jefferies & Co.","Hi, good morning. I guess the first question is on distribution flows. I think the comment was that a bulk of the flows are all coming from outside the U.S. I guess is it concentrated in one region or is it pretty well split out amongst all the different sales offices? If you can kind of give us some color there it would be helpful.","Nate Dalton","Sure. I think it\u2019s pretty diverse. Let me talk about it along another dimension, which is maybe the opportunity too, right, so good flows coming from places like Australia and the Middle East where we\u2019ve had distribution built and operating for a while, right. ","In Australia we talked about coming up on our fifth anniversary. Really increasing flows in Europe, so that\u2019s an area where we had sort of good flows in a bunch of areas, but we see a lot of opportunity going ahead and what we\u2019re doing in Asia, for example, I still think it\u2019s pretty early days and there\u2019s a lot of upside opportunity there. ","So I would say it\u2019s broad and diverse, not just by regions, but also by affiliates. But I do think there are some places where we see the opportunity to really pick it up going ahead.","Daniel Fannon - Jefferies & Co.","Okay great. And then you said pipelines, RFPs, wins, all look good. I guess can you characterize that today versus at other points in 2011 where you made similar comments?","Nate Dalton","Okay. So obviously the huge caveat of \u2013 there are two caveats, very early in the quarter and then the second is you obviously have much more visibility to the wins than you do to the things you might lose, right. But, right, let me do it this way from a sort of won by not funded perspective. This quarter we were running decently ahead of where we were in the last quarter at this time and finals continue to be probably about the same page. So, maybe overall a little bit better than where we were coming into this quarter. ","And then the other thing I\u2019ll say, is if you sort of look at \u2013 we\u2019ve been talking about this for a couple of quarters now. It did seem like the pace of decision-making in some parts of the institutional market got slowed down and I do think we had that effect and so some of that may just be, there maybe a little bit of build up in there as well, which we\u2019ll hopefully see come through in closed business.","Daniel Fannon - Jefferies & Co.","Great. And then I guess Sean one more question about the deal opportunity. I guess just trying to compare to \u201808 and into \u201809 when you guys deployed a lot of capital, how would you kind of characterize your backlog today and opportunity set versus then?","Sean Healey","Well, Dan as you recall, \u201808 was the year to avoid deploying capital and the back half of \u201809 in hindsight, it wasn\u2019t obvious at that time. It was the time to be making substantial investments, which we did. ","I think every year is different. We have a number divestiture opportunities, but it\u2019s nothing like the level that you saw at the back half of \u201809. The market opportunities and the supply-demand balance I think continue to be very positive as we said earlier, very much in our favor, specifically as well as for buyers generally in the market and we feel quite optimistic. ","I think the opportunity set includes the full range and I would say it includes small firms, wealth management firms, which is new from just the past year, as well as some larger opportunities, which are I think unique and potentially attractive. So we look across that range and feel very good about the opportunities. ","And then the core of our investment activity over the past 18 years has been and will continue to be succession-oriented transactions with independent firms, increasingly on a global basis. And we have a tremendous asset in the firm, which is our long-term relationships that we built up with these firms over time. I mean, last year was a year where we didn\u2019t execute any investments, but I can assure you, we were very busy working with firms, building relationships, maintaining and enhancing the ones that we built over time. ","And as we look forward, I think there will be inevitably, just for demographic reasons, a substantial increase in succession-oriented transactions. Taxes may be a catalyst, but I think as long as we have a measure of stability in the markets, there\u2019s going to be a substantial set of opportunities for us and that\u2019s what gives us the optimism, both in the short term with the existing pipeline, as well as over the medium to long-term where we feel very, very good about our position.","Daniel Fannon - Jefferies & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Sean Healey","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse Group. Please proceed with your question.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Group","Thanks guys. Good morning.","Sean Healey","Good morning.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Group","And just to kind of maybe read between the lines on the M&A commentary, so question here really for Sean. It seems like you\u2019re actually more positive at this point on the succession planning in terms of kind of the timing of the pipeline, but maybe a little softer on the divestiture side. So maybe I\u2019m reading too much into that; maybe you can comment on that. ","And also if maybe Jay you can pipe in, in terms of what is the kind of accretion ranges for deals? And I know some these larger deals could be very creative, some of the succession deals maybe a little smaller or maybe you can comment in terms of accretion ranges for potential acquisitions.","Sean Healey","I think to the extent that you heard me emphasize succession-oriented transactions more than divestiture transactions, I intended it to be more around the contrast between the world of \u201909, early \u201810 and the world of today, where we certainly \u2013 in \u201809, it was very largely divestiture opportunities. ","Today we\u2019ve got some divestiture opportunities, many of which you have read about, but there are some others that are out there that we are looking at, but you\u2019ve also got a huge array of succession-oriented transactions, potential investments in alternative firms, as well as wealth management, which is brand new for us. So it\u2019s more the breadth than it is one category versus another. Jay.","Jay Horgen","Yes, and on the accretion, of course it depends on where we are and where we pay and how we fund it, but in general I would say our opportunity for accretion is exactly the same as we\u2019ve said before, which is per $100 million, somewhere between $0.10 and $0.20. Again, it depends on what kind of consideration mix. ","I think, of course we\u2019ve got build-up of cash that\u2019s occurring on our balance sheet now, and so there\u2019s quite a bit of time before we\u2019d even have to consider anything other than just issuing debt or taking it off of our revolver.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse","Got it. Thank you. And Jay, just a housekeeping item, actually two housekeeping items. Will interest expense drop again in the first quarter, because you paid back that debt I believe in the middle of the fourth quarter, so I thought there might be another step down. And I believe you said performance fees are $0.26, meaning baseline EPS of $1.50. Did I get those two numbers right?","Jay Horgen","So, on the latter, yes, you got those numbers correct. On the interest expense, our cash interest expense will stay approximately the same quarter-over-quarter. We don\u2019t expect to repay any debt. We just expect to accumulate cash or deploy it.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse","All right, great guys. Thanks for taking my questions.","Sean Healey","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today is coming from the line of Robert Lee of KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Lee - KBW","Thanks. I just have one follow-up. I\u2019m just, really just more curious; I think a couple of years ago you guys had taken a small stake in a \u2013 I think it was Value Partners in Hong Kong, it was a public traded manager. I think it was only a few percent. But I\u2019m just kind of curious on any update in terms of how maybe that relationship has helped maybe gain some access to China or any possibility or intention to kind of increase your stake there?","Sean Healey","Well, we slightly increased our stake in Value Partners last year. It\u2019s a unique opportunity, unique situation and a great firm and we\u2019re great friends with Cheah Cheng Hye, the Chairman and Founder of Value Partners and from a broad relationship standpoint, both with Value Partners where we have a great ongoing relationship, which could continue to evolve over time, as well as in the perspective and relationships in the region that Mr. Cheah gives us. ","I think it\u2019s been terrific and we certainly as we look forward, expect to spend more and more time in the region, both in terms of new investment opportunities, as well as distribution, which of course is a huge focus for us. Maybe I\u2019ll ask Nate to elaborate on the distribution front?","Nate Dalton","Sure. So it took us a little bit of time to sort of maybe exactly have to work together. We\u2019ve started working, both with our institutional sales forces in a couple of regions, working with them on the sales and marketing client service side, so I think we just actually added them to the Europe platform. I think we\u2019re going to be really helpful to them there, and it\u2019s also helpful to our guys, because it\u2019s a pretty unique differentiated product set. ","And then also the other way, which is they are being very helpful to us as we look at a couple of specific things in different countries. I\u2019m thinking of a specific opportunity in Taiwan where they are being very helpful to us, because of some relationships they\u2019ve got both on the sort of general client servicing, as well as some regulatory things. So, again, it\u2019s a great relationship and we are finding more and more ways to work together.","Robert Lee - KBW","All right, great. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Gentlemen, we have one further question. It is from Cynthia Mayer of Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America","Hi, good morning.","Sean Healey","Good morning. ","Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America","Can you talk a little about in terms of buying the wealth management firms, are those structured similarly and would those have the same accretion as a more typical asset management deal?","Sean Healey","Broadly speaking, yes. I think there\u2019s certainly aspects to the relationship and the degree to which we can provide in the AMG Wealth Partners business, the broader set of capabilities or maybe I\u2019ll say a different set of capabilities to help our wealth management affiliates; I think it will look a little bit different. ","But the core approach and the core philosophy is very much the same, investing in very high quality growing businesses where the management partners want a degree of liquidity, but very much believe in the ongoing growth of their business. ","I think with respect to the level of accretion in those investments, it\u2019s really going to be a function of size and by and large they are at the smaller end, but not all, but they\u2019ll tend to be at the smaller end of the size range of our investments and therefore just less accretive given the lower scale.","Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America","Great, okay. And then really briefly, it looks like through AQR you really benefited through the trend toward 40 Act alternative funds and how do you see that trend going? Do you see those flows industry-wide continuing to take greater and greater share or do think that if equity markets improve and equity flows improve, that those would back off a little bit and equity would take some share back from them?","Sean Healey","Why don\u2019t you start and then I\u2019ll\u2026","Nate Dalton","So I think in the short run, the things we can see, right, and you asked a really challenging question. In the short run the things that we can see, I do think there\u2019s lots of opportunities for them to continue to take share, both firms like AQR and First Quadrant but this idea of sort of liquid alternatives, I think there\u2019s lots of opportunities in lots of different places where that can be used in retail investment structures, whether it\u2019s \u201840 Act here or you said elsewhere in the world, so I do think there\u2019s lots of opportunity for that. ","We are working with a number of affiliates that have other alternative strategies to find ways to get them into sort of forms that can be used in these distribution channels. So I do think that trend has a bunch of legs. ","If there is sort of very strong equity market returns, I think over time we do think that will of course have some impact on behaviors and this should be more, as the risk trade comes back on maybe, there should be increasing allocations to equities. ","Will that come at the expense of what\u2019s happening in the alternative space? My personal view, I think it\u2019ll be a while before it really slowed it down dramatically, but at some point, sure, maybe.","Sean Healey","I think as we look more broadly, and you\u2019ve probably heard our peers say this, it seems inevitable that there will be a return and a shift back in the cycle toward positive equity market betas, as well as positive active equity flows and to the extent that that occurs and when it occurs, I think there\u2019s no question that we\u2019ll benefit across our affiliate group, but I think our point is that we are given how we are positioned. ","We are already generating industry-leading flows into return-oriented products and we see going forward to the extent that there\u2019s a broad increase in active equity flows, a continuation and even we would argue an acceleration of our growth, because we believe that increasingly investors as they return to risk assets and this is U.S. as well as global investors, as they return to risk assets. ","They will look increasingly not just to U.S. equity products but also to global and emerging market equities and also on an ongoing basis to alternative products and it\u2019s really that optimism about our ongoing organic growth capability that gives us a lot of confidence going forward about our growth potential. It\u2019s not just deals. We\u2019re growing faster from an organic growth standpoint than any of our peers and we see that going forward.","Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America","Great. Thank you.","Sean Healey","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. At this time there are no further questions. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Healey for closing comments.","Sean Healey","Thank you again for joining us this morning. As you\u2019ve heard, we are pleased with our results for the quarter and the year, especially given the market environment and confident in our prospects for continued growth ahead. We look forward to speaking with you again in April. Thanks.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.

(Operator Instructions) It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ally Lynn, Vice President for Corporate Strategy and Investor Relations.","Alexandra Lynn","Thank you for joining Affiliated Managers Group to discuss our results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2012. In this conference call, certain matters discussed will constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected due to a number of factors including, but not limited to, those referenced in the company's Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.","AMG will provide on its website, at www.amg.com, a replay of the call and a copy of our announcement of our results for the quarter, as well as a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.","With us on the line to discuss the company's results for the quarter are Sean Healey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Nate Dalton, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Jay Horgen, Chief Financial Officer.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Sean Healey.","Sean Healey","Thanks, Ally, and good morning, everyone. We were pleased to report record earnings for both the quarter and the full year period, with economic earnings per share of $2.55 for the fourth quarter and $7.71 for the full year, an increase of 16% over 2011. And assets under management were approximately $432 billion at yearend an increase of 32%.","Our excellent results for the quarter and year were driven by the strong investment performance and new business momentum of our affiliates as well as significant deployment of capital through our new investment strategy. We continue to benefit from our affiliates outstanding investment performance and our strategic focus on global and emerging markets equity and alternative products.","These return oriented product areas are increasingly in demand by global clients for the out-proportions of their portfolios, and unlike more scale-oriented product categories such as fixed income or passive equity in value-added product categories like global and emerging market equities and alternatives. Boutiques have a competitive advantage in generating excess returns and boutique firms, including our affiliates are recognized as among the best managers in the world.","For example, in global and emerging market equities, our largest affiliates in these categories, Tweedy, Browne, Genesis and Harding Loevner have substantially outperformed their peers and benchmarks in every relevant time period. While in the alternative area, affiliates such as Pantheon, ValueAct, AQR and BlueMountain offer a broad array of the most highly regarded alternative strategies in the industry, and their excellent performance generated meaningful performance fees in 2012.","Given their consistently excellent performance records across this diverse range of product categories and investment strategies, our affiliates are well positioned for continued strong organic growth. In addition, we anticipate and are seeing early signs of broad based reallocation to return oriented products by both retail and institutional investors.","We believe that the outsized flows into fixed income products over the past several years will inevitably reverse. And when that occurs, AMG will not be impacted by the decline of assets from fixed income outflows or the depreciation and value of fixed income products.","We continue to generate outstanding organic growth from net client flows, even against this industry backdrop of muted investor risk appetite. AMG's 11 consecutive quarters of strong positive net flows, including over $30 billion in 2012, reflect not only the excellent investment performance of our affiliates, but also the ongoing success of our global distribution strategy, which combine the affiliate level marketing and distribution with the scale and resources of a global asset manager.","For the past five years, we've been building our global platform in key markets around the world to extend the reach of our affiliates marketing efforts and the strategic investment we made in opening offices in Sydney, London, Hong Kong, Dubai, and now Zurich, has resulted in meaningful contributions to AMG's overall organic growth.","With new mandates won in every coverage region over the past 12 months and the enhanced depth and breadth of marketing coverage across our global platform, we see ongoing new business momentum and client demand for our affiliates industry leading products. And we are continuing to invest in our distribution platform worldwide with additional resources and key markets and client channels in the years ahead.","Turning to new investments. We were very pleased with the strong execution of our new investment strategy in 2012. With over $0.75 billion deployed over the course of the year, we added two outstanding new affiliates. Veritable, our first wealth partners affiliate, and Yacktman, a highly regarded value equity manager, and made a significant additional investment in renowned credit alternatives manager, BlueMountain.","Looking ahead, the transaction environment remains highly favorable to AMG and with our two decade long track record of successful partnerships, we are uniquely positioned to execute on our diverse opportunity set, including a broad array of traditional, alternative and wealth management firms.","Looking back on 2012, I'm very pleased with what we accomplished last year. Through the successful execution of our growth strategy, including the organic growth of our affiliates as well as partnering with new affiliates, we have continued to increase the scale, diversity and earnings power of our business. Looking forward, AMG is tremendously well positioned on a global basis across all elements of our growth strategy.","We will remain focused on our core strategy, but at the same time the increased breadth and scale of our business as well as our global reputation will continue to create additional avenues of growth, whether through extending the marketing reach of our affiliates in additional markets around the world, building strategic relationships with key global clients and enhancing capabilities across channels or deploying capital through a diverse array of new affiliate investments.","In this, the 20 anniversary of AMG's founding, even with the outstanding growth we've achieved to date, I know that the best days are still ahead of us and we're positioned to create substantial shareholder value in the years to come.","With that alternative, Nate to discuss our affiliate results in greater detail.","Nathaniel Dalton","Good morning, everyone. 2012 marked another year of significant growth for AMG. As Sean said, we continue to benefit from our strategic focus on global emerging markets equities and alternative investments. These are areas, where we see significant macro growth opportunities and our leading affiliates with products in these areas extended our outstanding investment track records last year.","Now, our continued strong investment performance combined with our robust global distribution strategy and resources resulted in another year of good net client cash flows in 2012, over $5 billion in the fourth quarter and $30 billion for the year. We've now had $55 billion of net positive client cash flows over the past two years, appeared when broad industry flow trends have favored fixed income and passive products.","Now, one point regarding the significant growth in passive allocations, generally, we believe that this is ultimately very good for truly differentiated return oriented managers, as clients are dividing their portfolios between passive exposures and alpha, which I would define broadly as including all the ways clients are taking risks to their actual return.","These so called barbell approaches clearly benefit providers of passive market data, but they also benefit the better providers of this extra return. Now, we view this as a long-term trend and believe that funds such as our performance oriented affiliates will continue to attract strong flows, as they have, even as passive product grow.","Now, turning to investment performance. In the global developed markets category, Tweedy, Browne's largest strategies outperformed on a relative basis for the year and remained well ahead of benchmarks across all irrelevant time periods. Harding Loevner also had a very good year overall with the global equity funds outperforming and remaining well ahead for the year in longer period. In addition, AQR, Artemis, Third Avenue and Trilogy each had a strong performance year in the category.","Turing to emerging markets. We had mixed performance in the quarter, performance track records for the full year and longer periods are very good. In fact, all the products managed by Genesis, Harding Loevner and AQR in the category are well ahead of their respective benchmarks for the one, three and five year periods.","Turning to alternatives category. We had strong performance among several of our largest products. We still have a meaningful performance fees for the year. Highlights included excellent performance from products at BlueMountain and ValueAct. At BlueMountain, the outstanding performance continued across all funds, including our flagship credit alternatives fund as well as our long\/short credit fund, while ValueAct had another great year with excellent performance across all their strategies.","Overall, we've been very broad, diverse, exposure to alternatives, including an array of products in each of private equity, infrastructure, credit, control oriented equity, global macro, market neutral, commodities and currencies, which are managed by some of the leading firms in their respective disciplines. While in any given year, performance and performance fees, they come from one set or another of these products. This diversity positions us extremely well for strong consistent performance free contributions going forward.","Now, turning to our U.S. equity products and starting on the value size. Tweedy brand generated outstanding performance in the quarter of systematic investment and more mixed quarter a year. On the growth side, our largest affiliates performed well across both short and long-term periods. Highlights here included the strong performance at Frontier and Times Square, where all of their products from small cap to all cap outperformed for both the quarter and year.","Now, turning to flows for the quarter. As I said, we had another strong quarter with $5.1 billion in positive net client cash flows, again coming principally in global equities, emerging markets equities and alternatives.","Starting with the institutional channel, we had positive flows of approximately $3.1 billion. These flows came mostly in those areas, global, emerging markets and alternatives with notable contributions from BlueMountain, AQR, Genesis, Harding Loevner and Pantheon. As we always say, flows in the institutional channel are inherently lumpy, and this quarter was no exception, as there were some great wins in the quarter, but also some rebalancing outflows at a few clients.","Moving to the mutual fund channel. We had positive flows of $1.9 billion, again continuing the positive trends we've had over the past several quarters and from a category standpoint, we had strong flows in the global and alternative strategies. The flows this quarter, once again included very strong flows in the subadvisory channel. In our high net worth channel, flows are about $30 million for the quarter. We had positive flows from GW&K, which continues to attract flows through their sales force is also a U.S. retail distribution platform. And our partners at GW&K have done a terrific job, building their business, since our investment in 2008.","Finally, turning to our overall global distribution efforts. 2012 was another terrific year of growth for us. We won significant new business in every one of our regions, Asia, Australia, Europe, the Middle East and of course in the U.S. with our retail and subadvisory efforts. As you know, our strategy is to identify those countries and regions, where we believe we can work closely with our affiliates to drive significant flows over time.","Each region generally takes a few years to really come on line, as we built traction with the highest quality prospects and intermediaries. As our penetration in the region takes hold, we can then deepen our exposure, both by geography and by channel it in a region.","For example, in the past couple of months, we strategically added experienced sales people in Switzerland and Germany to our European team, are opening an office in Zurich, and earlier last year opened a new office in Dubai to further strengthen our Middle East sales and client servicing efforts.","Looking ahead, we believe we are still in the early days of executing on the opportunity to come under distribution scope and scale of a global asset management firm with our broad array of outstanding performance oriented affiliates, and we remain confident in our ability to continue to generate significant organic growth going forward.","And with that, I'll turn it to Jay.","Jay Horgen","Thank you, Nate. As Sean and Nate discussed, our record 2012 results reflect AMG's industry-leading organic growth and the excellent execution of our new investment growth strategy. As you saw in the release, we reported economic earnings per share of $7.71 for 2012. For the quarter, we reported economic earnings per share of $2.55, which included net performance fees of $0.61. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings of $1.40 for the quarter.","Now, turning to more specific modeling items. The ratio of our EBITDA contribution to end of period assets under management was approximately 19.5 basis points in the fourth quarter, reflecting the strong contribution of performance fees. We expect this ratio to be approximately 15.25 basis points for the first quarter of 2013, and for the full year we expect it to be just under 16 basis points, which include the reasonable assumption for performance fees and organic growth.","Holding company expenses were approximately $29 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting final yearend expenses, and we expect them to return to approximately $23 million in the first quarter.","With regard to our taxes, our effective GAAP tax rate for the quarter was approximately 32% and our cash tax rate was approximately 27%. Going forward, we expect our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 34% and our cash tax rate to return to approximately 22%. Intangible-related deferred taxes for the fourth quarter were $17.5 million and we expect this number to return to approximately $14 million per quarter going forward.","Our share of reported amortization for the quarter was $26.5 million and together with $10.4 million of amortization from affiliates accounted for under the equity method, AMG's controlling interest portion of amortization was $36.9 million. We expect AMG's amortization to be approximately $35 million going forward.","Our portion of total interest expense for the fourth quarter was $33.3 million, including $9.1 million of pre-tax non-cash imputed interest expense. We expect our total interest expense to be approximately $31 million for the first quarter.","Now, turning to guidance. We are raising our 2013 guidance, as we expect economic earnings per share to be in the range of $8.60 to $9.50. Our guidance assumes our normal convention of actual market performance through yesterday for the current quarter and 2% quarterly market growth beginning in the second quarter.","We also assume our weighted average share count of approximately 54.5 million shares for 2013. The lower end of our 2013 guidance includes a modest contribution from performance fees and organic growth, while the upper end of the range assumes to be more robust contribution from both performance fees and net client cash flows.","As always, these assumptions do not include earnings from future new investments and are based on our current expectations of affiliate growth rates, performance and the mixed affiliate contributions to our earnings. Of course, substantial changes in markets and earnings contribution of our affiliates would impact these expectations.","Now, we will be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Craig Siegenthaler of Credit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse","Just walking through the potential uses of excess capital deployment this year, especially if you deploy less capital acquisitions than your current $500 million roughly free cash flow generations, how do you look at deploying capital into potential acquisitions versus deals and maybe even calling some of your convertible debt?","Sean Healey","As you know, we always over time, all things being equal, prefer to invest in new affiliates, and we look to take advantage of investment opportunities and outstanding firms. Whenever and wherever we find them and really without regard to what our excess capital, I wouldn't use that term. Whatever the available cash on the balance sheet is, it wouldn't really matter. Those opportunities are rare, and so we're focused on executing on them whenever we can.","Obviously, as you know, and virtually every year, that we've been public, we've repurchased equity. And so along the way I suspect that, that will be an element of our capital deployment as well, although we don't have a particular timeline or a target. Jay, do you want to add to on the convert?","Jay Horgen","I'm still on the convert, Craig. We do have the opportunity to call the convert this year. It's all right. It would be in August of this year and we can call it anytime after August as well just to make note of that. We have plenty of cash as you mentioned, to call it, as we approach kind of the middle of the year, I think we'll make a determination on our capital needs and opportunistically look to refinance part or all of that out, if that's course of the action.","And as we evidence by our debt offerings last year, we continue to have an excellent opportunity to access low cost of capital. And as we've said in prior calls, we are continuing to see our balance sheet evolve to more of a straightforward kind of simpler mix of debt and equity.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse","And then just as a reminder, what is the capacity left on the revolver today? And also, what's the notional amount on the equity forward sale on the strike price here?","Jay Horgen","Today we have virtually over $800 million of undrawn revolver plus the $500 million that we just talked about. In addition, the notional amount, but no shares issued of about 150 under the forward. So you add all those numbers up, it's close to $1.5 billion.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse","And can you remind us, what the strike price was on the 150 equity forward sale?","Jay Horgen","Yes, 122, thereabout.","Operator","Our next question comes from Daniel Fannon of Jefferies & Company.","Daniel Fannon - Jefferies & Company","Just in terms of the flows and thinking about 4Q and your outlook for next year. Maybe if there was anything going off that you might highlight that might have been on a more of the redemption side or negative or a delay, maybe in terms of decision making in 4Q? Then also just kind of characterize the backlog or conversation today versus various other points that you had in 2012?","Sean Healey","So I think I'll start by saying broadly the trends we've been seeing remain in place. If you start with looking back at the last quarter and then you sort of ticked up on it implicit in your question. Yes, there was a little bit of the tick up in redemption and there was especially in the institutional channel. I think that was some sort of idiosyncratic specific and rebalancing decisions that clients made.","And the things I would call out, I mean obviously, there is the broad stuff, but the things I would call out, some of that was mangers who've done very well, right. So it's sort of explicable, they've done very, very well and there were some rebalancing away. And some of them were just some portfolio rebalancing decisions, those kind of things, and I'm not sure is anything notable there that I would call out.","And then to the other question, which is I was looking forward. I guess again, probably break it down by channel is a way to talk about it. So institutional broad trends remain the same. We think, this had in our prepared remarks, investors are looking for ways to get returns into their portfolios with a broad array of differentiated return oriented managers.","So those broad trends remain there, and if you look at, whether it's searches, RFPs, finals all that, I think again the broad trends remain pretty consistent. I don't really have anything specific on the high net worth channel, but I think if you look sort of more to the retail side and Sean sort of mentioned this in his remark, if you look at the retail side that is the place where we like others have seen elevated positive equity flows this moment. It's very early in the quarter. It's only a couple of weeks all that, but that's only both U.S. equities and global equities, we've seen the pick up.","Jay Horgen","I think it's worth underscoring and I know you know this Dan that, when we talk about continued trends or continued momentum that really is quite unique in the industry. I mean, we now have 11 consecutive quarters of strong positive flows into return oriented products, not fixed income, not passive equity.","And so for us, the trends remain in place and what underlies them is the really outstanding performance of our affiliates that continues in these return oriented product categories especially, as well as the continued strong execution of our distribution strategy. And as we each mentioned, we see as we continue to build out that strategy globally, additional opportunities, additional avenues of growth, so that gives us even more confidence looking ahead.","Daniel Fannon - Jefferies & Company","And then, I guess just at the individual affiliate level, given the success you have been having, are there any capacity issues, maybe focusing more on the alternative guys that might be facing PKUMs?","Sean Healey","I think probably the best way to answer this is actually answer it in a broad level across the group, right. So there is certainly a few products, at capacity, over capacity is something they're seeing and they're managing flows carefully, and whether they're extending pipelines of flows out in the future and all that. So there is definitely some of those.","But in our view, if you start thinking about it in the high level that's much more than offset by new products coming online at a are really broad range of affiliate. So whether that's at a place like BlueMountain, where they're extending their product lines with things like their credit opportunities funds, they've launched one of those. There will certainly be others, whether it's a place like Pantheon, extending their co-investment vehicles and extending their infrastructure business. AQR has obviously launched a range of both new products and new packages.","Even on the equity side at Harding Loevner's is rolling its easiest version of global equities and emerging markets equities and Frontier equities. So there is plenty of new product, sort of coming online, that is again, in our view is sort of more than offset, but of course, you're right there will be given the success, there will always be places where one or the other, where capacity is something we have to manage.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Katz of Citigroup.","Bill Katz - Citigroup","On some of the rebalancing you highlighted, two-part question. So where are you seeing it coming from? And then the second question is, you've talked about the fact that you don't have the fixed income exposure, and certainly appreciative of that. Is there any concern about potential rotation out of global equity and emerging market back to domestic? And could there be a little bit of a mismatch on volumes, just given the relative sizes of the underlying portfolios you have in your affiliate mix?","Nathaniel Dalton","I'll try to go in order. So the first, I'm not sure, I really agree with the sort of starting premise. There were rebalancing. And I don't want to make too much out of it, but I do think they were at least in part, just sort of very idiosyncratic things. So I don't think I would, sort of look at those, and say, hey, there is some trends here.","I think the point I was trying to make is the flows in institutional are very lumpy and there were some on sort of both sides with this quarter, that's the first thing.","Then to the second part of the question, so speaking as said in earlier question, I think out where we see activity, right, so we can look back across the full pipeline, if you will. We're still seeing. And again, decision making cycles in institutional are long, but we're still seeing very good, high levels of activity, such as RFP's, finals and the one, the non-funded pipeline is looking very good. So we're seeing very good activity. It continues to be as we said, emerging, global, developed and alternatives in all the other areas.","So again, that's mostly an institutional comment. And then the one place where we have seen, again very short duration signals is on the retail side. But those have been both. As I said those have been both, U.S. and global equity, where we've seen good pickups and flows. Again Now again, all the caveats apply. That's three or four weeks of data. But where we've seen that change it's been both global and domestic, both.","Bill Katz - Citigroup","Just on that, maybe a follow-up. And then one for Jay after that. If you were to look at year-on-year instead of quarter-to-quarter, are you seeing the same kind of rotation, or is it more seasonal, in your mind?","Nathaniel Dalton","I'm not sure, you mean, just focused on the mutual fund?","Bill Katz - Citigroup","Yes, though, I think it's a rotation?","Nathaniel Dalton","So I have to be a little bit careful here, because again I'm focused on our products at, right. And our products set has also evolved a little bit year-on-year, probably from new investments and things like that. So I think it is different. I do. I think we're seeing good flows. That pickup and flow, I do think is stronger this year. I do think that's something we're seeing.","Sean Healey","I think again similar to that earlier question. I would just emphasize that first, our trend line and momentum is quite distinct from the industry. And so we're not seeing any of these trends that you suggest in your question that others might be seeing with a change or a slowdown in international. In fact, to the contrary, the AMG specific theme is that we're still building out our global distribution platform. And we saw at the end of last year, big wins in Asia, our Hong Kong office is still relatively new big wins in the Nordics.","And we're building out capabilities, Korea, Zurich office and Germany and Switzerland with dedicated focus coverage their. So we see continued trends and momentum in the extant regions. But as we continue to build out our distribution capabilities, we see additional opportunities for growth. And that's really unique, I think relative to the industry broadly.","Bill Katz - Citigroup","And then just one for maybe yourself and Jay, and maybe China, read through a few leaves here on the M&A opportunity. Jay, you mentioned that, as you get to the summary, you sort of reassess your capital planning needs. Does that imply that the deal pipeline is more in the early stage of discussions versus the latter stages, or is that reading too much into the commentary?","Jay Horgen","Well, let me say this and of course everybody is curious about the deal pipeline and tries understandably to read into nuances of what we say, sometimes where we don't intend nuances. If you sort of step back at the end of last year what happened. And I think this is largely based on market volatility through the year of political instability and uncertainty and the whole fiscal cliff issue. I think across the industry, there was less activity than what might have been expected.","As we look forward into 2013, I think it will be a very strong year for the industry, and I think it will be a very strong year for AMG. We entered the year with a very good pipeline. And if you sort of look forward and think about the broad trends and this will be 2013 and beyond. The first and most important when we're talking about boutique firms, we have demographic issues, demographically driven success in transactions or to some extent inevitable. They may not all go to AMG, but every boutique firm have to at some point have a solution to their demographically driven transition issues.","And what's important to understand is the base of firms that face these issues has expanded globally among traditional firms, but also includes an increasing number of alternative firms, also includes for us, wealth management firms.","Second thing to understand is that when you have a period of rising markets and relative stability, then those are the essential ingredients for an acceleration and activity. And it seems as if, certainly the year is beginning in that way. Obviously, if we have some event, which with renewed market volatility, that would have a chilling effect on transactions.","But it's important to understand, there has been a big build up of these potential transaction across the industry, and of course, for us as well. And so we're quite optimistic as we look forward. I'd also say, there are ongoing divestitures, and that's less of the theme for us, because we're highly selective and only a subset of those of the divested firms are really applicable to us.","But looking forward we are extremely optimistic. We have a very, very strong competitive position, really a unique position in the industry. It doesn't mean that every perspective transaction is appropriate for us, right. It's got to be the right kind of firm looking for our kind of solution.","And we are very, very selective. So it's always going to be a subset of the transactions out there. But that drop is very, very positive for our new investment activity. And that drives us as we think about allocating resources and positioning our capital. That's what's underlying those decisions.","Jay Horgen","Yes, I think the only other thing I was going to say that my comment was just really around the convertible, Bill, so it was not meant to be a more, a broader statement. It was just a convertible's call going August.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Kim with Sandler O'Neill.","Michael Kim - Sandler O'Neill","First, not to be the dead horse but, Sean, just curious to get your take on kind of the recent step-up in flows into equity, mutual funds, so how much of that do you think is more tactical in nature versus maybe more durable shift in allocation trends? And then assuming investors continue to move up the risk curve, how do you see your flow trends kind of playing out as you look across your product capabilities and your affiliate base.","Sean Healey","As we have said, we think that a broad based reallocation from fixed income into risk assets is inevitable. Whether we're seeing it now is uncertain. Certainly, there is anecdotal information in the industry trends broadly, and we have seen anecdotally some evidence that this is occurring.","Otherwise, I must say that the moment that this becomes conventional wisdom, and people start talking about the corporate rotation and everybody thinks this is the year. It makes me wonder, whether this might not be the year, either it might be little ways off. So the honest answer is no one knows. No one knows in the short term and we will see.","The thing that I do know, for a certainty, is that such a broad based reallocation to risk assets is not factored in to our guidance and to the extent that occurs, that is a huge positive for us. Because we're a firm with no fixed income, with very little fixed income exposure. No core fixed income exposure. And so our product set is ideally positioned for a broad reallocation rotation into risk assets.","And then from a sort of competitive standpoint, if you will, we're pleased that we're in a position over the past five years, we've been asked a number of times why we don't have more fixed income. And I think maybe, five years ago, we would have wanted more, but now given where we see industry trends, whenever this great rotation occurs, we know that we have; a, have a product set that is ideally positioned for future investor demand, retail, and institutional.","And we also know that what we don't have is a product set that is going to be subject to fixed income that is going to be subject to outflows and depreciations. So that gives us a degree of confidence. And as the trends are the same that they've been through the past couple of years, we're very confident in how our business is positioned, and our ongoing momentum. And to the extent that you believe that now is the time, as everybody seems to be saying that, that so much the better, much better for us.","Michael Kim - Sandler O'Neill","Then on the deal front, I know they offer a very different value proposition, so to speak, but it does seem like private equity money is maybe coming more into play, particularly with the availability of financing. So just wondering, how that could potentially impact the competitive environment for deals more broadly or is that not really an issue for you guys just given your structure?","Jay Horgen","Well, I think one of the benefits of this being our 20-anniversary as a company, is that we have been through market cycles and we've been through periods of various different competitor types coming to the floor. Private equity has been around for the whole duration. And I must say, relative to European banks paying 20 times EBITDA, which we lived through a little period like that.","Private equity tends to be rational and relatively disciplined in the pricing. And then, the most important point is that it is a completely different model. I think it's appropriate for firms that anticipate and desire as second-stage transaction. So they need somebody to come in, and maybe, help them change some things about their business. And then, shortly thereafter, they want to go public or they want to sell to somebody else. It makes sense there.","If you're talking about a boutique asset management firm, which has demographically driven succession issues, what they want is a solution that is a permanent solution. They don't wanted to have to go back to their clients a few years later, and say, we're back and now we're doing a different transaction. It's just a poor fit with the kinds of firms that we're interested in partnering with.","And so we end up, while they are contextually, competitors just like banks. And when banks were buying were competitors, it really is a very different transaction type. And so we don't end up competing with them, except in a few very isolated situations.","Michael Kim - Sandler O'Neill","And then just maybe one final one for Nate, obviously, momentum across the global distribution platform continues to build, but would it be possible that maybe we could get some color on where you kind of see the biggest opportunities, within some of the markets where you've been the longest, or maybe Australia and Europe in particular?","Nathaniel Dalton","Sure. And Sean actually had covered a little bit of this already, which is we'll step back, what we're doing is remarrying excellent performance-oriented boutiques, with the scope and scale of global distribution platform, right that's the broad thing. And we're certainly seeing new regions that we can go into as we have with our existing regions. And each time we enter one, there is a curve where they grow. And we see opportunities to keep doing that and you will see us do that.","But where we see huge opportunities in the shorter-term or for more focused resources within the broad region, an example, where we have really done this and already executed was we added someone in the Nordics, great folks in the Nordics, kind of 18 or so months ago. And that's already, really producing, and that's faster than going to new region as an example. And we're now adding Germany and Switzerland.","So there is definitely one team right there, which is much greater, more focused-resources within broad region, Europe especially, where we're really focusing. And then the other place, you're going to see us adding some resources. Again, we'll only do this when we see really good return opportunities, like you'll see us add resources to diversify channels within places where we're already seeing greater results.","And you mentioned Australia, and that's an example, where we see, where we've had some very good success over the years. But we do see some opportunity to specialize by channel there. And the kind of thing where we could see, make it a small incremental investment and get returns in terms of new flows, a bit faster than going to new region. So those are the things you will absolutely see us doing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cynthia Mayer of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Question on the fee rate, if I look at your management fees, from majority owned affiliates. It looks like the average ticked down. I'd say, it's little hard to see because it's a performance fee quarter, but can you give us a sense of where the blended fee rate is now, ex-performance fees and where you see that going?","Sean Healey","Nate can help me on this, Cynthia. I think the first comment is kind of taking a step back on fee rates. The actual calculation has as much to do with the ownership of our affiliates and which affiliates are growing, which once are not within the consolidate affiliates, being mindful that only as a portion of our total affiliate base, because the equity method has, as many as, seven additional affiliates in that category.","So we really don't look at our business on this basis. And maybe Nate can comment on just fee rates generally, but it's not our fee rates going up or down. It has more to do with the ownership rates and the combination of all the factors.","Nathaniel Dalton","So to extent the question is what are we seeing happened with the fee rates across the whole book. There are definitely isolated instances where you're seeing some fee pressure. But the broad comment I'd make is for differentiated managers with good performance track records. We're seeing plenty of demand and ultimately that's really what it is, it's just supply and demand.","I think the demand point is, and this is echo something Sean said earlier, the demand point is it's not only all the places where we're seeing it right now, but we are bringing these products into new regions. And in the main, we're not really seeing any issues on the fee side getting consistently high fee rates.","Jay Horgen","And then to kind of capital loss, Cynthia, when you look at our EBITDA contribution to sort of the end of period assets under management you see that that level being stable or maybe even ticking up a little bit. So that is really reflective of some of the growth and some of our higher fee rate businesses like the odds segment. It's interesting that actually occurred. And remember EBITDA contribution for us is representative of our revenue share of those affiliates.","Sean Healey","And so only thing I'd add is some of those partner business that are fast growing, you have to certainly think about those full effective fee rate including the expected performance fee component of that, right. So some of that is sort of more episodic, either backend loaded to the fourth quarter or just episodic. Some of those seem to be multiyear too.","Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Multi-year fee, is that you're saying?","Sean Healey","Yes.","Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Well, since you bring it up, are you expecting any difference in multi-payouts at multiyear fees, say this year versus less?","Nathaniel Dalton","No. I don't think I would characterize it that way, the only way of making, as I do think as the alts part of the business is going to perform and see, part of the business is growing. Obviously it's part of that.","Cynthia Mayer - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I understand you look at it more as EBITDA than fee rate. Maybe just one question on the guidance, correct me if I'm wrong, but it sound like you lifted a little bit less than the equity markets have gone up since you last gave guidance. Is there some offset there or is that conservatism or maybe the combination of alts, which wouldn't be geared directly of S&P?","Jay Horgen","I think we're reflecting fully on our market blends, so I think maybe one place that's a little different. It's just, remember you might see some metric equity market up a percentage, but not all of our affiliates are tied directly to equity data. So for example, Pantheon is not, so I think you have to remember that there is a factor there. So far, this quarter we've seen our blend to up about 3.3%, which incorporates all of the different types of the affiliates that we have.","The only other thing I would say is, we did mentioned that share count is up about 0.5 million shares from the last time we gave guidance. So there is a little bit of an effect of that, but generally speaking sort of the answer to your question is, no, we fully reflected our market blend and the share count, and indeed increased beyond that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Shutler with William Blair.","Chris Shutler - William Blair","One more on the pipeline, so if you look at the pipeline or prospects that maybe are a little bit more near-term in that pipeline. How do you think that the upper trajectory of the markets that were so far this year really impacts their timing? I mean, obviously, it's going vary on a case-by-case basis, but just broadly, do you think that positive markets cause sellers to hold out a little longer or do you feel like you're ability to maybe structure deals in various ways essentially neutralizes that kind of thinking?","Sean Healey","Well, the first thing to say is that your question which is a fair question is really only applicable to a subset of our opportunities. In other words, alternative firms aren't really affected by equity market moves necessarily. I think broad stability is positive for all transaction types, but the equity markets wouldn't necessarily affect an alternative manager. Similarly with wealth mangers, they're of course, going to get a benefit. But it's going to be a little bit more muted than it would be with the pure equity manager.","And even among equity managers, I would say if they make the decision to proceed than they will absent typically extreme negative volatility in the markets continue ahead. And we've got lots of experience as you can imagine designing a structure or adjusting our structure to take account of settings whether it might be extreme volatility or usually it's a large anticipated funding from a new client, let's say.","So it doesn't really pose an issue for us. And I would say, as I said earlier, that broadly speaking the backdrop both in terms of the number of high-quality firms which need a succession solution as well as the equity markets and the relative stability in the markets, so far is that that backdrop is extremely positive.","Chris Shutler - William Blair","When you guys look at the flows over the last year, can you give us some sense of how concentrated those flows have been if you look at them on kind of a client level, meaning if you take the top, let's say, handful of clients, where you've institutional wins over last year. Would those clients represent a meaningful percentage of the flows or is that very widely are distributed?","Nathaniel Dalton","The highest level comment would be it's widely distributed. But no, there have been some good significant positive flows. And we've built some significant multi-affiliate relationships with some significant clients around the world. So again, you have to think about it sort of both ways, even though a single mandate may not be fruitful, if we have good success with the some large institutions, we're now in a place. ","And this is also absolutely a by-product of the success we're have in global distribution, where we're able to build relationships between our guys in a region and some of these clients where we're able to then play multiple affiliates into this conversation. So again, we're having some good success, but those are multiple mandates at single relationships. And so that's good. But look the highest level has been very broad based.","Chris Shutler - William Blair","So from that standpoint, it sounds like you're having more significant conversations with not fewer players, but more affiliates with a concentrated number of players. I mean, is that something that you're come back to continue, I guess? That could be a very good thing, because it could improve the visibility in the model certainly?","Jay Horgen","I think it's a good thing. But let me go back please, and make one really important point here which is there is no real element of this concentrating, right, because at the same time that we are building these very high-quality, multi-affiliate relationships at some of the largest clients and prospects. The important thing is its clients and the prospects, right.","So now there are some of these relationships, the number of these relationships that we've build compared to the number of these relationships we can build, this goes back to the early days comment, right, we're still at the very early days. We are doing within the regions we've been in. This is a long process, right. These kinds of relationships don't get built overnight. These are long process involving lots of different levels at AMG, right.","So this involves, Sean on the road, and all the rest of it. So those are ongoing. We have had some good success at some small number of the potential prospects. But there is a very large number of these that we are still in that process with, and there is a large number of them that we haven't even really started that process with. And so it is good. What we've done is good. It does elevate the recognition and all of that. But there is a lot more that we can do here.","Sean Healey","I would agree with all of that certainly, and add to it the following. If you take a large sovereign wealth fund as a generic client type, and obviously, there are lots of them around and you have to deal with them on a specific client basis, and different clients, different regions, vary tremendously. But if I can generalize, it takes longer to explain our approach, because we have more complicated model, and so it's at the most senior levels of AMG, building a relationship.","Its AMG regional personnel building a relationship, it's each affiliates product team and often sales and marketing team building a relationship. And then when we have a strategic relationship when we get individual mandates that come out of that relationship, the great advantage to our structure.","If the disadvantage is, it takes a little longer and is more complicated to explain, because we don't have a single brand. Clients understand both that we can, in different product categories, let's say emerging market equities or various alternative categories. We have a number of affiliates with similar products and we have more ways to win.","We have a broader product base than you would expect even given our scale. And as well because the clients ultimately are choosing individual affiliates products, they understand that what happens with one affiliate isn't necessarily, let's say, that they under perform, that doesn't necessarily say anything about what another affiliate does. So I think both, we have more opportunities to scale our business overtime with large clients around the world. But it also is a more stable and defensively position business strategy.","Operator","It appears we have no further questions at this time. I would now like to pass the floor back to Sean Healey for closing comments.","Sean Healey","Thank you again for joining us this morning. As you've heard, we're pleased with our results for the quarter and the year, and we're confident in our prospects for a continued strong growth ahead. We look forward to speaking with you in April.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Alexandra Lynn, Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Investor Relations. Thank you. Ms. Lynn, you may now begin.","Alexandra Lynn","Thank you for joining Affiliated Managers Group to discuss our results for the second quarter and first half of 2013. In this conference call, certain matters discussed will constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those referenced in the company's Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. AMG will provide on its website, at www.amg.com, a replay of the call and a copy of our announcement of our results for the quarter as well as the reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.","With us on the line to discuss the company's results for the quarter are Sean Healey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Nate Dalton, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Jay Horgen, Chief Financial Officer.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Sean Healey.","Sean M. Healey","Thanks, Ally, and good morning, everyone. AMG reported economic earnings per share of $2.18 for the second quarter of 2013, which is a 31% increase over the same period of last year while our assets under management, now approximately $470 billion, grew by 22% year-over-year. Our results were driven by continued strong business momentum with outstanding organic growth from net client cash flows and excellent investment performance across our equity and alternative product set.","We've generated a record $13 billion of net client cash flows in the second quarter, which was our 13th consecutive quarter of strong positive net flows. Through the quality of our Affiliates and the diversity of our business across market beta exposures, product areas and client geographies and channels, AMG has consistently generated strong organic growth over the past 3 years through varying market environments, including periods of volatility. For example, even on a difficult quarter for emerging markets equities, our Affiliates in this area continue to generate meaningful net inflows and we remain confident that this will be an area of strong secular growth over time.","As in prior quarters, our flows were broadly distributed across our equity and alternative product set and positive across all channels and all client geographies including Asia, Australia, Europe, the Middle East and, of course, the U.S. Our success in generating organic growth reflects both the marketing efforts of our Affiliates, as well as a meaningful contribution from our global distribution platform, including new mandates through every covered region during the quarter.","We are continuing to make strategic investments to build on the success of our global distribution platform and further enhance the marketing reach of our Affiliates by expanding the breadth and depth of our capabilities with additional coverage and personnel in key markets and channels around the world.","In particular, as Nate will describe further, we see substantial opportunities in the U.S. retail channel and continue to focus on broadening our capabilities in this area.","Our results reflect the ongoing success of our strategic focus on high value-added, alpha-generating products across the U.S., global and emerging market equities and alternatives. Boutique firms have a competitive advantage in these areas and our boutique Affiliates are recognized worldwide as leaders in their respective disciplines including U.S. equity managers such as Yacktman and TimesSquare; global and emerging market equity managers Tweedy, Browne; Harding Loevner; Genesis and Artemis; and Pantheon, ValueAct, BlueMountain and AQR across an array of alternatives strategies.","Given our Affiliates' exceptional long-term track records of investment performance, we are seeing strong demand from clients around the world for these differentiated, value-added strategies as 2 key trends continue to unfold: first, the ongoing globalization of client portfolios; and second, the separation of clients portfolios between beta and alpha and the accompanying migration away from equity products in the index-hugging middle. These trends benefit not only providers of passive beta but also active managers such as our Affiliates, which offer value-added equity and alternative products, which can generate true alpha for the active side of client strategies.","Finally, to the extent that there's a broader rotation by global clients, including especially U.S. retail clients, away from fixed income and toward return-oriented products, this shift will generate strong incremental growth for AMG, on top of the organic growth we've been generating already. While this so-called great rotation is not yet upon us, we believe a return to performance-oriented products is inevitable and recent industry flow trends have begun to evidence signs of a reallocation. And as you saw this past quarter, in a rising rate environment, AMG will not be impacted by the decline of assets from fixed-income outflows or the value depreciation of fixed income products.","Turning to new investments. Notwithstanding recent market volatility, we continue to make progress toward adding outstanding new Affiliates. As always, we remain extremely selective in choosing new Affiliates. And through our consistent calling effort, we've built proprietary relationships with the best boutique firms worldwide, virtually all of which will inevitably face the need for a succession planning solution. Given AMG's unique partnership approach and 20-year track record of investing in boutique asset management firms, we are very confident in our ability to continue to generate meaningful incremental shareholder value through accretive investments in new Affiliates.","With that, I'll turn it to Nate to discuss our Affiliates in further detail.","Nathaniel Dalton","Thanks, Sean. Good morning, everyone. As you saw in the release, we had another outstanding quarter with record net client cash flows and strong relative investment performance. Our results for the second quarter illustrate the themes we've been talking about for several years now. By far, the most important component of our ongoing success remains the investment performance of our high-quality, diverse group of Affiliates, which are focused on truly differentiated return-oriented investment discipline. As you know, we have multiple outstanding products across a broad array of Affiliates in global, U.S. and other developed markets equities, emerging markets equities and a diverse range of alternative products. We also believe that there is some significant favorable macro trends.","First, as Sean described, clients are increasing allocations to focus performance oriented managers such as our Affiliates for the alpha portions of their portfolios. Second, while the timing remains uncertain, clients need to increase their allocation to return-oriented asset classes in order to achieve their objectives. Regardless of whether or not a great rotation has started, we are confident that these increased allocations will occur, creating significant additional opportunities for a number of our Affiliates.","Now while these macro trends are taking place, we continue to build out our distribution platform to increase our organic growth. We've taken a very strategic approach to leveraging AMG's scale to successfully bring our Affiliates products to clients located around the world. As you know, outside the U.S., our distribution platform focuses primarily on institutional clients. However, we see a very significant incremental opportunity in more retail parts of the markets and, in particular, the U.S. retail markets. Now the natural extension of our U.S. retail platform and to take advantage of the macro trends I referenced, we're increasing our strategic focus on U.S. retail and beginning to add additional resources.","In terms of investment performance in the quarter, our U.S. equity products had generally good, relative and absolute performance, with the highlight being continued exceptional performance at Yacktman. For the year and longer periods, the vast majority of our U.S. equity products at Affiliates, including AQR; GW&K; Tweedy, Browne; TimesSquare; and Yacktman are well ahead of their benchmarks.","Turning to the rest of our global developed markets category. While benchmarks were mixed for the quarter, our Affiliates generated good relative results. Highlights for the quarter included strong investment performance from significant products at AQR, Artemis, Harding Loevner and Third Avenue. While Tweedy, Browne had mixed performance for the quarter, all of their products remained well ahead of their benchmarks for long-term periods.","In the emerging markets category, while the broader market and industries were down significantly, our Affiliates have very strong relative investment performance, and track records for the full year and longer periods remain excellent. In fact, all the major projects managed by Genesis and Harding Loevner are well ahead of their respective benchmarks for the quarter 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods. While Trilogy's emerging markets products underperformed in the quarter, AQR, on the other hand, had a very strong quarter in its EM equity products and continues to build an excellent long-term track record.","Turning to our alternatives product category. In the quarter, we had strong performance across a significant number of products including at AQR, BlueMountain, First Quadrant and ValueAct. This continuing strong performance across our alternative product set, combined with good performance from some traditional products with performance fee structures, resulted in incremental performance fees being earned in the second quarter. Now while most of our performance fees are earned in the fourth quarter, as you can see, there are increasing numbers spread across the year. Fees in the second quarter were broad-based across a number of Affiliates and product areas, both beta exposed as well as absolute return-oriented, and including Genesis, First Quadrant, ValueAct and BlueMountain.","Stepping back for a minute, this quarter really illustrates the strength and diversity of our exposure to performance fees. While in any given quarter a year, performance and performance fees may come from 1 set or another for products, this diversity positions us extremely well for consistent, meaningful performance fee contributions going forward.","Now turning to flows for the quarter. As I've said, we had another terrific quarter with $13.2 billion in positive net client cash flows. While that headline number is another record for us, as we emphasized on every call, flows, especially in the institutional and sub-advisory channels, are inherently lumpy. In the second quarter, we had some very significant wins but also a couple of significant outflows. That being said, for the past 3 years, we have generated consistently strong flows across a wide range of Affiliates and we see this momentum continuing.","Turning to the channel review and starting with the Institutional channel, we had positive flows of approximately $4.6 billion. These flows came in U.S., global and emerging markets products and alternatives strategies with notable contributions from BlueMountain, Beutel Goodman, AQR, Genesis, Harding Loevner and Frontier. Similar to previous quarters, this was the quarter with a number of high-quality wins coming from leading institutions located around the world. While we spoke about this a bit last quarter, we continue to see an increasing number of U.S. equity mandates being funded by institutions outside of the U.S.","Moving to the Mutual Fund channel. We have positive flows of $8.3 billion. From a product category standpoint, we had strong flows in the U.S. equities as well as global and alternatives strategies. This quarter, once again, included strong sub-advisory flows including a couple of very large mandates. The breakdown of flows in the Mutual Fund channel was also very broad as the number of Affiliates make significant contributions including AQR; Artemis; Harding Loevner; Tweedy, Browne; Frontiers; Systematic; Aston; and Yacktman.","In our High Net Worth channel, flows were about $300 million for the quarter. The most significant contributors for the quarter included Harding Loevner as well as GW&K, which continues to attract flows through their sales force as well as for our U.S. retail distribution platform.","Finally, turning to an update of our global distribution platforms, which complement our Affiliates dedicated marketing efforts. We continue to generate strong flows among a diversified set of products and across geographies. In fact, as Sean said, we have significant mandates fund in every one of our region. We continue to look to selectively enhance our regional coverage with senior level sales and marketing professionals, expand into new channels in the geographies where we currently operate and make progress by identifying additional geographies for future expansion.","In particular, as I mentioned earlier, we are focused on the significant additional opportunities we see in the U.S. retail market and expect to accelerate the growth of this already scaled platform over time. Looking ahead, as our Affiliates maintain their excellent long-term performance records and as we continue to see strong global demand for performance-oriented products, we are confident we can continue to generate strong organic growth.","And with that, I'll turn to Jay to discuss our financials.","Jay C. Horgen","Thank you, Nate. As Sean and Nate discussed, we are pleased with our second quarter results, which reflect our continued outstanding organic growth as well as the strength and diversity of our Affiliates. As you saw in the release, we reported economic earnings per share of $2.18 for the second quarter with net performance fees contributing $0.15. On a GAAP basis, we reported $1.18 for the quarter.","Turning to more specific modeling items. The ratio of our EBITDA contribution to end-of-period assets under management was approximately 16.8 basis points in the second quarter. We expect this ratio to return to approximately 15 basis points for the third quarter and, for the full year, we expect it to be approximately 16.2 basis points, which include a reasonable assumption for performance fees.","Holding company expenses were $24.1 million in the second quarter and we expect them to remain at this level for the third quarter. With regard to our taxes, our effective GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 35.8% and our cash tax rate was 19.7%. In the third quarter, we expect our GAAP tax rate to decline to approximately 30% as a result of a further decrease in the U.K. tax rate, and we expect our cash tax rate to be approximately 28%. For the fourth quarter, we expect our GAAP tax rate to return to 36% and our cash tax rate to be approximately 26%.","Intangible-related deferred taxes for the second quarter were $12.3 million. We expect this number to be approximately $5.6 million for the third quarter, reflecting the U.K. rate change, and expect it to return to approximately $14 million in the fourth quarter. Our share reported amortization for the quarter was 27.8 million and, together with 10.3 million of amortization from Affiliates accounted for under the equity method, AMG's controlling interest portion of amortization was $38.1 million. We expect AMG's amortization to remain at approximately $38 million for the third quarter.","Our interest expense for the second quarter was $32.7 million, including $8.4 million of pretax noncash computed interest expense. We expect our total interest expense to decline to approximately $25 million for the third quarter, including $4.3 million of pretax noncash computed interest expense.","Turning to our balance sheet. As we have indicated in prior quarters, as part of our ongoing effort to simplify our balance sheet and reduce our cost of capital, we are retiring our senior convertible. In June and July, we repurchased approximately $80 million in face value convertibles and we have submitted a notice to call the remaining $380 million in August. While we have the flexibility to settle in cash or shares, we expect to deliver cash.","Also in the quarter, our credit rating was upgraded to BBB, reflecting the scale, growth and diversity of our business. With our $1.25 billion revolver and well over $0.5 billion of annual cash flow, we continue to have ample capacity to execute on our growth strategy.","Now turning to guidance. We are raising our 2013 guidance as we expect the economic earnings per share to be in the range of $9 to $9.70. Our guidance assumes our normal convention of actual market performance through yesterday for the current quarter and 2% quarterly market growth beginning in the fourth quarter. We also assume a weighted average share count of approximately 55 million for 2013, which includes the cash settlement of our senior convertibles.","The lower end of our 2013 guidance includes a modest incremental contribution from performance fees and organic growth while the upper end of the range assumes a more robust contribution from both performance fees and net client cash flows. As always, these assumptions do not include earnings from future new investments and are based on our current expectation of Affiliate growth rates, performance, and the mix of Affiliate contribution to our earnings. Of course, substantial changes in the market and earnings contribution of our Affiliates would impact these expectations.","Now we'll be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Sir, I heard the guidance related to share count for 2013. I'm just wondering, given how much free cash flow you're generating now, is there any potential to take out the dilutive impacts of the equity forward sale? And also, what are your thoughts on mixing kind of buyback into the capital return mix, especially if you're doing maybe 1 deal a year going forward here?","Jay C. Horgen","So Craig, it's Jay. Let me just take a step back. Clearly, just on the balance sheet, broadly, we continue to position our balance sheet for simplicity, flexibility and capacity. And I think we noted and we have noted that we've lowered our cost of capital this year both through our upgrade as well as the retirement of the senior convertible. And then looking forward, we do have nearly $600 million of after-tax earnings and $1 billion in the quarter of revolver. It affords us the opportunity to not only execute on new investments, which is meaningful -- new investments meaningfully accretive to our earnings, but also we will consider reducing our share count through either share repurchase or the forward on the line.","Sean M. Healey","And just for the record, Craig, we don't like hypotheticals generally, but I definitely don't like your hypothetical about 1 deal a year. We see a very substantial opportunity over the medium- to long-term without trying to time it in the short-term.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got it. And so just a follow-up here, as you become bigger and each of these deals potentially come smaller, if you're still looking at asset managers $10 billion to $20 billion AUM, they're going to be less accretive and require less capital cash upfront, what are your thoughts on, at some point, introducing kind of a nominal dividend as a way to return cash flow to shareholders still?","Sean M. Healey","Well, I think, if you trace the evolution of AMG, we obviously started from nothing and built through the early years as a public company including through the issuance of hybrid securities. There are periods where we didn't want to issue common equity and, obviously, didn't have a large base of cash flow to fund new investments. As we, following the financial crisis, have continued to build our business and generate now a relatively large -- have a large base of recurring and growing cash flow, that, of course, is available to fund new investments. And I think, if we're in the sort of $500 million to $600 million range, we obviously have had many years and expect years in the future where we will have well more than that in terms of new investments. Last year, we had, for example, $750 million in new investments. The question about how the world changes for us and how we look as the company that has $1.5 billion in EBITDA, how we think about capital management and how that affects our new investment strategy, we'll have the same strategy. We'll put the same amount of money to work, maybe more money to work in some years, our position keeps getting stronger and there are still a very large number of outstanding firms for us to invest in. But of course, inevitably, we will find years where we can't put all the cash the business generates to work and in that event, we'll be an even more active re-purchaser of our equity. And we are certainly considering and, I would expect at some point, would have a dividend. But there's no specific plan around that.","Operator","Our next question this coming from the line of Daniel Fannon with Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I guess just looking at the quarter, wondering if you could talk about the progression of flows throughout the period and if there was any real slowdown given the macro impacts of June, or if there's been any changes as we've kind of gone in to July in terms of your inflows.","Nathaniel Dalton","Okay. So I think the biggest -- this is Nate, the biggest thing I'd say is, obviously, the lumpy nature of some of the institutional sub-advisory flows, dwarfs the kinds of things you're talking about there were in some product categories. Again, they tended not to be places where we had -- in the main, where we had that much exposure. But if you look at something like -- I'll pick a detail, if you look at something like muni bonds, for example, you would have seen strong first 2 months and then sort of tail off in the third. But I think there's no -- all of those things are sort of dwarfed, as I said, by the bigger sized wins. To the second half of your questions or looking forward, I think we see a really strong -- again, it's a little -- practically it's very early days but both within the Institutional channel and on the more retail side, we see those strong flow patterns continuing.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And I guess that would imply that the demand for the non-U.S.-based investor for your products still remains quite strong.","Nathaniel Dalton","Absolutely.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And then, I guess, a follow-up just on the distribution, you talked about the U.S. retail being a focus of improvement or investment. And can you talk about what you're looking to do there? Is that just adding additional personnel or there are other things you're looking changing or improving?","Nathaniel Dalton","Sure. So let me say one thing to start right. So the basic model, right, is -- for all of our distribution is to bring the benefits of scale where scale matters, and it's helpful without getting in delay. So at this stage, I'd say, the main thing we're still doing is figuring out how exactly to position that business. I mean, we already do have a scale retail business in the U.S., but the main thing we're still doing is figuring out how to position that business given the macro trends that Sean described. We are beginning to make some incremental investments and we expect to do more. But the exact shape of that, I mean, again, the fundamental principle is how do we get the scale that we have and keep adding scale to it to benefit our Affiliates ahead of these trends that we see.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Michael Kim with Sandler O'Neill.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","First, just on the deal front, I know timing is always difficult to predict, but just to play devil's advocate, it seems like you've been pretty optimistic on putting capital to work for quite some time. So just wondering if there's anything more specific that you could point to as a reason why you haven't announced any transactions for a while or is it really just a function of markets continuing to trend higher here in the U.S. combined with maybe some volatility overseas?","Sean M. Healey","Well, I think volatility is certainly a factor. But as you heard, we remain very optimistic about our prospects. The short-term is inherently difficult to predict around the pace and timing of new investments, and so we don't really try to guide in the short term. I the medium- to long-term, we see enormous opportunities. And maybe to give you a sense of what you can't see from the outside, we have relationships that we have developed over many years with many of and, I'd say, most of the very best boutique firms worldwide. I've been, in the past 6 months, in 11 countries. And 10 of those, I've met with prospective Affiliates. It's an increasingly global, increasingly broad traditional as well as alternative prospect universe and our position has never been stronger. And so what we have learned over the years is that we need to be patient and wait for the opportunities with the very best firms to develop, which they, as we said, inevitably will because all of these firms will inevitably face succession planning need and want some kind of a transaction to solve that, and we are ideally positioned for that. So I don't worry about -- we don't worry about the short-term quarter-to-quarter impact really at all because we know that the important thing is to wait for the very best opportunities. And our position and opportunity set is -- continues to be outstanding.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then I know it's still a ways to go here but just given the step-up in performance fees in the second quarter and some of the strong absolute and relative returns that you highlighted across of what seems like a pretty diverse set of Affiliates and strategies, just curious to get your take on the outlook as you look out to the fourth quarter and beyond and just kind of thinking about the mix of performance fees going forward.","Sean M. Healey","Jay, why don't...","Jay C. Horgen","Yes, I'll start on the current year and then maybe Nate or Sean will do the outlook. I guess, Michael, just as Nate had said, our performance fee opportunity is growing and it's diverse across products and, I'll just add, across structures as well. Our Affiliates have continued to produce excellent investment performance, which is obviously the critical agreement of -- ingredient to the performance fee itself. So we believe that performance fees will continue to contribute in a consistent and meaningful way to our earnings. And as we said in the past, in just a typical year, we see performance fee in the 5% to 10% range of our economic earnings. Of course, this year, with the $0.15 in this quarter and the $0.25 in the first quarter, we've already booked $0.40. So this year, we can't go below $0.40. And in good years, we can see that go beyond 10%. And I think we're well positioned, still early in the year, but with already $0.40 in the bank and then looking forward, there is a good opportunity for us this year.","Nathaniel Dalton","And in terms of looking forward, I mean, I think Jay sort of captured that, which is the book is very broad both across Affiliates and then certainly even within Affiliates, across strategies, this trend towards including maybe more in across different quarters is, I think, a very positive thing. And then the book is just growing, partly it's just the organic growth of these businesses, some of it's also new product coming online and all the rest of it. So yes, the opportunity set keeps growing. I mean, the base business keeps growing as well, but the opportunity set for performance fees keeps growing. And it is -- again, I'd echo, it's a very broad book across both firms and strategies.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Got it. And then just finally, any update on Veritable in the wealth management platform now that it's been about a year since that deal closed. And then more broadly, just curious to get your thoughts on just the outlook in terms of potentially adding more Affiliates in wealth management?","Sean M. Healey","Well, Veritable is doing very well. We're quite pleased with that investment, and I think the partnership is doing great. The wealth partners team is hard at work, they have a strong pipeline. I'm obviously not going to comment beyond that but we feel terrific about their prospects. I think, inevitably, given the growth of our base business and the size of the new investment opportunity set amongst asset management boutiques, wealth management is never going to be a huge piece of our earnings picture. But we think it's a terrific opportunity and I'm very pleased with the progress that the team is making.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Cynthia Mayer with Bank of America.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So on the proposed increase in the U.S. retail sales, what -- can you talk a little about what specifically you'll be adding and over what time period? And also maybe I missed this, but why, in particular, now?","Nathaniel Dalton","Well, of the U.S. -- so I don't think we can -- as I said in answer to an earlier question, I think at this stage where the lot of what we're still doing is sorting out exactly how we're going to position this business ahead of the trends that we see, which is the second part of your question, I think we think, as re-risking happens, as people move more assets to return-oriented asset classes, we think the opportunity to participate in that on the retail side is really significant. We have lots of appropriate product that's not really being distributed in those channels today, right? So that's sort of a base piece of it. In terms of things we've done so far, we're done making some incrementals hires and you would see us make some, but it's more, at this point, still work on positioning business.","Sean M. Healey","And as Nate said, this is a business that is at scale, it is a business that is generating very strong flows. I mean, I think, we'd view our U.S. retail flows relative to the industry as being right at the top of the group. So we're talking about building strength on strength and anticipating client flow trends that we're beginning to see, but we're expecting to unfold over the coming years.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then also you guys are, of course, quite global. And to the extent that U.S. equity is gaining traction in Institutional channel, do you see any need for more institutionally-oriented U.S. equity managers than the ones you have because -- correct me if I'm wrong, but many of your traditional U.S. equity managers are a little more retail-oriented, right, than say, some of your global and emerging markets managers?","Sean M. Healey","We have a broad set of Affiliates in the U.S. equity category. And I think there's no question that over time, we will find outstanding new Affiliates to broaden that product set even further. And so I wouldn't necessarily say it's a need. I mean, our business is performing very well. Obviously, the addition of more great Affiliates or more new products from the existing Affiliates is going to be helpful. But we think our business is positioned quite well and, certainly, don't find any gaps or needs as much as we see ongoing opportunity.","Nathaniel Dalton","The only thing I would add to that is, I think, we have -- a number of our U.S. equity Affiliates are institutionally-focused and have -- historically, had largely U.S. -- and it's really an opportunity for us and have had, historically, largely U.S. institutional client bases. And so the opportunity to bring them, as we've done with others, bring them around the world and introduce them into -- through high-quality relationships that, in many cases, are already client service relationships, where we've made a sale already and has found this demand. Again, I'm not sure whether it's a trend yet. I mean, my personal -- I'm not sure if it's a trend or just happened to be a bunch of replacements sort of just coming all at once because the number of firms are having challenges or something. But yes, we were able to play U.S. equity into relationships that our guys are already built around the world over this last 6 and 9 months.","Sean M. Healey","Including with very large sophisticated global clients.","Nathaniel Dalton","Yes. Yes.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And also, did you give the mix of flows from overseas clients versus U.S. clients?","Nathaniel Dalton","I mean, I think it's pretty well split. But I think U.S. might have been a little more, but yes, pretty well split.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Chris Shutler with William Blair.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just one quick one for me. On the strength in sub-advisory in the quarter, it sounds like there were a couple of larger mandates, so just curious what product areas or geographies those might have been in? And that you also talked about some larger outflows which, obviously, it's not the bigger picture, but just curious to see what's going on there?","Nathaniel Dalton","Sure. So the -- I think the bigger sub-advisory wins were mostly -- again, sort of interestingly, U.S. equity and to U.S. clients, to the first part of your question. And then on the losses, there were a couple of large outflows which were -- I'm kind of thinking of 2 in particular -- one was a client closing down a program and another was a client internalizing a product category. So those are 2 that just come to mind, that included the 2 biggest in the quarter.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Robert Lee with KBW.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Just curious, and going back to kind of the deal with the pipeline. It seems like I can't pick up an industry rag without reading about someone else coming up with the great ideas, raising money to buy stakes in alternative managers and then take them public. So I'm just kind of curious, understanding that why do that if you guys exist, if there are quality managers. But how was that affecting pricing expectations amongst some of the managers you deal with because it would seem like there's a lot of money all of a sudden out there chasing alternative managers and looking to do something along the lines of what you guys have historically done?","Sean M. Healey","Well, I think back, looking here at Nate, and remembering 19 years ago when I was joining AMG, there was AMG and, I think, 4 other competitors that were emulating our approach. And maybe we haven't established our approach yet so they were -- they're trying to do the same thing as well as larger entities like United Asset Management and Legg Mason and Envest, et cetera. And so there has always been competition. I think for most of the past 20 years, the toughest competition has been, what I would call, sort of uneconomic buyer appetite from banks and insurance companies and, occasionally, the public market. And I think in the current period, not only is our competitive position, the strength of our business performance and, most importantly, the quality of our Affiliate relationships and their recommendation of us as a partner, those are all better than ever, the competitive landscape has changed. So there are far fewer competitors. The private public market, I think, is going to be, at least for a while, I think more discriminating. And there are more boutique firms that are quite hesitant to try to go public after what happened and, following the financial crisis, banks and insurance companies are net sellers. So the other entities that are out there that are trying to compete, and I'll separate the sort of other large asset management firms that have a very different business model, which we don't really compete with, so if you look at the universe of competitors that remain, of course, in every given situation, you have to compete, you have to make sure that the prospective Affiliate knows you, trust you, is willing to commit to you. And that's something that we do very well with and we've built, as I said, a strong set of relationships over time. And I think that's going to be the foundation of a series of very attractive investments. So competitors are out there, but they've always been out there and it's not affecting our ability to make new investments and it's not affecting pricing.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And just a follow-up question on distribution. I know, Nate, you mentioned that one of the opportunities in the U.S. retail is just getting more of existing product into the channel. But I'm just curious, if I look more globally, do you feel like all your Affiliates at this point are making -- are starting to make full use of what you've built or are there still Affiliates that are -- maybe just provide some momentum to the channel, too, but more Affiliates you can kind of bring into the channel who aren't currently using it?","Nathaniel Dalton","Yes. So I would say, I -- the way I would answer it is, the Affiliates are -- almost all the Affiliates with appropriate products are using us somewhere, right? And I think the opportunity set is as we -- and some of this is just, honestly, is prioritization, both on our part and on their part, right, as we work together, thinking out where the highest return opportunity is today -- and I'm playing them into that -- and then beginning to leverage that within a specific geography. Also, as you work with us in the geography and our teams builds expertise in comfort and knowledge, beginning to move that to other geographies, some of that's made easier by working with consulting firms, for example, who really help you bring that around the world. So I think everybody is working with us. That doesn't imply at all that we've got everybody working with us in all the places that they could or should ultimately be as the business scales. Some of it's also, as we do channel development within geographies, that will open up additional opportunities, right? So we're still at -- there are places where we built -- Australia where we've been for 7 years or the Middle East for almost the same amount of time where we built large scale businesses now. But in each of these geographies, there's real opportunity to continue to expand into other channels, which opens up opportunities for additional Affiliates. So an example would be Australia where we've just brought someone on to focus on the sub-advisory channel, which will open up opportunities for Affiliates that didn't really want to build separate account business there but who are happy to build a more packaged product business there. So yes, sorry, long answer but I do think there's much more opportunity to go even though if we are working with most Affiliates.","Sean M. Healey","And the thing that I would add is that, in addition to the extent group of Affiliates, there will be future Affiliates. I mean, you look back a year ago, we had just brought on Yacktman. You look several years ago, there are a number of Affiliates that have been added. And as we look ahead, there will be, we're very confident, a number of really outstanding Affiliates who will want to take advantage of our distribution platform to some extent. Again, we're happy to get flows wherever they come and don't really regard use of our distribution platform as necessarily an end in itself. But I would say, and it is a point that I didn't make earlier, the strength of our distribution platform and the track record of success with industry-leading organic growth over the past 3 years, there's no firm in the industry that is anywhere close in terms of the ability to generate worldwide organic growth in return-oriented product categories. And I think that is very attractive to prospective Affiliates. Again, Affiliates that are successful already, but look at the challenges of building a scaled global distribution business and infrastructure and recognize that, for many of them, that the opportunity to partner with a global scale asset management business that is already successfully generating sales for its existing Affiliates, that's quite attractive. And so that's both an added element to our new investment opportunity and gives us confidence as we look forward that we'll have an increasing set of products and capabilities to offer to clients which, of course, makes us an even more valuable distribution counter-party to our clients.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Just one more follow-up question on the distribution. To what extent has, what I'll call, reverse inquiry helped drive product development or flows? I mean, to the extent you establish a relationship, let's say, it's in the Mid East with some particular large asset owners or sovereign wealth funds, and they're saying, \"Look, these guys are great, but here's really a particular thing we're looking for,\" and then you kind of go back and figure out which of your Affiliates is the right one and try to develop a strategy from that. Is that becoming a part of the mix, too? Are there some successes you can point to in that regard?","Nathaniel Dalton","Well, I'd break your question in 2 parts, right? So the first part, which is leading the flows where maybe we wouldn't have been expecting them other than that way -- and here, I go back to my answer on U.S. equity, which was absolutely what you described, right, which is we've been engaged in conversations with both prospects and increasing the clients. And because of our breadth, we're able to have much more complete conversations, which are what is it your -- what are the challenges you're facing? What are you interested in? We're broad enough that they let us have those conversations and want to have that conversations with us increasingly. So the first step of that is that then let's us play into its existing products, so it certainly does allow someone who had been more focus on global or emerging markets or alternative product sets to come back, and say, \"Look, there's real opportunity with this client or that client,\" [indiscernible] large super, whatever it is, to play U.S. equity into those, right? That's part absolutely, in this quarter, was an example of it, frankly, some of that happening. The other -- the product development, I still think the opportunity to do that, ultimately, is there. I don't think we've yet to even scratch the surface of that.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of William Katz with Citi.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","First question is maybe, Jay, I'm curious, with the spread between GAAP and cash taxes seems to be narrowing over the next couple of quarters. Can you still talk through some of the dynamics that might be driving that? And longer-term, as you're scaling up your assets from organic growth, and just giving a share denominator of your assets, should we now start thinking over the long-term that the GAAP and cash tax rate might sort of go asymptotic with each other?","Jay C. Horgen","So the nature of the difference, of course, is the -- the main element is the intangible-related deferred taxes, Bill, that you're aware of. And that is, of course, as you think about it, it protects us on the first dollar and up to a level. And I'd say, I guess, well, say, a deductible level. And then if we grow beyond that, that is exposed to our marginal tax rate. So yes, if our IRDT remains static, then ultimately, they would converge over time, but it is a long time from now because we have, in magnitude, quite a large amount of these deductions. But we do expect substantial new investment activity in the future and, therefore, we don't imagine it being static. So I think if you're modeling both concept of the tax rate but also new investments over time affecting that, we expect that to be a meaningful gap between GAAP and tax, no pun intended. What's happening in the next 2 quarters is really just some noise. The U.K. has given us another tax rate decrease and then, because of that, we're revaluing our balance sheet deferred tax liabilities, which causes a onetime rate change to GAAP, so that was just noise. And then the retirement, the convertibles, create some nice because there are -- there's a small amount of excess deductions that we won't -- that we'll have to give back, but a very small amount. So the next 2 quarters is noise. Longer-term, there will be a gap and it will influenced by the rate of new investments.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, it's helpful. And I know you've covered this now, a substantial amount, in both your prepared remarks and in Q&A, but I'm still not quite clear on exactly what you're going to be doing on retail to try and generate growth. Is it a branded campaign? Is it a great investment spend? And does it come from the Affiliate bucket or does it come from the owner's allocations?","Sean M. Healey","I think you will see, as the quarters unfold, a range of initiatives at the Affiliate level and, certainly, at the AMG level. And the message that we want to convey here is that we are -- it's an area of strategic focus. We're going to commit increasing resources ahead of an opportunity that we see reflecting broader client demand trends. And right now, in the interim, we have a scale business that is generating very strong flows, which we're happy to put up against anybody in the industries, and we feel good about the prospects.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And just one last one for me. I've been looking at your retail business and my analysis about you now, about 50% of your volume comes from outside United States. Was there anything unique in the second quarter, it really does stand out quite nicely relative to peers, or is it just sort of the cumulative buildup of momentum and diversification of the business?","Nathaniel Dalton","I think you might be -- so the way I would describe it is there's 3 big parts, probably one of which you're seeing clearly and then the other 2 are probably just much harder to see. So the one you see clearly is probably the U.S. retail flow picture. And then the other bits are both, as you say, non-U.S. retail flows and that includes Affiliates like Artemis who's having very good flows, firms like Beutel Goodman who's having very good flows. So there's some sort of retail flows outside the U.S. that you described. And then the other piece is sub-advisory wins which -- sort of both sub-advisory wins and then just also sub-advisory flows, so flows within existing sub-advisory accounts that are separately branded, branded away. And some of the last 2, that is probably the number you're thinking about, not just in non-U.S.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Greg Warren with Morningstar.","Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","You sort of touched on a little bit there in that last answer, but I was kind of curious to see where the bulk of the positive flows are coming from on the U.S. equity side because, as you know, it's an area that has not seen a whole lot of flow on the active management side, and then, I guess, on the international equity side, too, where you're seeing kind of the bulk of the flows coming through and whether you expect that to fall through the rest of the year.","Nathaniel Dalton","Yes. So let me do those in reverse order. So when you say international, I'm going to take that to mean both sort of the broad, global as well as international as well as emerging markets, so all the non- sort of U.S. but also global, including U.S. flows. And I think there, we're seeing very broad -- and then have, for a while now, we've seen very broad flows in both developed markets and emerging markets, both institutional and retail. And so it's hard to sort of pick one very specific thing. I think the first part of your question on U.S., as we said in the prepared remarks and as we sort of said and answered to a couple of these questions, some of it's been, I won't say, surprising to us because we saw a little bit of it last quarter as well. I'm not sure if it's a trend or -- we're sort of seeing demand both in the U.S. and outside the U.S. Some of what we see in both categories, I would say, is countertrend, broad trend. And some of that's because we are just -- we have very good performance across a range of Affiliates and are adding distribution resources to them, so just as bringing them to places they haven't been might be part of it. And so that's -- sort of overstating it, it's a version of market share that was -- we're taking to places. And then may be related to that -- again, U.S. equity, hard to tell, I don't know if it's -- again, maybe a little bit surprising to us, right, as you suggest. Some of it might be. People allocating to it are beginning to allocate the U.S. equity active. And we have that maybe going on. Some of it, maybe there are some other managers struggling, so -- because a lot of these do seem to be replacement searches. So hard and still early to try to call exactly what's happening.","Sean M. Healey","I would add to that by saying part of what we're seeing, to the extent there's a broad reallocation, is the benefit of a global platform and getting Affiliates, many of which would not have otherwise been exposed to global institutional clients in markets like the Middle East or Australia getting -- having them presented to clients in a way that is leading to some flows. As Nate said, it's too early to call a trend, but I think there's no question we're seeing the benefit of the breadth and scale of our business and of our distribution platform reflected in a number of areas. And obviously, the overall growth is very strong and very broad-based.","Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I guess, that's kind of a perfect segue to my next question then was you're looking on Yacktman a year on, I mean, the performance has been fantastic for them year-to-date. Have you guys been surprised with the level of flows you've been able to generate pulling that on to your own distribution network? Has it been stronger than what you're anticipating when you initially signed the deal?","Nathaniel Dalton","No. We obviously believed Yacktman is a tremendous firm, and so I think we had lots of comfort for that. And as we said at the time, we thought we could be helpful. So they had good flows already, right? But we also said, we thought we could be helpful to them bringing them on to a few platforms on things where maybe they weren't. So I wouldn't say we're strived, but also think they are a significant contributor to the flows in the quarter. But for a large number, there were a number of various significant contributors to flows in the quarter including in the Mutual Fund channel, so it's -- it really is a -- it's a breadth story rather than a specific story.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Sean Healey for any additional, concluding remarks.","Sean M. Healey","Well, thank you again for joining us this morning.

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Selene Oh, Vice President, Investor Relations for AMG. Thank you, you may begin.","Selene Oh - Vice President-Finance & Investor Relations","Thank you for joining AMG to discuss our results for the third quarter of 2015.","In this conference call, certain matters discussed will constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results can differ materially from those projected due to a number of factors, including but not limited to those referenced in the company's Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. AMG will provide on its website at www.amg.com a replay of the call and a copy of our announcement of our results for the quarter as well as a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.","With us on the line to discuss the company's results for the quarter are Sean Healey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Nate Dalton, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Jay Horgen, Chief Financial Officer.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Sean Healey.","Sean M. Healey - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Selene, and good morning, everyone.","AMG reported economic earnings per share of $2.93 for the third quarter of 2015, which is 6% higher than the year-ago quarter, notwithstanding meaningful declines in global market indices over the same period. While our overall results for the quarter were inevitably impacted by declining markets and muted investor risk appetite, our affiliates continued to build on their outstanding long-term track records of investment performance. And most notably, we made significant progress in the execution of our new investment strategy.","As you saw on our release, we were very pleased to announce the addition of Systematica Investments, Abax Investments, and Ivory Investment Management to our affiliate group. And looking ahead, we continue to have an excellent pipeline of prospective affiliates and seek ongoing opportunities to generate incremental earnings accretion from additional investments in outstanding boutique firms worldwide.","Our third quarter results reflect the strength of our business and the quality of our affiliates. Periods of market dislocation and falling stock correlations provide the best active equity and alternative managers with opportunities to distinguish themselves. And as Nate will describe further, our affiliates outperformed peers and indices across a broad array of global emerging market and U.S. equity products during the quarter, building on their outstanding long-term track records. Likewise, our alternative managers continued to generate strong results across a wide range of liquid and illiquid strategies.","As we all know, investment performance is the primary driver of future organic growth for actively managed alpha-generating products. And given their exceptional long-term performance track records, our affiliates are well-positioned to attract strong client cash flows going forward.","While we have generated consistently strong organic growth in every quarter over the past five years and we're very confident in the outlook for AMG's long-term organic growth, against the backdrop of a volatile risk-off quarter, it was inevitable that it would be a difficult period for our return-oriented product set in terms of client flows.","In addition to general risk aversion among institutional and retail clients, which reduced gross sales, a small number of institutional clients elected to reposition their portfolios in the quarter, resulting in one-off but meaningful redemptions unrelated to investment performance. Looking ahead, we see a resumption of new business momentum across our global distribution platform, with ongoing client demand for our affiliates' return-oriented strategies and improving prospects in U.S. retail.","Over the longer term, we are extremely well-positioned for strong organic growth. First, our strategic focus on building exposure to the highest quality global equity and alternative products has given us a leading position in these attractive areas, further enhanced by our announcements today. Over 75% of our earnings are generated in these areas, which continue to be of great interest to global institutional clients and large retail platforms.","Second, AMG is now the fifth largest manager of return-oriented assets worldwide. Many clients around the world are looking to narrow the range of their managers while also deepening those relationships, and clients perceive AMG as offering a unique proposition in that environment, which brings together the focus and specialized expertise that clients prefer in those asset classes with the breadth of product provided by AMG's scale and diversity.","Finally, AMG's brand is increasingly recognized by sophisticated clients in all channels globally, as differentiated both by the quality of our affiliates individually and collectively, as well as the unique partnership structure which incents and enhances our affiliate partners' future success. In addition, given global clients' high regard for AMG and our affiliates, top-quality prospective affiliates around the world are increasingly drawn to AMG today, which in turn serves to reinforce our appeal to clients in this virtuous circle.","The three investments we announced this morning reflect the strength of our competitive position and the long-term success of our distribution capability. Let me spend a moment describing these outstanding new affiliates.","Systematica, led by Leda Braga, is recognized as one of the leading systematic trading managers in the world. Based in Geneva with offices in four other countries, the firm manages $8.8 billion in assets through trend-following algorithmic trading strategies and quantitative equity investing. And its award-winning flagship fund, BlueTrend, has an outstanding record of return since its inception over a decade ago. Leda and her partners are renowned for their innovative approach and industry-leading performance. And with the opportunity to choose a permanent institutional partner to facilitate their firm's independence from BlueCrest Capital Management, Systematica chose AMG. Systematica has exceptional long-term prospects, and I'm very pleased to welcome Leda and her team as partners.","Based in Cape Town, Abax is a $5.4 billion manager of South African and global equities, utilizing fundamental research to invest in companies with strong secular growth opportunities. With its tremendous long-term performance record over the past dozen years, as well as its expertise across a broad team of seasoned professionals, Abax has outstanding prospects ahead. I'm delighted that Anthony Sedgwick and his partners are joining our affiliate group.","Ivory, led by Curtis Macnguyen, is one of the industry's preeminent long\/short equity managers, with a 17-year track record of alpha generation. The firm has $3.6 billion under management and an excellent forward outlook, given its consistent track record of outstanding risk-adjusted returns. Known for its entrepreneurial culture and disciplined approach to investing, Ivory has a tremendous opportunity to leverage its reputation and performance record with a long-only product that offers excellent opportunities for growth. We're looking forward to working with Curtis and his team, and are pleased to add Ivory to AMG's group of industry-leading affiliates.","Together, these partnerships meaningfully increase the earnings power of our business and diversify our exposures. Moreover, while all three firms have excellent prospects for growth, with AMG as their partner, we can further enhance their respective forward opportunity sets through leveraging the reach and success of AMG's global institutional distribution and U.S. retail platforms.","Key partners at all three firms have made long-term commitments to their businesses and clients. And in each case, the transaction reaffirms their independence and operational and investment autonomy, preserving the essential elements for success at a specialist firm. Each firm chose AMG on the basis of our 20-year track record as a partner to excellent boutiques globally, as well as for the range and quality of our strategic capabilities. All three transactions were negotiated directly with management and arose from proprietary relationships that AMG built with the principals. And two of the three resulted from referrals from existing affiliates.","That three such high-caliber businesses have each chosen to partner with AMG provides compelling evidence of the strength of AMG's competitive position as a prospective partner to high-quality boutiques. And the fact that these new affiliates are on three different continents underscores the increasingly global nature of our franchise and opportunity set.","Looking ahead, we continue to have an outstanding opportunity for generating meaningful earnings growth through the execution of all elements of our growth strategy. In a quarter marked by significant equity market volatility, our affiliates generated excellent investment performance, positioning them for continued strong organic growth. In addition, given our unparalleled competitive position, including the proprietary relationships we've been building for over 20 years with the world's best boutique firms, as well as our track record as a partner to our outstanding affiliates, we have a unique opportunity to create shareholder value through additional accretive new investments going forward.","With that, I'll turn it to Nate to discuss our affiliates' results in further detail.","Nathaniel Dalton - President & Chief Operating Officer","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. As Sean said, against the backdrop of a volatile market environment this past quarter, our affiliates generated good performance relative to their peers and benchmarks, adding to their already strong long-term track records, which positions us extremely well for future growth. I'll cover our affiliates' performance in more detail in a moment. But first, I'd like to give a bit more context to our net cash flows in what was a unique quarter.","Against the backdrop of 21 straight quarters of significant positive flows, we had three factors challenge our net flows in the quarter. First, we had several significant idiosyncratic outflows unrelated to performance, meaning the underlying products are performing well. These were primarily institutional in nature, and so inherently lumpy. Second, we were not immune to investor risk aversion in reaction to market volatility, and so we encountered a meaningful level of delayed fundings. The combination of these two alone caused our total flows to turn negative. Third and finally were continued outflows from U.S. equities, especially in U.S. retail, which we've talked about on prior calls.","Now a couple comments as we look ahead; first, as market conditions stabilized, some of the delayed mandates have already funded in the fourth quarter, and we expect institutional sales to pick back up. Second, while of course it is still early in the quarter, the flows in our retail channel look to be improving, as inflows to alternatives and global and emerging market equities are offsetting our U.S. equity outflows, which are slowing.","Now turning to investment performance. which, as we mentioned, was very strong on a relative basis in the quarter. Starting with the alternatives category, where we offer a wide range of strategies, our affiliates performed well in a volatile market environment. Standouts included AQR, where their Style Premia and Multi-Strategy Alternative funds ranked as the best and second best mutual funds in the Morningstar category. Also notable were First Quadrant's currency, AQR's managed futures, and BlueMountain's flagship BMCA fund. Lastly, ValueAct's relative performance was good, as they beat their benchmarks and outperformed most of their highest quality peers, even though the absolute performance was negative, as it was for other alternative products with significant equity beta components.","Overall, long-term performance track records across the majority of the largest products in the alternatives category continue to be very strong, including especially AQR, BlueMountain, Pantheon, and ValueAct. Finally, with the addition of Systematica and Ivory, we are further diversifying our alternatives product set and expanding our sources of potential performance fees.","Next, moving to the global developed markets category, where our affiliates had very strong relative performance, highlights for the quarter came from major global equity product at AQR, Artemis, Harding Loevner, Tweedy Browne, and Veritas. Tweedy Browne's flagship Global Value Fund once again stood at the top of its category in a challenging market environment, ranking in the first percentile in Morningstar. These products continue to have outstanding performance track records across longer-term periods as well.","In the emerging markets category, the products managed by Harding Loevner, Genesis, and AQR all outperformed the benchmarks in the quarter. Furthermore, long-term performance records across their product suites remains very good.","Finally, with respect to our U.S. equity products, performance significantly improved in the quarter, with Yacktman, Times Square, GW&K, and River Road all beating their benchmark. While Frontier and SouthernSun trailed their respective indices in the quarter, long-term performance across both affiliates remains very strong.","Now turning to flows for the quarter, as we always say, flows to both the institutional and sub-advisor channels are inherently lumpy, and we certainly saw that this quarter. Starting with the institutional channel, we had outflows of $2.6 billion. Positive contributions from many affiliates across alternatives and global emerging markets equities were overshadowed by the factors I mentioned.","In our high net worth channel, we had net inflows of $385, million with contributions coming from GW&K, Harding Loevner, Veritable, Clarfeld, and BlueMountain.","Finally, in the mutual fund channel, we had outflows of $3.3 billion. Once again, we had positive inflows to a number of alternatives and global and emerging market equity strategies, including those from Artemis, AQR, and Harding Loevner. These were not enough to offset outflows from U.S. retail strategies, consistent with broad market trends. As you know, our mutual fund channel has a higher concentration of U.S. equities than the rest of our business.","Maybe one final point about flows and distributions, while this quarter was a more challenging environment for gathering assets, we are well-positioned to generate meaningful net flows as investors return their focus to their strategic investment objectives, notably with regards to their allocations to return-oriented investments. Our affiliates' recent excellent performance, building on their already strong long-term track records, reinforces our confidence in the significant positive flow generation by both the affiliates own selling efforts as well as our complementary global distribution team.","With that, I'll turn it to Jay to discuss our financials.","Jay C. Horgen - Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer","Thank you, Nate.","As we discussed, despite a difficult market environment, we are pleased with our ongoing earnings growth, including an increase of 6% in economic earnings per share for the third quarter when compared year over year. As Sean said, AMG has a differentiated ability to grow our earnings across all market environments through both the organic growth of our affiliates as well as through our new investment strategy, which includes the proprietary relationships that we've built over the past two decades. Each of these new investments, Systematica, Abax, and Ivory, will be immediately accretive to our earnings, and together they further diversify and meaningfully increase the earnings power of our business.","As you saw in the release, we reported economic earnings per share of $2.93 for the third quarter, with net performance fees contributing $0.08. Now on a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $1.98.","Turning to more specific modeling items, for the third quarter our EBITDA was $218.9 million, and the ratio of our EBITDA to end-of-period assets under management was approximately 14.7 basis points or approximately 14.3 basis points excluding performance fees. In the fourth quarter we expect this ratio to be approximately 17.1 basis points, reflecting the higher performance fee contribution that we typically experience in the fourth quarter.","With regard to our taxes, our effective GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 33.2% and our cash tax rate was approximately 22.5%. For modeling purposes, we expect our GAAP tax rate to be 33% and our cash tax rate to be 22%. Intangible-related deferred taxes for the third quarter were $21.1 million, and we expect this number to be approximately $22 million in the fourth quarter.","Our share of reported amortization for the quarter was $29.9 million, which includes $8.6 million of amortization from affiliates accounted for under the equity method. We expect our share of amortization to remain at approximately $30 million in the fourth quarter.","Our share of interest expense for the third quarter was $23.6 million. And for the fourth quarter we expect our share of interest expense to decrease to $20 million, reflecting the interest savings from the redemption of our 2022 senior bonds.","Our other economic items for the third quarter were $0.8 million, of which pre-tax non-cash imputed interest expense was $0.3 million. For modeling purposes, we expect our other economic items to be approximately $1 million per quarter.","Turning to our balance sheet, our capital structure is well-positioned for growth in all markets. This quarter, in anticipation of our three new investments, we closed a new $1.3 billion five-year unsecured revolver and a $350 million term loan, while simultaneously calling $140 million of our senior bonds. These transactions were leverage-neutral and meaningfully reduced our cost of funding.","In addition, the cash flow generated from the size, scale, and diversity of our business continues to provide us with significant capacity to execute new investments and the flexibility to return capital by repurchasing shares. In the quarter we repurchased $53 million, bringing our year-to-date total to approximately $332 million, just shy of our model convention of 50% of expected annual economic net income.","We expect to fund all three new investments by year end and have a revolver balance of approximately $500 million at that time. Looking forward, with $800 million of capacity under the revolver combined with run rate EBITDA of approximately $1 billion, we continue to be well-positioned to create incremental opportunities for earnings growth.","Now turning to guidance, we are updating our 2015 guidance, as we now expect economic earnings per share to be in the range of $12.20 to $12.80. This guidance range reflects market performance through last Friday, our current view of fourth quarter performance fees, and a weighted average share count of 55.2 million for 2015, which assumes no share repurchases in the fourth quarter.","For 2016, we expect economic earnings per share to be in the range of $13.20 to $14.80. This guidance range assumes our normal model convention of actual market performance through Friday for the current quarter and 2% quarterly market growth beginning in the first quarter of 2016.","As I mentioned earlier, we expect all three new investments to close by year end, and we also assume share repurchases equal to 50% of expected annual economic net income over the course of 2016, which results in an expected weighted average share count of approximately 54 million.","The lower end of our guidance includes a modest contribution from performance fees and organic growth, while the upper end assumes a more robust contribution from performance fees and net client cash flows. As always, these assumptions do not include earnings from future new investments and are based on our current expectation of affiliate growth rates, performance, and the mix of affiliate contribution to our earnings. Of course, substantial changes in markets and the earnings contribution of our affiliates would impact these expectations.","Now we'll be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks, good morning.","Sean M. Healey - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Nathaniel Dalton - President & Chief Operating Officer","Good morning.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So I appreciate Nate's comments on the net flow variance analysis versus 2Q. But other than Yacktman's net flow reversal, what other themes or trends can you point us to as reasons why flows have continued to slow versus the very strong levels back in 2012 and 2013?","Sean M. Healey - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think we covered the variance in our prepared remarks around a small number of institutional clients who chose this quarter to reposition their portfolios independent of performance, so that I think is the dominant effect. Nate, would you add anything to that?","Nathaniel Dalton - President & Chief Operating Officer","Yes, so let me just say a couple things. So first, I think we talked about this quarter the three specific things that impacted it. One, the one you called out, which I would say is really U.S. equities in general rather than just Yacktman-specific, so U.S. equities in general, especially U.S. equities in retail, whereas we said in our prepared remarks it was disproportionately larger. And then we had the specific to this quarter events.","Other than that, I think if you look at the long-term trends, we feel pretty good about it, and I think that includes the trends over this multiyear period, which is a large number of good performing products. The global distribution platform is growing. We have this opportunity to keep adding products both from product development as well as from new investments, investments in additional affiliates as you saw today. And so I think those long-term trends over the long term I think remain in place. Obviously, any one quarter will have the kinds of things that we talked about in our remarks.","Sean M. Healey - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","But on an overall basis, we see, as we noted, a resumption of the momentum that we've had for now a very long term.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. And then just as my follow-up, how does your total deal capacity stand as of today between your revolver and excess cash after the three new investments, maybe then just for that? And then also, I may have missed this. But what was buyback activity in 3Q?","Jay C. Horgen - Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer","Sure, Craig. It's Jay. So I mentioned this earlier that we have \u2013 we expect to close at the end of the year and have $500 million drawn on our revolver, which leaves $800 million under the revolver spot rate. Plus of course, we have $1 billion of EBITDA annually. So depending on the timing of new investments, we have all that we need from revolver or the cash flow from the business.","As it relates to your question on repurchases, we repurchased $53 million in the quarter and $332 million year to date. We do not expect to repurchase any in the fourth quarter, but we would resume our model convention for 2016.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, good morning. I guess, Jay, if you could, help us with the new investments that were announced this morning or yesterday, and give us a sense of the contribution as you think about next year, and the guidance you gave from those transactions, and separate that from the existing business and the growth of that?","Jay C. Horgen - Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer","Sure. So on the deals, I think I'd maybe start where the last question left off. We had $60 million drawn on the revolver at September 30. Of course, we got our distributions from affiliates in the third quarter this past month. So we've obviously paid off our revolver. I think we expect our revolver balance to be a little over $500 million at 12\/31, expecting to close all of the deals at that time. So we're not individually calling out the purchase prices, but I think you can tell, order of magnitude, the amount of capital deployed.","When you think about typical capital deployment into deals, we've said in the past we see accretion in the $0.10 to $0.14 range per $100 million spent. So I think you can get a good sense for what's in the 2016 guidance based upon that capital and that metric. Because we expect them to close on 12\/31, we will get a full year of that in 2016.","Maybe I will take a step back and just talk about 2016 more broadly, if that's okay, Dan, which is that that range of $13.20 to $14.80, it obviously starts with our pro forma AUM with those deals. And since we're going to get a full-year effect, includes markets as of Friday, and that blend was up a little bit less than 4% as of Friday for the quarter to-date, so that's since the end of the quarter. Because you can see what our AUM was at the end of the quarter, you have to put myCIO, which closed on 10\/1, into that number, grow it by the 4%, more or less, and then you end up adding the deals, and you can see what the full-year effect would be in 2016.","We have our normal model convention of 2% per quarter beginning the first quarter of 2016, no market performance through the rest of the 2015 period. And then we have a range of performance fee assumptions for the year. And then we also have our model convention of repurchasing 50% of annual economic net income, and I gave you the weighted average share count that we expect next year of 54 million, down from 55.2 million. So I think that's the broad set of assumptions that I think you'll need for 2016.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Jack Keeler - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, thanks. This is actually Jack Keeler standing in for Bill. My question is just around the deal pipeline. I guess, A, what's the status of the deal pipeline? What are you seeing? And then, B, the market volatility in the third quarter, does that have any impact on the potential pipeline? Thanks.","Sean M. Healey - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","As we indicated, the pipeline continues to be very strong, I would say, including traditional, alternative firms, wealth management firms, on a global basis. The volatility \u2013 I think if the volatility in the quarter had continued, it probably would have had an effect, but there's no discernible effect that we're seeing on the firms that are in our pipeline at this point.","The large majority of our opportunities continue to be in negotiated transactions that arise out of proprietary relationships. We do our best to avoid organized auction processes. And you saw the effect in the transactions we announced, where all of them, as I noted, arose out of proprietary relationships and were negotiated in a way that was attentive to the particular circumstances of each new affiliate. And going forward, we think that by far, that's the most attractive way to make investments, most appropriate way to make investments, and obviously results, we think, in a much better transaction for everybody.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Kim with Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with your question.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Hey, guys. Good morning, maybe another question for Jay in terms of the guidance range for this year. Any changes to organic growth or performance fee assumptions for the fourth quarter, just given the downturn last quarter? And then looking ahead to next year, are you still pointing to maybe the 5% to 10% range of total earnings for performance fees?","Jay C. Horgen - Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer","Good question. So the 2015 guidance range of $12.20 to $12.80, so first, Michael, that reflects the actual results. We've already booked $8.93 year to date. We do have an estimate in our model for the fourth quarter, and that's based upon the third quarter AUM plus the closing of myCIO, and then noting that quarter-to-date market blend up a little less than 4% gets you to a reasonable estimate for where our AUM is right now in early November. We don't assume any more beta.","So the last bit then would be performance fees, and performance fees are the primary driver of the range at this point. We have lowered our expectation for performance fees given the market volatility over the past three months, especially in products that are beta-sensitive. That being said, because of the diversity of our performance fee opportunity in both the absolute products as well as the beta-sensitive products, we still see the 2015 performance fees coming in at 5% to 10% of earnings. If you remember, last quarter we thought it might be a little bit higher than 10% at the top end, but we're back to that 5% to 10%, just also noting that we've already booked $0.23 year to date. So there's already 2% that's already done.","And then as it relates to 2016, just to round that out, I mentioned the impact in 2015 on the performance fees on the beta-sensitive products. But in the main, these products have good long-term track records with annual resets. And so they're well-positioned to generate meaningful performance fees in 2016. So when you think about these products combined with the broad range of absolute products as well as the new investments that we just made, each of which have some performance fee opportunity, but especially Systematica and Ivory, we do expect a slightly higher contribution from performance fees at the top end of our 2016 range. We've reflected that a bit in the wider range in the guidance of $1.60. So we do have that opportunity as our AUM in alternatives is growing.","I think the last thing I would say about performance fees, just to round it out, is as we add more diversity to our already broad range of performance fee opportunity, I think we've said this in the past. We feel good about a base level of performance fees. The diversity creates a positive asymmetry for investors as it increases the probability at the bottom end of our range of achieving that level of performance fees, while the top end gives us more optionality because we could experience upside even above our range, as there's no cap on performance fees. So I think that's how we'd characterize our performance fee opportunity.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Michael R. Carrier - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks, guys. Just a question on maybe the slower outlook, and the color of this quarter was helpful, in two parts. I think one, just on the three affiliates you made the transactions with, any color on how their organic growth has been trending in the last call it year or two? And then I think when you look at all the affiliates and you look at the industry trends in demand and maybe the performance of the affiliates, it's harder for us to see some of that. I just wanted to get your sense. When you look over the next year or two, do you feel like the firm is well-positioned to maybe generate above-average organic growth relative to the industry?","Sean M. Healey - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So I'll answer the first bit and then turn to Nate for the broader part of your question. With respect to the new affiliates where we announced investments today, they are all doing very well both from a performance standpoint as well as in terms of organic growth. You would expect that in a way because firms generally choose to pursue investment transactions when they have strong momentum in their business, and these three certainly do.","Systematica has terrific long-term and near-term performance, is opening new products and gaining market share in their larger existing products. Abax, the same goes for them, having an excellent year in terms of performance, with a very exciting opportunity to build a global equity product or build on and grow an already very successful, well-performing global equity product. And then Ivory has, as we noted, an outstanding long-term alpha generation record, but has a long-only product which has just terrific prospects for growth and excellent performance. So these three affiliates I think are all very well-positioned to generate strong growth, as is our overall franchise, but I'll let Nate add more color to that.","Nathaniel Dalton - President & Chief Operating Officer","Sure. So I think the way you set it up was a really good way to do it, which is look at the next couple years, and I'll try and do it that way. But then I also think there are some longer-term trends even in that that maybe I'll touch on.","So as you look at this medium-term year or two trend out, I think our affiliates continue to benefit from a set of trends that we've talked about on prior calls, which is investors need to get returns into their portfolios and investors continue to \u2013 we've talked about it as barbelling their portfolios between exposures on one end and then active return-seeking managers to meet their return goals, and how boutique firms, specialist firms are very well-positioned to meet those needs. And we've actually talked about that also in the white paper that we published earlier in the year. So I think those trends benefit our affiliates on this time you mentioned \u2013 you described.","In addition, and this is the thing that AMG can bring to bear on behalf of these affiliates, is in addition, we're taking these good performing products and we're marrying it to the scope and scale of an increasingly diversified global distribution platform institutionally in many, many markets, retail in some markets, U.S., and we've begun building some retail exposure in others. So we're taking those affiliates that on their own have this really good opportunity set over the next couple years and we're marrying it to the distribution business that further enhances their opportunity.","And we've talked about on calls that we take those together, we're able to build a relationship with the marketplace, which is really a unique relationship. And again, we're in the early stages of doing this, which is building a relationship where we can bring all of this to bear with the most sophisticated institutions, with the intermediaries who serve them with platforms, and allow them access to all this fantastic manufacturing through a single very high-quality point of contact.","And so when you think about bringing those together and then the last thing I'll say here is the virtuous circle component, which is as we continue to execute that on behalf of these affiliates, and we're having very good success, that obviously makes us more attractive as a potential partner to additional affiliates. And that was part of some of these things the firms \u2013 investments you saw announced today, which is they understand that opportunity that we bring them. So I think the firms have a very good opportunity on their own, but I think combining that with what AMG is doing in distribution really creates a very significant opportunity.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher C. Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Sean M. Healey - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Christopher C. Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","So I think it had been a year and half or so since the last large new affiliate investment. You had done AQR and I know some stuff on the wealth management side, but it had been a while otherwise. So I guess the question is just what changed over the last few months, or was the timing here just a coincidence in that you did three? And ultimately, I'm wondering. Did something change in the environment with the market downturn in the back half of the quarter that opened the floodgates, or what exactly happened? Thanks.","Sean M. Healey - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. I can understand the question given the number of transactions, but it is actually just the fortuity of the circumstances. And as you know, our investments in the main rise out of proprietary relationships that we've built over the years. And obviously, that's a very important part of our forward opportunity set.","The timing of transactions is driven by idiosyncratic circumstances of each prospective affiliate. And it varies from demographic considerations to an outside investor's preferences, for example, in part of what was involved in the Systematica investment. The market volatility in the quarter, I would say, had those transactions really no effect. Those transactions were well underway. And importantly, as I said in response to an earlier question, going forward we don't see any discernible effect from the market volatility on our forward opportunity set, and we continue to be very optimistic about our prospects going forward, with a very strong pipeline and a competitive position that continues to be extremely strong. So lots of good opportunities, but they will never appear in a precise orderly timing, because that's just not how it works.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Just to follow up on just the quarterly flows and the outlook, I think there was a comment, Nate, that you mentioned about some delayed fundings. So just curious if those delays have now funded, and if you actually \u2013 and also just looking back on the quarter, did you lose some of the business that you might have thought that was coming in the door and that's not coming, back based on either performance or client decisions?","And then also, I think the question was asked, but I'm not sure it was specifically answered. Are you assuming inflows for the remainder of the year in your 4Q guidance, and the low end of guidance next year still assumes inflows? Just want to clarify that.","Jay C. Horgen - Chief Financial Officer & Treasurer","Okay, so let me try and take those in order. So the question about deferred fundings, as I said in the prepared remarks, we did have some mandates in the third quarter that were deferred due to that volatility. A number of them have funded. Some of them have not. And obviously, the ones that have not, obviously, you're never 100% sure until it's done.","I do think the volatility may have \u2013 there were a few mandates that I'm not sure. This is, again, completely unrelated to performance. I think the volatility in some product categories did have some potential investors say that they're slowing it, and so I think some of those might not come back. I think that this is highly possible. But again, you'll see what happens if things are stable from here. So I think that's the first bit, which is, I think we've had a number of them fund, not all. I think there are a couple that you don't know.","And then the other thing I'd say on flows looking ahead is, we've gotten those \u2013 obviously it's still in the quarter and all that, but the trends that we've been seeing look like they're meaningful trends, but they're all there and good. And then the other thing I'd say, which I think were in our prepared remarks a bit, but let me, just be to clear, which is I think, if you look at the mutual fund channel, I think we're continuing to see good inflows in alternatives, global, and emerging markets. And we are seeing slowing outflows in U.S. equity, so that channel in particular looks better.","Sean M. Healey - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And with respect to your question about guidance, Dan, as you know, we never guide to flow. So you have heard, I think, a pretty optimistic and positive view of our forward organic growth prospects. And embedded in the earnings guidance which we gave, of course, is I think very good growth looking ahead, which obviously, if markets are better and we make additional new investments, we'll be even higher than we forecast. But just the earnings forecast itself, I think, embeds some strong internal growth without getting to the place of guiding to flow specifically.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Kim with Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with your question.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Hi, thanks for taking my follow-up. I'm just curious if your thinking or timeline has shifted at all as it relates to building out the U.S. retail platform, just in light of some of the more recent flow trends and sustained lack of demand for actively managed domestic equity funds, really across the industry?","Nathaniel Dalton - President & Chief Operating Officer","So let me just talk a little bit about what we're doing right now in the U.S. retail business. So first, I'd say we're making good progress on the product development side. A little bit of this is related typically to \u2013 look, we have a scaled business with the exposures that it has, but we have a bunch of very good opportunities to take the team that we've got there, and the sales and marketing client service infrastructure, and marry it with the good \u2013 and we've talked about this on prior calls \u2013 marry that with the very good performing products, especially in alternative, global, and emerging markets.","So when you focus on this quarter, I think we've done a lot of work on what I'll call product development side, and maybe I'll call out two specific examples. One is we've started working with Harding Loevner in the wirehouse channel, which is taking their products which are performing well, having good flow in the distribution channel, and leveraging the places that we think we can really be additive. That's one example.","And then another example I'd give, and this goes specifically to the opportunity set in alternatives, I think we've talked about on prior calls a product that we've been building with Pantheon in bringing private equity into the 1940 Act funds space. We've built that. We've now got that, 1940 Act (44:33) registered this past quarter. They'll be rolling that out through the team, and so things like that. We've been making additional progress on product development on some concentrated equity things and some other alternative products. It's good progress in product development to leverage our affiliate capabilities through the distribution team.","I guess the other thing I say is look, all the judgments about that business and what it can achieve, further to Sean's point, are in the forecast that we've given you. And in the forecast, we're not really assuming any big trend changes to that trajectory. As some of these product development things come on, we expect it will take a little while to really gain traction and change things. But the last thing I'll say, to repeat a point I made earlier, we are seeing slowing outflows in U.S. equities and we are seeing good momentum on the alts, global, and on the EM side, both within our AMG funds platform but within our retail distribution more broadly.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question from the line of Chris Shutler with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Christopher C. Shutler - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my follow-up. On the institutional outflows in the quarter, can you just talk about what types of strategies that you saw that the repositioning occur? I've had a couple of investors ask me if \u2013 it sounded like they're concerned about momentum types of strategies that have obviously worked well during the bull market that we've been in. Maybe just talk about where you've been seeing the repositioning.","Nathaniel Dalton - President & Chief Operating Officer","So I think it's very hard to generalize. So I think the repositioning came \u2013 I'll say it had three pieces. So one, there were some, and this wasn't the bulk of it, but there were some where it was related to performance, so that's some of it. I think the others where it's clearly unrelated to performance and performance was quite good, I think it would be very hard to generalize and assign into a strategy. It was a couple things, and they were all we think unrelated. So I don't think there's something I'd generalize beyond that there.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Craig Siegenthaler - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. I may have missed this, but to the response to my second question, did this $500 million draw on the revolver, did that include the three new investments and myCIO, or just the three new investments?","Jay C.

[Operator Instructions] A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Alexandra Lynn, Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Investor Relations for Affiliated Managers Group. Thank you. Ms. Lynn, you may now begin.","Alexandra Lynn","Thank you for joining Affiliated Managers Group to discuss our results for the third quarter of 2012. In this conference call, certain matters discussed will constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected due to a number of factors including, but not limited to, those referenced in the company's Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.","AMG will provide on its website, at www.amg.com, a replay of the call and a copy of our announcement of our results for the quarter, as well as a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.","With us on the line to discuss the company's results for the quarter are Sean Healey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Nate Dalton, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Jay Horgen, Chief Financial Officer.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Sean Healey.","Sean M. Healey","Thanks, Ally. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining. We appreciate that it's been a difficult week for many of you, and we wish the very best to those affected by the storm.","AMG reported economic earnings per share of $1.91 for the third quarter of 2012, which is a 23% increase over the same period of 2011. Our earnings growth was driven by continued strong business momentum with outstanding organic growth from net client cash flows and exceptional investment performance across our equity in alternative products.","Our strong results reflect the excellence of our boutique Affiliates and the ongoing impact of our strategic focus on global and emerging market equities and alternatives, which collectively accounts for 70% of our earnings.","We believe that specialist firms have competitive advantages in generating alpha in these areas and our boutique Affiliates, including Tweedy, Browne, Genesis, Harding Loevner, and Artemis, among global and emerging market equity managers; and Pantheon, BlueMountain, ValueAct, First Quadrant and AQR, among alternative managers, are all recognized as leaders in their respective disciplines.","Over the last 10 quarters, we have generated $60 billion in net close. Concentrated in these product areas and looking ahead, we believe that both retail and institutional investors will continue to seek value-added equity and alternative strategies for the alpha portion of their portfolios. With our Affiliates industry-leading products and these attractive areas -- attractive categories, we are generating strong organic growth in the face of industry trends, which continue to overwhelmingly favor passive and fixed income products. And we are particularly well positioned to benefit when investors inevitably reallocate to return oriented products.","And finally, in a rerisking rising rate environment, AMG will not be impacted by the decline of assets from fixed income outflows or the depreciation in value of fixed income products.","Our outstanding organic growth, with $11 billion in net client cash flows in the quarter, also reflects the continued success of our global distribution strategy, as our Affiliates are winning new business and market share through both Affiliate level marketing efforts, as well as leveraging our global platform, which enhances the presence of our Affiliates across channels and geographies.","Given the ongoing success of our strategy and the forward opportunities that we see, we continue to build out our institutional and retail platforms worldwide through the opening of new offices and the addition of key personnel in existing coverage regions. And these investments are increasingly resulting in incremental new business momentum as evidenced by recent wins in Asia, one of the newer regions in our platform, as well as in Europe, the Middle East and Australia.","Turning to new investments, we were pleased to complete our additional investment in BlueMountain during the quarter, which significantly increased our ownership interest in one of the world's leading credit alternative managers.","The current environment remains very favorable for AMG, and our pipeline continues to include both divestitures, as well as succession oriented transactions with top performing traditional and alternative boutiques globally. Going forward, given our outstanding competitive position, track record of successful partnerships over the past 2 decades and substantial financial flexibility, we're uniquely positioned to execute on this diverse opportunity set, and we're confident in our ability to continue to create shareholder value through accrete investments and new affiliates.","With that, I'll turn it to Nate to discuss our Affiliates in greater detail.","Nathaniel Dalton","Good morning, everyone. The overall themes of the third quarter continued those we've seen for some time. Excellent organic growth from the client cash flows, combined with continued good investment performance across most of our Affiliates.","Consistent with some broader industry trend, slow momentum has been especially strong among alternative strategies in global equities products. And we're also seeing opportunities to distribute top performing U.S. equity products in institutions worldwide. Now as Sean noted, we continue to generate strong client cash flows across channels, with a total of $10.9 billion in net new flows for the third quarter, our 10th straight quarters of strong positive client cash flows. Looking ahead and consistent with past trends, the pipeline looks good through the remainder of 2012 and into 2013.","Now turning to investment performance. In the global developed markets category, we had another strong quarter. Highlights include AQR, Trilogy and Third Avenue, which had very good relative performance while Tweedy, Browne's, flagship global value and international product both outperformed, continuing to build on their incredible track record.","In our emerging market category, we had another excellent quarter with Genesis and Trilogy, in particular, outperforming the benchmarks by a significant margin across their products. While Harding Loevner slightly underperformed in the quarter, all of their products are ahead of their respective benchmarks for the year-to-date 1, 3 and 5-year periods.","As with global equities, emerging markets is a product category with substantial opportunities for growth, in part because of the macro opportunities we see, but most importantly, because we have multiple extremely well-regarded firms in each category.","Next turning to our alternatives products. All of the funds at BlueMountain and ValueAct are well ahead of their benchmarks for the quarter and our other Affiliates with significant alternative products, which is AQR and Pantheon, continue to deliver strong performance across their suites of alternative strategies.","One other item to highlight in our alternatives category is product development. In this past quarter, BlueMountain launched the first Credit Opportunities Fund. And as most of you know, AQR has been a market leader in alternative price development, especially in the retail channel, having launched a suite of mutual funds, including managed futures, diversified arbitrage and risk parity funds.","Finally, turning to our U.S. equity product. Against the backdrop of a good quarter in the equity markets, our Affiliates delivered strong relative performance. On the growth side, I would highlight there was an excellent quarter for Times Square, as the firm continued its long-term record of outperformance. On the U.S. value side, systematic had a strong quarter and continues to outperform. And while Yacktman missed its benchmark in the quarter, the firm's long-term track record remains very strong. Top desk [indiscernible] for both funds for the 5 and 10-year periods, for example.","Now turning back to flows. With the headline number of $10.9 billion in positive net client cash flows, this quarter, we saw very strong alternative flows as well as exceptional flows in global, emerging markets and U.S. equities. In terms of geography, we saw positive net flows in both the U.S. and globally, but with the majority coming from non-U.S. clients.","Looking at our flows for the quarter by channel, and starting with the institutional channel. We continue to have very strong performance. In the quarter, we had positive net client cash flows of approximately $7 billion. While we continue to be pleased with the diversity of flows across product and firms, let me reiterate that flows in this channel are inherently lumpy, and we had several very large mandates from this past quarter. That said, we are confident in our ability to continue to generate strong organic growth in the pipeline in terms of won [ph], but not funded mandates, RFPs and searches remains very strong.","Moving to the Mutual Fund channel, we had positive flows of $3.4 billion. Here we also continue the positive trends we've had over the past several quarters. For example, once again, we had strong flows in the sub-advisory channels, and especially, for alternatives products.","In our high net worth channel, flows are about $400 million for the quarter. We had positive flows from GW&K, especially through our U.S. retail distribution platform; and from Harding Loevner and BlueMountain in their international and credit alternative strategies, respectively.","Turning to our global distribution efforts. We continue to make very good progress across our platforms. Now, I thought I would take a step back and remind everyone how we're building these out. Our strategic rationale of hiring senior local experienced sales professionals is that we can provide leverage to our Affiliate model, at the same time, add significant incremental flows to our business.","6 years ago, we started in Australia, and now have local specialist coverage in Australia, the Middle East, parts of Europe, including the U.K., Netherlands and the Nordic, as well as for Asia. As Sean said, each of these is providing meaningful contribution, now including Asia, the most recent region we launched.","Looking ahead, in the coming quarter, we'll be adding Swiss and German specialists to our European team operating out of a new office in Z\u00fcrich. And looking further ahead, we're focused on continuing to expand some of our regional teams, adding new senior-level sales in client service professionals, as well as launching new regions and diversifying by channel within the regions we already cover.","Finally, the pipeline at our global distribution platform remains very strong. And we believe we are extremely well positioned to continue to drive good growth through client cash flows.","With that, I'll turn it to Jay to discuss our financials.","Jay C. Horgen","Thank you, Nate. As Sean and Nate discussed, we continue to be pleased with the successful execution of our growth strategy. With strong contributions from both organic growth and new investments, our third quarter results reflect a substantial increase in the earnings power of our business. As you saw on the release, we reported economic earnings per share of $1.91, including a $0.02 contribution from performance fees. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings of $1.04 per share.","Now turning to more specific modeling items. The ratio of our EBITDA contribution to end of period assets under management was approximately 15 basis points in the third quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect this ratio to increase at just over 18 basis points, which includes a reasonable assumption for performance fees. And for 2013, we expect this ratio to be approximately 15 basis points.","Holding company expenses remained flat at $22 million in the third quarter. And we expect them to increase to approximately $25 million for the fourth quarter, reflecting continued investment in global distribution and other anticipated year-end expenses before returning to a more normalized level of $23 million per quarter.","With regard to our taxes, our effective GAAP tax rate for the quarter was approximately 26%. This rate primarily reflects changes in foreign tax rates and reserve adjustments, including a further decrease in the U.K. rate, which also impacted our third quarter cash tax rate of 12%.","For modeling purposes, we expect our GAAP tax rate to be 35% going forward and our cash tax rate to return to approximately 18% in the fourth quarter.  Intangible-related deferred taxes for the third quarter were $11.7 million, also reflecting the U.K. tax rate reduction I just mentioned. While this number may fluctuate across quarters, for modeling purposes, we expect our normalized intangible-related deferred taxes to be approximately $15 million per quarter.","Our share of amortization for the quarter was $19.7 million, and together with $10.2 million of amortization from Affiliates accounted for under the equity method, AMG's controlling interest portion of amortization was $29.9 million. We expect our quarterly amortization to be $31 million in the fourth quarter and going forward. A portion of total interest expense for the third quarter increased to $27.8 million as a result of borrowings related to our new investment activity.","This amount included $6.1 million of pretax noncash computed [ph] interest expense. We expect our total interest expense to increase to approximately $30 million for the fourth quarter, reflecting a full run rate effect of our recent financing activities.","Turning to our balance sheet. We have opportunistically extended the maturity of our balance sheet and increased our available capacity to execute on our new investment growth strategy by raising $340 million and 2 tranches of senior debt at very attractive rates. These 10 and 30-year bonds, which were issued in August and in October, were leveraged-neutral transactions and proceeds were used to repay our outstanding revolver balance.","In addition, we entered into forward equity contracts to sell approximately $150 million of equity at an average price of just over $121 per share. These contracts, under which no shares have been issued to date, can be settled for cash or shares at AMG's discretion.","Now turning to guidance. We are raising the bottom end of our 2012 guidance range as we expect economic earnings per share of $7.20 to $7.70 and are confirming our 2013 range of $8.30 to $9.20. Our guidance assumes normal convention of actual market performance through yesterday for the current quarter and 2% growth beginning in the first quarter of 2013. We also assume a weighted average share count of approximately $53.4 million for the fourth quarter and approximately $54 million for 2013. The lower end of our 2012, 2013 guidance includes a modest contribution from performance fees and organic growth. While the upper end of the range assumes a more robust contribution from both performance fees and net client cash flows. As always, these assumptions do not include earnings from future new investments and are based on our current expectations to Affiliate growth rates, performance and the mix of Affiliate contribution to our earnings. Of course, substantial changes in markets and the earnings contribution of our Affiliates would impact these expectations.","Now we'll be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Kim with Sandler O'Neill.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","First, maybe a question for Nate. Can you talk about the mix of the flows for the quarter, particularly in the institutional channel as it relates to your global distribution efforts versus the Affiliates more directly? And then more broadly, is it fair to say your newer offices are, maybe, coming online quicker, relative to the more seasoned offices as you kind of progress through the distribution expansion?","Nathaniel Dalton","Okay. So first, in terms of mix of flows, I'll say a couple of things here. So one -- obviously every sale, and, I would say, every bit of [indiscernible],  but every sale starts and ends with Affiliates, right? So there's -- I think I made this point last quarter, which is it's getting increasingly hard to separate that out completely, but everything involves Affiliates. That said, this quarter -- a significant portion of the flows had our global distribution, institutional folks -- folks in institutional channels here. A significant portion of flows had our guys involved including some of the very large mandates we talked about. So that's the first bit. And then in terms of things coming online, I would say there's really 2 parts to that. Right? So the first is, if you think about a really new region -- so Sean mentioned -- I think Sean and I both mentioned Asia. It's that couple year ramp just like we've seen elsewhere. The other thing that's happening though is we're adding resources inside regions. So for example, take Europe where we've been there for a while, but we added a Nordic specialists, for example, a little over a year ago, going to be coming on 2 years now, but we added that specialist there. And as we think about adding the German and Swiss specialists, those kinds of things. Those are not really brand new regions, right? Because we've been covering them, and we do expect the contribution from people like that to come online faster, and that has been our experience.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Got it, that's helpful. And then as it relates to performance fees, I know there are still a couple of months left in the year. But any color in terms of how things might be shaping up, particularly just given the diversification of the various strategies and Affiliates that can contribute at this point?","Jay C. Horgen","Yes, Michael, it's Jay. We continue to see performance fees as a significant opportunity. We have great diversity. As you mentioned, our performance fees stream ranging from absolute return products to loan-only products. We've been consistent in our guidance throughout the year in terms of what we see performance fees coming in at kind of 5% to 10%. I don't think anything's changed there. As you've heard though in our prepared -- in my prepared remarks, the -- we've upped the bottom end of that range, so we are seeing -- we're coming into focus on what we're -- what we think our opportunity is for the fourth quarter.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, I know you've sort of gotten away from guiding to an all-in number as it relates to deal capacity but can you just maybe walk through all of the different levers available to you in terms of sort of cash on hand, ongoing free cash flow, the credit facility, as well as the equity forward agreements?","Jay C. Horgen","That was great. You summarized them all, but I'll put a few numbers to that. Well first, we did see just an outstanding opportunity to finance long term, fixed rate debt in the third and fourth quarters. So that -- we took that opportunity to raise $340 million in 10-, 30-year bonds, extending our balance sheet, increasing capacity under our revolver. But we also added level of flexibility, because we have a 3- and 5-year call feature at par for both of those. So we felt very good about those financings, both from a extending and increasing capacity, but also flexibility. So we used that to pay off our revolver with virtually no revolver balance. We have $800 million available together with ready access to $150 million under the 4 -- again, we have not issued those shares, but we have ready access to that. And then, our annual cash flow in the neighborhood of $450 million of after-tax earnings, just if you added those numbers up -- and I'm doing it in my head, you're up approximately $1.5 billion.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I apologize the connectivity here is pretty thin. Just in terms of deals, you've seen a little pickup of other activities, Carlyle acquiring TCW, maybe a bit of an instant credit [ph] transaction. But then Schwab paying a pretty big number for Thomas partners. Just wondering if you could comment a little bit about the competitive backdrop? Any pricing change you may be seeing underneath the good pipeline?","Jay C. Horgen","Thanks, Bill. I would say that the competitive environment is -- continues to be highly favorable for us. There are, of course, always competitors for the very best firms and you've identified some transactions that I would agree are situation specific in the main for demographically driven succession transactions involving traditional boutique asset management firms, as well as succession-oriented [ph] transactions involving large alternative firms, and finally, divestitures of boutique firms in all of those general categories are a competitive position. It continues to be stronger than ever, and our pipeline as you've heard me say, is very strong and balanced.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Yes, that's helpful. Then just a second question. You mentioned earlier that you were able to sell some U.S. equities in some of the institutional areas. I'm just wondering just more broadly, are you seeing any more systematic change in risk appetite made from fixed income back to active equities, or is it more at the margin?","Jay C. Horgen","I think what is gratifying, if that's not too strong a word for us, is that the overall industry environment really hasn't changed. As we all know, passive products, passive equities and fixed income products, both in the retail and the institutional space domestically, and to some extent, internationally -- although, I would say non-U.S. clients, in general, have been put willing to rerisk sooner. Those are the clear trends they continue. I think we can all speculate about when clients will rerisk and what will happen when they rerisk. I think, as you heard me say, we're very pleased with our position, both in terms of strategic allocation of products, but also the outstanding performance and underlying excellence of our boutiques. And really what we're seeing is in driving the flows is both the outstanding -- ongoing outstanding performance of our Affiliates as well as a good execution -- very good execution in our global distribution strategy.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just like to start on the M&A pipeline, and I understand that the overall pipeline is very strong. But if you can kind of dissect your comments into 3 main groups, succession planning being one, and then divestitures in the U.S. being 2 and then Europe being 3? How have each of those kind of sources for M&A changed over the last 6 months? Are some stronger or some weaker?","Sean M. Healey","I think succession-oriented transactions probably have been -- I think they will increase going forward, and we've seen fewer than one might have thought at the beginning of the year. And that I think is owing as much as anything to the timing of market volatility with a market recovery occurring in the second half of the year. If you wanted to get a transaction done by the end of the year, you really had to begin in, let's say, by June. And the ongoing driver of demand for transaction activity is, of course, demographically driven succession. That doesn't change. And I think we'll see in the medium to long-term, we'll see continued strong activity and substantial opportunities for us in that category. Divestitures tend to be more episodic. I would say there's relatively less activity among U.S. banks and insurance companies now, but still there are some transactions that we're considering, evaluating. And there are substantial opportunities, both in transactions or involving potential transactions that have been well publicized as well as that are more private. And we're evaluating all of those opportunities. We continue to be extremely disciplined and extremely selective in how we pursue transactions, and so we'll see what unfolds. Obviously, as Jay described, we've positioned the balance sheet to provide substantial flexibility in the event that we see opportunities, but we haven't taken down all of the available capital. And so if transactions don't manifest in the medium term, then we'll -- we don't have excess capacity.","Craig Siegenthaler - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And the demographic point on succession planning is very strong, and it's been here for a while. But at this point in time, the equity markets have recovered very strongly, so a lot of these underlying [ph] businesses have higher valuation, which I think could help some of them look to sell. But also your tax has gone up. So why isn't kind of right now like, kind of the best environment for succession acquisition? Where is that -- my thought kind of wrong there?","Sean M. Healey","Well, you're not wrong. But I think if somebody wanted to get in prior to the end of the year and pending rises in tax rates, I think they would've had to have started in the first half of the year, or at least, let's say, by June. So I think we will see substantial activity going forward, and we're seeing the early stages of that. But I think looking out into next year and beyond, we're quite confident that there will be a substantial set of opportunities.","Operator","Your next question comes from Robert Lee, KBW.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I'm just curious. When you talk a lot and talk to perspective Affiliates, I mean if I think back 10 years ago, 5 years, 6 years ago, in fact, pretty much, except for helping with some compliance infrastructure, there weren't that many incremental resources you could -- that you really brought to bear on new Affiliates. Now, you have the global distribution that's pretty built out with the Yacktman. It seems like you're trying to -- or making some efforts maybe to beef up the managers' business. Can you maybe talk a little bit -- when you -- are you more willing to think of other types of asset managers that may have attractive investment teams and records that are intact, but you'd feel like you can bring more to the table in terms of resources, so you're thinking more broadly about some of the organizations you're willing to invest in.","Sean M. Healey","The answer broadly is no. We really aren't changing the basic business strategy. We continue to focus on investing in the highest quality boutique asset managers, who really have complete businesses, and those kinds of firms anticipate continued growth. They're betting on their continued growth by choosing our structure and approach. But of course, what is the case is that in a whole set of product categories and distribution channels, we can provide meaningful additional growth to Affiliates, and I think it makes us that much more attractive to these very high quality firms, both traditional and alternative, domestic and outside the U.S. And then finally, I think one bit of our strategy, and maybe Nate can elaborate on this, is to continue to help our Affiliates grow by acquiring or expanding -- acquiring teams or expanding their product set with the addition of key personnel and in building out existing Affiliates or helping existing Affiliates build out their product set and expand their distribution. I think we're an even better partner to our Affiliates.","Nathaniel Dalton","I would agree with that. I think one way we, I think, have talked about on previous calls. But there really are -- it's a virtual cycle we're building. And one of the things between the increased strength of the distribution platforms we're building in a collaborative way with our Affiliates, right? So we're not building it for them, we're building it with them. But one of the pieces of that circle is the ability to increase the pace of product development, increase the pace of new product launches. And so I think it opens up a number of new possibilities. And you'll hear us talking more about these as we go forward. But I think each of these pieces opened up more opportunities, including the ones Sean mentioned.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","All right, great. Could you maybe also update us a little bit on -- I guess this should be a part of the pipeline discussion, but on your wealth management, did that large transaction -- I guess it closed around the middle of the year. And are you kind of comfortable with where you are in terms of added process, in terms of seeing more? Did that really have the desired effect of kind of attracting more people to your model, or at least, willing to engage in conversations? Or has it kind of been going a little slower than you thought or kind of right in line? Any kind of color you could provide.","Sean M. Healey","I think we continue to be very pleased with the launch of those business. The investment in Veritable was absolutely a huge boost to their profile and that serves as a flagship investment, which certainly helps them in their prospecting efforts, but any new initiatives requires a tremendous amounts of investment and timing going out and building relationships with all of these independent firms and teams. And so that process continues and the very best opportunities will manifest over time. But looking at what they're doing and the way in which they are executing the business plan, I'm quite happy.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","And maybe one last question for Jay. Is it possible to get some color on what proportion of the AUM are fees are, at this point, based on predominantly on say, committed capital, but not really market value? Obviously, this Pantheon, I'm assuming this credit opportunity's fund may be incorrectly, but with BlueMountain, may be based more on committed, not market. So just trying to get a feel for what keeps the asset base of kind of just kind of rock solid steady quarter-to-quarter, is not going to move around too much?","Jay C. Horgen","I think you're identifying the main kinds of pieces of it. I think it's -- and I was -- I think even on the BlueMountain one, I'd be a little bit careful on the way you just described it as well. Because it is a -- the credit opportunity's kinds of funds, I'll put it that way, and those lines of business. They're not just rock solid committed capital in one sentence, which is they all do have upside opportunities as well, right? So you can think of sort of a baseline level of fees with opportunities above that.","Jay C. Horgen","And we've talked about Pantheon being our most stable Affiliate, because it is committed capital. And that is, by far the largest Affiliate with this type of arrangement. And it really is the single biggest place to find long data capital.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cynthia Mayer with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Maybe a question on the EBITDA to AUM on a ratio. It sounds like 15 basis points in 3Q. You said just over 18 basis points in 4Q, 15 basis points for next year. So if next year's fourth quarter has also got performance fees, and so, it's higher than 15 basis points, doesn't that imply lower than 15 basis points for 1Q through 3Q? And if so, why would it be going down a little bit?","Sean M. Healey","So as you know, Cynthia, I said they were approximate, and that was for the full year. And of course, the other quarters also have some level of performance fees, notably the second quarter usually has a noticeable amount. I really do think that you're right, the fourth quarter will have an elevated amount. But when you take 25% of the  fourth quarter and you blend it with stuff that looks like 15 basis points around the 1 through 3, you'll end up with something that looks like 15 for the year.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. But wouldn't that imply, let's say, a year from now that 3Q '13 would be a little bit lower than this year's?","Jay C. Horgen","Not necessarily. No. No, not necessarily. And remember -- again, when we give this guidance, we're really giving it to a reasonable level. So there's a range, there's a range around it. That's why we have $8.30, to $9.20 range out there next year. So if you have to imagine that we're talking to the middle of the range. More or less.","Sean M. Healey","And Cynthia, I would just add that I think we're -- we may be the only one of our peer companies to give guidance of any sort. And so I think we're -- hopefully, you'll appreciate the challenge and forecasting asset management businesses generally in a business as large and diverse as ours is just inherently difficult to forecast. And predicting the changes in mix over time is specially challenging. We are very confident in the underlying drivers of our earnings growth. Obviously, incremental new investments will always change the ratio that we're discussing in a way that we're indifferent to. So it's not really a number that we used to manage the business in any way. I understand it has an element in building a model, but hopefully, you can appreciate the degree to which it's impossible to be precise.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Definitely. Yes, sure it's an output. So yes, and I appreciate it. On the -- I think on some of your presentations, you guys give emerging markets exposure by EBITDA. And I'm just wondering if you could update us on that? Sounds like 2 out of -- most of your emerging markets managers are doing really well.","Sean M. Healey","Yes, it's just over 10%. It's sort of in that 11% to 12% range.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","11% to 12%, okay. And last question is just on Yacktman. I guess you noted the underperformance, is that due to any particular plant in their strategy and what kind of any impact do you expect on flows going forward on that?","Jay C. Horgen","I think it really was just in a market that kind of ran like that. We weren't surprised, they weren't surprised. And now, the flow profile of the business remains strong. And I think one item we talked about, maybe at the last call, we're also seeing them -- we're all going to be -- helping them get on to some additional platforms and also sort of begin to cross-sell a little bit in our relationship. So I think we feel good where they are and the flow opportunity.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So given the new platforms then, would you expect the flows to accelerate ahead?","Nathaniel Dalton","Well, I think -- remember, there's the mutual fund side of it and also the separate account side of it. So I think over the long run, we're confident in the opportunity to keep distributing the funds and -- there is a little bit of lumpiness in that business as well, so I'm not -- I'm sure it won't be a straight line.","Operator","Our next question comes from Daniel Fannon with Jefferies.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Nate, I think you mentioned on the call in your prepared remarks about opportunities for some of the top U.S. funds to kind of continue to expand worldwide. If you could kind of elaborate on products or individual firms as kind of what you think that opportunity is?","Nathaniel Dalton","Okay. So I think -- so this quarter, we had some good wins for U.S. equities both inside and outside the U.S. in the institutional channel. And I think the opportunities are coming from a couple of places, right? So one -- and I think Sean mentioned this, if you think about our Affiliates, we have firms that are managing really -- we talked about truly differentiated products, right? So even though there are some trends away from U.S. equities, people are looking with ways to get returns into their portfolios, and including within asset class, looking for ways to gain returns in their portfolios. So for managers, who are really willing to try to get returns in, were seeing opportunities. I think part of it is, which I do think there is that trend. I think part of it is also the sort of same macro point we're making in global emerging and elsewhere, which is we're just simply bringing more specialists' coverage online to match up with good performing U.S. equity firms. So if you can imagine a new very senior salesperson in the region, who has this other very good relationships, as if we'll look at the breadth of all of our Affiliate products. He has some -- he or she has some very good performing U.S. equity products to pick from. So we're just simply increasing the front part of the funnel, if you will, for these Affiliates in ways that just wasn't there before. So I think some of it is also that. So I think it's partly, there is -- I do think there is some trend to people looking for ways to get returns in, including for differentiated products in U.S. equity. I think that's helping us, but I also think, part of it is just -- and we saw like this quarter, part of it is just bringing product to places it just wasn't before. And making those matches.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And I guess just one more question on guidance, and I realize you don't have a crystal ball. But looking at 2013 and what you guys see today, whether it be alternative versus performance fees outlook versus high watermark or kind of pipeline for flows, I mean, would you characterize what you've laid out '13 as kind of conservative, middle of the road? Just some color around that?","Sean M. Healey","I would say consistent. We have a, as hopefully comes through, an optimistic view, a confident view of our underlying business dynamics and the quality of our business and the Affiliate franchises. And I think all of those trends are continuing, in so far as we can tell. Of course, there's much about our business and about the macro environment, which is impossible to predict. And so among other considerations, we -- both in how we've positioned our balance sheet as well as in the diversity and breadth of our product exposure. We position our business to be resilient even in difficult times as well, but we feel confident about our prospects.","Operator","Our next question comes from Greggory Warren from Morningstar.","Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Jumping back to Yacktman a little bit and the flows overall. It looks like based on the data I'm looking at, you hit about $1 billion plus in flows for Yacktman during the quarter. That was part of what helped push your total flows up closer to $11 billion. As you look forward, do you think we should be looking at maybe a quarterly run rate in that $7 billion to $10 billion range? Is that too sort of optimistic or do you think that you sort of hit us another level here between Yacktman and between sort of the traction you're getting with the distribution platform?","Nathaniel Dalton","Yes, so let me start. So I think I would not describe it the way you just did. I would not say things like we've just hit another level or whatnot. I'd go with -- I think the themes are really the ones we talked about in our prepared remarks, which is look, we feel good about the traction that we have. We feel good about the sort of 10-straight quarters now positive flow momentum. But the flows this quarter, I take your point about Yacktman. But the flows this quarter, the institutional channel was a very big contributor and flows in the institutional channel are very lumpy and we had some -- we experienced the benefits of that this past quarter. And so I would not characterize it as really other than that. We feel good about the prospect, we feel good about the momentum but this quarter, we really did benefit from some of that lumpiness, not to overuse it.","Sean M. Healey","I would add to that, and maybe this is something that is also responsive to Dan's question, which is we're assuming that some version of the status quo is continuing. What we're not assuming is that there is a dramatic rerisking in client appetite and client demand. I think to the extent that occurs, and we can all speculate as to whether it will and when it will. But to the extent it does occur, it will be a very substantial addition to the underlying drivers of our organic growth. So the growth that we are consistently achieving, we all understand is in spite of broader industry trends. And I think we feel quite good about how our business is positioned, generally, both for difficult times, but also for good times. And I don't think we're in from an industry environment, client demand perspective we're really not in good times yet. And so that opportunity is not reflected in our underlying guidance expectations.","Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I think that, that's sort of the impressive quality of what we've been seeing from you guys over the last year or so. But you sort of answered my second question which is looking at institutional. I mean, understanding that it is a bit lumpy, noticing that the sales tipped a little bit higher, the redemptions were a little bit lower and just not thinking that, that was going to be a continued factor going forward. But I guess, just back to round about to my question again. Do you think it's unreasonable to sort of assume -- a 2% is sort of quarterly organic growth rate? Do you think that, that's out of the norm? Based on what you've done with the distribution platform, based on the fact that even Yacktman with pour performance this year relative to its history and relative to the benchmarks? It's still generating decent flows.","Sean M. Healey","I think we are confident in our expectations for continued strong momentum and not really comfortable giving more precise guidance than that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Xiaowei Hargrove with William Blair.","Xiaowei Hargrove","I've got a couple of questions on behalf of Chris here. First, on the institutional channel. Your redemption rate there is at a multiyear low. So maybe if you can talk about what you think has been the key drivers of that trend?","Sean M. Healey","Yes, so I think -- and the last question also, question touched on the floor. But I think we are benefiting both from an uptick in gross sales, institutional but also -- and as you note, in this quarter in particular, a decline in the growth outflows. I think, look, it comes down to our -- our Affiliates in the main performing very well, right? I think that's the place that it starts and stops. And I really think that's the main driver of it.","Xiaowei Hargrove","Okay. And then my second question is kind of related to that also. So the hedge fund industry has seen a pickup in outflows this year versus last? And obviously, performance has been a big driver of that. So do you think -- is it just performance that's been a differentiator for your Affiliates? And that's how they've been seemingly able to buck that trend?","Nathaniel Dalton","I think it's -- as Nate said, for alpha-oriented firms, all of our Affiliates, traditional and alternative, it is all about performance ultimately. And so good performance will drive. And that's not all you need, but without good performance, you're not going to see a strong organic growth. That said and stepping back a little bit and talking about what we see in the alternative industry, generally. I think there are a large number of, I'll say, a substantial subset of the alternative firm universe where you see excellent franchises performing well and generating stronger organic growth from net flows. Happily, our Affiliates are among those kinds of firms. And I think it's the firms that are, either have not built their business franchise for the long run or have had performance challenges that are seeing declines. And so it really is that bifurcation in the industry, which is underlying those broad trends that you described.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. I'd now like to turn the floor back over to Sean Healey for closing comments.","Sean M. Healey","Thank you again for joining us this morning. As you've heard, we're pleased with our results for the quarter, confident in our prospects for continued strong growth ahead. We look forward to speaking with you in January.","Operator","Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Selene Oh, Vice President, Investor Relations for AMG. Thank you. You may begin.","Selene Oh","Thank you for joining AMG to discuss the results for the second quarter of 2016. In this conference call, certain matters discussed will constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected due to a number of factors including, but not limited to those referenced in the company\u2019s Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the call.","AMG will provide on the Investor Relations section of its website at www.amg.com a replay of the call and a copy of announcement of our results for the quarter as well as a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of any estimates of the company\u2019s economic earnings per share for future periods that are announced on this call.","With us on the line to discuss the company\u2019s results for the quarter are: Sean Healey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Nate Dalton, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Jay Horgen, Chief Financial Officer.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Sean Healey.","Sean Healey","Thanks, Selene, and good morning, everyone. Against the backdrop of volatile markets and muted investor risk appetite, AMG generated solid results in the second quarter, including stable economic earnings per share and year-over-year growth of 8% in our pro-forma assets, bringing our total assets under management to approximately $700 billion.","Our Affiliates produced excellent relative investment performance and positive net client cash flows and we added outstanding new Affiliates, including Winton Capital Management and Capula Investment Management.","As Jay will describe, given the increased earnings power of our business, even in a relatively difficult environment for the asset management industry, we see continued earnings growth for the balance of the year and through 2017.","Notwithstanding, elevated market volatility, which resulted in industry-wide risk aversion, we generated positive net client cash flows during the quarter. As Nate will discuss, our strong net inflows in the retail and high net worth channels were partially offset by lower institutional sales, especially at the end of the quarter as a number of global institutional clients decided to pause implementation of investment decisions in response to the unexpected outcome of the UK\u2019s Brexit referendum.","We believe that this was essentially a short-term response, and looking ahead as markets have stabilized and investor expectations adjusted, we are seeing a resumption in sales momentum and expect to benefit from these delayed fundings through the balance of the year.","We also believe that rise in dispersion in the market will increasingly favor differentiated performance-oriented strategies, including focused active equities and a range of value-added alternative investment products. Our Affiliates\u2019 equity strategies performed well in the quarter, including Tweedy, Browne, Harding Loevner and Genesis; which all posted strong absolute and relative performance in global and emerging market equities; and the Yacktman and TimesSquare, which in particular generated excellent results in U.S. equities.","Our alternative managers also generally performed well amid the volatility, as several of our Affiliates, including AQR, First Quadrant and BlueMountain generated meaningful alpha during the quarter.","Looking forward, contrary to conventional wisdom around challenges in the hedge fund industry, there is significant and growing client demand for alternative strategies across distribution channels; particularly those which are additive at a total portfolio level, given their lack of correlation to traditional equity and fixed income markets.","We believe this is an enduring trend. The diversification and balanced risk-and-return offered by well-designed alternative strategies are compelling to both sophisticated global institutions, as well as individual retail investors as they strive to meet their investment goals. We believe that clients are increasingly focusing on the highest quality managers with long-term track records of alpha generation, and those managers which had demonstrated that they can effectively manage at scale and with institutional quality.","This trend benefits the highest quality alternative firms including our Affiliates, which are recognized as leaders in their respective discipline, and as evidence of this, our alternative Affiliates have consistently generated positive net client cash flows over the past five years including in the second quarter.","Across our group of Affiliates, we have strategically and deliberately assembled a very large and diverse set of alternative strategies, which taken as a whole, not only generates strong organic growth, but also have low correlation with equity markets and low correlation with each other. There is no other firm in the industry with the range and quality of our alternative product set.","We think that this point is undervalued by the market and that the benefit of our strategic position across a very broad range of alternative strategies will become increasingly evident.","Our substantial exposure to this array of strategies, which is in aggregate approximately 40% of our AUM and the highly diversified return streams they provide is not only attractive in its own right, but it is also a strong complement to our strategic focus on differentiated active equities through our outstanding traditional Affiliates. As clients increasingly seek the highest quality active managers for the alpha portions of their portfolios, our industry leading boutique Affiliates are well-positioned for continued strong organic growth going forward.","Finally, turning to new investments, we continue to have an outstanding opportunity to further enhance the diversity of our performance oriented product set by partnering with leading traditional and alternative firms around the world.","The transaction environment remains highly favorable for us and we have a diverse global pipeline of prospective new Affiliates that are drawn to AMG\u2019s excellent reputation as a partner for over 23 years. Given our unmatched competitive position, and our strong and flexible capital structure, we are confident in our ability to execute additional accretive investments in new Affiliates. And together with the organic growth of our existing Affiliates are well-positioned for continued earnings growth ahead.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it to Nate to discuss our Affiliates results in more detail.","Nathaniel Dalton","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. As Sean said, in the quarter heavily influenced by macro uncertainty, we have positive net flows and our business performed well, as the market volatility created opportunity for high-quality active managers.","Let me begin with performance of the second quarter and start with our alternative products. Across our Affiliates, we are one of the largest managers for alternative products in the world with a very diverse portfolio of strategies across categories and investment styles.","As Sean mentioned, the addition of a diverse series of high-quality alternative return streams to our outstanding equity boutiques, significantly improves the stability of our business, while also providing enhanced long-term return profile. Now, before I describe our performance in more detail, let me further breakdown our alternatives exposure in the categories. And we now have these categories broken out in our IR presentation on our website.","We have four primary group earnings. First, Private Equity & Real Assets, which includes the variety of long-locked capital products, such as Pantheon\u2019s global private equity fund of funds and infrastructure funds, Baring Asia\u2019s emerging markets private equity strategies and EIG\u2019s energy and related infrastructure investments; none of which are impacted by short-term fluctuations in equity market.","The next category is Systematic Diversified strategies. These include our managed futures or CTA products at AQR, Systematica and Winton, which see to deliver returns which are uncorrelated with equity markets and often substantially outperform in declining markets. The third category Fixed Income\/Equity Relative Value strategies, including those at BlueMountain and Capula, which look to provide returns uncorrelated to traditional equity and fixed income markets, as well as strategies with varying degrees of equity market exposure from full exposure to market neutral.","Our fourth category is Multi-Asset and Multi-Strategy, which includes products that utilize a variety of asset classes and exposures to deliver diversifying return streams for both institutional and retail clients.","Turning now to performance, I\u2019m starting with our Private Equity & Real Assets strategies, we have very diversified array of offerings with firms such as Baring Asia, EIG and Pantheon. These firms have a number of current strategies where they are actively putting capital to the work and they have excellent long-term track records.","Next, turning to Systematic Diversified strategies, our Affiliates includes three of the leading CTA managers in the world. So we\u2019re benefiting not just from the diversity these strategies provide during periods of expanding volatility in trending markets. But also from the excess return, these firms have been able to provide pretty consistently over time.","With that as backdrop, our Systematic Diversified strategies were able to navigate the volatile markets in the quarter well. AQR managed futures was one of the strongest performance strategies in the space with a positive return in the quarter and a strong long-term track record.","While Systematica\u2019s flagship BlueTrend fund posted losses in the quarter, it has positive returns for 2016 and a very strong long-term track record. Our investment in Winton is not closed yet, and so is not reflected in the financials of the quarter. But they also have one of the highest quality offerings in this product category and performed well in the quarter.","Among our Fixed Income and Equity Relative Value strategies, BlueMountain and Capula generated positive returns in the quarter across most of their products. While ValueAct on the other hand had a more challenging quarter as they underperformed their benchmark, although they have started the third quarter very strong and continue to have an excellent long-term track record.","Finally, with regards for Multi-Asset and Multi-Strategy offerings, many of our service Affiliates\u2019 products performed well in the quarter, including risk parity products of both AQR and First Quadrant, as evidenced by the returns of their publicly available funds: AQR Risk Parity fund and the AMG FQ Global Risk-Balanced, which were 6% and 7% respectively.","In addition, we saw solid gains across other significant products in the categories such as AQR Style Premia and First Quadrant Tactical Currency.","Now, turning to our equity products and starting with the Global Developed Markets category, where a number of our largest collection strategies posted strong absolute and relative returns.","Tweedy, Browne\u2019s flagship Global Value Fund outperformed its benchmark and peers in the quarter further improving its long-term track record. Through the quarter, this fund holds the top five and ten year track records in Morningstar\u2019s Foreign Large Value category.","In addition, Harding Loevner once again outperformed benchmarks and peers in both our International and Global Equity strategies. Both strategies also feature near or above top decile long-term track records in the respective Morningstar categories.","On the other hand, AQR Artemis underperformed their benchmarks, although they still maintained good long-term performance records in the major non-U.S. equity strategies.","Turning to our Emerging Markets category, we have very broad-based strong relative performance. Almost all of our major products and Affiliates including AQR, Genesis, Harding Loevner and Trilogy posted good absolute and relative returns.","Standouts included Genesis Global Emerging Markets and Harding Loevner Emerging Markets, each of which outpaced the benchmark by over 250 basis points.","Finally, with respect to our U.S. equities, many of our U.S. growth strategies are biased towards quality growth and away from high beta stock. And we benefited from that in the quarter, as they generally outperformed their benchmarks and peers. This includes the largest products of Frontier and TimesSquare.","On the U.S. value side, our largest U.S. equity contributor Yacktman, saw their Focus Fund and Diversified Fund each outperform peers for the quarter allowing them to maintain their top decile returns year-to-date and for the trailing year and both funds still ranking the percentile of their Morningstar category across last 10-, 15-year period.","Now, turning to flows for the quarter, and I\u2019ll reiterate that flows of both the institutional and sub-advisory channels are inherently lumpy. First, we\u2019re pleased to generate another quarter of positive net client cash flows of $630 million, bringing us to positive flows in 22 over the last 24 quarters.","Within our flows this quarter, there are a couple of themes to identify. First, as we discussed on previous calls, we remain very well positioned to participate in the trend of rising allocations to alternatives across distribution channel. And we benefited from this trend again this quarter.","As Sean said, investors are increasingly using alternatives to achieve their investment objectives either generate uncorrelated returns or for risk mitigation. And our Affiliates feature some of the best offerings in liquid and illiquid alternatives, whether for institutional, retail or high net worth investors.","While there have been a lot of headlines about the challenges, so called, hedge funds are facing; we should all be very careful to separate those from the strong underlying trend of flows to alternatives more broadly. A trend we believe will continue, which we were very well positioned to participate in.","Second, the quarter was really a tale with two parts, with a relatively good first two months giving way to June, which was impacted significantly by the Brexit vote and the volatility around it. Then moving to specifics for the quarter and starting with the institutional channel, we had a net out flows of $2.9 billion in the quarter.","There were three broad reasons for the negative net flows in the channel. First, we saw the funding process for several significant mandates well in the back-half of the quarter. A couple of cases were explicitly linked to Brexit related uncertainty. Second, we did experience some outflows from petrodollar related client. And third, unusually, we did not have any meaningful closures in our long-locked capital products with firms such as Pantheon, EIG and Baring Asia.","There was really just an idiosyncratic dynamic related to the quarter. There is significant demand for these illiquid products, with the matter of incidental timing and how the fund rating cycles across facilities stacked up. Turning to the high net worth channel, we had record inflows of $1.7 billion for the quarter. Key contributors to this quarter\u2019s strong flows were SMA sold to our broker dealer channel, especially municipal bonds, as well as our AMG Wealth Partners platform, where we continue to see good traction developing.","In the mutual fund channel, we had net inflows of $1.8 billion in the quarter. From an asset class perspective as well as this quarter we\u2019re driven by strong inflows for alternatives and emerging market equities offerings and we continue to benefit from much better U.S. equity redemption rates.","From an Affiliate perspective, key contributors to net positive flows were AQR and Harding Loevner. We did have some elevated retail outflows at our UK Affiliate, Artemis, in second-half of the quarter, particularly in the UK-oriented strategies following the Brexit vote. But as markets recover, we expect this to continue to abate.","More broadly, where there is still a lot to be determined regarding the outcome, we do not see the Brexit vote having a significant direct impact on our distribution efforts or our Affiliates operations more broadly. In fact, in the area most likely to be impacted, the retail channel across the UK and Europe, our Affiliate product offering, even from our UK-based Affiliates are mostly domicile outside of the UK and it would be relatively unaffected, our domiciled in the UK, but also sold to UK clients.","Looking ahead, with our outstanding and growing array of high-quality equity and alternative products, along with our unique distribution strategy, which includes both the Affiliates and distribution teams as well as AMG\u2019s focused complementary resources, we believe we are very well-positioned for meaningful organic growth ahead.","With that, let me turn to Jay, to discuss the financials.","Jay Horgen","Thank you, Nate. As Sean discussed, we generated solid results in the quarter marked by industry-wide risk aversion. AMG has differentiated ability to produce stable earnings across a range of market environment. And with the addition of Winton and Capula, we will further diversify and increase the earnings power of our business. As you saw on the release, we reported economic earnings per share of $3.06 for the second quarter, which included net performance fees of $0.10. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $1.97.","Turning to more specific modeling items, for the second quarter our EBITDA was $220.3 million and the ratio of our EBITDA to end-of-period assets under management was approximately 13.6 basis points or approximately 13.1 basis points, excluding performance fees. In the third quarter, we expect this ratio to decline to approximately 13.1 basis points, reflecting lower performance fees, which is typical in the third quarter.","As a reminder, we will report our recent new investments on one quarter lag. As a result, this will have the effect of lowering our earnings for the second-half of 2016, but not thereafter. As we closed Capula in July, and we expect to close Winton in the fourth quarter without reporting their respective income in the quarter in which we close.","I will further describe the timing and cost of funding of these new investments in a moment.","With regard to our taxes, our effective GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 32.3% and our cash tax rate was 18.8%. In the third quarter and for the full year 2016, we expect our GAAP tax rate to be 33% and our cash tax rate to be 20%.","Intangible related deferred taxes for the second quarter were $21.3 million. We expect this number to remain at approximately $21 million in the third quarter. And for the full year 2016, we expect our intangible related deferred taxes to be approximately $87 million. Our share of reported amortization for the second quarter was $37 million, which includes $14.8 million of amortization from Affiliates accounted for under the equity method.","For the third quarter, we expect our share of amortization to decline to approximately $35 million. And for the full year 2016, we expect amortization to be approximately $145 million. Our share of interest expense for the second quarter was $21.9 million. In the third quarter, we expect our share of interest expense to be approximately $24 million, reflecting the higher revolver balance from the closing of Capula.","For the full year 2016, we expect our interest expense to be approximately $90 million. Other economic items for the second quarter were $0.8 million. For modeling purposes, we expect other economic items to be approximately $1 million per quarter.","Turning to our balance sheet; in June, we announced new investments for the total purchase price of $800 million and simultaneously entered into a forward equity contract for up to 2.9 million shares, a structure which we have used several times in the past. Of the available 2.9 million shares, we expect to issue 2.5 million shares for $400 million proceeds in the fourth quarter upon closing Winton, with the remainder of the purchase price funded under our revolver.","Given this funding profile as well as the ongoing strength of our balance sheet, and the quality and diversity of our business, we replaced on positive outlook by S&P. With our flexible capital structure, we are well-positioned for growth in a range of market environments. And looking ahead the strength and scale of our business, which generates run rate EBITDA of approximately $1 billion along with approximately $1 billion of undrawn capacity available by year-end under our revolver, positions us to create meaningful earnings growth, as we execute on our new investment strategy and return capital to shareholders over time.","Now turning to guidance; we are updating our 2016 guidance, as we now expect economic earnings per share to be in the range of $12.30 to $13.30. This guidance range assumes our normal model convention of actual market performance through Friday for the current quarter and 2% quarterly market growth for the fourth quarter.","As per our convention, given the pacing of our 2016 new investments, our guidance does not assume incremental share repurchases for the balance of 2016. We expect our weighted average share count for 2016 to be approximately 55 million, which includes the expected equity issuance in the fourth quarter.","Given the meaningful run-rate impact of our recent new investments which is not reflected in 2016, as well as the full year impact of the fourth quarter share issuance, we are providing preliminary guidance for 2017, as we expect economic earnings per share to be in the range of $14 to $16. This range assumes the full year effect of our 2016 new investments, our normal model convention of 2% quarterly market growth beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 and each quarter thereafter, and includes our normal model convention for share repurchase in 2017 equal to 50% of our annual economic net income.","As a result, we expect our weighted average share count to be approximately 56 million for the full year of 2017.","The lower-ends of our guidance ranges include a modest contribution from performance fees and organic growth, while the upper-end assumes a more robust contribution from both performance fees and net client cash flows.","As always, these assumptions do not include earnings from future new investments and are based on our current expectation of Affiliate growth rates performance in the mix of Affiliate contribution to our earning. Of course, substantial changes in markets and the earnings contribution of our Affiliates could impact these expectations.","Now, we\u2019ll be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Craig Siegenthaler","Hey, good morning.","Sean Healey","Good morning.","Nathaniel Dalton","Good morning.","Craig Siegenthaler","I want to hit first on the $8 billion of lower institutional sales activity in 2Q. So I\u2019m just trying to think about it. But if Brexit really only impacted the last week of the quarter and the petrodollars impacted the redemptions, but not sales, I just want to better understand the $8 billion decline. And may be the answer is institutional sales activity is very lumpy as you said. And also, I think, you also said that you didn\u2019t have any large lock-up fund raises too.","Nathaniel Dalton","All right, this is Nate. So I think you understand it mostly right. So I think, first, I would say that the Brexit vote, the slowed funding is really where the uncertainty around it. So we actually saw that show up more broadly through the month of June, than just right after the vote. So there\u2019s actually that uncertainty running into it. We saw a few things sort of push out. That was the first.","And then the second is, as you say, we didn\u2019t have any closes in long-locked capital products, which is the other underlying sort of trend I\u2019d give you. And then, yes, of course, as you say, it is always lumpy. And so the timing of the close on one or two fundings ends up - can end up impacting that growth sales number - can end up back in that growth sales number.","The new thing I would say just follow on to your question is, yes, look, July was a good month and the institutional pipeline looks really strong. And partly that is probably because of something that slipped from Q2 into back-half of the year. But the RFP levels and the finals activity levels are really fantastic. And so maybe even a nuance there which is that description I gave of June was really on funding, not really on activity level. Because again, activity level through the quarter was actually quite good.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Alexander Blostein","Thanks. I was hoping you guys can update us on the year-to-date trends that you\u2019re seeing out of Winton and Capula, specifically on performance and flows. And I guess, once you think about your 2017 guidance, can you just remind us I guess again what accretion you\u2019re assuming for that one from these new deals. And I guess the underlying assumptions for that, meaning, flows and the performance fees for those new Affiliates?","Sean Healey","I\u2019ll start. Maybe, Nate, if you want to add in some color and Jay can answer the last bit. When in Capula of course our - in the case of Capula, we just closed our investment and Winton will be later this year. Their performance is actually good and was ironically even better post-Brexit. So across our book, alternative strategies and you heard a broader more comprehensive discussion this quarter and you\u2019ll hear more as we broaden and expand our disclosure around the range and quality of our alternative products.","But the main answer is that looking ahead we feel very good about the position and performance level of especially our largest Affiliate products; but including the range and diversity of the products, because inevitably not every product or strategy will outperform in every period and that it\u2019s the correlation among the alternative products as well as correlation or lack of correlation to equity markets. That\u2019s important to bear in mind.","Jay Horgen","Yes, Nate, do you want to\u2026?","Sean Healey","Jay, I\u2019m just going to answer on the 2017 piece if that\u2019s okay. So on 2017, the first thing, obviously, Alex, is that we\u2019ve incorporated Capula, which has closed and Winton that will close in the fourth quarter. Again, we will hold a full year reporting of those in 2017. The 2016 numbers will be affected by the lag that I mentioned. But that is included in the $14 or $16 of the 2017 estimate.","But specifically when you look at the deal itself, we had announced the range of accretion $0.50 to $0.80. Given that we will be issuing the 2.5 million shares in the fourth quarter, it\u2019s going to be closer to $0.60, but it will still be in that range. And it\u2019s included in the 2017 numbers already.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Carrier","All right, thanks, guys. Hey, Jay, just wanted to get an update, like when we think about the activity that you guys have pursued this year both in kind of the end of 2015, beginning of 2016 and then more recently in June on deals, it\u2019s been pretty active. So just wanted to get an update, when we think about the balance sheet, the capacity, what we should be expecting maybe over the next six months, in terms of either paying down some debt versus the - maybe as you\u2019re going into 2017?","It sounds like you still have capacity and there\u2019s a lot of activity that could potentially be done over the next few years. But just wanted to get an update, just because you guys have been relatively active over the past six months?","Sean Healey","Right, yes. I think that\u2019s a fair comment. So far in 2016 we\u2019ve closed or will close on approximately $1.3 billion in new investments. So I think you are right on that. We have positioned the balance sheet for both flexibility and capacity. As you know we expanded or we increased the revolver to $1.45 billion. And we did the equity forward, really in anticipation to continuing our new investment strategy continuing to execute on our pipeline.","We are well-positioned for that. And as it relates to overall leverage levels, we are just a hair above two times. I think two times would be a level that over a longer period of time we would think we would be at. So we are not really over levered at this point. And in fact, we are probably right where we would want to be. You can see a modest de-levering, but nothing that would change the sort of course of our balance sheet and as it relates to capacity to do deals we\u2019ll by the end of the year have over a $1 billion under our revolver that we can continue to execute.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Bedell","Hi, good morning, folks. Just going to circle back on the institutional side, if you could, size some of that delayed funding in what you\u2019re seeing so far in July just to give us a sense of the flows into July. And also, if you could, break that out between the petrodollar redemptions. I think, Jay, you had before talked about exposure to petrodollar funds all-ins. Just wanted to get a sense of where we are through that sort of potential pipeline of redemptions.","And then also just the magnitude of the private equity fundraisers, I realize they\u2019re lumpy. But I just want to get a sort of a sizing of that.","Nathaniel Dalton","Yes, so I\u2019ll try to hit all those. And I think there - it\u2019s not unfair to think about them as sort of relatively equal magnitudes as a way to think about it. So the fundings sort of a couple of billion, the petrodollar outflows, again that\u2019s not impacting that growth sales number. But that was also significant.","And the closes on long-locked capital, as you say, they\u2019re very lumpy. Some of these when you come through with flagship products those are multibillion products, sometimes spread across multiple closings. But as you say, it will be lumpy, but those are all very significant things. I don\u2019t declare. We did have some additional pieces in, but there was nothing that was sort of a meaningful close on long-locked.","Which again, if you look across the breadth and diversity of that product set across the Affiliates we sort of talked about, it\u2019s quite unusual to not have anything. But again, as I said, it was just the accident of how things stacked up. And then I think our petrodollar, kind of the exposures, still one of the lowest I think in the industry frankly. But it\u2019s still a couple - probably a couple of percentage is probably how we\u2019d characterize that.","Sean Healey","And, again, all of that is separate and apart from the very elevated. In fact, I think I heard Nate use the word fantastic, which is not a typical Nate-word, RFP and finals activity. So we feel very good about current trends, especially given our product set and performance.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of William Katz with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","William Katz","Okay. And thanks so much. I\u2019m just kind of curious, in terms of guidance for this year. I appreciate you giving us next year as well. You\u2019ve narrowed down the range pretty substantially. And feel like the midpoint phased down about $0.50. How much of that just relates to the timing of the economics of the deals versus perhaps a little bit less performance fee dynamic going into the end of the year?","Sean Healey","Yes. So the short answer is it is primarily related to the timing of the financing and the quarter lag of reporting. And then there is a bit of it that\u2019s performance fee. Maybe just to give you the backdrop, but the last time we gave guidance are - at the time we gave that guidance in the quarter which was May 2, we were already up above 1%. And as you can see from our AUM table, we experienced about 1.3% market change for the full quarter. And I also we note that FX impacted it by about 0.5% negative. So we really from the last time we gave guidance, markets really haven\u2019t changed materially.","So it really was not market related. And then, when you look at what happened quarter-to-date July, we\u2019ve effectively experienced about 2% up in our blend which would be exactly consistent with what a quarter would expect. So there is really no change to our forecast with respect to beta, because we got the 2% that I just described.","So really the three items are the quarter lag, closed in July Capula, but we won\u2019t report until the fourth quarter, expect to close Winton in October, but won\u2019t report till the first quarter of 2017. But we will have the revolver balance and the 2.5 million share issuance in this calendar year. And so, that\u2019s the first bit.","The second bit then would be our model convention, given the pacing of due investments, the $1.3 billion I mentioned earlier, we would from a guidance and a model perspective not assume anymore share repurchases. So that has an impact. And then lastly, we\u2019ve taken down our performance fee expectation just modestly, but that\u2019s the third piece here.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Nicholas","Hi, good morning. This is actually Andrew Nicholas calling in for Chris. I just wanted to talk briefly or ask a question on the fiduciary rule. If you guys wouldn\u2019t mind just reminding us what percentage of your EBITDA is exposed to the rule or kind of exposed to US retirement accounts? And then, any thoughts more generally on the shelf space, distributors potentially changing and maybe just more broadly how you expect AMG to be impacted?","Nathaniel Dalton","So this is Nate, I\u2019ll take that one. So I think the short answer, right, is that we don\u2019t think the DOL rules will have a significant impact on our business and maybe just at a first answer, at a bit of a high level. But our Affiliates that are interacting with retirement advisors, retirement investors are already fiduciaries. And so there were time that a piece of our business is modest. It\u2019s actually, frankly, an area where we should able to grow our business and there should be real opportunities for us there over time.","That said, right, there definitely going to be ways that the rules are impacting the way products are sold by intermediates you work with. And that is where most of our retirement business is. And so, we\u2019re probably thinking about this the same way as many others are from that perspective, which is, okay, what are the things we can be doing to be a supportive partner as we are sort of working through - as they\u2019re working through primarily, but as they are working through that.","So, again, not a particularly large piece of our business, the places that we\u2019re interacting directly already with retirement investors were already fiduciaries. It\u2019s 100% of our business. And so, it really is for us the question, how do we really support our channel partners.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Dan Fannon","Thanks, Sean. I guess, could you talk a bit about the new investment outlook and kind of what\u2019s happening there. And maybe, post-Brexit that volatility effect really changes the potential for deals in the short-term, and then also kind of pricing of - we\u2019re seeing evaluations come in given what we\u2019re seeing in the public markets for what the traditional - or their evaluations coming-in in?","Sean Healey","Sure. As you heard us say in the prepared remarks, generally speaking, the new investment pipeline continues to be strong. I guess, I would say looking back over what we\u2019ve done over the last year and trying to imagine looking forward, I think, there is probably a little more balance in the mix of little more traditional and perhaps a bit more U.S. based. But that\u2019s I think, just the - really just the incidental element of the pipeline in our relationship set and not anything that I would call an enduring trend, I think, because the overall opportunity is very much global and includes, of course, excellent alternative firms as well as traditional loan only.","So to your question about whether the recent volatility has done anything to impact the pipeline, I would say, not, not really. I mean, I could maybe argue that to the extent that markets have recovered that there might be a greater inclination to move forward. But it\u2019s not anything, we\u2019ve seen from the discussions that we\u2019re in the midst of and in terms of the forward part of the pipeline that continues to be positive with, I would say, transactions that we\u2019ve been working on, as well as ones that we\u2019re just at the earlier stages.","And finally, with respect to your question about pricing, I would say, for the best firms it\u2019s you always have to pay fair prices. We, as you know, don\u2019t participate in auctions, don\u2019t try to quote, win actions. And firms which choose to partner with AMG are making a much broader decision, beyond just the valuation of the portion of the firm\u2019s revenues that were acquiring in a short transaction.","There are pockets of the industry, I would call out probably, private equity firms where there is a lot of activity, and I would say a supply\/demand balance among buyers and sellers which is less favorable. But even there we still find opportunities to invest in a sensible basis.","And overall, it continues to be very much an execution of our new investment strategy in the same way that we\u2019ve been doing it for two decades, building on relationships that we\u2019ve established over years, and then making investments as a product of all the relationships and the description of our investment structure and how that fits with the prospective Affiliates\u2019 long-term succession plans.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Lee","Thanks. Good morning. I guess my first question is actually in the high net worth flows. I mean, they were pretty strong this quarter and they\u2019ve been actually a fairly positive for a while now. Can you maybe give us a little bit of color on that? Is that coming a lot from - I know they\u2019re not particularly large - but is a lot of that coming from your initiatives in the RIA market or maybe little more color on what\u2019s driving the strong flows in that channel?","Nathaniel Dalton","Sure, so as you said, we\u2019ve been - I think our Affiliates have done a really nice job in the channel. The biggest driver in the quarter and over this period sort of has been the strong flows of - disseminated through the broker dealer channel, including through AMG funds, which has also got a distribution platform for those and the operational platform for those products as well. But as you say, the Wealth Partners - the AMG Wealth Partners is developing some real nice traction with a very significant contributor this quarter, and has been over the last four or five quarters.","And most of that, as always, most of that is due to the really good work of those Affiliates - those very high-quality leading independent RIAs are doing themselves, but we are also doing some - we are also exploring and have now launched a few initiatives to help augment their new business development, and I think some of those are starting to take hold as well, so I think that\u2019s contributing.","Operator","Thank You. Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Bedell","Hi, great. Thanks for taking the follow-up. Just wanted to circle back on just the last part of that my prior question on just the month of July, I think, Nate, you talked about the delayed fundings of around $2 billion. I just wanted to see if that actually came in July, and if the institutional channel is substantially positive in July.","And Jay on the guidance, just the range for performance fee assumptions within your guidance? And on the net flow, on the bottom side, is that still a positive organic growth assumption on the bottom side of the net flows for guidance?","Nathaniel Dalton","Let me start with the question about July. I don\u2019t think, we are going to be able to do kind of month by month. I think, July was a good month, and I think we sort of characterized the sort of sizing of stuff that slipped into the back half of the year. So I think those are both - it was a good month and that is a positive kind of tailwind for the next two quarters, yes.","Jay Horgen","So I am going to - I think, you\u2019re asking about 2017, Brian, in terms of performance fees?","Brian Bedell","Yes.","Jay Horgen","So I\u2019ll address it. I\u2019d just say that as we look at the estimate for 2016, we\u2019ve already booked $6.01, and so really we\u2019re just looking at the second half of the year, we\u2019re making a judgment on where we are. But the year is still early and that\u2019s why we have a range, primarily for performance fees on that $12.30 to $13.30. But when you look out into 2017, and I should have said this earlier, a lot of these items that really just affect 2016, they go away. They normalize, because we\u2019ll have the full year effect of Winton and Capula, we\u2019ll obviously have the full year effect of the share count, and we will have a new year with respect to performance fee opportunity.","When you look at performance fee opportunity and we continue to add incremental breadth and diversity to this product set with the addition of our 2016 Affiliates, and when you take them all together. We expect kind of low-teens contribution for performance fees at the midpoint of the 2017 guidance range. And obviously there is a range around that, makes up a good part of that $2 range.","The other thing that you mentioned is organic growth, and yes we do assume positive organic growth, and a range as well, more modest amount at the low end and more robust amount at the top end.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of William Katz with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","William Katz","Okay, thanks so much. Just two questions, actually. Number one, Jay could you talk more about the decision to use equity in the Winton and Capula transactions versus just funding it from operations and taking on the dilution, and what that might mean for go-forward buying power?","And then on the real assets in private equity, are those three platforms you have called out, are they actually in the market right now for some mandates? Thank you.","Jay Horgen","So I\u2019ll go first. Yes, so, Bill, going back to the backdrop here was we did $1.3 billion in the first six months of announced deals. The forward equity structure, which we\u2019ve used several times in the past, really gives us the option to issue equity. I think the third consideration is our leverage ratio of debt-to-EBITDA is just about two times now, call it 2.1.","So those things taken together, we want to make sure that we have ability to execute on our new investment strategy as we obviously want to pick up the very best highest quality boutique Affiliates, when they come to us, so that we have no interruption there, we obviously also want to keep our leverage at a reasonable level.","So that\u2019s really the two main drivers as to why we chose or why we are choosing to issue 2.5 million shares later this year. It does preserve in both respects, our ability to execute, and as we look forward we expect to continue to execute. So really it is in preparation and getting ready for the next wave of new investments.","Nathaniel Dalton","And then, on the private capital, there\u2019s not a lot we can sort of say about it other than, I\u2019d say what, there is good demand for some of the products. They do have plans, sort of capital raise plans for the back-half of the year. And I think the thing that\u2019s driving the timing or a thing that\u2019s driving the timing, I don\u2019t want to say it\u2019s the only thing, but a thing that is driving the timing has been the pace of putting capital to work from prior things and whatnot.","So it really is just good underlying demand trends and just the question of when they bring products to market.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Alexander Blostein","Thanks for the follow-up guys. Just hoping I can get your updated thoughts on - thoughts around capital management and buyback specifically. So I understand the philosophy around 50% of cash flow. But given where the valuation is for the stock and significantly, I guess, improved capital flexibility from just increased cash flow generation, how are you guys thinking about opportunistic buybacks here?","Sean Healey","Well, to just correct and maybe it\u2019s just semantics, but it\u2019s not a philosophy, it\u2019s a model convention to allow or illustrate the magnitude of the impact on our earnings from the use of the cash that the business generates. So how do we spend the $1 billion in EBITDA that the business generates is, of course, a much more important and relevant question than it was three years ago, five years ago.","We have a long track-record of returning capital to shareholders, when we see periods of relatively lower new investment opportunities. And over time, inevitably as the business grows there will be fewer and fewer periods where all of the cash or the largest part of the cash is used up by new investment opportunities. And so what we see going forward and in terms of the quality and pacing and magnitude of new investments is hard to gauge.","As you\u2019ve heard us say, we continue to be very optimistic about our prospects for adding outstanding new affiliates which will generate earnings accretion, and broaden and diversify our product set and enhance our business in another way. So to the extent we have those opportunities that that will continue to be the primary focus of our capital activity. That\u2019s said, inevitably, the pacing of new investment opportunities, and again, over time as the business grows, the repurchase of shares will continue to be and over time maybe, I would say, even be a more important element of our capital management.","That part is philosophy, and the commitment to return capital, and not to just build cash on the balance sheet, is also part of our philosophy. But the amount and timing of repurchase relative to new investments is difficult to forecast and I think if you look at our track record we expect that that we will continue to do both and do both in a meaningful way.","Operator","Thank you. Mr. Healey, there are no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back to you for any final remarks.","Sean Healey","Thank you again for joining us this morning. As you\u2019ve heard, we\u2019re pleased with our results for the quarter and more confident in our ability to continue to create shareholder value for both organic growth and accretive investments in new affiliates. We look forward to speaking with you again in October. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

[Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Ms. Selene Oh, Vice President, Investor Relations for AMG. Thank you. You may begin.","Selene Oh","Thank you for joining AMG to discuss the results for the third quarter of 2017. In this conference call, certain matters discussed will constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those referenced in the company's Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the call.","AMG will provide, on the Investor Relations section of its website at www.amg.com, a replay of the call and a copy of our announcement of our results for the quarter, as well as a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of any estimates of the company's economic earnings per share for future periods that are announced on this call.","With us on the line to discuss to company's results for the quarter are Sean Healey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Nate Dalton, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Jay Horgen, Chief Financial Officer.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Sean Healey.","Sean Healey","Thanks, Selene, and good morning, everyone. AMG reported strong results for the third quarter, including economic earnings per share of $3.41, representing growth of 12% year-over-year, and record assets under management of $804 billion, a 20% increase over the year-ago quarter. Our results reflect continued excellent execution across our business, including the ongoing investment outperformance of our Affiliates, positive organic growth from net flows and the impact of new Affiliate partnerships.","During the quarter, our Affiliates generated positive net client cash flows of $3.1 billion, with strong new business momentum across a broad array of alternative strategies partly offset by net outflows in equities.","Looking ahead, we see ongoing growth, especially in our alternative and global equity product sets, as global institutional and retail clients increasing recognize the long-term outperformance of specialist boutique managers and expand their allocations to truly diversifying value-added products.","As next month marks the 20th anniversary of AMG's IPO, I thought I would take a moment to step back and consider how our business and strategy have evolved over the past 2 decades. As we all know, in the past 20 years, we've seen multiple market cycles, including several periods of extreme volatility, along with profound changes in financial markets and the asset management industry. Through it all, since AMG's IPO in 1997, global equity markets have roughly doubled. While AMG's market cap and assets under management have both increased by over 20x.","We've achieved this success through excellent execution, disciplined adherence to our core principles and partnering with truly outstanding firms which have generated industry-leading investment performance.","Our growth reflects the advantages that the best-focused boutique firms have been generating alpha, and the degree to its clients continue to recognize and appreciate these advantages along with a very strong alignment, which exists when investment managers are true partners and direct equity owners of their firms.","As we build AMG's business over time, we deliberately sought diversification into product areas such as global and emerging market equities, where clients have been increasing allocations in the alpha portions of their portfolios. These products now represent 35% of our assets under management.","We also saw a growing client demand for the less correlated sources of alpha, which alternative products can provide, and AMG was one of the first traditional asset management firms to add significant exposure to alternatives, beginning with our investment in AQR in 2004.","Since then, with partnerships with leading firms such as ValueAct, BlueMountain, Pantheon, EIG, Baring Asia, Winton and Capula, AMG has now assembled one of the largest and most diverse alternative businesses in the industry, with over $300 billion across a broad array of liquid and illiquid strategies. These strategies are largely uncorrelated to equity markets and to each other and our alternative products set, which represents 39% of overall AUM, enhances the balance and stability of AMG's earnings stream, while also positioning the company ahead of enduring client demand trends. We continue to see strong momentum in this product area, cross markets and channels around the world. And given our Affiliates' outstanding long-term track records, and ability to innovate and develop products to meet clients' evolving needs, we see a tremendous opportunity ahead.","As we all know, in the years following the global financial crisis, the growth of passive investing has been a major development in our industry as the market environment created by central bank interventions dramatically accelerated the flows into passive products.","While many of these products have not been tested across a full market cycle, the growth of passive investments will, no doubt, continue. But in any event, there remains an enduring role for value-added active strategies as clients seek the highest quality alpha-generating products to help meet their obligations and goals, also in complementing their beta exposure in what we now call robo investing.","We believe in our client dialogues continue to indicate that there's enormous opportunity for performance-oriented strategies, providing high-quality - sorry, high-conviction alpha and true diversification, including those offered by our Affiliates, across global and emerging market equities and alternatives.","AMG's track record of organic growth was over $130 billion in net line cash flows into active strategies since the financial crisis, with ongoing sales momentum is evidence of this enduring client demand for alpha products.","As clients around the world, especially large, global institutional clients, increasingly recognized the advantages of specialist boutique firms in managing the alpha portions of their portfolios, there is also a growing trend toward global clients concentrating their manager relationships. While we don't believe that large firms, with mediocre active products, will succeed over the long term, excellent investment performance won't necessarily be enough for smaller firms without global reach and product breadth.","Through AMG's global distribution capabilities, which complement our Affiliates marketing efforts, we have come to offer our Affiliates and ultimately, our clients, the advantages of global scale and distribution and compliance, while also providing the excellence in alpha generation of focused and aligned boutiques. This trend toward manager concentration plays well to AMG's strength as a single point of access to the broadest array of boutique, alpha-oriented strategies, with the ability to build strategic relationships with large clients and intermediaries. We are already benefiting from this trend and expect these kinds of relationships to be an increasingly important theme in our growth going forward.","On top of our excellent prospects for ongoing organic growth, AMG's business strategy provides a unique opportunity to generate incremental earnings growth and product diversification through accretive investments and new Affiliates. Given our outstanding track record over the past 2 decades, AMG is a clear partner of choice for boutique firms, traditional and alternative, on a global basis, which seek a permanent, strategic partner. We have an extremely attractive secular opportunity to create incremental earnings growth and diversification. And while the pace of new investment activity is inherently based on the dynamics of each prospective new Affiliate, we continue to be very busy over a range of potential transactions, though, as always, we remain disciplined and highly selective.","Finally, as our EBITDA has grown from less than $50 million, at our IPO, to over $1.2 billion today, the financial scale and strength of our business is itself, an increasingly important source of shareholder value creation. Our strong capital position, as an A-rated company, along with our substantial free cash flow generation, provides the financial flexibility to not only opportunistically execute new investments but also consistently return capital to shareholders through repurchases and dividends, which will continue to increase over time.","As we look ahead, our business is larger, stronger and more diverse than ever. And the lessons and experience of the past 20 years continue to serve us well. We know that markets will go through difficult periods, with sometimes, extreme volatility. But a disciplined focus and commitment to the core principles, which have guided us into our founding, will ensure continued success.","Our business, active investment management, is ultimately about serving clients well with excellent execution and excellent performance. And together with our outstanding Affiliates, each with a clear focus investment strategy, a track record of excellence and directly in-lined incentives, we are incredibly optimistic about our ability to execute and grow our business over the next 20 years and beyond.","With that, I'll turn it to Nate to discuss our Affiliates results in more detail.","Nathaniel Dalton","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. As Sean said, we had another good quarter of organic growth and our Affiliates continued to extend their excellent investment track records across a broad array of alternative and active equity products.","Now before turning to the details, I wanted to review at a high level our flow profile this quarter against the backdrop of the broader industry-specific themes. We continue to be extremely pleased with our product positioning and new product development and more near term, the fact that we generated another quarter of positive net client cash flows. We also continue to have very good level of activity in terms of won-but-unfunded mandates, finals and our fees across global equities and alternatives, both liquid and illiquid strategies.","Now looking specifically at the shape of the flows in the third quarter, we were clearly impacted by some lumpy flows in both the institutional and sub-advisory retail client segments. We had some significant large wins, especially in the alternatives product category this quarter. But we also had some significant institutional mandates flipped from the third to the fourth quarter and, in addition, we had a couple lumpy institutional outflows in the global equity product category.","While it all netted out to a positive $3.1 billion inflows for the third quarter, more importantly, we feel very good about the forward pipeline and opportunity set for the balance of this year and into 2018.","Looking ahead, we continue to see significant ongoing opportunities in both our liquid and illiquid alternative products across both our institutional and retail client types, and we see our global equity flow pattern significantly improving.","As Sean said, there's an enormous opportunity for performance-oriented strategies providing high-conviction alpha and true diversification, strategies offered by our Affiliates across global and emerging market equities and alternatives and we are increasingly able to leverage our scale to bring these products to sophisticated investors and intermediaries.","Now turning to the details for the quarter. As a reminder, our product categories include alternatives, global equities, both developed and emerging markets, U.S. equities and multi-assets and other strategies.","In addition, we'll continue to discuss our alternative products at the subcategory level to dimension underlying return and flow dynamics that are hard to see at the aggregate level. Starting with our alternative strategies, which account for 39% of our business by assets, within private equity and real assets, our Affiliates, including Baring Asia, EIG and Pantheon, continued their strong long-term track records across their flagship offerings in categories such as global and regional private equity, primary secondaries and coinvestment and infrastructure, including energy. We continue to see each of these Affiliates broadening their product lines as well, adding talent and creating additional complementary yet diversifying growth opportunities, in areas such as coinvestments, real assets, real estate and credit. The combination of these legacy flagship strategies, with scalable product line extensions, are gaining significant traction in the marketplace and we are very encouraged by the organic growth potential. We believe these businesses will make a substantial contribution to what is an enhanced growth profile for AMG.","In fixed income and equity-relative value, major indices posted positive returns in the quarter, as indicated by the HFRI Relative Value Index at the 1.3% return, the HFRI Equity Hedge Index with a 3.6% return, and the HFRI Venture-Driven Activist Index with a 1.2% return.","Our largest product in the category at Affiliates such as AQR, BlueMountain and Capula have mixed performance in the quarter but continue to maintain very good long-term track records. The ValueAct had a challenging quarter of earnings, well ahead of the index year-to-date on a trailing broader equity markets.","I would also note the performance of our Affiliates equity hedge products was especially good this quarter as a number of products at AQR, PFM and Systematica, produce strong relative and absolute returns.","Now within our multi-strategy and other category. Indices are positive for the quarter. For example, the HFRI Fund Weighted Composite return of 2.3%. Against that backdrop, most of our Affiliates' key strategies generated strong, absolute and relative returns in the quarter as it benefited from strong market betas across asset classes. Products that perform particularly well include AQR's multi-assets style premier, alternative beta and risk-bearing strategies as well as First Quadrant's prosperity and commodity strategies.","Now in our systematic diversified category. Broadly speaking, industry returns were flat in the quarter, and the SocGen Trend Index rose by a modest 0.8%, remaining negative for the trailing 1 and 3-year periods.","In recent periods, a variety of macro factors have combined to offset what have been steady gains from equities in these diversifying strategies. The processes behind these strategies incorporated a wide array of underlying engines across asset classes, which have proved over the long term to generate alpha, particularly in severe market drawdowns. Our Affiliates performance was in line with peers this quarter. And while there are some near-term challenges in certain segments of the systematic investment universe, there continues to be significant, broad-based demand for algorithmic investing, and our Affiliates are among the leaders in developing products to meet this demand.","Turning now to flows in alternatives category. We had an excellent quarter of organic growth, with $10.3 billion of net inflows, supported by continued momentum across both institutional and retail clients.","Looking at the quarter, on a subcategory basis, consistent with recent trends, we saw good flows in both fixed income and equity relative value and a multi-strategy in other subcategories. While systematic diversified continue to be in net redemptions. We also had a very strong quarter in our private equity and more illiquid product set as we saw significant wins and some closings. This occurred even as realization activity increased as Affiliates crystallize the asset values for certain mature investments in this environment.","Now moving next to our global equities category, which accounts for approximately 35% of our business by assets. In this strong quarter for global developed markets with the MSCI World Index returning 5%. Our Affiliates generated good results in the quarter as well with the flagship strategies from AQR, Harding Loevner, TimesSquare, and Trilogy outperforming their benchmarks, while Veritas had a more challenging quarter but maintains their very strong long-term track record.","Emerging markets indices also posted strong returns with a benchmark MSCI Emerging Markets Index of 8% in the quarter. Among our Affiliate, the flagship products of AQR and Trilogy outpaced the index, while Genesis and Harding Loevner lagged for the quarter, which is not surprising, given they were underweight in more growth-oriented sectors, which outperformed.","Turning to global equity flows. As I mentioned before, we had a challenging quarter, with $4.6 billion in net outflows, as we experienced a couple of lumpy institutional redemptions, at the same time as we had a light growth sales quarter among our institutional clients. In part, this is because several large funding slipped in the fourth quarter.","Now in terms of the category more broadly, AMG's largest Affiliates, AQR, Artemis, Harding Loevner, Tweedy, Browne and Veritas, all continue to maintain excellent long-term track records in their primary products. We see good product development within this group.","In addition, we've been working with a number of our other Affiliates to build out their global investment capabilities, and some of these products are beginning to be in traction as well.","Turning next to U.S. equities, which accounts for 14% of our business by assets. Markets were meaningfully positive, small caps outperformed large caps and growth outperformed value.","Now for the quarter, the S&P 500 returned 4.5%, while the Russell 2000 Index returned 5.7%. Our performance is mixed, we had stronger, absolute and relative performance in a number of smaller cap strategies, an area where several of our Affiliates including Frontier and SouthernSun, outperformed across their flagship products.","Conversely, given the relative underperformance of value and larger cap, Yacktman's flagship strategy underperformed the broad market benchmarks this quarter but maintains an outstanding long-term track record.","Now within U.S. equities, we saw $3.2 billion net outflows, and this is in line with industry-wide trends. But while institutional search activity and retail demand remains relatively muted, we do see improvement on the redemption side.","Now while broadly speaking, investors are currently favoring so-called passive exposures for the U.S. equity portions of their portfolios. We believe true, alpha-oriented U.S. equity managers will continue to be able to produce excess return, which in turn, will drive client demand.","Finally, moving to the multi-asset and other category, which accounts for 12% of our business by assets and this encompasses multi-asset and balance mandates at our wealth management Affiliates, as well as a number of specialty, fixed income and multi-asset products.","In the category, we've produced net inflows of $580 million, as we again saw solid sales activity and a reduction of institutional redemptions within our specialty fixed income and multi-asset product set.","Performance for most of the products in this category remains good versus our benchmarks and the customized portfolios were wealth management Affiliates continue to broadly perform well across their ultra-high net worth clients.","Now while the broader investment management landscape faces a number of challenges, we believe that the business we have built is very well positioned. Together with our Affiliates, we are one of the largest providers of alpha-oriented strategies, especially on alternative and global emerging market equities. This combination of focused excellence by our Affiliates in the scope and scale of the global asset manager provides us with a significant number of opportunities to continue to improve how we, together, meet evolving needs of clients.","And as Sean said, we are making very good progress, and we see tremendous opportunities ahead. But we're still in early stages of executing this area. And as we do that, we'll continue to both enhance our position as the partner of choice to the best boutiques in the world, and drive significant organic growth across our Affiliate group.","With that, let me turn it to Jay.","Jay Horgen","Thank you, Nate. As Sean discussed, our third quarter results reflect continued growth in the earnings power of our business as we ended the quarter with record assets under management of $804 billion. As you saw in the release, we reported economic earnings per share of $3.41 for the third quarter, which included net performance fees of $0.05. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $2.22. Turning to our performance metrics. For the third quarter, aggregate revenue, which, as you know, is the sum of our GAAP revenue and our equity method revenue grew 27% to $1.3 billion from a year ago driven primarily by strong markets and organic growth and alternatives together with a full effect of our 2016 new investments.","The ratio of aggregate revenue to average assets under management increased year-over-year from 60 basis points to 64 basis points, reflecting modestly higher performance fees. Excluding performance fees, we also saw a modest increase in this ratio, as our AUM composition shifted towards a greater contribution from higher fee alternative products.","Adjusted EBITDA grew 17% to $256.3 million from a year ago, reflecting the mix between consolidated equity method Affiliates. Economic net income grew 16% to $191.3 million from a year ago, reflecting strong growth and adjusted EBITDA, partially offset by a higher cash tax rate in the quarter.","Finally, economic earnings per share increased 12%, to $3.41 from a year ago, which includes a modest increase in share count. Turning to more specific modeling items for the third quarter. The ratio of adjusted EBITDA to average assets under management was 13 basis points or 12.7 basis points, excluding performance fees.","In the fourth quarter, we expect this ratio to be between 16 and 18 basis points, reflecting a higher contribution from performance fees in the range of $0.70 to $1.20 per share.","Excluding performance fees, we expect this ratio to be approximately 12.8 basis points in the fourth quarter. With regard to our taxes. Our effective GAAP tax rate was 33.8%, and our cash tax rate was 21.7% in the third quarter.","In the fourth quarter, we expect our GAAP tax rate to increase to approximately 34%, and our cash tax rate to increase to approximately 27%, reflecting a higher level of taxable income driven by performance fees. Intangible-related deferred taxes for the third quarter were $22.9 million. In the fourth quarter, we expect this number to decrease to approximately $20.5 million. Our share reported amortization for the third quarter was $42.2 million, which includes $25.9 million of amortization from Affiliates accounted for under the equity method. For the fourth quarter, we expect our share of amortization to remain at approximately $42 million.","Our share of interest expense for the third quarter was $21.5 million. In the fourth quarter, we expect our share of interest expense to decrease to approximately $19.5 million, which reflects the retirement of our senior bond in August. Other economic items for the third quarter were less than $1 million. For modeling purposes, we expect other economic items to be approximately $1 million per quarter. Our adjusted weighted average share count for the quarter was $56.1 million and we expect it to be approximately $55.9 million for the fourth quarter, reflecting additional share repurchases.","Finally, turning to our balance sheet. In the third quarter, we retired our $200 million senior bond, paid a cash dividend of $0.20 per share and repurchased $74 million in shares. In the fourth quarter, we expect additional share repurchases of approximately $100 million.","With record assets under management of $804 billion, together with the increased earnings power of our business of approximately $1.2 billion in run rate EBITDA, we are well positioned to continue to generate substantial shareholder value through the execution of our growth strategy and the consistent return of capital to shareholders.","Now, we'll be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Craig Siegenthaler","I just wanted to start with the private equity fundraising cycle. How much of the fundraising inflow from private equity was in that $10 billion of alternate flows? And then when we think about the original target, which I think was around $10 billion, how much has already been raised to date?","Nathaniel Dalton","It's Nate here. So just to step back one second. So obviously, we had a strong quarter in the private equity, more illiquid product set and while there's not a ton we can say given the rules about fundraising and stuff about specific funds. But relative to the pipeline, the way to describe it. Yes, as we discussed last quarter, we had several Affiliates with sort of what we would think of as flagship products now and are kind of entering the markets to raise funds and we're beginning, as you indicated, to sort of have closings on those products. But I think it's important - as we've also talked about, those firms are also broadening their product lines and they're also increasingly offering sort of customized separate accounts and, so I think the right way to think about it is while those Affiliates are entering the spirit of significant fundraising, we continue to see the - we continue to see the opportunity to kind of both extend longer but also the sort of pipeline, if you will, sort of broaden and diversifying.","So, while we definitely had - we had sort of a good quarter there. I wouldn't think about it as sort of taking from kind of a defined number because we see - again, as I said, we sort of see that continuing to grow. One of the just kind of detail and we said this also in the prepared remarks, we did have sort of slightly elevated kind of realizations in this past quarter. And so, as that - as you think about the net number, that should moderate a bit as we look forward. So, I feel good about it about anything continuing to - continue to be both a larger number and also continue to extend out into the future.","Craig Siegenthaler","Okay. Just as my follow-up here. Solutions is still a growing theme in this space. And I wanted to get your appetite, if there's any appetite for building a centralized solutions effort for either your institutional Affiliates that could be working with insurance companies or even on the retail side that could work with large retail platforms that really leverage the capability of multiple AMG Affiliates, whether it's across vehicle or are you using SMA or even seed cap outside the U.S.?","Nathaniel Dalton","Sure. Well, I guess I would start by saying what we are doing. And our business is mostly institutional, as you know. And as we described, and have been discussing over the last year or so, we are very pleased with our position with some of the largest, most sophisticated institutional clients and the largest, most important intermediaries, who are looking for a breadth of alpha-oriented - excellent alpha-oriented product, global scale, and as they design and develop their own product allocations. So, they're not looking for solutions, they're looking for excellent products. And I think, in fact, if we were coming with solutions, we might even, in some ways, be competitive with some of those intermediaries. So, we're focused, at most, on building those relationships. And as we've said, we think we're very well positioned given the quality and breadth and scale of our business.","Now are there other areas in the market where there are growth, including especially retail and retail outside the U.S.? Absolutely. And it's on our list, and we have smaller initiatives to develop those capabilities. But I think the very largest opportunity, and one that you hear around the industry as an increasing theme of concentration of manager relationships, is one that, as I said, plays very well to our strength and we're seeing lots of traction and expect that to be even more important and even bigger element of our growth. It's not something that we're going to call out each quarter, but we're having very large mandates that we've won or in the process and that we're looking forward to. And so, we feel terrific about that part of our business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup.","William Katz","Okay. Just sort of - Nate, I was wondering if you could comment. You highlighted that there was some lumpiness on the institutional side, for some of the supplements, separate accounts - or some advice accounts, excuse me and then \"some of the pipelines still continue in the fourth quarter.\" Could you dimension those 2 aspects to sort of get - or maybe throw in the realization number as well so we get a sense of what the underlying organic growth trend looks like?","Nathaniel Dalton","Yes. So, I think, probably, the easiest way to do is by looking by kind of at trends, right? So, I think if you look at the flow pattern this past quarter, as compared to kind of the last, where we're running kind of a couple of billion net positive. If you sort of look at that this quarter relative to that, I'll kind of guide you through the pieces. So, as you said or as we talked about in our prepared remarks, in the alternative set, we had a very good quarter, both institutional and retail, and also did have some elevated realizations.","And then in global, we had both kind of lower growth sales in institutional, although I will say global retail was quite a good quarter, but global institutional, we had those lateral gross sales as things slipped into the fourth quarter. And then we also did have those lumpy realizations that I've talked about. You can kind of normalize those off against each other and get back to kind of that trend plus, as a theme that we've been talking about, which is we continue to have this very strong, kind of illiquid pipeline that should provide this incremental growth opportunity on top of it. So that's the way I would kind of dimension those pieces.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies.","Daniel Fannon","I guess, I want to build on that question a little bit and just thinking ahead to the fourth quarter, which is typically - the last few years, we've seen elevated redemptions. And so, I guess if you could talk about, kind of the dynamics driving some of those redemptions? If you see that kind of persisting into the fourth quarter? Then also, just a little more color on the longer-dated stuff, is that kind of - are we still in the early stages, I guess, of thinking of that building and ramping? Or is it - is what we saw this quarter kind of a steady state of what you think will be ongoing? So just kind of getting a sense of the trajectory.","Nathaniel Dalton","Got it. So, there's a couple of embedded in there. So, I'll make sure and try and get them all. So first, the first answer is no. I don't think any of the kind of lumpy things from this quarter should apply to next quarter and beyond in the kind of fourth quarter seasonality that you talked about. There is fourth quarter - to be clear, there is fourth quarter seasonality both in the retail channel as both 401(k)s are maxed and also you have capital gains and dividends distributions and people are sort of selling for tax losses, all kinds of stuff. So, there is that. And also in the institutional work kind of space, there's this timing disconnect where you have - especially people with annual product, redemptions coming out maybe before the new subscriptions are coming in the first quarter. So, there is that kind of seasonality. All of that is taken into account in the optimism that you hear from us.","So, the short answers are no, none of the lumpy thing. The outflow should have nothing to do with the fourth quarter. There is that seasonality, but that's all embedded - understanding that is all embedded in the optimism that you hear from us for the fourth quarter and beyond. Now on the illiquid pipeline, I would say we're still in the early stages of it. If you think of it, in that kind of cyclical way, right? So, I think we are entering it. We are beginning to have sort of interim closings, and we're beginning to have flagship products with closings and separate account wins and all that kind of stuff starting to happen.","But sort of to reiterate a point I've made before, we're seeing that pipeline continue to expand, both by products because of product development and a number of these firms and also continue to extend out as both these newer products are going to enter fundraising cycles. But also, as large separate accounts become a bigger part of the asset base of these firms as they evolve. Now there's going to be a bunch of lumpiness to that as these large mandates - as Sean alluded to, these large mandates come but now, we still think we're in the early stages and we continue to see the opportunity being - if anything, growing both in magnitude and duration.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler with William Blair.","Christopher Shutler","On the global equity redemptions, could you just dive into those a little bit more with strategies or what types of strategies and where are they performance-related in your view?","Nathaniel Dalton","Yes. So, it was across a couple of different strategies. Look, you never know exactly the reasons, right? And even when people will tell you, it's not always clear they are exactly right. But I think in the main, this is coming through portfolio-positioning decisions made by very large institutional clients. Again, they were definitely idiosyncratic and kind of lumpy. So, I think that's sort of...","Sean Healey","Yes. And I think a little bit just listening to the tone of the question or maybe our response is, part of having a big, diverse product set and overall business is that even in periods where we were surprised by - because we have very large mandates that are won and just got pushed into this quarter in global equities. And so, it was a quarter that, to us, seems anomalously or misleadingly low in terms of the global equity contribution. And yet, we - the strength of our alternatives franchise, including, especially the liquids, as Nate is describing, allows us to have a good flow quarter with - these are good, strong - obviously, high-fee products in the alternatives category.","And so, if you look forward, we have every reason to be quite optimistic about the overall trends and global equities, normalizing or even improving, honestly, given the strong performance among a number of our largest Affiliates. And then continuing, which is now really, the biggest piece of our business. This very strong contribution across a range of alternative products. So that's really underlying the overall optimism that we feel.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.","Brian Bedell","Just to go back to the flow picture a little bit. I guess, as we look at the trends and how they're sort of differing from what your normal sort of [indiscernible] announced are on across the product categories. And is it fair to say, it looks like the fundraising could have been a good $5 billion or $6 billion this quarter in illiquids. And again, I'm just comparing 2Q versus 3Q, and then the size of the lumpy outflows. Again, we've had a $2 billion greater differential in redemptions in the global equity category. And then, I guess, if you can also - I appreciate that you can't really discuss fundraising while the funds are in process. I understand that. But if there's a way you can just disclose that after the fact, so we can get an understanding of that - of the importance of fundraising to your net flows?","Nathaniel Dalton","Perfect. So, I think you're thinking about it roughly correctly. The only - if I understood it exactly right, the only modification I would make is, on the alternatives flows side, there's also very good traction - trajectory on the liquid alts side of our business as well. But for that, kind of component piece, I think you're thinking about it well. And then, obviously, we're certainly happy to look at what we can, with what we can disclose on the fundraisers as we go.","Sean Healey","But again, emphasizing that it's partly, of course, flagship funds having closes, but it's also increasingly separate accounts and funds of won and other kinds of mandates that won't necessarily show up as a close. And that's why you're hearing us talk about this as more than just sort of the finite $10 billion, it's something that, as we look out over the next year, 1.5 years, we see ongoing momentum.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW.","Robert Lee","Maybe going back to flows. I mean, understanding that you're not very optimistic on flows to higher fee alternatives, global strategies, but I guess, maybe looking at it at different dimension, I guess, it's really kind of the EBITDA contribution that matters the most to you guys. Could you give us a sense of - if we look at the flows this quarter, and if we look at the figure you're expecting, kind of what was the EBITDA contribution to flows? But maybe more importantly, is there any reason that we should think that the flow mix, given the Affiliate mix and whatnot that, that contribution per asset could be trending up maybe just given the mix of Affiliates? Or should we expect it to be relatively constant going forward? Just trying to get a sense of if there's kind of some leverage in those flows to that contribution to you.","Jay Horgen","It's Jay, Rob. So, let me see if I can take that and then maybe Nate, if I miss anything, will add. Look, I think in general, as we add alternative product in a particular illiquid product, you get the benefits of base fee, performance fee and in some cases, long-duration. So, we do find that product - those product categories to be particularly attractive and additive to EBITDA contribution over a long period of time and even in quarters like this one. This quarter obviously, we've had tried a bit of asset appreciation. So clearly, our run rate EBITDA going forward is noticeably higher than it was last quarter and that includes not only from the flows, but also market changes and FX. So, I think that is a pretty - at least at this point, pretty strong tailwind that we've got going for us. But I want to reiterate the performance fee and the duration component of these types of fundraisers.","Sean Healey","Yes. And I think you, of course, understand this. But relative to the public PE firms, which talk about flows and performance fees as if they're just like ours, those performance fees that they're anticipating, or recording are mark-to-market. For us, we have a different accounting method, method 1, which only takes performance fees and the contribution from performance fees in - as they're realizing cash. And so, it doesn't mean these flows are any less valuable. And especially as we sort of build a book, and have contribution that will be consistent over time, it's quite valuable. But it will not show up necessarily as quickly or in the same way as it would for some of the other public companies. Nate, you want to add anything to - yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.","Alexander Blostein","Shifting gears a little bit. I want to hit on just the investment spend backdrop for your Affiliates. So, over the last couple of quarters, most of your large peers in the space have been highlighting rising investment needs really across the business to kind of sustain flows or get better flows. Can you guys spend a minute on where your Affiliates are spending today? And I guess, more importantly, how this may impact AMG's overall kind of earnings, right, since obviously with the revenue share, I don't think there's a ton that will flow through. But I guess, kind of how do you balance making sure that, a, they continue to invest at the same time that they are the ones kind of bearing the cost of it?","Sean Healey","What don't I start with a kind of high level set of observations about what we're doing at the AMG level. And Nate, you can fill in with Affiliates. Of course, we've seen a lot of this conversation around investments and people talk about \"Technology\" And assigned a large number to it. And it means different things to different people. I think a lot of it is around investing in processing and manufacturing capabilities for passive products. That's just not a business we're in. A lot of it is back office and off-shoring and other things. I - that is less a function of our business and not something that we worry anywhere near as much about.","Obviously, we run the business efficiently. Jay can elaborate on that. Sometimes \"Technology\" spend is around retail distribution initiatives and robo-advisers and that sort of thing. Nothing against the robo-advisers but it's just - it's really not nearly as meaningful part of our business given our global institutional focus. And we have invested, continue to invest, in a very meaningful way. And are getting traction and I'll put our active equity and alternative flows against anybody's in the industry. And on a - sort of rolling basis and certainly, looking forward. So, it's not that we're not investing, but we're not doing it from a position of feeling defensive. I think we feel like we're in a very good position and we're building and investing to generate incremental positive flows through extending what our Affiliates are already doing on their own. Do you want to add to that, Nate?","Nathaniel Dalton","No. The only thing I would add, this relates back also to some of the distribution strategy question that was asked earlier, right? I think if you think about the spend - if you think about our Affiliates business, especially our largest Affiliate, these are leaders in their investment disciplines and they're generally in the business of producing that return stream, right? And so, there's a set of investment spending necessary to produce that return stream. For some of them, absolutely that means incremental investing as they compete but that's part of the business. Again, as Sean said, it's part of the business that these firms are inhabiting if you think about a firm like an AQR or Winton or a Systematica or a BlueMountain or a Capula.","These kind of firms absolutely have that as part of their competitive advantage really, and have as part of - as they build our firm, right? So that is certainly ongoing and as Sean said, we feel good about that and these are absolutely leading firms and that's an offensive capability in a lot of ways. And then there's the relative to - what the go-to-market strategies are for these firms and for us more broadly and these all do relate, right? We are very - I think, were being very thoughtful about how we make the investment spend relative to the opportunity focused on the return and the margin of the opportunity and so this relates in part to the questions about packaging and distribution of what market segments or what geographies we were going after. So, while there are investment spends that we're making, there I think very modest relative to the opportunities that we're seeing.","Sean Healey","Yes. And I would add one more point. I think we do not accept the idea that somehow massive incremental spend on, let's say, technology, is the answer and the only way for forward-alpha generation in active products. In other words, I could - we believe, and the evidence bears this out and the ongoing interest that clients and intermediaries are showing in the best boutique firms. And just simple common sense is that scale is the enemy of alpha generation, generally. And in our approach, which is a set of focus performance-oriented boutiques addresses, we think very effectively, that issue.","And so the idea that a business that is perhaps challenged because of an integrated setting, with very large scale is just harder to generate alpha, that it somehow, magically, spending more money or doing something different, is going to create superior alpha generation when it's not currently seen is - I mean, maybe that will happen, but I think for us, we're betting on the - as Nate said, the individual focused efforts of our group of Affiliates, some of whom are the absolute leaders in the world in developing advanced quantitative techniques.","In fact, if you said, \"Who is the best - which public company is the best positioned in terms of having the proportionate exposure to the very best quantitative systematic managers who are at the cutting edge of applying - they'll tease me about this, but in other words, like machine learning and artificial intelligence\", it's us. AMG, through AQR, First Quadrant, Wenton, Systematica and a number of other firms. But those are some of the absolute leaders in the industry. So, we feel like, collectively, we're absolutely making the investments we should do and should make to sustain this alpha generation.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America.","Michael Carrier","Sean, just shifting over to the M&A environment and the backdrop. Just wanted to get an update. It's been a little bit of time since you guys have done a deal. So just what you're seeing out there, in terms of both the opportunities but also valuations? And then Jay, maybe on that front. When we look at the EBITDA level now, what you guys have done in terms of paying down some of the debt, just remind us in terms of maybe the capacity or how much potential opportunity you have if you do see some attractive transactions and if the economics have changed at all. I know in the past, you used to say, like $100 million would get you so many [indiscernible] and ENI or adjusted net income. So, any update there?","Sean Healey","Sure. Well, as I said, we are busy. We are working on a number of transactions. But as you know, we do our best to avoid auctions. We are always - but I would say, especially when markets are at all-time highs, we are highly selective and highly disciplined. And then in terms of the supply of outstanding boutique firms who are looking to pursue a succession planning transaction, I can say that in the current environment, given the ongoing uncertainty, geopolitical, regulatory tax, I think is probably playing a factor at this point. There's just excellent discussions, and we see this because our strategy, of course, is to go out and build and maintain relationships with the best boutique firms in the world, and not to wait until the banker send us a book.","So, are there bankers sending books? Yes, a few, but not as much as one might expect given the markets. But we're absolutely - I'm very pleased with the relationships that we're maintaining and building, and that's the forward pipeline. And inevitably, if you're working on one-on-one negotiated transactions, where the dynamics of the individual partners and their own circumstances are at play, and couple that with an uncertain world, that's why these transactions take longer. So tremendous long-term secular opportunity that exists in this, I would say, is strong as ever, may be stronger, given our relative position. In the short to medium term, we're working on transactions.","We feel good about the forward contribution. But we're not ever going to feel any pressure to reach and pay more than we think is appropriate for an investment or to lower our standard and just so that we can announce a deal once a quarter or whatever. And happily, and I'll turn it to Jay, our business allows for us to repurchase stock or pay down debt and generate earnings contribution that way, which, to us, given the strength and scale of our overall business and the organic growth, will - that feels like a very good investment.","Jay Horgen","Yes, and then on the balance sheet. I'm glad you noted it. I think we've positioned the balance sheet, really in the last 12 months, to maintain a lot of flexibility, and we built capacity. We've opportunistically repurchased high-priced debt for us, and so that was accretive to us. As you look forward, as Sean said, our - we're making progress on a new investment pipeline. And even if we announced the transaction in the fourth quarter, it wouldn't close until the first quarter likely. So, we will see additional capacity built. And then we look at it on a full year basis, we can certainly execute just with the current cash flow of our business over $1 billion worth of transactions, together with a capacity that we've built with a leverage ratio that's going to fall below 1.7x here this quarter. I think we have an additional, call it, $0.5 billion more of just leverage capacity.","So, we really have maximum capacity at this point to execute on a wide range of transactions, number of transaction size of transactions, et cetera. In the meantime, we will continue to consistently repurchase shares, which obviously is accretive. And as I've mentioned in my prepared remarks, we expect to do $100 million in this quarter. So, we are in a place where our scale allows us to not only do new investments in scale but also repurchase and scale and also build capacity through delevering.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research.","Patrick Davitt","And I think the market have kind of come to the conclusion that the treasury white papers is pretty innocuous. But I would be curious to get your thoughts on anything in there that you think is particularly good or bad for your business, specifically?","Sean Healey","I think we've learned in the current environment to not spend too much time on the interim updates around pending legislation because it all seems to change dramatically, if indeed it even gets enacted. So, what would I say, and I'll ask my colleagues to join, I would say nothing that we've seen is at all problematic. I think, yes, I think tax reform, which, depending on how you describe it, might just mean lower corporate taxes. Would, of course, be a good thing for us, and we have, and Jay can, again, quantify what the magnitude of that would be. I won't speculate on what it would do to financial markets, and I think we'll wait until we see something actually happened or get close to being enacted to spend, frankly, a lot of time worrying about it. I - maybe that's too pessimistic, but that's been...","Jay Horgen","Yes. I mean, I did take a look at that, Patrick. And I think, it looked - it appears to us to have more of an impact in other industries within financial services as opposed to specifically asset management or AMG. I think Sean's right, in general, we're mindful of all these regulation and white papers and change. But so far, most of them, except for the tax reform, has kind of a second order, or even a third order impact on us, which will give us time to react if we needed to. At this point, does not seem to have a material financial impact to us, other than potential tax reform, which could be significantly positive.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Robert Lee with KBW.","Robert Lee","I'm just curious. When you look outside the U.S., I mean, obviously, you guys have invested in over the years and talked a lot about kind of the - your institutional business outside the U.S. But could you maybe update us on your thoughts around building or expanding some of your, kind of, [indiscernible] retail markets outside the U.S. [indiscernible] or whoever may be? And maybe some of the - if you are, some of the investments or initiatives you have either way there?","Sean Healey","The answer is, at a high level, yes, absolutely. I mean it's an area of growth. There's a need to, I think, over time, and it varies by market. But over time, we need to be able to take a very strong institutional level distribution marketing capability, and take it a level down. Not may be to pure retail, but to have the retail product vehicles available. And so, we've done a bit in building the capabilities in Europe. But there's a lot more that we want to do. I think we're going to be careful to not - because business is good, and we see very strong ongoing organic growth doing what we're doing.","And so, like responding to an earlier question about whether we're making investments offensively, where we see even better opportunities, or defensively because somehow, we think there are franchises, is going to be imperiled, it's very much the former. But it doesn't mean that it's not high on our list. And exactly how we pursue building out that capability is, is it going to depend on the circumstances and it could involve a different kind of transaction, it could involve a market-by-market approach? I can't really be more specific at this point. But Nate, maybe you can provide a little more color on that?","Nathaniel Dalton","The only thing I would add, and I agree with what Sean just said. We are doing it in some of our Affiliates and we, on behalf of our Affiliates, have been building some packaging capabilities. Some of that is to execute against specific geographies. But then the other team I would bring into this is we have been - as you've heard us talk about, we've been working increasingly with largest global sophisticated clients and their intermediaries to serve them. That includes sort of global intermediaries to more retail parts of the market. And so, one of the things we have been working on in those conversations with them is making sure that we have the ability, as we provide product to them, working across their entire platforms, right? And so that actually leads us into needing to build some taxing capability alongside the revenue opportunity with those - again, sort of large, global intermediaries. So that's the place, specifically, where we have been doing some additional work.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have come to the end of our time allowed for questions. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Healey for any final remarks.","Sean Healey","Thank you again for joining us this morning. We're pleased with our results for the quarter and confident in our ability to continue to create shareholder value through the organic growth of our existing Affiliates, accretive investments and new affiliates and consistent capital return to shareholders.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Ms. Anjali Aggarwal, Vice President, Investor Relations for AMG. Thank you. You may begin.","Anjali Aggarwal","Thank you for joining AMG to discuss our results for the second quarter of 2019.","In this conference call, certain matters discussed will constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected due to a number of factors, including but not limited to, those referenced in the company's Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time-to-time. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.","AMG will provide on the Investor Relations section of its website at ir.amg.com, a replay of the call, a copy of the announcement of our results for the quarter, and a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures that are not announced on this call to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.","As a reminder, we have also included an updated investor presentation on this section of our website. AMG encourages investors to consult the Investor Relations section of its website regularly for updated information.","With us on the line to discuss the company's results for the quarter are Jay Horgen, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Wojcik, Chief Financial Officer.","With that, I will turn the call over to Jay.","Jay Horgen","Thanks, Anjali, and good morning everyone.","It's good to be with you on my first quarterly earnings call as CEO of AMG and I would like to welcome Tom in his new role as CFO. We, along with the rest of the management team, look forward to executing on AMG's long-term strategy leveraging the significant competitive advantages that we've established over our 25-year history to generate long-term sustainable growth and create shareholder value.","AMG reported economic earnings per share of $3.33 for the second quarter. Outflows of $15 billion were elevated driven primarily by quantitative strategies across liquid alternatives and global equity and will likely remain at similar levels in the near-term given ongoing performance headwinds in these areas.","As Tom will discuss in further detail, it's important to note that these outflows had a disproportionate impact on our headline organic growth profile relative to their impact on earnings.","More broadly, we are seeing positive momentum across our Affiliate Group in multiple product areas. Industry growth in global private equity infrastructure and real assets is benefiting our illiquid strategies at affiliates such as EIG, Pantheon, and Baring Asia, as well as fixed income strategies across traditional and relative value alternative products at affiliates such as GW&K, Capula, and with the closing of our investment in Garda, we're increasing our exposure to these in-demand fixed income alternatives.","In addition, our Affiliate Group includes some of the industry-leading global and emerging market equity managers such as Harding Loevner, Tweedy Browne, Genesis, and Veritas, and given their excellent long-term performance track record, we are well-positioned for future growth in this category.","At the highest level AMG's boutique focused model is positioned to capitalize on key industry trends including the recognition by clients that Alpha generation is driven by skill not scale and that the essential characteristics of independent firms results in inherent advantages in generating Alpha relative to large scale manufacturing.","These fundamental characteristics include boutiques entrepreneurial investment centric cultures, specialized focus, and direct management ownership which together foster a long-term orientation and an alignment of interest. And as AMG's Research has apparently demonstrated, boutique managers have outperformed both indices and non-boutiques over time especially in volatile market.","We have deep expertise in identifying and selecting high quality boutique investment firms and structuring permanent partnerships that align the interests of our clients, our affiliate partners, and our shareholders.","In addition, AMG offers a single point of access to these industry-leading boutique capabilities at scale, while preserving our unique investment cultures which are critical to individual affiliates success.","And finally, we have extensive industry relationships that we can leverage to enhance the growth of our affiliates and our business.","With these competitive strengths, in combination with the execution of our strategy, AMG has unique agility in evolving and enhancing our exposure to a number of the fastest growing areas in the asset management industry through both collaborating with existing affiliates and partnering with new affiliates. Over the years, AMG has worked closely with our affiliates as they evolve their investment and product capabilities to pursue growth initiatives to meet client demand trend. Through this collaboration we have encouraged our affiliates to innovate in ways that further enhance their growth facility and global client reach.","For example, we have helped affiliates to successfully launch new business lines to expand into new asset classes and channels, leveraging our capital and distribution resources to establish and market new products.","We have also assisted affiliates in sourcing and executing list out acquisitions and new business development opportunities, including most recently combined trilogy emerging market teams at GW&K last year and today these products are winning new mandate.","One of the most significant examples of our ability to leverage AMG's talent resources of scale to support growth of our affiliates is the successful execution of our global distribution strategy built over the past 15 years. Through the strong relationship and dialogues we have developed with asset owners and intermediaries around the world, we continue to evolve our global distribution platform to meet changing buyer preferences and objectives.","As we discussed last quarter, AMG is making progress in building strategic relationships with key financial institutions, distributors, and solution providers globally to enable our affiliates to gain access to high quality scale distribution particularly in regional wholesale channels where we believe partnerships are the optimal way to extend our reach and scale.","Turning to new investments. Earlier this month, we closed on our investment in Garda Capital Partners a premier relative value fixed income specialists adding to our organic growth profile in this in-demand product category and further enhancing the earnings power of our business. We are building momentum in our new investment activities and are actively evaluating a broad range of prospective affiliates.","Our transaction pipeline includes a diverse range of high quality growing independent firms that are well aligned with our partnership criteria.","AMG's model continues to be highly attractive to our target prospect universe. Independent firms inevitably need to address succession planning. And those firms seeking a solution that preserves and protects their entrepreneurial cultures amongst successive generations of management are drawn to AMG's partnership approach.","In executing new investments, we are not only adding excellent talent but also in-demand and immediately saleable products that will drive growth, sustain our competitive positioning in an evolving industry. And our ability to evolve and scale our business without the risk or cost of integration is another distinctive competitive advantage.","Traditional acquisitions and recent mergers in the asset management industry are often driven by cost synergies and many have resulted in prolonged periods of lower organic growth giving client and business disruption.","Through the successful execution of our new investment strategy, AMG is well-positioned to simultaneously grow our earnings while enhancing long-term growth profile of our business.","Through our revenue share model which minimizes operating leverage and the scale and diversity of our global franchise, we generate significant and stable free cash flow and together with modest leverage, we have substantial capacity and flexibility to execute on our growth initiatives. We will remain disciplined in deploying capital and selective in partnering with the highest quality firms in our industry. We will also continue to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases as we demonstrated this quarter and over the last three years resulting in a significant reduction in our share count.","Stepping back, having just returned from our annual strategic board offsite as our leadership team transitions to the next-generation, we are bringing together the history and experience of operating AMG's successful partnership model and a focus and energy of a new generation of management. This change has reignited the entrepreneurial culture and partnership orientation that has always defined AMG and I'm optimistic as ever about our ability to capitalize on key industry trends through excellent execution of our vision.","Our strategy is to generate long-term value by investing as leading independent Active Investment Manager through a proven partnership approach and allocate resources across AMG's unique opportunity set to the areas of highest growth and return.","And as the role of boutiques in generating Alpha and delivering superior client outcomes become even more differentiated, we believe that our strategy is as important as ever in aligning the interests of clients, affiliates, AMG, and our shareholders.","As we position our business for growth, we will evolve and shape our resources to align with our strategy and focus our organization on the most significant growth opportunities before us.","AMG's model is truly unique. We've build a diverse business which includes long-term partnerships with many of the most highly regarded independent firms in the world with established track records of outperformance across a wide array of investment strategies and in a number of the fastest growing segments of the industry.","Given our reputation as the partner of choice to excellent firms, expertise of making new investments, we're able to simultaneously grow our earnings and enhance our organic growth profile, while also consistently returning capital to our shareholders.","And with that, I'll turn over to Tom to review the details of the quarter.","Tom Wojcik","Thanks, Jay, and good morning everyone.","I'm both humbled and excited to have joined AMG and look forward to working with our leadership team to execute on our growth strategy in the years to come.","Net client cash outflows of $15.1 billion were concentrated in quantitative strategies across liquid alternatives and global equity. And as Jay said, we expect that this level of net outflows will likely continue at a similar pace as performance challenges in these areas are addressed.","Turning to flows by asset class. In our Alternative segment which accounts for 37% of our AUM, we reported net outflows of $7.4 billion driven by liquid alternative strategy and partially offset by positive contributions from illiquid products. While long-term investment performance and liquid alternatives remain strong with 66% of assets under management outperforming benchmarks over a five-year period, our recent performance in this area has been challenged, as value factor strategies have underperformed broader markets at an historic level resulting in sustained pressure on net flows.","At the same time, several affiliates are generating strong results within the liquid alternatives area including momentum in Capula's fixed income relative value strategy. And we look forward to additional momentum in this category from Garda in the coming quarters.","We also continue to see a steadily growing opportunity in illiquid, as our affiliates build on existing and new product capabilities with ongoing fundraising at EIG, Pantheon, and Baring Asia in the quarter. AMG's performance in this category is very strong with 94% of our recent vintages outperforming industry benchmarks on an IRR base. We are also beginning to realize the benefits of outperformance by way of carry realization as we did this quarter and expect this to be an additional driver of earnings growth over the long-term.","Now turning to global equities, which account for 35% of our AUM. While we saw net outflows of $6 billion in the quarter primarily in quantitative strategies, new mandate wins in fundamental global and emerging market strategies were positive contributor. Our affiliates continue to generate strong long-term performance in global equities particularly in fundamental strategies with 62% of our AUM ahead of benchmark over a five-year period.","In U.S. equities which accounts for 14% of our AUM, we reported net outflows of $2.3 billion driven by institutional redemptions and partially offset by retail inflows. While we saw some improvement in the quarter, U.S. equities performance continues to be affected by our overall value buy, with 39% of our strategies outperforming benchmark on a five-year basis.","Turning to multi-asset and fixed income which accounts for 14% of our AUM. Here we posted $600 million in net inflows primarily driven by GW&K's municipal bond products and supported by AQR's systematic fixed income products which continue to generate good flow momentum.","With respect to overall net client cash flows, as Jay mentioned, it is important to understand the difference between flows and their impact on our financial results. A large equity method affiliate had an outsized impact on our headline flows during the quarter, while this affiliate represents approximately 25% of AMG's AUM, the business contributed less than 10% of our EBITDA this quarter.","Now turning to our financials. As you saw in the release, quarterly economic earnings per share decreased by 8% year-over-year to $3.33 including $0.22 of net performance fees driven by illiquid alternative carries that we initially anticipated would be realized in the fourth quarter.","For the second quarter, aggregate fees declined 9% to $1.2 billion driven primarily by lower average AUM.","Adjusted EBITDA declined 11% to $219.3 million driven primarily by lower aggregate fees as well as lower contributions from certain of our equity method affiliates where we share in margin. Relative to adjusted EBITDA, the year-over-year decline in economic earnings per share of 8% reflects a lower share count partially offset by higher cash taxes.","Now turning to specific modeling items. For the second quarter, the ratio of adjusted EBITDA to average assets under management was 11.3 basis points supported by higher performance fees. Excluding performance fees, this ratio was 10.5 basis points. In the third quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA to average assets under management to be approximately 10.6 basis points reflecting seasonally lower performance fees and the addition of Garda.","With respect to performance fees, we booked $0.39 through the first half of 2019 and we expect performance fees in the second half of the year to be between $0.25 and $0.75 reflecting the pull-forward of illiquid fees into our Q2 reported number and $0.01 to $0.03 of estimated performance fees in the third quarter. Over time given the diversity of our product set, performance fees remain a significant earnings growth and cash flow generation opportunity for AMG.","Our share of interest expense was $19.7 million for the second quarter reflecting higher interest on junior subordinated notes issued in the first quarter of 2019. In the third quarter, we expect our share of interest expense to remain roughly flat at approximately $20 million.","Our share of reported amortization was $55 million for the second quarter including $39 million from affiliates accounted for under the equity method. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect our share of reported amortization to be approximately $56 million.","Our effective GAAP tax rate was 23.7% and our cash tax rate was 19% for the second quarter. For modeling purposes, we expect our GAAP and cash tax rate to be approximately 25% and 19% respectively.","Intangible related deferred taxes were $6.6 million in the second quarter and we expect intangible related deferred taxes for the third quarter to be approximately $7 million.","Other economics were $0.5 million for the second quarter and we expect other economic items to be approximately $1 million for the third quarter.","Our adjusted weighted average share count for the second quarter was $51 million and we expect share count to be approximately $50.3 million for the third quarter.","And finally, turning to our balance sheet. Our business model generates significant free cash flow particularly relative to our current market cap and we will continue to allocate capital to the areas of highest growth and return in our business.","During the second quarter, we paid $0.32 per share dividend and repurchased $50.1 million in shares reflecting a more modest level of repurchases given the closing of our investment in Garda in early July. We anticipate repurchasing approximately $200 million in shares over the second half of the year depending upon market conditions and the level of new investment activity over that timeframe. We continue to maintain a prudent level of leverage and have repositioned our balance sheet over the last several quarters, extending duration, while maintaining flexibility and capacity to capitalize on growth opportunities even in challenging market.","Given AMG's combination of distinct independent affiliates that are well aligned against future client demand trends, our unique ability to make new investments that deliver both earnings and organic growth accretion, our stable cash flow profile, and our flexible balance sheet, we are well-positioned to create long-term value for shareholders.","Now, I would be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions].","Our first question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Lee","Great. Thanks. Good morning, thanks for taking my question. I guess maybe just kind of Tom; I think you kind of suggested that carry maybe impacted the quarter. Did that show up in the consolidated revenue line because that really seems to be a lot higher than I think any of us were expecting?","Tom Wojcik","Thanks for the question, Rob. Yes. So performance fees did have an impact on the quarter. And in this case the preponderance did come from one of our consolidated affiliates. Just to reiterate a little bit of color through the first half of the year, we've now booked $0.39 and we've guided in the second half of the year from $0.25 to $0.75. So some of what we saw this quarter was really a pull-forward of illiquid carry that we thought was likely to hit in the fourth quarter and ended up impacting us in the current quarter.","I think longer-term just to give you some color, obviously we've seen pretty good fundraising across our illiquid book over the course of the past several quarters and we expect that to continue over time. So we're continuing to build a book of illiquid performance fees that we think will be positive earnings contributors over the course of the next several years.","Jay Horgen","And Rob I'll just follow up one point here. So we, as Tom mentioned, we have great diversity in our performance fee opportunity and we've seen that express itself over the years. The illiquid fundraising that we've done in the past two years, three years is starting to come into our earnings, as Tom mentioned. And we've talked about seasonality in our performance fee opportunity historically has been really a fourth quarter -- the significant portion coming in the fourth quarter. And then with our affiliates that are reported on a lag some performance fees in the first quarter.","With this new opportunity or this growing opportunity in illiquids, we are going to see more performance fees come through less seasonality in our business more in the quarters in which we express the carry. And so that that happened this quarter and I think we'll see that in the future years.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Craig Siegenthaler","Thanks. Good morning everyone. I want to see if you had any color on how your EBITDA adjusted net flows or organic growth rate looked in the quarter just given that most of the outflows were from an affiliate that contributed less than 10% of EBITDA this quarter?","Jay Horgen","Yes, thanks Craig. This is Jay. We, as Tom mentioned, this in his prepared remarks, we did have a disproportionate contribution of these quantitative liquid and global equity products on our organic headline number relative to the more modest contribution to our earnings. And you can see that just in the earnings themselves both the EBITDA and the earnings, we reported were solid, and yet our flows were elevated. So the contribution of these flows were much lower on that basis and noting the contribution of one large equity method affiliate which is AQR that equity method affiliate is now lower than 10% of our contribution to our EBITDA. ","The 10.5 basis points, as we know, is a model convention that -- 10.6 that we're guiding to and the 10.5 that we experienced. We will see that ratio move up we think over time. And at this point that we are in, we've experienced most of the decline in that ratio.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Alex Blostein","Thanks. Hey Jay, Tom good morning. Just maybe building on this last point, can you guys update us where AQR and BlueMountain stand with respect to their cost reduction initiatives and maybe how much of the EBITDA drag in the current quarter is still coming from the fact that I think BlueMountain is net negative from an EBITDA perspective. And I guess just bigger picture do you guys envision any other affiliates either current or perspective that are pushing towards more profit share structure versus AMG's typical revenue share? Thanks.","Jay Horgen","Yes, thanks Alex. So just I'll take the first one being BlueMountain. On BlueMountain a couple of things to note here. We continue to work with BlueMountain in repositioning the business towards profitability. We see that being resolved by the -- by year-end, any financial impact is in the numbers. It was modest this quarter a couple million dollars and so we're already moving in that direction and we do see that we're on track to resolve the profitability by year-end. So that's on path and in a good place.","Maybe taking your AQR question and just stepping back for a moment on AQR. So the business is in a very strong position. It's a very large diversified business, as you know, nearly $200 billion in AUM across several distinct business lines including traditional equities, fixed income, absolute return, and total return alternative. We strongly believe in AMG's -- AQR's ability to generate long-term investment return. These are important products or portfolios, and given their proven investment process and culture and the strength of their leadership team and their multi decade track record of outperformance, we do see that business having long-term positive trends. There's also great optionality in this business Cliff and the management team are focused, they're fully aligned as majority equity holders in the firm and they've been through difficult times before emerging each time as a stronger organization, the very entrepreneurial firm, lots of new products, and lots of new businesses that can scale dramatically.","Today, we see AQR running their businesses at scale and they have the ability to run on at industry margin. And certain areas that we're seeing them invest for future growth and we're very supportive of that growth taking margin down temporarily in the short-term for the benefit of the long-term and we see that that's a repeatable business decision that they've made over the years.","As you know, we made this investment when the business was only $12 billion in AUM. They've grown and diversified over all these years in building out new business lines. Today, they have a number of opportunities in their business.","First, a number of the products are high performing and they including for example risk parity, defensive equity, fixed income. They're also investing in a number of growth areas including ESG and tax managed strategies. So longer-term we do see margins returning, we see growth returning at AQR. And so we're very bullish on this business and I'll just repeat that we see great optionality in the business.","Away from these two, the 90% of our EBITDA is covered by revenue share. So as we said really it's just these two that we have margin exposure. One is going to resolve itself by year-end. The others got tremendous upside in margin from here. Thanks for your question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Bill Katz","Okay. Thank you very much for taking the question this morning. So a two-part question sorry but a bit unrelated, so wondering if you might be able to help quantify or ring fence the areas of risk that you see in terms of the liquid and the global equities and what might be the size of risk assessment risks you make. And then, Jay, just basing your comments around sort of what I perceive as cautionary comments around sort of integration by transactions. Does that suggest that you're more in an affiliate bolt-on type of opportunity or is there an opportunity here to consolidate some of the other holding company structures?","Jay Horgen","Those are two different questions. But let me start to provide bit more color on the flows. And look it's always hard to predict flows in general. And as we've said in our prepared remarks, we do see elevated outflows at similar levels in the near term in quantitative liquid also in global equity products. Longer-term, we see these products improve and clients do need these in their portfolios. So the secular trends are still in place.","We have a broad array of liquid alts and global equity products. Our outflows were localized in certain products. But I will just note that in the second quarter these products did account for nearly all of our outflows. And so just noting that was masking some of the positive momentum that we have in our business in other areas, illiquid equity, traditional and alternative fixed income strategies including Garda which we just recently closed, fundamental global equities including emerging markets. And even in U.S. equities we're seeing a number of our managers being recognized for their value orientation as investors are increasingly looking for defensive equities.","So all nearly 100% of our flows were in were localized in a few product areas. And it -- it really was not the broad array of our quantitative and quantitative liquid alts and global equity products.","As you know we have a number of affiliates including AQR but also Systematica, First Quadrant, and Winton, all have these products. And with the exception of the CTA momentum driven products which are still suffering from some headwinds although the product performance has gotten better generally speaking product performance across those affiliates is improving frankly in the quarter and even in this quarter that we're in has gotten a lot better. So we do see performance returning. And this is a localized set of products.","To your question on M&A, since you asked two questions. I will maybe take the opportunity to discuss our pipeline and industry consolidation trends. Stepping back for a moment, our strategy of partnering with excellent firms has and of course always will be the cornerstone of our growth initiative as it relates to moving towards client secular trends as well as adding incremental earnings without the risk or cost of integration.","And Bill, as you know, I started my career in M&A joined AMG over 12 years ago to oversee our new investments function, being responsible for a number of our largest affiliates. Today as CEO I'm looking forward to spending even more of my time calling on prospective affiliates and building relationships with great firms around the world. And we hope over the coming years to really increase the capital allocated to our new investment strategy and our growth strategy. I've already been spending a meaningful amount of my time in this area and we're not only going to -- we're going to broaden our relationships and use the whole management team towards this effort.","And as I've said in my prepared remarks, we're building momentum in our new investment activities. We're actively evaluating a broad range of opportunities. When you look at the current pipeline, we have a good mix of alternative both liquid and illiquid as well as long-only fundamental managers primarily in EM and global equities.","The market is large for boutique and investment management. And so we do see our solution being appropriate for and attractive to large number of managers and so we do expect that the demand is there for our solution.","Specifically to your point about industry consolidation, there is and has been and really will always be M&A activity that's focused on consolidation. But consolidation to reduce costs can be efficient for some firms particularly in areas such as distribution. However you have to be careful particularly in active management because there is one area that can't be consolidated and that's investment performance. Scale is your enemy not your friend there. So while there is of course economies of scale in our business and we do offer that to our boutique managers it's primarily is in the areas of distribution and other areas not in investment performance.","And then, lastly, you you've talked about our ability to execute on larger transactions. And I think we've always said that it's important to note that we have a unique model. We believe in our partnership model as it relates to Succession Planning to the extent that we were to look at larger transactions that come with multiple affiliates, I think they would have to be both at the level and quality and standard of our process that we use on the new investment side. And they would have to have a -- we'd have to have a view on how we would get them into our ultimately our succession planning model. If those things were they fill in place of course we would consider other larger firms but that bar is high. And obviously those transactions are difficult to execute.","I think when we look forward at our growth opportunity; we see plenty of opportunity in the bread and butter of AMG which is to do high quality boutique investment management firms and active management. And that's what we're going to do.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Shutler","Hi guys, good morning. So on the pipeline, Jay, you talked about building momentum in the pipeline. Just give us a better sense of what that means relative to maybe six or 12 months ago, how you felt and I know these things happen on their own timetables but what do you think is a reasonable way of looking at the amount of capital or deals that you could do an annual basis going forward?","Jay Horgen","Yes, Chris. So we've always been active and always have spent a good amount of time cultivating relationships so as you know we've had multi decade relationships with firms. It's fair though to say that we've been through some transition at our firm and I think you asked about 12 months ago, and even 24 months ago, I think when we look forward as we've made this transition to the next-generation and I -- I've stressed in my prepared remarks the energy and focus of the next-generation. We are seeing that the pipeline build, the activity build, the ability to broaden the number of people here at AMG who are calling including my own time. So I do think that the forward prospect of transactions and capital avoiding transactions is greater certainly than 12 months ago because of some of the things that I said.","In terms of reasonable capital, I mean look it does depend on the market environment. There's always opportunity with independent firms because succession is inevitable. It has its own natural course in each firm and therefore it gives us a reasonable supply in any period. Markets can accelerate and certain regulatory change can accelerate that for example just taxes alone can be an accelerant.","As we look forward over the next 12 to 24 months it is a favorable environment to do transaction and so we do see the prospect of additional growth through new investments. Maybe I'll let Tom talk about capital in general and capital allocation as we think about it.","Tom Wojcik","Thanks, Jay, and thanks for your question, Chris. Obviously, I think capital allocation certainly goes hand-in-hand with all the color that Jay just provided. As you know our business generates a significant and predictable stream of unencumbered free cash flow probably something on the order of $700 million a year in after-tax free cash flow. And we also had tremendous flexibility with respect to our balance sheet. We have a $1.25 billion revolver. So we have a lot of capacity. So to the extent that some of these transactions do come to fruition, we think we can quite easily put out $1 billion in capital over the next 12 months and still be in a very reasonable leverage position.","Of course when we are putting capital to work on new investments, we're bringing in cash flows. So as we think about leverage and ratios overall, those cash flows come into the business.","The other thing that I think is important to mention here clearly new investments are our primary focus and what we believe to be the best use of our capital over the long-term for all the reasons that Jay has touched on. But in addition to that to the extent that we don't find opportunities, we have and will continue to return excess capital through share repurchases and dividends as we've done in the past.","Since 2017, we've returned more than $1 billion through share repurchases and we've reduced our diluted share count by more than 11% over that time period and have also paid more than $140 million in dividends.","So to Jay's point we'll continue to look for outstanding new affiliates to partner with to continue to build our business and we'll also be very prudent and thoughtful in the way that we return excess cash to the extent that we have.","Jay Horgen","Yes. And I think that was a really good summary. Let me just say notwithstanding our desire and our energy to go-out and entrepreneurial is going to go-out and continue to execute our new investment strategy, we don't have a target in any given period because quality is the most important thing to AMG. And luckily because or I shouldn't say luckily, but by design, we have a balance sheet that has both the capacity and the business model that has the free cash flow given the revenue share model and the diversity and instability, scale of our business that any excess capital we can be very productive and repurchase our shares. And that's what we'll do.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your question.","Patrick Davitt","Hey good morning guys, thank you. You mentioned EIG, Pantheon, and Baring all in the market with some frozen and 2Q on the illiquid side, could you maybe help frame how many strategies are in the market in that bucket and the target AUM in some, even if it's just some broad ranges. I think that would be really helpful for all of us.","Jay Horgen","Yes. So Patrick it's a good question because actually in the second quarter illiquid just idiosyncratic closings in the quarter were light. And I think when you look at our headline gross sales and alternatives in addition to having the -- in addition to the comments they made on the liquid al side, we did have a softer illiquid funding quarter that was temporary because as we look in the third and fourth quarter, we think it will return to normal and even into next year. And as you point out, EIG, Pantheon and Baring Asia all continue to be in fund raising mode each with multiple products. So what does that half dozen or more products that they're out actively marketing.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Mike Carrier","Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just given the annual strategic board offsite and then the new management you guys in place now besides looking for quality affiliates, are there other new initiatives that you guys and the team will be focused on whether it's in areas like distribution, products, expenses, or any others that can drive value and growth over time?","Jay Horgen","Thanks, Michael. So you stated our first objective and in our strategy which is we do believe in the superior capabilities of boutiques and generating alpha. And we think that's going to be in the future even more important especially as we move into more volatile periods. I think there's been a lot of recent press on this and we certainly support the thesis that we are moving into the age of boutiques.","Let me pause and say I think it's clear to everyone that we have a model that scales boutique capability by virtue of the fact that we protect the inherent value of the investment process and the equity alignment with clients, affiliate partners, and you our shareholders. That that model allows us to scale manufacturing of boutiques in a way that no one else can and doing so without the risk or cost of integration. So that is a clear competitive advantage of ours and something that we as a strategy matter do expect to continue to execute on in an excellent way allows us to be very agile, if you think about it as you move towards client demand trends long-term secular client demand trends over time.","There are multiple levers of growth in our business and so away from new investments. We would like to invest in the growth initiatives of our existing affiliates, they -- at any moment in time and obviously these things can be both secular and cyclical have opportunities for new products, for new distribution, for new packaging. And we have been very active maybe more active than we've ever been in helping our affiliates grow and use both our resources and capital to do so. And I mentioned in my prepared remarks just recently, we assisted GW&K and Trilogy and bringing the Trilogy emerging market product into the GW&K franchise. Those products are growing and we see that being something that we supported and it was a growth initiative for both firms.","Beyond that we've also seeded product and continue to see that as an opportunity where we can build additional opportunities at affiliates that have brands and have investment capabilities. We've assisted Pantheon for example in extending their reach into Japan. We assisted Pantheon in launching and marketing new products in U.S. retail. We've worked with our affiliates on both acquisitions and list out. And so when we take a step back, we see our affiliates especially those that are moving towards client demand trends, we see opportunities for us to invest directly in their businesses or alongside them in a way that is unique in our industry. So that clearly is a growth area and a growth opportunity.","And finally, our global distribution effort which we've talked a lot about recently not only continues to operate and leverage the skills of our AMG talent for the benefit of our affiliates in regions around the world where our affiliates or boutiques can extend their reach, we can use our scale and brand to raise assets for them. But because of that effort, we've evolved and we continue to see strategic partnerships as a valuable growth opportunity for us.","You heard us say last quarter and progress this quarter on Nordea. We have now seen funding across two affiliates and three products. We expect to add more affiliates and raise additional assets here. That has been borne out of our distribution efforts over time. And the benefit that we have with these relationships is that we can move to wholesale channels around the world without having to build scale in those channels. And so these partnerships are allowing us to have a single point of contact bring our boutique manufacturing into those regions and into those intermediaries to allow us to leverage what they've already built.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Bedell","Thanks, good morning guys. Maybe just a follow-on on the distribution question, Jay, as you see it for the investment in distribution. Do you see more of that coming internally at the affiliates or is AMG the holding company making a larger effort economically there. And is that something that we could see potentially pressuring the EBITDA fee realization rate. And then just one clarification on the prior question, I think Bill asked about the AUM that was at risk in the liquid, in the localized liquid al strategy that you mentioned, I missed that AUM number if you want to just repeat that. Thanks.","Jay Horgen","So on just your topic of distribution well maybe if I can just continue on the -- on the -- just continue on the topic of distribution for a moment and the costs associated with it, we really build distribution, institutional distribution in a very efficient way because we are leveraging many affiliates in those regions. As you know we have a cost recovery approach to our distribution effort. So as it relates to AMG's costs, we do not see it really going up materially. We've been able to work with our affiliates and really build that kind of one, one step at a time in a very efficient way. So I don't I guess my expectation is that it would not increase our costs but we can continue to offer those services and build out those services.","These strategic relationships that I mentioned are extraordinarily efficient bringing potentially scaled assets really through the efficiency of working with AMG to access all of our affiliate products.","When you look at the -- flipping to your second question, I think it's a difficult question to answer because while there were several products that had outflows in the quarter, we don't really classify AUM at risk in part because performance continues and moves and changes at any point in time. So while we did see it localized in AUM, I don't think it's productive to point to an AUM number because we would not expect that number to necessarily be at risk AUM, in fact we are very optimistic that this period is temporary and that we will return in all products to a level of normalized gross sales and redemption. And, Tom, if you wanted to add to it?","Tom Wojcik","Yes, I think the other thing Brian just to add to Jay's point, a number of the areas where we've seen recent outflows are product areas or individual funds that have multi-decade performance track records that have been incredibly strong and I've seen weak performance really only over the course of a relatively short period of time and we've seen outflows in those areas.","And as we talked about in our prepared remarks to the extent those performance challenges continue, we may see continued pressure. But I think taking that half step back, it's not really categorizing something at risk because these are long and storied franchises that have incredibly strong brands and that we believe in the role that they play over the long-term in client portfolios providing uncorrelated return and are really important part of portfolio construction. So I think we and our affiliates are working through some of those challenges today but over the long-term, we still have a lot of belief in those businesses, in those products and in the role that they play as part of client portfolios.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question this morning comes from the line of Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Dan Fannon","Thanks. Can you talk about just the pricing for new deals and obviously multiples for your stock and other kind of publicly traded asset managers have come in a lot. And so just curious how the private markets transactions and what you're looking at in terms of pricing has changed?","Jay Horgen","Dan, so I would put pricing structure, alignment, and ownership all in the same bucket. And so as you know our ownership model, our partnership model we're very interested to really only purchase at an amount of equity initially that continues the alignment in the long-term succession plan that we put in place at the time of the initial investment.","The reason why I started here is that that tends to be -- it tends to dominate discussion because really these businesses are looking for a succession plan. And when you're selling only a portion or say half of the equity in your business then you really care a lot about the other half and put the growth profile and who your partner is and how they're going to transact.","So pricing has always been part and parcel of our model. That said, we have seen pricing come down in most of the areas of boutiques. I would say the one exception being illiquid. But in other areas, we have seen pricing come down and possibly because industry multiples for public managers have come down and while it lagged, it has come down.","When we look at structuring and pricing today, we are seeing acceptable levels relative to even where our stock multiple is. And so we see no problem transacting at kind of the lower end of our 8 to 10 times multiple that we've historically transacted.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Horgen for any final comments.","Jay Horgen","Well thank you all again for joining us this morning. As you heard through our unique business model along with our ability to execute against our strategy, we're confident in our ability to generate long-term sustainable growth and create shareholder value over time. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Selene Oh, Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Selene Oh","Thank you for joining AMG to discuss our results for the second quarter of 2015. In this conference call, certain matters discussed will constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to those referenced in the company\u2019s Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time-to-time. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. AMG will provide on its website at www.amg.com a replay of the call and a copy of our announcement of our results for the quarter as well as a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.","With us on the line to discuss the company\u2019s results for the quarter are Sean Healey, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Nate Dalton, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Jay Horgen, Chief Financial Officer.","With that, I will turn the call over to Sean Healey.","Sean Healey","Thanks, Selene and good morning everyone. AMG reported economic earnings per share of $3.08 for the second quarter of 2015, which is a 16% increase over the same period last year. Our strong results for the quarter reflect ongoing momentum across all aspects of our business, including excellent execution of our new investment strategy, outstanding long-term investment performance by our industry leading boutique affiliates and continued strong organic growth from net client cash flows bringing our assets under management to a record $650 billion. Notwithstanding increased volatility in global equity markets and a somewhat muted investor risk appetite, we generated over $4 billion of net client cash flows during the quarter marking our 21st consecutive quarter of positive net client cash flows with a cumulative total of $135 billion in net flows over this period.","The ongoing success of our global distribution strategy, including new or expanded fundings in every coverage region worldwide during the quarter reflects the outstanding long-term investment track records of our boutique affiliates across a diverse range of return-oriented products as well as our strategic focus on global and emerging market equities and alternatives. Moreover, given our position as one of the largest alternative managers in the world, we continue to benefit from significant organic growth across a broad array of liquid and illiquid alternative products, which collectively generate over 35% of our earnings.","Looking forward, we see strong demand for our differentiated return-oriented strategies as global institutional clients continue to barbell their exposures into passive beta and active alpha components and increasingly prefer boutique managers for the alpha generating portions of their portfolios. We believe that over time demand for these products will likewise accelerate among retail clients who will inevitably require greater allocations to return-oriented strategies to meet their long-term objectives. AMG uniquely offers the breadth and diversity of an array of independent managers with distinct brands and specialized investment processes combined with the efficiency of end market client service and a single point of contact. With our affiliates\u2019 outstanding long-term investment track records across a wide range of alpha generating strategies, especially in global and emerging market equities and alternatives, AMG is well-positioned for continued strong organic growth.","Turning to new investments, we continue to make excellent progress towards partnering with outstanding new affiliates. Earlier this month, we were pleased to announce the addition of our fifth Wealth Partners affiliate, myCIO, a leading Philadelphia-based wealth management firm with approximately $7 billion in assets. Looking ahead, the transaction environment remains highly favorable to AMG and we have a growing and diverse pipeline of prospective new affiliates around the world. Given our unmatched competitive position as the permanent partner of choice to traditional and alternative boutiques globally our two decade track record of successful partnerships and our global distribution capability, we are confident in our ability to meaningfully enhance our earnings growth through accretive investments in outstanding new affiliates.","Stepping back, we have built our business into one of the largest global investment managers based on the fundamental belief at outstanding boutique firms with distinct, highly focused investment processes, alignment of interest through equity ownership and unique entrepreneurial cultures have competitive advantages in generating alpha in active equities and alternatives. In June, we published a research paper which analyzed 20 years of institutional equity returns across nearly 5,000 strategies and demonstrated that active boutique investment managers have consistently outperformed both non-boutique peers and indices over virtually all relevant time periods. These results present a sharp contrast to the prevailing industry narrative that active management underperforms passive products, while also validating our belief in the distinct advantages of boutiques in delivering alpha for their clients.","Going forward, we are uniquely well-positioned to continue to increase the scale, diversity and earnings power of our business both organically and through new investments. Given the strength of our existing business, our unparalleled global distribution capability and our proprietary opportunities to partner with a growing number of leading boutique firms, we are confident in our ability to continue to create outstanding shareholder value.","With that, I will turn it to Nate to discuss our results in greater detail.","Nate Dalton","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. As Sean said, AMG performed well during the first half of the year. While it was a period where investor risk appetite was relatively modest, over the long-term, we believe clients will need to continue to increase allocations to return-oriented assets in order to meet their liability stream and we are very well positioned for when this occurs. In the quarter, we benefited from clients increasing their allocations to focus boutiques, especially for the return of our alpha portions of their portfolios. This trend, combined with the excellent long-term track records of our high-quality diverse group of affiliates, resulted in over $4 billion in net flows and what was our 21st consecutive quarter of strong growth totaling $135 billion in net flows during this period.","Turning to investment performance and starting with the alternatives category where we offer a wide range of strategies. Standout performance in the quarter included BlueMountain and ValueAct. In addition, long-term performance track records across the majority of the largest products in our alternatives product category continue to be very strong, including especially at AQR, BlueMountain, Pantheon and ValueAct. In fact, Pantheon was just named Fund of Funds of the Year by Euromoney at their Investment Excellence Awards.","Continuing with the global developed markets category, our affiliates generally had strong investment performance with highlights for the quarter, including the major global equity products at Artemis, Harding Loevner and Veritas. These products continue to have outstanding performance records across longer term periods as well. While Tweedy Browne underperformed in the quarter due to both strict value discipline and relatively the cash flows held in their portfolios, but long-term track records there remain excellent with top decile rankings across 10 and 15 years in Morningstar.","In the emerging markets category, the major products managed by AQR, Genesis and Harding Loevner slightly underperformed their benchmarks in the quarter. Long-term performance records across their product suites, however, remained very strong. Finally, with respect to our U.S. equity products, performance was mixed with Yacktman underperforming, while GW&K and Systematic outperformed across most of their products during the quarter. Frontier also delivered very strong performance both in the quarter and across longer time periods.","Now, turning to flows for the quarter. As I said, we had another good quarter with $4.1 billion in positive net client cash flows. As we emphasize on every call flows, especially in the institutional and sub-advisory channels are inherently lumpy. However, in the quarter, flows were very diverse in terms of product category across both alternatives and global equity products. Starting with the institutional channel, we had positive net flows of approximately $6.1 billion. Flows came primarily in alternative strategies and global equities, including notable contributions from AQR, BlueMountain, AIG, First Quadrant, Harding Loevner, Pantheon and ValueAct very diverse. In our high net worth channel, we have positive net flows of $70 million with contributions from GW&K and Harding Loevner. We also had a notable contribution from our new Wealth Partners affiliate, Baker Street.","Focusing on Wealth Partners for a moment, I would also like to welcome myCIO Wealth Partners, a new affiliate which we announced a couple of weeks ago. myCIO is a highly regarded wealth advisory firm with strong future growth prospects. They provide comprehensive and integrated advises regarding asset allocation, manager selection and financial state and tax planning for the focus on corporate executives and retirement plans. With this most recent investment, our Wealth Partners business now includes five outstanding firms with over $30 billion in AUM, making us one of the leading wealth management firms in the industry.","Moving to the mutual fund channel, we had outflows of $2.1 billion. While we had positive flows into many global and emerging markets equities and alternative strategies which came from a number of affiliates, including AQR, Artemis, Harding Loevner and Tweedy Browne. These were more than offset by outflows at Yacktman and other U.S. equity products that AMG funds. This was against the backdrop of a tough environment for U.S. retail flows for active return oriented managers generally and especially in U.S. equities. As we have noted on previous calls, our U.S. retail business has eschewed towards U.S. equities unlike our broader institutional and high net worth businesses.","Maybe one final point about flows and distribution and the evolution of our distribution capabilities and strategy, this evolution has played an important part not only in driving our significant positive flows over the past 21 quarters, but more importantly, set us up extremely well to continue to drive significant positive flows in the years ahead. Over the last decade, we have made significant progress towards our vision to build out a unique multilevel distribution strategy. At the first level, each of our affiliates maintains their own dedicated distribution and product specialist resources in the channels and geographies where they can do an excellent job. As you know, we have invested in affiliates that are complete firms. At the same time, we have built a second highly complementary AMG level distribution designed to do three things. First, add the benefits of global scale to these boutique firms allowing them to access appropriate clients around the world in a cost effective way, clients that could not have accessed on their own. Second, to create a relationship with the marketplace that is unlike the relationship any boutique firm could have. This is a relationship where we can engage with evermore sophisticated clients around the questions of what do you the client need and what problems are you, the client trying to solve as opposed to here are the products we have to sell.","Third, we are at the early stage of building client relationships that ultimately will allow us to work with our affiliates and help them with everything from more effective product development, more effective client acquisition and more effective client retention, all in the context of the multilevel relationships we already have with most of the largest institutional clients in the world. This global strategy is working well today and we continue to make good progress. Also, we are in the early stages of building out the same approach for the retail market, certainly here in the U.S. but conceptually can extend to other global regions as appropriate given the return profiles we see. And we have taken some initial steps. Putting these all together, as I said earlier, we are setting up extremely well to continue to drive significant positive flows in the year ahead \u2013 in the years ahead with our existing affiliates.","Finally, we should also recognize the significant corollary benefits of the success we have been having with our AMG distribution platforms. We often speak about this in terms of a virtuous circle. Our distribution success makes us more attractive to prospective new affiliates who come with outstanding additional products, which in turn makes us a more valuable business partner to our clients and their intermediaries, which in turn will allow us to continue to generate even greater organic growth in the years ahead.","And with that, I will turn it to Jay.","Jay Horgen","Thank you, Nate. As Sean discussed, despite a volatile market environment, we are pleased with our second quarter results, including another quarter of strong net client cash flows. Given the strength and diversity of our affiliates and the substantial cash generated by the size and scale of our business, we continue to produce stable and growing earnings including in periods of uneven markets. As you saw in the release, we reported economic earnings per share of $3.08 for the first quarter, an increase of 16% year-over-year with net performance fees contributing $0.11. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $2.31. Our GAAP earnings for the quarter included a non-cash imputed interest gain related to the revaluation of our contingent payment obligations. Excluding this item, our GAAP earnings for the quarter would have been $2.14 per share. This non-cash item had no impact on our economic earnings per share.","Turning to more specific modeling items, for the second quarter, our EBITDA increased 13% year-over-year to $239.2 million, reflecting the continued organic growth of our business and the impact of new investments. In the second quarter, the ratio of our EBITDA to end of period assets under management was approximately 14.9 basis points or approximately 14.2 basis points, excluding performance fees. In the third quarter, we expect this ratio to be approximately 14.1 basis points as we expect only a minimal contribution from performance fees. With regard to our taxes, our effective GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 35% and our cash tax rate was approximately 22%. For modeling purposes, we expect our GAAP tax rate to be 34% and our cash tax rate to remain at 22%. Intangible related deferred taxes for the second quarter were $20.7 million and we expect this number to stay flat at $20.7 million in the third quarter.","Our share of reported amortization for the quarter was $30 million, which includes $8.7 million of amortization from affiliates accounted for under the equity method. We expect our share of amortization to remain at approximately $30 million for the third quarter. Our share of interest expense for the second quarter was $22.5 million and for the third quarter we expect our share of interest expense to remain at this level. Our share of pretax non-cash imputed interest expense for the second quarter excluding the contingent payment gain of $15 million would have been $1.8 million. For the third quarter, we expect our pretax non-cash imputed interest expense to decline to approximately $1 million.","Turning to our balance sheet, the excess cash flow generated from the size, scale and diversity of our business provides us with significant capacity to execute our new investment strategy and the flexibility to return capital by repurchasing shares. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 125 million bringing our year-to-date total to approximately 280 million. Looking forward, with run rate EBITDA of approximately $1 billion combined with over $1 billion of undrawn revolver, we continue to be well positioned to create incremental opportunities for earnings growth.","Now turning to guidance, we are updating our 2015 guidance as we expect economic earnings per share to be in the range of $12.80 to $14. The revision in guidance was entirely attributable to market changes since our last earnings call. This guidance assumes a model convention of actual market performance through yesterday for the current quarter, 2% quarterly market growth beginning in the fourth quarter and repurchases of 50% of annual economic net income for 2015, resulting in a weighted average share count of approximately 55.5 million for the year. The lower end of our guidance range includes a modest contribution from performance fees and organic growth, while the upper end assumes a more robust contribution from performance fees and net client cash flows. As always, these assumptions do not include earnings from future new investments and are based on our current expectation of affiliate growth rates, performance and the mix of affiliate contribution to our earnings. Of course, substantial changes in markets and the earnings contribution of our affiliates would impact these expectations.","Now, we will be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this we will be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Craig Siegenthaler","Thanks. Good morning every one.","Nate Dalton","Good morning, Craig.","Craig Siegenthaler","Just want to hit on retail first, Jeff Cerutti has been in place for over a year now and I think there has been some changes among the retail wholesaling ranks, so really when will product tweaking and the U.S. distribution efforts sort of be ready to really more aggressively attack and gain market share from the bigger broker dealers or our agents from the key distribution partners?","Nate Dalton","Sure. So this is Nate, I will take the first part of that. So you are right, the teams are in place. I think there are several members, but we had the team is now in place. And I think you also hit on the key question as you think about sort of short-term, which is the product mix. Some we have talked about the product mix of installed base. It\u2019s reasonably scale U.S. retail platform already, right and we have talked about the product mix there being skewed towards U.S. equities and the challenges of that active U.S. equities are having. But there is a whole \u2013 there is actually a lot of work going on already in terms of product development and building out a product set or additional product if those appropriate kind of near-term, but also trying to also focus on the sort of the medium to longer term where do we think the real opportunities are. And some examples that we have talked about I think on previous calls have been in the alternative space as an example, where we have lots of manufacturing capability and we also have packaging capability and that\u2019s both liquid and illiquid as we talked about before. So I think you hit on the right question, which is I think the teams built and in place, they are executing and continuing to evolve the focus of the people underneath them and where they are pushing. And again, I think we have also talked about we have good penetration in some places wires, RAs as examples as we bring AMG funds and asking together as we have re-branded and are now kind of leverage the AMG brand into this channel. So, there is lots of good things happening, but again, you also hit on the key determinant, I think in the short run which is making sure we continue to evolve the product mix.","Sean Healey","In the long run, the biggest opportunity is around broader client demand trends and we are convinced that and history tells us that demand trends move in cycles. And I think with rising rates and ongoing evolution and among retail investors and the inevitable need, as I said, to find and pursue more return-oriented strategies in order for retail investors to meet their long-term planning objectives, we believe that the retail universe will \u2013 client demand universe will increasingly move toward the return-oriented product set that we emphasize the alpha portion of the barbell, if you will. And then, I know you understand this, but I think it\u2019s worth emphasizing and we saw it again this quarter in a period of challenging U.S. equity demand in the \u2013 for us and for the industry in the U.S. retail space. The strength of our business, the preponderance of our business in the global institutional client universe is evident and you saw that in the strong flow numbers that we put up, which even as I said in a difficult period for U.S. retail resulted in flows that were strong, especially relative to overall industry results.","Craig Siegenthaler","Great. I think she said just one question. So, I will just get back into queue.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Dan Fannon","Thanks. Good morning. I guess, Jay, if you could clarify the components of the guidance in terms of the mark through the quarter. And then also on the buyback in the quarter, I guess, would you characterize 2Q in terms of the purchases in that level as kind of a base case for thinking about modeling going forward?","Jay Horgen","Okay. So, Dan, just as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the change in guidance, the revision is entirely attributable to lower beta since our last call, which is off about 3% since the last time we gave guidance. This is reflecting the downward volatility in global markets that started late June, continues through yesterday, I guess. Stepping back though, just on the convention and then I will address your question about quarter-to-date. Our convention is since our last call April 28, we assumed zero markets for the remainder of second quarter and 2% for the third quarter. As I just mentioned though, the actual blend was off 3% from April 28, which is the last time we did the guidance through yesterday, which results in a 5% cumulative market decline versus our model. As you know, for the remainder of the year, we will assume no additional market this quarter, for the remainder of the third quarter and then 2% in the fourth quarter. So, that\u2019s our guidance.","And so when we look at the revision, it was just entirely a market-driven revision. But the detail you were looking for, a little extra detail on quarter-to-quarter changes, first, as you saw on our AUM table, we experienced almost no contribution from market change in the quarter. So, it was basically flat. And then from June 30 through yesterday, our market blend was off about 1%. So, that\u2019s another way of looking at the same market on a quarterly basis. On repurchases, so this quarter, our share count was 55.6 million. In the third quarter, we expect the share count to come in because of the weighted average effect. In the second quarter, we will have a full effect on the third quarter. And that 125 million that we repurchased was more reflective of the fact that we didn\u2019t have material new investments in the period. I think we \u2013 well, go back to the model convention, which is just a convention of 50% of annual economic net income for repurchases, but the substantive point is our first priority is new investments to the extent that in \u2013 because of the accident of time, timing, we don\u2019t have a new investment or material new investments, we might do a little more. As we look forward in the second half of the year, we do have a good pipeline and we will be mindful of the new investment opportunity as it relates to the capital that we put out.","Sean Healey","Yes. And I would just add underscoring what Jay just said that the baseline expectation for investors should be that we will return the cash the business generates either through repurchases or the first priority, as Jay noted, is always going to be new investments. So, your question around baseline is I think relevant to the guidance convention, but not really relevant to the overall business strategy, where you may see periods of even more elevated repurchase activity in a quarter. But over time, we expect that you will see substantial new investment activity, which with some repurchase activity along in the mix as well, but the overall opportunity in new investments, and I am sure I will get a question around this in a moment, remains extraordinarily strong, better than ever.","Dan Fannon","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Bill Katz with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Bill Katz","Alright, thanks so much and Sean just a pickup right there, I guess in your press release, you did add some verbiage share you are seeing progressively well, so not something it\u2019s too much, but it sounds like a little bit more upbeat than maybe what you said last quarter, so just sort of stepping back could you talk a little bit about the pipeline sequentially, where you sort of see the best appetite? And then could you also address competition, because I have noticed a couple of deals have been announced of late, Blackstone made a majority stake into First Eagle. I think Ares merged up with Kayne. So, curious if there is any sort of pressure building on multiples? Thank you.","Sean Healey","Sure. Thanks for the question, Bill. The overall pipeline as you heard Jay and me both say continues to be very strong. It continues to be skewed to alternative and to non-U.S. prospects with and I will talk about this further in a moment, but with a broad universe of outstanding prospects, where we built strong relationships. I would say current year pipeline, there were a couple of investment opportunities that were deferred for kind of one-off idiosyncratic reasons earlier in the year and that Jay alluded to that in the sort of slightly elevated repurchase activity. But at the moment, we are very busy with some excellent new investment prospects. So, I will leave it there in terms of the short-term. I would say, our experience and activity level is against the backdrop of actually relatively slow overall industry activity. If you look sequentially at the number of transactions, even AUM, it\u2019s down. There have been a few notable transactions, which involve different kinds of firms doing different kinds of deals, so not really relevant to us. I would say, we continue to be highly selective in our choice of perspective affiliates. So, there are always going to be deals, which others will pursue which you will see announced, where we didn\u2019t think the opportunity is right for us.","And then finally, over the medium to long-term, our market position continues to be extremely strong. The universe and we talk about 150 core prospects where we build relationships, I would say, even over the last several months that universe expands. We have done a very good job of adding to and deepening our relationships among the best perspective boutiques around the world. Transaction timing is inevitably going to be driven entirely by the individual perspective affiliates and their idiosyncratic decisions about the right time for them. I would say, we, on an overall basis, none of our expectations about transaction activity or timing is reflected by or based on any perceived increase in competitive pressure. I would say, on an overall basis, as we think about the opportunity set again in a medium to long term. We look at this universe of outstanding boutique firms around the world and our judgment is that the decision for these firms to seek a succession planning solution is a question of when, not if. And so our relationships, which form the foundation of the opportunity and our market position, competitive position and the offerings we provide and the track record of success and our relationships and recommendations from existing affiliates give us just enormous confidence as we look forward.","Bill Katz","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Carrier","Thanks, guys. Just on the M&A front, you have been a little bit more active on the wealth management side and I know each transaction is going to be different, but just wanted to get your take on the outlook for both that industry and then how you guys see it? And then on the transactions just how we should think about deploying capital in that arena versus maybe the legacy like what you traditionally have been active in on the asset management side, just how those economics differ?","Sean Healey","Well, first, the core opportunity among asset management boutiques remains as I just said extraordinarily attractive with very large number of firms and in our judgment that we have an extremely strong competitive position. Separately, and it really is separate, with the separate team and a separate strategy and I will ask Nate to talk about the strategy and some of the potential synergies that we see with the wealth management boutiques. I am extremely pleased with the results and execution by the wealth management team. And as you heard, another new wealth management affiliate, we are now up to about $35 billion in wealth management assets, which puts us in a very short span of time, among the leading independent wealth management firms, with lots of ongoing prospects. Maybe I will ask Nate to talk in a little bit more detail about the execution and the opportunity.","Nate Dalton","Sure. So, let me start by emphasizing the point that Sean made, which is the sort of the separate effort, it really is a separate effort and customized for that space. And maybe I broadened a little and say separate and complementary and maybe I will use that to get in a little bit to, I think where Sean was headed, which is as we have made \u2013 we have five affiliates now in Wealth Partners Group and they are among the very best, so sort of how we have made investments and among the very best Wealth Partners firms, there is a continuing pipeline of firms sort of equivalent scope and scale that we are looking at. And so I think that sort of past and continued growth is there. The other thing is and this comes back to the complementary, there are two things that we are starting to do now, right, one is now add our scope and scale with the Wealth Partners firms as we did with our more traditional affiliates. Once you get to a certain scope and scale, you can start to leverage that to improve and provide additional opportunities to the businesses. So, we are beginning to that, which is one of the things we can do to help these firms and pay more effort, one of the things we have been doing to help make these firms capitalize on opportunities. And we think there are number some that look like what we have done with traditional firms, but a number that are different given the different nature of those businesses. And then there are also opportunities we believe and this is more of a medium to longer term opportunity, but we believe there are opportunities to build bridges between the more traditional affiliates and the excellent manufacturing capabilities that they have and the Wealth Partners affiliates. And so again that\u2019s more of a medium-term opportunity set, but we do think these are highly complementary businesses on a bunch of different dimensions.","Michael Carrier","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Chris Shutler with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Shutler","Hey, guys. Good morning.","Sean Healey","Good morning.","Chris Shutler","I think last year, Sean, late last year, you started talking about potentially broadening the investment strategy. Clearly, you guys have been adding firms on the Wealth Partners side, but just curious what else you are working on behind the scenes to the extent that you can elaborate?","Sean Healey","You are right to make the observation, Chris. And I think we have made excellent progress and there has been a great deal of time and energy devoted to identifying a universe of perspective targets and thinking through the various issues around the best way of partnering with such firms. There isn\u2019t a lot that I can say beyond that at this point, but I think you will see some announcements. And I don\u2019t think there will be any one investment or partnership that stands out, but the cumulative effect I think over time will contribute meaningfully to ongoing diversification and broadening of our product sets. Maybe I will ask Nate who is heading up this strategic effort to add anything that I left out given the constraints about not announcing what we can\u2019t announce yet.","Nate Dalton","No, I think you said it just right. And I think we are very focused on alignment and where the leverage opportunities between what we know how to do and what we are good at and where the opportunity set is. And so we have looked at a lots of things and maybe on the margin, you could say being a little on the cautious side, I think we are also known by the things we don\u2019t. So, we have looked at a bunch of things. I think we are making good progress. I agree with what Sean said.","Chris Shutler","Alright, thanks. And then just the other question I had was just on capacity and maybe just give us an update on the existing managers that you have, particularly the ones where you have been seeing really good flows over the last several quarters. Are there any that stand out as having capacity constraints at this point, I would think ValueAct is probably in that bucket, but maybe help us think about firms like Harding Loevner? Thanks.","Sean Healey","So, you don\u2019t get in trouble with Selene, Chris. We are going to view that as a link to your [indiscernible]. Yes, so I think let me answer it across the group. I want to be careful and not get ahead of how specific the affiliates are talking about it to their clients. But there is definitely some areas, where affiliates are looking carefully at capacity. I don\u2019t break in the couple of buckets, right? So, one is absolutely, right, because there is a limit to how much someone can manage in a capacity. There is also a number of affiliates that are managing the pace as their firm grows, right? So, we have had affiliates building, queuing and pacing systems and all that, which is less about the capacity and less in process and just making sure that they bring in the assets in a way that they are doing a good job for their existing client base first and there are certainly affiliates doing that. And then they are certainly also ones where affiliates are managing capacity to match it with the investment opportunities they see now. And so an example that\u2019s public would be a firm like Tweedy Browne, which has been soft closed for a while and so managing inflows from their existing user base really. And so I think when you talk about capacity, you have to sort of think about all of those.","The other thing I would say is and then we have examples for all those, the other thing I would say is though those are more than offset and you are seeing this in our flow results, that\u2019s more than offset by new products coming online at a range of different affiliates. And I think I use the words coming online sort of consciously, because some products being launched, there is also a number of products sort of coming up on 3-year records or 5-year records or $100 million in assets and places where they can really be brought to market and we have got a number of affiliates across channels and geographies, where that\u2019s happening. And some of this also relates to packaging, right? So, we have to make sure we can help affiliates with the packaging. And a lot of this also relates back to that virtuous circle conversation that I talked about before, because we are also I think being able to be a more effective partner to our affiliates in conversations around product development, where they should be taking these products, so they can access clients faster, right, appropriate clients faster and make the cost of acquisition and the time to acquisition shorter. So, all of those things sort of happening, so we certainly have affiliates for their capacity things, but it\u2019s certainly offset by \u2013 more than offset by sort of new products coming online at a range of affiliates.","And then finally, there is the role that new affiliates play in us, which you have heard us talk about before, which is as we bring on new affiliates sort of one of the strong advantage we have, certainly as we have been building out distribution as you can bring on new affiliates with appropriate products and leverage distribution capabilities much more quickly. So, I think we feel good about the new products coming online at our existing affiliates and then obviously also the opportunity set as we look at the pipeline of potential affiliates.","Chris Shutler","Alright, thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Michael Kim with Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Kim","Hey, guys. Good morning. So, just in terms of flow trends, it seems like on the one hand, demand for alternative strategies continues to remain strong, but less favorably interested more traditional actively managed domestic equity funds remain soft across the industry and pretty evident when you look at your flows by product and channel. So just assuming those trends sort of hold steady for the time being, just wondering about sort of the relative economics for AMG in terms of EBITDA contribution, it seems like you may have some offsetting dynamics around maybe higher fee rates for deals, but maybe lower ownership stakes in some of those affiliates, so just wondering how that might play out at a high level?","Sean Healey","Well, I think the first reaction I have is you notably left out logo on emerging market equities, which do even in the U.S. retail channel and certainly on a global basis, represent real growth opportunities where we have a number of excellent affiliates. So it\u2019s not just an old story indeed global and emerging market equities is a bigger element of our product set even then alternatives. And so that\u2019s the first answer. As you look at our broad product set, you look at overall industry trends and our own results, which I think relative to the industry, including of course, in return oriented products I think positioned us very well and are evidence of the ongoing strength and vitality of our business and the quality of the underlying affiliates and their products. So that\u2019s the high level answer.","The second high level answer I would give, which I am sure Jay would say, but I will say it first and then let Jay add to this is we are unique among our public peers, certainly among any large public peers, in giving earnings guidance. And sometimes the guidance methodology about what we assume about market returns in a given quarter like this one can sort of mask the underlying strength of our results and of our business and future prospects. We leave it to you to sort of through all of that, but if you look at our forward guidance and compare our earnings growth to any of our peers, we are happy to be judged on that basis and the guidance assumes and encompasses judgments around any of these changes in mix. And in many cases, the difference between or the economic impact of a \u201cminority owned affiliate\u201d is not that different given the incremental investments and firms like BlueMountain and AQR. It\u2019s not that different than some of the \u201cmajority owned affiliates\u201d. And just the guidance itself is evidence of this. We feel very good about our earnings growth prospects. I will ask Jay to add to that.","Jay Horgen","I think Sean did a nice job covering it, Michael. But just to add a bit more color to it, I think on the feedback, really the alternatives in general not only have a management fee component, but they have a performance fee component. So when you look at it in total, especially through the years and over the course of the year, most of our performance fee is expressed in the fourth quarter. You are actually seeing our fee rates go up a little bit in that context. And as Sean mentioned, the equity method affiliates, while slightly lower ownership than the consolidated, it\u2019s not that much especially since we have made a second investment in AQR and the second investment in BlueMountain. So the mix is much closer between equity method and the consolidated. So when you take the two together and you think about we give guidance every quarter, on a quarter where there is very little performance fees like the third quarter, for example we have held pretty steady at EBITDA to end the period assets under management in the 14 \u2013 low-14s. But on a yearly basis, we are north of 15, maybe even close to 16. And if you look at that over a longer period of time, it actually has been flat to up, not flat to down.","Michael Kim","Got it, that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Bedell","Hi, good morning. Maybe just to get a little bit more on the performance fee assumptions change and then a related question for Sean just in terms of the math on the $0.11 that seems to be about 3% of EBITDA, so can you verify that? And then is the upper and lower balance of the guidance range or lower and upper balance of the guidance range still 5% of EBITDA and performance fees in 10%. And then do you feel you are just based on the comments you just said Jay I think you are tracking on the better side of that. And then just longer term about the affiliates that you are interested in it is increasing that performance fee part of the mix, it\u2019s something that\u2019s interesting to you from a like alternative perspective?","Jay Horgen","Okay. So that\u2019s a good question. So let\u2019s maybe take it the performance fee at a high level, couple of quick points and then I will be more specific. Performance fees have and they continue to contribute earnings in a consistent and meaningful way given the breadth of our products and the type of performance fees that we have and the diversity of the affiliates that produce performance fees. Some of those performance fees are related to alternative products, both liquid and illiquid and some of them are related to more traditional long only products. So there is a lot of ways for us to generate performance fees, that\u2019s first point.","Second point is when you look at our flows and we have talked about good flows over a long period of time into alternatives, I would just like to add a small point before I make the bigger point that not all alternative flows go into performance fees oriented products. Notably, Pantheon and liquid alternatives AQR tend to be more management fee products. So when you see our flows, not all are going into performance fees sensitive products. Some of them are going into management fee products. But as I think you would expect, against the backdrop of continued flows, we are seeing our performance fee opportunity go up modestly as a percentage of our earnings.","I think on the last call, I said given the scale, diversity and the performance to-date of our alternative products are 15 range guidance range include a slightly higher performance fee assumption. So that is the case at both the low and the high end, a slightly higher performance fee assumption. The last thing I wanted to say about performance fee is just to note, we would like to say this, we only express performance fee when realized. So we get the performance fee in cash when it\u2019s expressed in earnings, which is distinguishing between us and other firms, which may use method two, which is mark-to-market performance fees where you can see more volatility in the performance fee stream more effectively a reversal of performance fees earnings that might have been recognized in an earlier period, but wouldn\u2019t in the given changes in market, perhaps ever be realized as cash for us, it\u2019s an inherently more conservative approach.","The other thing I would say, which I think implicitly mentioned is the nature of performance fees for AMG is that they can\u2019t be much higher and we have many different strategies and many opportunities to generate exceptionally strong performance fees, but they can \u2013 they can never be below for any strategy, never be below zero. We don\u2019t \u2013 there aren\u2019t scenarios where we are giving back money and that one way option is, again not always present in the way that other entities talk about or experience performance fees.","With respect to the second part of your question around our future strategy for investing in alternative firms, there is no question that there are a large number of really excellent institutionalized alternative firms that have built and want to continue to build and doing franchises where some kind of succession solution or partnership is attractive to them. And I think I would say broadly, AMG\u2019s proposition, value proposition is attractive to a firm that probably doesn\u2019t need money. If all you offer is just money, that\u2019s not something that a typical successful alternative firm really needs. And if that\u2019s the kind of transaction that clients see, it really isn\u2019t aligned with client interest. If by contrast it\u2019s a competitive partnership where we offer in a way that is very attractive and amenable to the needs and desires of alternative firms in areas like global distribution, global compliance, etcetera, where perspective affiliates get the opportunity to access and benefit from economies of scale and a real strategic capability. That\u2019s sensible and attractive to firms and by extension to their clients.","And in the same way, a permanent partner with a long track record of successful partnerships where part of the ongoing opportunities to have the partner participate in ongoing succession and transition in a way that we have done several times, including with \u2013 several times with our alternative affiliates and it\u2019s really the cornerstone of our overall business activity. That too is attractive for the right kind of alternative firm. And so, yes, you will see more investments in the future in excellent alternative firms. But I should say, the largest part of the universe of excellent boutique firms around the world are still in traditional long only strategies, including especially global and emerging market equity strategies. And so on an ongoing basis, I don\u2019t expect the mix of our business to from a product standpoint \u2013 from a performance fee contribution to overall earnings standpoint to change that much. Obviously, we expect growth in all areas, both organically and through new investments.","Brian Bedell","Okay, that\u2019s great color. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Lee","Thanks and I appreciate your patience taking all the questions this morning. Just on the global distribution, I guess when I think of global distribution, I guess they have historically put it as predominantly institutional effort in the U.S., that the AMG Fund platform is predominantly retail effort, but could you maybe talk to us a bit about what the plan is kind of non-U.S. retail? I mean, is that kind of the next leg on your global distribution that you are either investing in or thinking about? And I mean that would seem to be a logical extension. And so maybe just talk about that a little bit where that type of initiative stands and just on the horizon and maybe how you think \u2013 what you think it would cost?","Jay Horgen","Perfect. Thanks very much for the questions. So, I think you understand exactly right sort of how we have built to here. So, fundamentally, as we said, we are marrying sort of excellent performance-oriented boutiques with the scope and scale of global distribution platforms. And you are right, the non-U.S. has been predominantly institutional, but does include some sub-advisory, but predominantly institutional. And we have started out going to regions hiring experienced marketers. And I think you have heard us talk now for a couple of quarters about deepening the coverage that we have within existing regions. So, increasing specialization by country sometimes, but also sometimes broadening the channels recovering within the regions, right? So, if we have a good high-end institutional calling effort, we are building a brand in that market, where people know us and know our affiliates and then beginning to take that down market. Some of that down market can be just smaller institutional and through intermediaries to small institutions, but some of it certainly can be into platform markets and then through that where it will be more effective direct access and some of that is through that building out more packages, which can help the institutional market as well as leverageable to more retail platforms and we are absolutely starting to work on those things. Now, it\u2019s showing up we have done some work already in use its space, so we have launched a few uses with affiliates. Again, mostly we are focused on places where we can leverage our institutional, leverage that package to help our existing distribution team deepen their coverage, right, but we are starting to build those packages.","Same thing we talked about I think in Australia where we have begun building out all the trusts, same thing which is we can leverage the brand that we have already built over the better part of the decade into platform markets and we have hired someone to begin working on that effort as well. So, I think you are understanding it exactly, right, which is it is in additional leg. I wouldn\u2019t sort of say it\u2019s the additional leg, but it\u2019s an additional leg as we look at the ways that we can continue to leverage the good work that we have done so far building the AMG brand and helping our affiliates penetrate a bunch in those attractive markets in the world. I will say there are other legs and the other legs include there are geographies we haven\u2019t really penetrated yet and there are certainly other channels besides the more retail channels and the more package product channels within geographies where we are ready that we haven\u2019t really penetrated yet. So, there are lots of places for us to go. But one of them is certainly build appropriate packages and then bring those packages into more retail markets generally through platforms.","Robert Lee","Great, thanks for taking my question.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Alex Blostein","Great, thanks. Good morning. Question for you guys on retail alts, something you have talked about for a while and the industry has been talking about this product and opportunity for sometime as well. It feels like it\u2019s taking a little bit longer to really gain much of a meaningful momentum. So just trying to get a better sense of what you guys hearing from the channels and what are the biggest hurdles for these products to become a bigger part of retail allocations?","Nate Dalton","So, I think you are right we have been talking about for a while. I think we have been seeing some good flows into sort of retail liquid alts and I think that\u2019s both sort of a little bit touching this question and the prior one that\u2019s both the U.S. as well as non-U.S. retail liquid alts. So, I do think we have been seeing some good penetration and we have also been doing some work as you have heard us talk about on prior calls in bringing the sort of less liquid alts products to the marketplace, which has certainly taken a while to catch hold and a lot of that is building the packages and sort of getting the mix of building what\u2019s appropriate for the marketplace with the liquidity, with the constraints of continuing to do an excellent job relative to the investment process that underlies it. You are sort of putting those together. I think there is \u2013 I can\u2019t speak for the industry, but sort of for us, I think there is lots and lots of good groundwork that\u2019s been laid and I think bringing product into market. I think some of it is just figuring, helping the channels figure out how to use this product, getting it on to platforms and then through platforms, getting the first movers to adopt it. And I just think it\u2019s, as you say, maybe taking a bit longer, but fundamentally, we have been seeing good flows in liquid alts so far.","Sean Healey","And hard to judge exactly when or how, but our view is that there will be more and more demand, especially in the retail channel for alternatives. And if you think about it, the rest of our return-oriented product set, even though you have seen reasonable demand for global equity products, the rest of our return-oriented products that we think will be increasingly in favor in the retail channel. And you can imagine in an environment where that\u2019s the case or increasingly the case, there will be other products, most notably, long duration fixed income, where the products and the underlying retail investors are struggling and experiencing even losses in products where they thought they were investing in a \u201csafe\u201d i.e., limited principal risk kind of product and they thought they were investing in a product that was highly liquid, which in some scenarios, for some products might not be. And so that will be challenges for the broader industry and certainly the firms which emphasize those products. For us, I think it will actually be an opportunity as clients rotate out of those kind of products, long duration fixed income-oriented products, and into more a broader suite of return-oriented products like liquid alts.","Alex Blostein","Got it. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Greggory Warren with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","Greggory Warren","Yes, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question. Hey, real, you touched on this a little bit as far as uses of cash and allocations for capitals as we move forward here. Number one priority being new investments, number two being repurchases of common stock when the stocks trading at a reasonable value, but I think one of the broader questions that I get from time-to-time from people is looking at a dividend. And I know we have talked about this a little bit in the past and it looks like with the Wealth Partners investments here, you found a good source of putting that capital to work at least in the near to medium term, but just wondering what kind of timeframe you might be thinking about longer term for a dividend and whether or not a special dividend makes sense in the near-term?","Sean Healey","Well, thanks. I think the opportunity to invest the cash the business generates and indeed additional capital in new investments, both asset management and wealth management or Wealth Partners affiliates, is enormously attractive in the short, medium and long-term. And we, if you look over any reasonable time period, I think we have demonstrated an ability to execute investments over market cycles. And if you look forward at the 150 \u2013 and I don\u2019t know that we have quantified the number of wealth management perspective affiliates, but it\u2019s a very large universe worldwide. I think if anything, it\u2019s a growing universe over the course of this year. There are more of these really excellent prospects that represent ideal investment opportunities for us and there is, as we have said a certain inevitability to transaction activity based around succession, finding a succession solution a question of when, not if. And AMG\u2019s competitive position built over the last 20 years is really better than it\u2019s ever been. So, an enormous opportunity set, we have quantified the asset management opportunity set as $40 billion to $50 billion in purchase price, not over \u2013 not even overall enterprise value. So, it\u2019s that kind of a magnitude of opportunities looking forward, which makes us to sort of return to the specific timing question that you raise, makes us much more sensitive around maintaining the flexibility that share repurchases provide in terms of calibrating the return of capital to periods where we have fewer new investment opportunities.","And for us, there will be those periods inevitably, but they will be short in duration, hard to predict any and the thing that we are very convinced of and very much positioning our business for is over the next five years a very substantial amount of new investment activity, which we have been able to \u2013 we have demonstrated an ability to make investments in outstanding firms, which enhance the overall value of our business franchise and obviously create even greater shareholder value. So, that\u2019s what we are looking toward in the medium-term. There will be, at some point, a dividend, but I think it will be at a point where AMG is much bigger and where we imagine that the amount of available cash flow that\u2019s generated every year is more than we are likely to invest in a typical period. And even at more than $1 billion in EBITDA current run-rate, we are not close to that. So, I wouldn\u2019t count on it anytime soon. But you should count on a real commitment to return substantially all the capital the business generates in a way that is most attractive to shareholders. I don\u2019t know if I left any meat on the bone for you, Jay.","Jay Horgen","Well said.","Sean Healey","Okay, thank you.","Greggory Warren","Well, thanks guys. That\u2019s it. Good color.","Operator","Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Healey for any additional or concluding comments.","Sean Healey","Thank you again for joining us this morning.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Anjali Aggarwal, Vice President, Investor Relations for AMG. Thank you. You may begin.","Anjali Aggarwal","Thank you for joining AMG to discuss our results for the third quarter of 2019. In this conference call, certain matters discussed will constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected due to a number of factors, including but not limited to, those referenced in the company's Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time-to-time. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.","AMG will provide on the Investor Relations section of its website, at ir.amg.com, a replay of the call, a copy of the announcement of our results for the quarter, and a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures that are not announced on this call, to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. As a reminder, we have also included an updated investor presentation on this section of our website. AMG encourages investors to consult the Investor Relations section of its website regularly for updated information.","With us on the line to discuss the company's results for the quarter are Jay Horgen, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Tom Wojcik, Chief Financial Officer.","With that, I will turn the call over to Jay.","Jay Horgen","Thanks, Anjali, and good morning everyone. As macro factors continue to fuel uncertainty and volatility in markets, AMG's diversification and unique partnership structure, provides stability and enable us to continue to evolve our business to meet long-term client demand trends. Boutique managers have a proven ability to outperform in more volatile markets, and given their long-term performance track record, our affiliates are well positioned to benefit as client deep differentiated risk adjusted returns that only active managers can provide. More broadly, with AMG's unique competitive advantages built over the last 2five years, we are confident that our business will generate long-term growth and shareholder value. ","AMG reported economic earnings per share of $3.16 for the third quarter. Net client cash outflows of $19.7 billion, were driven primarily by certain quantitative strategies across liquid alternatives and global equities, and included a single low fee redemption of $5 billion. As we said last quarter, and as Tom will discuss in more detail, it's important to note that these outflows, had a disproportionate impact on a reported AUM, relative to their more modest impact on our earnings. While we expect outflows in these quantitative strategies to continue in the near term, we anticipate that AMG\u2019s aggregate level of net outflows, will moderate in the fourth quarter, given a number of large institutional and some advisory wins, which are expected to fund by year end. ","Notwithstanding our near term flow results, we are well positioned for strong organic growth over time. AMG is diversified across a broad array of strategies and active management, including a significant position in product areas currently benefiting from secular client demand trends. I want to take a moment to discuss these growth areas within our alternatives, multi-asset and fixed income categories. The first is our illiquid managers, Pantheon, EIG and Baring Asia, which combined, account for nearly 20% of our run rate EBITDA, and are benefiting from record levels of client outpatient to private market. ","Of these, Pantheon is the largest and most diversified, generating two thirds of our EBITDA contribution from the liquid. Pantheon is a world class private market solutions provider, offering clients a diverse array of primaries, secondaries, and co-investment across private equity, infrastructure, real assets, and private debt on a global basis. This business continues to grow and its earnings stream is highly stable, given that nearly all of its revenue is fee based and tied to committed capital. ","In addition, EIG and Baring Asia offer unique exposure to fast growing segments within private markets. EIG is a leader in energy, renewables and infrastructure investing globally. While Baring Asia is one of the largest independent private equity and real estate firms, focused on Asian markets. In addition to fee related earnings, EIG and Baring Asia have significant upside potential from a growing performance fee opportunity. Collectively, our private markets affiliate manage nearly $100 billion in assets, and have generated over $20 billion of net inflows over the last two years. These businesses continue to drive innovation in new structures and solutions, making private markets more accessible to clients globally.","Second, within our multi-asset and fixed income categories, AMG is benefiting from strong secular tailwinds in wealth management space through four affiliates, Veritable, Baker Street, Welch & Forbes, and MyCIO that manage nearly $50 billion in ultra-high net worth assets. In addition to the growing concentration of investable assets in this area, wealth clients are actively transitioning from legacy manager selection model, towards holistic advice and portfolio construction. Our affiliate strong client relationships, solution orientation and focus on innovation, are driving consistent inflow and earnings stability. ","In addition, we have a meaningful exposure to a number of attractive areas across traditional and alternative fixed income, through both growth initiatives at existing affiliates such as GW&K and AQR, as well as new investments in market leading affiliates such as Capula and Garda, both specialists in relative value fixed income. In aggregate, traditional and alternative fixed income accounts for approximately $70 billion in assets, and provides another growth opportunity in area of strong client demand.","These growth opportunities in aggregate across private markets, wealth management and fixed income, account for approximately 30% of AMG\u2019s EBITDA today, and we expect these areas to play an even more significant role in our business over time. Our fundamental managers across active equities and liquid alternatives, including Genesis, Harding Loevner, Tweedy Browne, ValueAct, Veritas, and Yacktman, continue to build on their strong long-term track record, and have further distinguished themselves as asset dispersion has increased, particularly in less efficient markets such as small cap, emerging markets, and global equity. These strategies represent approximately 50% of our EBITDA. And given improving performance against the backdrop of volatile markets, alongside capacity reopening in a number of strategies, we are confident in our long-term organic growth prospects across our fundamental equities and liquid alternative manager.","And finally, we continue to believe strongly that quantitative strategies across long-only equity and liquid alternatives, play an important role in client portfolios, and we expect these strategies to be meaningful contributors to our organic growth profile over time. And while these products account for approximately 30% of our AUM today, given fee rates and ownership levels, they contribute only 10% to our EBITDA. ","Stepping back, our core strategy is to generate long-term value by investing in leading independent active managers, through a proven partnership approach, and allocating resources across AMG\u2019s unique opportunity set to the areas of highest growth and returns. This strategy has remained consistent, and in the quarter, we made good progress in executing against our strategic plans. Early in the quarter, we completed our investment in Garda, a specialist fixed income relative value manager, with an exceptional performance track record. And we are building momentum in our new investment activities across a broad range of prospective affiliates offering in-demand products. ","Our transaction pipeline includes a diverse range of high quality growing independent firms that are attracted to our model, and we are well positioned to structure partnerships that align affiliates to clients and shareholder. Unique ability to evolve and scale our business through new investments, without the risk or cost of integration, is a distinctive competitive advantage. We are dedicating significant resources to this effort, and I'm confident in our ability to continue to generate earnings growth and further diversify our business through additional accretive partnerships over time.","In addition, we continue to work closely with our affiliates by supporting them in the execution of their individual growth strategies, as they position their firms to capitalize on client demand trends. We have worked with our affiliates to seed and launch new products, and enter new regions and channels. And we have partnered together to evaluate and execute on potential lift outs and acquisition opportunities. In other cases, we are collaborating with affiliates that are facing headwinds, to help them position their businesses to achieve the best outcomes for their clients, as was the case with BlueMountain.","We are pleased to have had a good partnership with BlueMountain over the many years, and that we were able to work together to find the best path forward for their clients and employees, and for AMG shareholders. More broadly, consistent with the work we are doing with our affiliates, we are strongly focused on positioning AMG for future growth. And to that end, we have engaged in a number of strategic initiatives in the quarter, to align our resources and talent base with those areas where we can deliver scale and expertise to help our affiliates grow and diversify their businesses. ","For example, within our global distribution platform, we have adjusted coverage in certain regions, and reallocated resources to focus on the client that represent the largest growth opportunities for our business, including deploying additional resources towards building strategic relationships with leading institutions and intermediaries that are consolidating their relationships with skilled players like AMG. Leveraging our scale can also take different forms. In certain areas, delivering partnerships with industry leading service providers through our affiliates, can be more efficient and provide better outcomes, particularly where AMG\u2019s scale can improve pricing, access and service. For example, we recently partnered with ACA Compliance Group to support affiliates seeking to lower their compliance costs and access a greater breadth of services.","Finally, in the quarter, we have simplified certain elements of our business, reduced operational costs, and taken steps to optimize our footprint. These initiatives will free up approximately $20 million in capital annually, which we will redeploy towards higher growth opportunities in our business. Finally, our entrepreneurial culture remains critical to our success and our ability to adapt ahead of changing industry dynamics. While the environment has been challenging, difficult markets yield compelling opportunities, and we remain confident in the quality and profile of our existing affiliate base, and are actively positioning our business for future growth. AMG's business diversification and unique partnership structure, provides the resources and flexibility to execute on our growth strategy, while consistently returning capital to shareholders.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Tom to review the details of the quarter.","Tom Wojcik","Thanks, Jay, and good morning everyone. AMG reported stable economic earnings per share, and generated strong free cash flow in the third quarter. Despite industry volatility and near term net outflows, our unique business model continues to demonstrate resiliency, as we've positioned for future growth. Net client cash outflows of $19.7 billion, were concentrated in certain quantitative strategies across liquid alternatives and global equities. As Jay said, while outflows will likely continue in these strategies until performance stabilizes, we see fourth quarter aggregate net outflows moderating, notwithstanding year end seasonality, given the number of expected institutional and sub-advisory funding.","As we mentioned last quarter, it is important to understand the difference between flows and their impact on our financial results. In the current quarter, more than 75% of outflows were related to affiliates where we have a minority interest, or in low fee products that collectively make up only 10% of EBITDA, and therefore have a more modest impact on current and future earnings growth.","Turning to flows by asset class. In alternatives, we reported net outflows of 9 billion, driven by certain liquid alternative strategies, and partially offset by positive contributions from illiquid products. As noted, these outflows included a $5 billion low fee currency overlay redemption that was unrelated to performance. While long-term investment performance in liquid alternatives remained strong, with 65% of assets under management outperforming benchmarks over a five year period, more recent performance in this area has been mixed. Certain of our quantitative strategies have been impacted by value factor exposures, while others, for example at Winton and Systematica, are generating strong near term results.","We continue to see outperformance in our fundamental liquid alternatives book, including relative value fixed income strategies at Capula and Garda, both of which are generating solid organic growth, supported by client demand for these unique alpha streams. Overall, we expect liquid alternatives to be a positive contributor to our growth profile over time, as these strategies continue to play an important role in client portfolios. ","As Jay mentioned, we also see a steadily growing opportunity in illiquid alternatives, as our affiliates build on existing and new product capabilities, with ongoing fundraising at Pantheon, Baring Asia and EIG in the quarter. AMG\u2019s performance in this category is very strong, with 94% of our recent vintages outperforming benchmark on an IRR base. In global equities, consistent with industry headwinds facing the asset class in the third quarter, we saw net outflows of 7 billion across quantitative and fundamental strategies. Overall, our affiliates in this area continue to generate strong long-term performance, as evidenced by the reported increase in global equity AUM outperforming three and five year benchmarks. And particularly, in global fundamental equities, where 83% of AUM, is ahead of benchmark over a five year period.","Additionally, a number of our emerging market equity affiliates, have recently reopened capacity or launched new strategies, and we expect these categories to be a meaningful contributor to future growth. In US equities, net outflows were 5 billion, driven in part by institution insourcing third party mandates. While we saw improvement in the quarter, US equities performance continues to be impacted by our overall value buy. ","In multi-asset and in fixed income, we posted nearly 1 billion in net inflows, marking the 11th consecutive quarter of positive flows in this category. Flows were primarily driven by GW&K's municipal bond product, and supported by AQR\u2019s innovative systematic fixed income strategy, which continued to generate good flow momentum. This category also includes our wealth management affiliates, which are benefiting from the positive secular trends referenced previously. In aggregate, we remain confident that AMG is well positioned in high growth areas, supported by long-term client demand trends, as well as our affiliate\u2019s differentiated abilities to generate durable outflows.","Now turning to our financials. For the third quarter, economic earnings per share declined 8% year over year to $3.16, including $0.02 of net performance fees. Aggregate fees declined 12% to 1.1 billion, driven primarily by lower average AUM. Adjusted EBITDA declined 13% to 206.5 million. Relative to adjusted EBITDA, the decline in economic earnings per share of 8%, reflects a lower share count as a result of continued share repurchases. Jay discussed several initiatives we are taking to position our business for future growth, which in combination with the BlueMountain transaction, will have an impact on our fourth quarter financial results, and I'll touch on that in a moment. ","Turning to specific modeling items, for the third quarter, the ratio of adjusted EBITDA to average assets under management, was 10.8 basis points. Excluding performance fees, this ratio with 10.7 basis points. In the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA to average AUM, to be between 10.5 and 12.5 basis points. This range is pro forma for the removal of BlueMountain, and includes performance fees of $0.20 to $0.60 per share, as well as onetime costs related to the repositioning initiatives in the quarter, which we expect to have a $0.15 to $0.30 per share impact. ","Our shared interest expense was 19.5 million for the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we expect our share of interest expense to be approximately 19 million. Our share of reported amortization was 68.4 million for the third quarter, and was driven by recent elevated outflow levels, and included 52 million from affiliates accounted for under the equity method. We expect a similar level of amortization in the fourth quarter.","Our effective GAAP tax rate was 24.7%, and our cash tax rate was 21.6% for the third quarter. For modeling purposes, in the fourth quarter, we expect our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 25%, and we expect our cash tax rate to be impacted by a onetime benefit of approximately 50 million related to the BlueMountain transaction. Excluding this benefit, our normalized cash tax rate is expected to be approximately 20%. Intangible related deferred taxes were 3.5 million in the third quarter. And we expect intangible related deferred taxes for the fourth quarter, to be approximately 53 million, resulting from the one-time tax benefit I just mentioned. Other economic items were 1.2 million for the third quarter, and we expect that to be consistent in the fourth quarter. Our adjusted weighted average share count for the third quarter was 50.4 million, and we expect share count to be at or below 49 million shares for the fourth quarter.","And finally, turning to our balance sheet. During the quarter, we paid a $0.32 per share dividend, and repurchased $110 million in shares, reflecting our commitment to consistent capital return. Additionally, we completed our investment in Garda, and received approximately 90 million in proceeds relating to the BlueMountain transaction. We are targeting share repurchases of 100 million or more in the fourth quarter, subject to transaction activity and market conditions. ","Our business model generates significant and stable free cash flow, driven by the diversity and quality of our affiliate base, together with our unique revenue share structure, which limits AMG\u2019s exposure to affiliate level margin fluctuations. And we will continue to allocate capital to the areas of highest growth and return in our business. At the same time, we continue to maintain a prudent level of leverage, and have repositioned our balance sheet over the last several quarters, extending duration, while maintaining flexibility and capacity, to capitalize on growth opportunities, even in challenging markets.","Given AMG\u2019s combination of distinctive, independent affiliates that are well aligned against future client demand trends, our unique ability to make new investments that deliver both earnings and organic growth accretion, our stable free cash flow profile, and our flexible balance sheet, we are well positioned to create long-term value for our shareholders.","And with that, we'd be happy to open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Chris Shutler with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Shutler","Hey guys, good morning. Could you just talk about the new investment opportunities I guess in the more near term part of the pipeline for the opportunities that do feel more actionable? Are they - how would you, I guess, classify those small or large asset classes more proprietary versus formal processes, et cetera?","Jay Horgen","Great. Thank you, Chris. It\u2019s Jay. Yes. Let me just talk about our pipeline broadly and then give you some attributes of it today. Stepping back, our strategy of partnering with excellent firms, has and always will be a cornerstone of our growth strategy. Obviously that's still true today, and we look forward to continuing to grow our business through making new investments. The other thing I would just say is, the management team, including me, are spending more of our time on new investments. My background obviously is in M&A. it\u2019s something that I'm excited about and this extra effort and resources to the effort, we think will continue to drive additional transactions over time. ","We\u2019re building momentum in our pipeline. We see good diversity of types of businesses, all high quality, all attracted to our model. I would characterize it as global in nature. I would also characterize it as all sizes. What's interesting about investing in growing firms is, obviously it's not just the capital you put out in a single transaction. It\u2019s the growth that you can see from the business, both because these are entrepreneurial businesses, but also to the extent that they're in front of significant client demand trends that can add significant upside to these businesses. ","Our unique business model puts us in an enviable position where we can, through continued successful execution, scale our business with little or no integration risk, allowing our affiliates to remain autonomous to that unique competitive advantage of AMG. We can simultaneously grow our earnings and enhance our long-term growth profile through new investments. We can also invest alongside of our affiliates, both in distribution capabilities, but also invest in their individual growth opportunities through allocating capital to affiliates.","So all of those things come from a successful new investment strategy. And when we look at it today, we do see momentum in both the near intermediate and longer term pipeline. Most of what we are - most of what is in our pipeline today is proprietary, coming through long-term relationships that started many years ago, whether that was relationships with - that I started when I was in new investments, or with Sean or Nate. All of those relationships have been transitioned now.","And we see that the proprietary conversation that we're having, really is important to our process because we are sorting through due diligence, and we are also sorting through the partnership itself as we have these long-term relationships, get to see businesses evolve, and they get to understand our business model better. So when it comes time, and I think we've said this before, structure and pricing is only part of the partnership. It's really the long-term autonomy and alignment of interest that we offer through our model that really attracts these firms to us","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Craig Siegenthaler","Thanks. Good morning everyone. ","Jay Horgen","Morning. ","Tom Wojcik","Morning.","Craig Siegenthaler","So first just on flows, we know AMG tends to have tougher 4Q, just given several seasonal and cyclical factors. And I heard the commentary in the prepared remarks that net outflows showed moderate or improved. I wasn't sure if this meant total flows, or if this meant sort of core flows after backing out some of those seasonal and cyclical factors. ","Jay Horgen","So a good question, Craig, and we\u2019ll clarify. I\u2019ll let Tom take that one.","Tom Wojcik","Thanks, Craig. So maybe I'll just kind of recap flows overall in the quarter, and then try and give you a little bit of color on what we see on the horizon, and address your seasonality question. As you recall, coming into the quarter on our July call, we talked about where we saw flows landing overall in the third quarter. And really excluding that one large low fee currency overlay mandates that I referenced, outflows for the quarter were pretty flat against last quarter. Again, more than 75% of the outflows that we saw came from certain quant products, most notably in liquid alt absolute return strategies. And these flows were on a base that today is only contributing 10% of our EBITDA.","So given the combination of fee raise and ownership levels, and the affiliates from products that contributed the outflows, the impact on our earnings is generally going to be much less than what the headline flows suggest. We also continue to believe that quantitative strategies are going to be important in terms of their contribution to future growth, and we're already seeing very strong performance in certain affiliates in that area, including at Winton and Systematica. ","We did also see some outflows in the quarter in active equities, primarily driven by global risk off trends. But importantly overall, performance in these areas continued to strengthen, and we have more than 83% of our fundamental active equities products now outperforming benchmarks over the five year period. And we've also seen some incremental capacity come online recently in some of our high performing EM managers. So that's an area overall where we see a lot of future upside potential. ","In terms of upside, Jay also talked about illiquid alternatives, where we're seeing strong fundraising in Pantheon, EIG, and Baring Asia. And the combination of their performance and current high levels of client demand, continue to point to future growth in that area. And we saw 11 consecutive quarter of inflows in our multi-asset and fixed income area. To give you some color on the go forward, as we think about the flow picture near term, notwithstanding certain quant headwinds, we do have some sizable institutional and sub-advisory mandates that we expect to fund in the fourth quarter. We think that these will more than offset the normal seasonal headwinds that we see around tax loss selling, and around illiquid alternative lockup periods that hit toward the end of the year. ","Obviously we don't have perfect clarity on how those trends will play out, but broadly speaking, we feel pretty good about that. So taken together, we expect to see outflows moderate in the fourth quarter versus the levels we've seen the last couple of quarters. And importantly, going forward, we see very strong performance momentum in a number of areas in our business, and we continue to believe in the long-term organic growth profile of our platform, and the alignment that we're seeing between long-term secular client demand trends and our affiliates diverse product offerings. ","Jay Horgen","Yes. And let me just add, and that was good detail from Tom. I'll just summarize by saying, look, even beyond this next quarter, we see continued growth in private markets, wealth management and traditional and alternative fixed income, as we've said in our prepared remarks. In addition, I don't want to underscore - I do want to underscore that our performance is improving across our fundamental equity affiliates - equity and liquid alternative affiliates, as market volatility has increased. So we view this as a positive as we look forward to 2020. In aggregate between these growth opportunities and improving performance at our fundamental managers, we see that that represents about 90% of AMG\u2019s EBITDA. ","And then the last thing I would say is, when you look at the fourth quarter, and we talked about institutional and sub-advisory wins, some of those wins are in quantitative products. And so that's an important thing to note as we would say more broadly, these products are very important to client portfolios, and we're seeing that come through in the fourth quarter. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Alex Blostein","Hey everyone. Good morning to. A question for you guys around EBITDA yield on assets, both in the fourth quarter and over time. And I think Tom, in the guidance, you guys talked about 10.5 to 12.5, but that included performance fees and some of the reposition expenses. I think the long of that will be fairly close to the - kind of the base, just the management fee EBITDA yield. So I guess, part one, does that sound right? and two, given the kind of mix shift in the business between affiliates and products, and obviously the ownership stakes are different, how do you guys think about that, call it 10, 10.5 basis point yield evolving over the next of couple years","Tom Wojcik","Sure. So why don't I start, and then maybe Jay can address sort of the end of your question in terms of just the forward trajectory. First off, there were a couple of things when we talked about guidance in terms of that 10.5 to 12.5 basis point range, just to make sure that you have in your numbers. The first, as you mentioned, was a performance fee range of 20 basis points - of $0.20 to $0.60 per share. But we also gave you a little bit of color on our expectations around some expenses related to some of the strategic initiatives that Jay walked through. That will be about $0.15 to $0.30 per share. So that\u2019s embedded into that guidance. So you can kind of think about getting to more of a core run rate if you backed out some of those one-time expenses that we gave you color on. ","More broadly, if you actually look at kind of stability in our fee rates and sort of stability in that overall ratio, you have a handful of things that are going on. First, we've talked about the fact that our flows overall have really been influenced by areas where we have either lower fee products, or minority ownership positions. So while headline flow numbers have been rather sizable, the actual impact that we've been seeing on EBITDA, has been much less, particularly over the course of the last couple of quarters. ","And then as we go forward, we talked a lot about areas of our business that are very strong contributors to our EBITDA, that are either growing now in terms of the illiquid area, the wealth management area, and the fixed income areas that Jay spoke about, or that have very strong performance, and we believe are well positioned against client trends for future growth in the fundamental equity space.","Jay Horgen","Yes. the one part of your question that Tom picked up on, and I'll just state more flatly, which is, as we look forward, a growing contribution of our business is coming from the private market, the wealth management, multi-asset and fixed income areas. And that does not only put a level of stability on that number. Those businesses are growing. But also if you look past, or look into the kinds of assets that we're raising there, you see very long duration, very sticky asset levels. And so we do see that as a positive. So it\u2019s hard to capture it in just a number, but you're seeing the quality of that number go up.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Ben Herbert","Hi. Good morning. It's Ben Herbert on for Bill. Thanks for taking the question. Just was hoping we could go back to liquid alt and global equities, and definitely appreciate the commentary on you saw contribution. But can you just help us kind of ring-fence the remaining AUM at risk there, and maybe some sort of timeline on deposit outflow expectations there over kind of the near term horizon?","Jay Horgen","Yes. So thanks, Ben. Maybe I'll use that question to answer it in a lot of many different levels. So our efforts have been localized in the quantitative liquid alternatives, and long only equity quantitative strategies. And we did say, and I just mentioned a minute ago, that those products are seeing inflows in certain areas, especially with large institutional clients. Some of those wins are going to show up in our fourth quarter, and we mentioned that. So the attractiveness of these products are very much apparent in even our near term pipeline. ","Our largest manager of course of these types of strategies is AQR, and I'd like to just maybe address that more broadly. As I did last quarter, and I will say it again, and probably have to say it again in future quarters, AQR is very much a highly diversified business with 180 billion in AUM. Just to remind everyone that we made that initial investment with the business with 12 billion, and AQR has grown and diversified its business across several different distinctive business lines, including long only quantitative equities, systematic fixed income, absolute returns and total return alternative strategies. And within each business line, they have multiple products that address a range of client needs and risk tolerances.","Growing from 12 billion when we made the investment, to where we are today was not a straight line, as many of you know, and a number of you have the history here. We\u2019ve had a number of other periods of softness that only to come back stronger after that period of softness. We continue to believe in their ability to generate excellent long-term investment returns, given their proven culture and process, the strength of their leadership team, and their multi-decade track record of business success. So there's a lot to be positive here, and we are very much believe in that.","And as I said, the outflows have been localized in certain products, but when you get beyond those products, you see some really great performing products, including risk parity, defensive equities, fixed income. They continue to run their business at scale, and invest in the future. They have a number of opportunities that are emerging growth opportunities, including the fixed income strategy that I mentioned earlier, but also ESG and tax managed, tax aware strategies. These all have significant growth opportunities because the market opportunity is very scalable, and they are applying their technology and process to these markets. So we feel that the opportunity is significant, the option value is very high there. ","We're very much in support of what they're doing in their business. Cliff, John, David, and the rest of the senior partners, are focused and fully aligned as majority holders of the firm. It\u2019s a very entrepreneurial firm. We\u2019re proud to be aligned with these partners. So the last thing I would say is, we're very confident in their ability to manage their business, to sustain profitability and generate long-term growth. And as I said, we're very aligned with them. So longer term, we see growth returning to AQR in the near term even, but over the long-term especially.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please proceed with our question.","Dan Fannon","Thanks. Good morning. Just on the reallocation of resources, Jay, you walked through a number of things. It sounds like real estate consolidation, some compliance, things that you - services you can combine for your affiliates. But - and I think you said 20 million of capital that\u2019s freed up from this I guess. Is this going into new investments in terms of the priorities? I just want to kind of walk through that again in terms of areas that you specifically have changed, and then what you - where you're kind of reallocating those resources or capital to?","Jay Horgen","Yes. Thanks, Dan. Good question. Let me just start by stepping back and tell you what we're trying to do here. On the call, we sort of flatly stated our strategy is to generate long-term value by investing in leading active managers, as you know, through a proven partnership approach, and then allocating our resources to our opportunity set, to the areas of highest growth and return. There are a couple of areas that follow from this. There\u2019s a couple of points to follow from this. ","First, we're going to focus on our strengths and competitive position, which does include new investment. It\u2019s our primary use of capital. Second, we're going to continue to build and position our business for growth, which really means delivering our scale to our affiliates, either through the service offering of strategy distribution capital and other resources, or more resources in new investments and other growth areas. So really what we're doing is pivoting using our resources, our talent base, our entrepreneurial culture and aligning that with growth opportunities, which could include growth opportunities for existing affiliates, growth opportunities in new affiliates. ","All of that said, in periods where we have excess capital, we\u2019ll be disciplined in returning capital to shareholders. The one other thing I would say is, maybe just while we're on the point of capital, I might turn it to Tom and just talk a bit about our capital strategy.","Tom Wojcik","Sure. So if I think about capital management overall for AMG, as you know, the diversification and unique structure of our partnership agreement, enables us to generate significant and predictable unencumbered free cash flow. And we have a lot of flexibility in how we allocate that capital as a result. As Jay talked about a couple of times, we continue to believe that the highest and best use of our capital over the long-term, is through new investments, where our unique model enables us to partner with affiliates with little or no integration cost or risk. ","These investments deliver immediate diversification and earnings accretion, and simultaneously enhance our organic growth profile, including adding immediately saleable products in areas of future client demand. We\u2019ll also continue to return excess capital through share repurchases and dividends, as we've done in the past. And since 2017, we've reduced our diluted share count by more than 12%, in addition to paying out nearly 160 million in cumulative dividends. ","As I mentioned, we repurchased $110 million in shares in the third quarter, slightly ahead of the pace of the guidance we gave you in July. And I also noted that we expect to repurchase 100 million or more in shares in the fourth quarter, and that that amount could vary based on a variety of factors. As you know, we completed the BlueMountain transaction earlier this month, and received approximately 90 million in proceeds. And we have a lot of confidence in our business and our future growth trajectory. So we feel good about buying back our stock at current levels, and we'll continue to monitor deal activity, market conditions and leverage levels, as we execute on our capital plans going forward.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Mike Carrier","Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. Maybe just one more on M&A. can you provide us with an update, just on balance sheet capacity, just given some of the things that you guys have done over the past few years in deal activity hasn\u2019t been as active? And I guess more on the debt side, I guess just particularly given your equity evaluations in the industry being a little bit more challenged. And then also just priorities on the asset management side versus the wealth management side in terms of the types of transactions. Thanks. ","Tom Wojcik","So maybe I can start on the capacity side and then Jay can answer the second part of your question. So from a capacity perspective, as I just mentioned, our business generates a substantial amount of unencumbered free cash flow. So first and foremost, we have that as a resource as we're looking at new investment opportunities, and obviously looking to fund out of free cash flow. ","In addition, as you mentioned, we have taken actions over the course of the past several quarters and really over time, to optimize the shape of our balance sheet. We are an A rated company. We have $1.25 billion in revolver capacity, as well as in aftermarket ability to issue stock for transactions as well. So from a flexibility perspective, we have a tremendous amount of flexibility financially to be able to execute against the opportunities that we see in front of us.","Jay Horgen","Yes. the other part of your question, and I appreciate you asking another new investment question, because I do want to talk a bit about pricing in the market and then a bit more color on the types of businesses that could fill in from the - my prior answer. So just on pricing, and I think everyone knows this about our model is, we partner with affiliates, and we are only purchasing a portion of the equity at the time of the initial transaction, which really takes some of the weight off of pricing over longer, because over periods of time, the equity that is retained is expected to be worth more than the equity that we initially purchased.","We also try to find ways to structure transactions so that value really is a concept over time, and therefore the economics to AMG is consistent with an opportunity cost of capital that we see across our other opportunity set, including repurchasing our shares. So we really are investing in businesses through our partnership model, that cost of capital consistent or better, if you will, than our own repurchase of shares. ","As it relates to the types of transactions that we're looking at in our pipeline today, I would mention, similar to the growth opportunities we have in our business, we have a number of opportunities in the private market, the number of opportunities in fixed income alternatives. Those are businesses that are in our pipeline today, and we're moving them along. We also continue to look at emerging markets as an opportunity thematic, and ESG impact investing, again another growth area for us. And so we are seeing those types of opportunities again across the size range.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I\u2019ll turn the floor back to Mr. Horgen for any final comments.","Jay Horgen","Thank you all again for joining us this morning. And as you heard, through our unique business model, along with our ability to execute against our strategy, we are confident in our ability to generate long-term sustainable growth and create shareholder value over time. We look forward to speaking with you next quarter. ","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a wonderful day."],"246":["Affiliated Managers Group (NYSE:AMG) Q1 2012 Earnings Call May  1, 2012 11:00 AM ET","Executives","Alexandra Lynn - ","Sean M.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. ","It's now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Alexandra Lynn, Vice President of Corporate Strategy and Investor Relations for Affiliated Managers Group. Thank you. Ms. Lynn, you may begin.","Alexandra Lynn","Thank you for joining Affiliated Managers Group to discuss our results for the first quarter of 2012. In this conference call, certain matters discussed will constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected due to a number of factors including but not limited to those referenced in the company's Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call. AMG will provide on its website, at www.amg.com, a replay of the call and a copy of our announcement of our results for the quarter, as well as the reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. ","With us on the line to discuss the company's results for the quarter are Sean Healey, Chairman and CEO; Nate Dalton, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Jay Horgen, Chief Financial Officer. ","And now I'd like to turn the call over to Sean Healey.","Sean M. Healey","Thanks, Ally. Good morning, everyone. With Economic earnings per share of $1.58 for the first quarter, AMG is off to an excellent start in 2012 with strong execution across all aspects of our growth strategy, including 2 new Affiliate investments, strong performance of our products and outstanding organic growth from net client cash flows bringing our total pro forma assets under management to just under $400 billion. ","This was our eighth consecutive quarter of strong positive flows with over $7 billion in net inflows and $24 billion in the past 12 months. Our net inflows into a broad array of return-oriented strategies are particularly notable in a period were industry flows are being concentrated in fixed income and passive products. We continue to benefit from our strategic focus on highly attractive product areas, especially global and emerging market equities and alternatives, as well as the under -- the ongoing success of our global distribution strategy. ","Affiliates such as global and emerging market equity managers: Tweedy, Browne, Genesis, Harding Loevner, Trilogy and Artemis; and alternative firms: Pantheon, AQR, BlueMountain and ValueAct are all leaders in their respective disciplines, with outstanding track records of investment performance and prospects for continued organic growth. Our results reflect the strong -- the continued strong execution of our global distribution strategy as our Affiliates are winning new business and market share through both affiliate-level marketing efforts as well as by leveraging our global platform, which enhances the presence of our Affiliates across channels and geographies. ","Given the ongoing success of our strategy, we continue to build out our institutional and retail platforms worldwide through the opening of new offices and the addition of key personnel in existing coverage regions. As investor risk appetite inevitably returns around the world, our Affiliates are uniquely positioned to benefit, and we're seeing numerous opportunities for continued strong organic growth ahead. ","Turning to new investments. We're very pleased to have recently announced investments in 2 new Affiliates which are industry leaders in their respective areas. Yacktman Asset Management is an outstanding concentrated value equity manager with a tremendous long-term record of investment performance and industry accolades, having been named Morningstar Managers of the Year and nominated as Manager of the Decade. Don Yacktman, Stephen Yacktman and Jason Subotky are outstanding investors and have built a great business, and we're excited to welcome the team to our Affiliate group.","In addition, with our investment in Veritable, which is one of the nation's premier independent wealth managers, we successfully launched our wealth management business, AMG Wealth Partners, which extends AMG's proven partnership approach and succession planning solutions to outstanding wealth management firms. Partnering with a firm of Veritable's caliber is a key foundational step for our wealth management strategy, which is, of course, completely incremental to our opportunity to invest in additional boutique asset management firms. ","Finally, we continue to make progress across a broad range of new investment opportunities. In addition to ongoing divestiture activity from corporate sellers, we also believe that demographic trends, coupled with the prospect of rising tax rates, will result in increasing transaction activity among independent firms through the balance of 2012 and beyond. ","We believe that AMG is positioned as the partner of choice for outstanding boutique asset management and wealth management firms worldwide, and we're confident in our ability to materially enhance our earnings growth through accretive investments and additional Affiliates. ","With that, let me turn it to Nate who will discuss our Affiliates results in greater detail.","Nathaniel Dalton","Good morning, everyone. The outstanding investment performance of our Affiliate group, combined with significant flows, made for another good quarter. As Sean said, we continue to benefit from our emphasis on global and emerging markets equities and alternative products, and Affiliates specializing in these areas continue to not only perform extremely well, but also have outstanding business momentum. ","Notwithstanding industry trends, which continue to favor passive and fixed-income strategies, we generated strong flows across channels, especially in the product areas I just mentioned. Net client cash flows for the first quarter were $7.1 billion, with now 8 straight quarters of strong positive client cash flows. Going forward, the pipeline looks good, and we are confident in our ability to continue to generate strong organic growth. ","Now turning to investment performance. In a global development markets category, we had another strong quarter, with nearly all of our global managers delivering outperformance. Our leading managers with exceptional performance include Harding Loevner, Artemis, Trilogy and Third Avenue, with the majority of their global equity fund outperforming their respective benchmarks. Tweedy, Browne missed its benchmark for the quarter but remains well ahead for the 1-, 3- and 5-year periods. ","We had another strong quarter in the emerging markets category, with Trilogy and Harding Loevner outperforming their respective benchmarks by 100 basis points or more. The flagship strategy at Genesis underperformed for the first time in several quarters, but remained significantly ahead of its benchmark for the 1-, 3- and 5-year periods. ","Turning to our alternatives product category. We had good performance among many of our largest strategies. Highlights include excellent performance from firms such as First Quadrant, AQR and BlueMountain. At First Quadrant, the firm delivered outstanding performance across its suite of strategies from taxable currency products to their data-oriented products. In addition, AQR delivered strong performance among several strategies, including a global risk premium fund and diversified arbitrage funds. While BlueMountain, the firm's flagship credit alternatives fund, continued to outperform across all time periods. ","Turning to our U.S. equity products. Our Affiliates delivered very strong performance. On the value side, Systematic had good performance across its product set in the first quarter. While on the growth side, it was a strong quarter, with Frontier Capital and Friess Associates significantly outperforming their benchmarks across their respective products sets. TimesSquare had mixed performance, with small cap missing its benchmark, but with their mid cap and all cap products bidding for the quarter by 50 and 180 basis points, respectively. ","Now turning to flows. As I said, we had another quarter of good growth, with $7.1 billion in positive net client cash flows coming principally in the global equities and alternatives areas, as well as emerging markets equities. In terms of geography, we saw positive net flows in both the U.S. and globally. In terms of flows by channel, starting with the institutional channel, we had positive flows of approximately $5 billion. ","Looking at the flows in greater detail. It was a quarter where we had significant flows in global equity products and alternative strategies, as well as in the emerging markets equities, with notable contributions from Tweedy, Browne, Genesis, Harding Loevner, AQR, BlueMountain, ValueAct and Beutel Goodman. Now as we all would say, flows in the institutional channel are inherently lumpy, but we were very pleased with the breadth and diversity of the flows we're seeing. With respect to the pipeline, looking forward, we continue to see positive long-term trends in terms of one business, finals and RFPs. ","Moving to the Mutual Fund channel. We had positive flows of $1.4 billion. Here, we also continue the positive trends we've had over the past several quarters. From a product category standpoint, we had good flows into global and alternative strategies. The flows this quarter, once again, includes strong flows in the sub-advisories channel and especially for alternative products. ","Now as Sean mentioned, we're very excited about our new partnership with Yacktman. We have tremendous respect for the team and their investment discipline. As you may have noticed in the announcement, following the closing of the transaction, the Yacktman funds will become part of the Managers family of funds. Being the obvious, these funds are very highly regarded and have excellent long-term track records. And we look forward to working together with the team there. ","Now in our high net worth channel, flows were about $700 million for the quarter. We had positive flows at Gannett Welsh & Kotler, which continues to attract flows through our U.S. retail distribution platform,  as well as Harding Loevner and Third Avenue. Overall, we continue to make very good progress with our global distribution strategy. We are focusing on expanding our presence in key global financial centers, as well as attracting additional world-class sales, marketing and client service talent to help expand in the regions where we already have a strong presence. ","For example, as we mentioned in the release, we opened our Dubai office at the beginning of the quarter allowing us to deepen our presence in the Middle East. Now fundamentally, we're very pleased with the contribution of our distribution teams to our industry-leading flows. As you've heard us say before, we remain focused on building distribution capabilities that not only can be successful in the current market environment, but that also enable us to capitalize on the even larger opportunity when some of the macro trends turn back to return-oriented assets. ","In addition to the Institutional business we're building in key global financial centers around the world, we also have a retail sub-advisory platform here in the U.S. through Managers Investment Group. And as we look ahead, we see significant opportunities to grow that business as well. ","From a product standpoint, we will continue to focus on those areas of the market where we are already seeing strong demand, including liquid alternatives, but also for good performing global and emerging markets equities. And we continue to be focused on building out the infrastructure to capitalize on the inevitable return to performance-oriented strategies. Finally, we see a lot of synergies between what we're doing in the global institutional side and the U.S. sub-advisory and retail business. And we've begun to realize these synergies with the teams working together even more closely. ","Looking ahead, we are uniquely well positioned for continued excellent long-term growth, with the combination of outstanding performance-oriented boutiques and increasingly, the scope and scale in the marketplace of a $400 billion diversified asset management firm where that scale is useful. ","And with that, I'd turn it to Jay to discuss the financials.","Jay C. Horgen","Thank you, Nate. We are again pleased with our industry-leading organic growth, as well as the continued successful execution of our new investment growth strategy. The newly announced partnerships in Veritable and Yacktman, which as with all of our new investments, we expect to be immediately accretive. As you saw on the release, we reported Economic earnings per share of $1.58 for the first quarter, with performance fees contributing $0.01. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings of $0.71 per share. ","The ratio of our EBITDA contribution to end-of-period assets under management was about 15 basis points for the first quarter. We expect this ratio to remain at approximately this level for the second and third quarters, reflecting both our business mix and the expected closings of our 2 new investments. And in the fourth quarter, we expect this ratio to trend upward, with a reasonable assumption for performance fees. ","Holding company expenses were approximately $22 million in the first quarter, and we expect them to increase modestly to $23.5 million per quarter for the remainder of the year, primarily reflecting fund merger and related deal costs at Yacktman and Veritable. ","With regards to our taxes, our effective GAAP tax rate for the first quarter was 35.7%, and our cash tax rate was 13.7%.  For modeling purposes, we expect our GAAP tax rate to be about 35% going forward, and we expect our cash tax rate to be approximately 13% for the second quarter and then to trend upward during the remainder of 2012 with organic growth and performance fees. Intangible-related deferred taxes were $9.9 million in the first quarter, and going forward, we expect intangible-related deferred taxes to remain at approximately this level. ","With reported amortization of intangible assets of $30.4 million, our share was $26.8 million, and together with $8.2 million of amortization from Affiliates accounted for under the equity method, AMG's controlling interest portion of amortization was $35 million. We expect our amortization to remain at this level going forward.","For the first quarter, our portion of the total interest expense was $19.6 million, which included noncash imputed interest of $1 million pretax. We expect our total interest expense to remain at approximately this level for the second quarter. ","Turning to our balance sheet. We expect to close Veritable at the end of the second quarter and Yacktman in the middle of the third quarter. These transactions will be funded with a combination of borrowings under our revolver and available cash, leaving us with ample capacity to continue to execute on our new investment growth strategy. ","Now turning to guidance. We are raising our 2012 guidance as we expect Economic earnings per share to be in the range of $7 to $7.70. This range includes the partial year impact of our new investments in Veritable and Yacktman, net of fund merger and related deal costs. Our guidance also assumes our normal convention of actual market through yesterday, with 2% quarterly growth beginning in the third quarter and a weighted average share count of 53 million shares. ","The lower end of our 2012 guidance includes a modest contribution from performance fees and organic growth, while the upper end of the range assumes a more robust contribution for performance fees and flow expectation. As always, these assumptions do not include earnings from future new investments other than Yacktman and Veritable and are based on our current expectation of Affiliate growth rates in performance and the mix of our Affiliate contribution to our earnings. Of course, substantial changes in markets and the earnings contribution of our Affiliates would impact these expectations. ","Now we will be happy to answer questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Daniel Fannon of Jefferies & Company.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Nate, just to talk more about the flows and kind of the context. It seems like obviously a very good quarter for flows, and then the backlog still looks good. Is there a way to kind of characterize that maybe versus a year ago or even last quarter? Just kind of give us some context.","Nathaniel Dalton","Sure. So I think -- broadly, I think you captured it, which is we've had a series of pretty good quarters here from a flow standpoint sort of in a range. I think if you looked at the pipeline today maybe versus last quarter and obvious caveat supply right early in the quarter, all that kind of stuff. But if you look at the pipeline this quarter versus last, I'd say it's running about the same. I mean there's a lot of -- obviously, a lot of moving parts to it. But I'm sort of describing across our fees, finals and all that, as well as one business. And I'd say probably it looks about the same.","Daniel Thomas Fannon - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess on the performance fee outlook, Jay, if you could talk and also kind of characterize that. I guess, maybe we started out last year with the markets pretty strong or we've seen that start again this year. I guess, is it -- as you look at kind of the potential for 2012 and the contribution from performance fees, how diverse is that? And I guess, is it much different than where we were a year ago?","Jay C. Horgen","Sure, Dan. So our guidance of $7 to $7.70 really reflects primarily the update to market and flows as well as the partial impact -- partial year impact of deals. There is no fundamental change in the view on performance fees within the model of the guidance that's given, mainly because it's still early in the year. Having said that, we see great diversity in our performance fee opportunity, and we are experiencing flows into performance fee products. So we feel good about the prospects there.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","When you look at the pipeline for new business, I'm just sort of curious. Is there any shift in the appetite in terms of what you're seeing? Or is it still heavily centered on the emerging market and the alternative platform?","Sean M. Healey","Yes, I think the 3 buckets we talked about as places we've seen strong demand and continue to see strong demand are the 2 you mentioned, the alternatives and emerging markets, but also the global equities category, we are seeing strong demand. I think some of that is sort of at a macro level, and then I think some of it is just we have some very good products that we're bringing into new geography and channels. So I'd say those 3 buckets, we continue to see strong demand. And then the other things, places like U.S. equity kinds of products, it is more sort of episodic or idiosyncratic where we see demand. But those 3 buckets: global, emerging markets and alternatives the places we've been seeing strong demand and continued to.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","The reason I was asking is I think last call you mentioned that 100% of volume came from outside the United States, and this quarter, in your prepared remark you said it was both U.S. and non-U.S. So apologize for running on the question.","Sean M. Healey","No, no, no. Maybe let me clarify. So I think what I just described was product categories and product geography, meaning where the flows are coming from. You're right, last quarter we did say more than 100% were outside the U.S. in terms of where the clients' assets are located. This quarter, that was more balanced coming both outside the U.S. and also good -- some good flows in the U.S. But those flows in the U.S. tended to be in those product categories I mentioned, global, emerging markets and alternatives.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's very helpful. And then just on the deal front, obviously, you had 2 behind you now. And Sean, you mentioned that there's material opportunity until '12 and '13. Where are we are in terms of the wealth succession? Is the deal patter still pretty high? Or now with these 2 deals behind you, are things a little bit cooling off but yet the long-term pipeline is still pretty healthy?","Sean M. Healey","Well, I would say we don't expect to announce a deal a month, but we feel very good about the pipeline and all of the underlying trends that we've been describing are very much in place: very favorable M&A environment, where our competitive position is stronger than ever; ongoing divestiture activity, especially by European banks, but not exclusively; and then, this wave of demographically-driven succession transactions, which we are seeing now and we expect to continue for the medium term at least. And that reflects simple demographics, lots of great firms where the founding principals are nearing retirement age and where they're looking to execute a transaction which helps manage the firm's succession and transition issues and provide a solution. And I think the prospect of rising tax rates is an additional catalyst to accelerate some of those transactions. But overall it continues to be a very, very strong pipeline.","Operator","Our next question will comes from the line of Michael Kim with Sandler O'Neill.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Just a follow-up on the deal pipeline. Can you just talk about the extent to which you're really starting to leverage the global distribution platform as it relates to sourcing deals? So if you think about Yacktman, obviously, it had scale, differentiated investment approach and was generating very strong flows and very strong investment performance track records. So how much of a role did that opportunity to really broaden out their distribution reach plan to the partnership because it seems like they were obviously doing very well on their own?","Sean M. Healey","Sure. I would say prospectively, it's hard to measure, but I think the addition of or the enhancement to our global distribution capability, both institutionally and increasingly as Nate said, on a retail basis through retail channels is helpful. It's never going to be a reason that somebody signs up with us, but the tone and tenor of the conversations that we have with new investment prospects are quite different than they were, let's say, 5 years ago where people really -- the results of our distribution and the strength of our organic growth is obvious. I mean, we're generating industry-leading organic growth going on 2 years now. And so it's not just investors that are nosing that prospect, prospective Affiliates appreciate the opportunity. But in the event, we're always partnering with outstanding firms that are generating strong growth. They believe in themselves. They want to keep direct equity in their own firm. And so the opportunity to enhance their growth is always viewed as incremental. So helpful but not essential, I think. We're going to have a great long-term run here of new investment opportunities, which hopefully we can execute on, and the track record is incredibly important to that but our distribution is also helpful.","Michael S. Kim - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division","Got it. And then, maybe a question for Jay. I know you still have ample capacity on the revolver and continue to generate a lot of free cash, but now that you're going to put some capital work related to the new 2 recent transactions, if more deals were to materialize over the course of rest of the year, how would you be thinking about funding any incremental transactions?","Jay C. Horgen","So Michael, we do have ample capacity even after these transactions. We have about $150 million of holding company cash, in addition to the revolver as you mentioned. Some of it would depend on timing, but I don't think we have any constraint with respect to funding transactions, whether it's on our current revolver or it's in the capital markets transaction.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Shutler with William Blair.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Nate talked about the fact that you see a lot of untapped opportunities with Managers Investment Group. So maybe you could just expand on that a bit and give us a few examples.","Nathaniel Dalton","Sure. So I think we talked about the opportunities with Managers Investment Group in a couple of different dimensions, right? So one is the opportunity to keep executing or to, honestly, improve execution in the current market environment. So I think there's some product categories, global and emerging, we talked about liquid alternatives is a place where we are really distinguishing ourselves. Both First Quadrant as well as AQR are doing well there, both on their own and through Managers Investment Group. There's an opportunity to continue to do more there in product development and also, to bring the expertise we're developing with liquid alternatives there to a broader set of products. As you know, we have a wide array of alternative products. So that's one sort of example of this specific alternative -- specific opportunity. There are also sort of channels where I think we could be -- we could certainly build a much stronger presence, the D.C. channel is one. Some of our Affiliates participate there. We do some work there with our Affiliates through Managers Investment Group. But honestly, there's a relatively large opportunity that we haven't yet built out there. And there's some natural leverage between the work we do elsewhere, both at Affiliates and then also our distribution in terms of firms on ITB [ph] side, in terms of what we're doing with consultant sides. There's a bunch of leverage opportunities in there, and that I think I mentioned in the prepared remarks. But broadly, there's a real opportunity to capture the synergies of and leverage between what we're doing in global institutional and the relationships we're building with consultants and others there. And what we're doing in the retail market in the U.S. So I hope that gives you some flavor both short-term and long-term.","Sean M. Healey","And I would just add to that, Chris. As we all know retail flow trends in the U.S. continue to be very strongly in favor of passive and fixed-income products. Active equities continue to be in net redemption, and all of us in the industry are anticipating that there will be a re-risking by U.S.retail and I would say also institutional investors. But we really haven't seen that yet, and so the strong traction and good results that we're really already seeing in the retail space through the managers' platform and as we build out further the capabilities is all sort of against a difficult backdrop. And to the extent and the point that we see substantial re-risking and flows into return-oriented product, we think we're very, very well positioned for that. And all of that will be highly incremental to what we're seeing so far.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay, great. And then, in terms of the pipeline, maybe just zeroing in on the wealth management opportunity for second. I'm just wondering, after Veritable, has that deal generated more inbound calls from prospective Affiliates? Just what -- any kind of color you can provide on what's happened since that deal was announced?","Sean M. Healey","Well, there's no question that it has generated some inbound calls and more importantly, with the really high-quality firms that are out there that -- where we've been working to build relationships. The decision by a firm, the quality of Veritable, which clearly could have chosen from anybody they wanted, would be interested insisted with partnering with Veritable. Choosing AMG Wealth Partners is such a ratification of the quality of our team and of our approach that it is incredibly valuable and a great calling card to go out and continue and deepen conversations with firms, which, in almost all cases, have the same kind of inevitable demographically-driven succession needs  that independent boutique asset management firms do. So we're very well-positioned looking forward, and there's no question that the Veritable investment was a huge help, but they've got a great pipeline going.","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Great. And I just -- one final housekeeping questions on the flows. I apologize if I missed this in the prepared remarks. But were there any noticeable client concentration issues in the flows of the quarter?","Nathaniel Dalton","I think the only ones are the ones you would -- do you mean specific large mandate that moved it?","Christopher Shutler - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Yes, that exactly.","Nathaniel Dalton","Nothing I think I would call out. No, nothing at all.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Paris with Barrington Research.","Alexander P. Paris - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of follow-up questions, diving a little deeper. On flows for example, we all know what the flows have been like in U.S. actively managed equities over the last year. And just trying to identify maybe a bottom at some point before investors begin to re-risk their portfolios. What do gross inflows look like? Have they been improving in your experience? Or similarly, what about growth outflows, has that flowed at all?","Nathaniel Dalton","So let me do this in 2 parts, right? So I think the first part is, as you heard Sean say, we think there is a bottom. We actually think we are approaching the bottom. But calling a specific time, we think it's a tranche here, there or the other place. I think it's just incredibly difficult to do, and it hasn't really just -- you sort of mentioned the last year -- you called out the last year, but it's been much longer. I mean, it's been several years now of that trend. So that's the first that I'd say. The second in terms of our experience, I think the challenge for us is we end up seeing our flows -- end up being determined much more by the 2 things I talked about before, which is one, obviously the performance of the specific firm; and then two, the ability to marry that performance with distribution which is bringing it into places where it will be able to sold. I mean, look, a perfect example is you have firm like Yacktman, which is doing very well and is gathering shares -- is taking market share against that backdrop you described. So our view is it's possible for -- it's demonstrably possible for excellent performing boutiques in the U.S. equity space to still do well. But I think it's very hard to call it a turn.","Sean M. Healey","Yes, and it's impossible to call it. But there's no question that when it occurs, which to us all seems inevitable, setting aside the precise timing. Because individuals and more broadly, institutions can't fund their retirement needs on the levels of returns that they're getting now. And over time, the best actively managed firms, the alpha generating firms, are going to be back in favor. So we're getting this traction and good results, the share gains that Nate is describing. But there's no question that when there is broad return to risk assets, that we'll get a disproportionate benefit prospectively so long as we're continuing to execute and generate good performance.","Alexander P. Paris - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then one other question regarding the investment pipeline. You've made 2 larger acquisitions year-to-date putting to work $350 million or more based on the typical multiples that we've seen in the past. And I think at some point, you had said either on the conference call or at a conference appearance that you thought that you could potentially put to work $400 million to $500 million this year. The first  2 acquisitions were domestic, and you have historically said that the focus of your activity has been on international and alternatives. Qualitatively, what does the pipeline look like? Are we looking more at national acquisitions or all  of the above?","Sean M. Healey","Well first, I'm certain that I was careful to not give a specific target for any given year because it's not something that is knowable and not part of what our guidance is. I think there is -- if you look back to a couple of years ago, where we had a good run of new investments where we've put $1.5 billion to work in about 18 months, and I described that maybe as a period that wasn't so unusual or that  wasn't impossible to think of that kind of a level of activity prospectively. But we don't guide year-to-year in terms of the magnitude of new investments that we anticipate. That said, the opportunity is tremendously attractive. As I indicated earlier, our competitive position remains extremely strong, really better than ever. And the range of new investment opportunities is broader than ever. So we've got firms around the world that need succession and transition solutions. Those include not just traditional firms in the U.S. but really on a global basis, and it includes increasingly alternative firms. Hedge fund firms which 5 years ago, 7 years ago one couldn't even imagine as enduring franchises, now they're really global scale and institutional quality firms. And the founding principals are in their 50s and anticipating retirement. So alternative firms represent an increasing opportunity set. Wealth management firms, as we've discussed. Again, a new and very large potential opportunity set completely incremental to what we've been doing. And then finally, given all of the challenges in the world that the banks and other financial services firms are facing, we're seeing still a large number of divestiture opportunities, which, for a small subset of those opportunities, represent attractive new investment candidates for us. So put all that together, we're quite optimistic about our ability to generate strong incremental growth from new investments. And that's, as I said in the prepared remarks, through the balance of 2012 and beyond, we view it as a long-term opportunity for us.","Alexander P. Paris - Barrington Research Associates, Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just one last related question. With the platform of Wealth Partners and the acquisition of Veritable, is it possible that we'll see smaller acquisitions which you might have called an Affiliate development acquisition in years past?","Sean M. Healey","Sure. There's no question that the universe of wealth management firms represents, in the main, firms which are relatively smaller than the asset management firms, which we would regard as the sort of prime prospects for us to make investments -- Affiliate investments in asset management firms. That said, the wealth management firms that we will look to invest in are still going to be substantial multibillion-dollar firms, and so they're not going to be -- they'll be smaller but not small transactions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Marc Irizarry with Goldman Sachs.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sean, this may be a tough one to answer. But I mean, are you sensing capitulation from some of the U.S-focused managers that are in the pipeline such that maybe the active world is under a bit more pressure that maybe they're more likely to seek an alternative or planned succession now versus waiting?","Sean M. Healey","Here's what I would say to that, Mark. Those firms -- whether they're U.S. equity managers or some other product set, those firms which are headed towards capitulation, they're not the firms that were looking to invest in. So that may be true broadly for a bunch of firms, but the prospects that are most attractive to us for new investments are great firms generating strong organic growth which includes, as Nate has observed, taking market share but also position in products which are generating growth more broadly.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Right. And then what does that imply then maybe for the multiples and sort of the bid-asked on some of the businesses that you like?","Sean M. Healey","The multiples are really not that changed. I mean, there's no question that relative to a decade ago when there were banks and insurance companies who, for whatever reason, were actively seeking to acquire boutique asset management firms that the environment is much more attractive for buyers. As a general matter. But for us, we have been very consistent over time in the pricing that we pay for investments in outstanding firms, and that really hasn't changed. I think to the extent that we can be opportunistic in divestiture settings where we're partnering with management and buying out their business from a larger company, then sure, we'll seek those price those as aggressively as we can, although we also want to be viewed as an attractive counterparty by those banks and I think have been. So on an overall basis, it's really a consistent discipline and one that allows for us to make investments where we think we're paying a fair price. But we're getting a very attractive return and very substantial accretion for our investors.","Marc S. Irizarry - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just, Jay, on the EBITDA contribution guidance, I guess there is some seasonality there. But it did strike me as the EBITDA contribution was maybe a bit lower this quarter. Anything to infer there? You know it's obviously a bit difficult to get some of the Affiliate level profitability, if you will. But anything behind that?","Jay C. Horgen","No, there isn't. If you look at our base business, we're pretty much, year-over-year, flat, $1.57, excluding performance fees. On the EBITDA contribution, the 15 basis points just reflects the math associated with the contribution. And I think as you look forward, you'll see it tick up as we get through the year as we grow and we see performance fees.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Cynthia Mayer with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","A couple of questions. One is I guess it looked like you said you had flows from a broad number of Affiliates. But I'm just wondering if you could give us a sense of what percentage are from minority-owned Affiliates versus majority. any trends there?","Nathaniel Dalton","Okay. Yes, so I'll start with that. I think there definitely was good flows through minority firms, which sort of again stands to reason because if you think about the broad set of alternative firms, a number of alternative firms -- most of our alternative forms -- many of the most of our alternative firms fall there, and that is an area where we've been seeing good growth. So whether you think about a BlueMountain or a ValueAct or an AQR those are firms we have been all seeing good growth. So I think that's the way to answer it. There's definitely good flows coming through there.","Sean M. Healey","But I think what's also notable is that the very large majority, whether you take our largest 10 Affiliates including both traditional and alternative firms or our entire Affiliate mix, the large majority are seeing positive flows.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Great, okay. And then, last year's second quarter you had pretty hefty performance fees, I think. Could you talk a little about how this second quarter is shaping up versus last year?","Jay C. Horgen","On performance fees, Cynthia, I think, of course they're hard to predict. We do have some seasonality in the second quarter where we, oftentimes, will see a bit more performance fee contribution. Again, it's still unknown to us, but we do think that the performance fee opportunity this year is in line overall with that 5% to 10% of our earnings guidance that we give and candidly, given the flows in the alternative products that Nate just described, we think that opportunity, depending on how the year plays out, could be even better.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then let's see, do you have -- I don't know if you mentioned this, but do you have average AUM particularly for funds? And I'm wondering if you could just talk about any trends you're seeing in terms of the average fee rates in funds and maybe how Yacktman would affect that?","Jay C. Horgen","So yes, you're right. In the 10-Q, we put, I guess, our billable rates, our average fee rates. We have -- in total, our average fee rates have really not changed materially. I think they're kind of in that single plus 1%, minus 1% across all of the segments. Gosh, you're testing me a little bit here. I think that Yacktman at kind of 70-ish basis points coming in is consistent with our mutual fund fee rates, and I don't think it'll change it much.","Cynthia Mayer - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And last one is maybe just how do you feel about making more minority investments? Or you must be looking for majority or how do you feel about the mix of that overall?","Jay C. Horgen","We think we're in a great position. There's certainly plenty of room for additional investments in alternative firms. We've talked -- you probably heard me talk at conferences and meetings about being sensitive to some upper limit of exposure to performance fee products, but we are a long way from that. And I think to the extent that we have a large business generating strong organic growth and a very substantial new investment opportunity set, I think that there's plenty of room for investments in great alternative firms, and there are a whole bunch out there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Lee with Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I had a question on Pantheon, I guess, one of the few alternative managers you haven't talked about today. And could you maybe update us at all kind of what you're seeing there in terms of there ? I know it's hard to get too specific, but I'm assuming that they're out there fundraising. I don't know to what extent they may have some existing committed capital that's not showing up in the AUM yet. But any kind of color you can provide on your progress there and kind of dry powder that they may be sitting on?","Nathaniel Dalton","Sure. I'll try a little bit. And then I -- sort of one little caveat here which will probably answer a part of your question. They are in the market right now with their group of primary funds, which includes the other traditional primary funds, as well as some carve-out funds. They're actively marketing, which probably implies someone as for how much detail we can give right now. ","But I guess, I'll say a couple of things, right, which is overall, they are looking at some upcoming closes in the primary funds. This is -- I'll talk about the fundraising first, and then dry powder second. They are looking at some upcoming closes in the primary funds. One thing that I think is an evolution -- I don't think you need to ask, but if you think about sort of the shape of that business, the growth, a lot of growth is coming alongside the funds in sort of  separate accounts. And so they are actively out there with that as well. And I think in this quarter, they had some couple of separate account closes sort of modest sizes but had a couple of separate account closes. So I think that's sort of one way to think about it which is they're active in the market. There are some upcoming closes. And they're pretty consistently active in the market now on the separate account side. And then in terms of dry powder, they certainly do still have some dry powder, both on the primary side but certainly on the secondary fund side, both funds and separate accounts from things they've raised not  all that long ago, sort of last year.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then, I'm just curious. Maybe a question for Sean on the divestiture front. Obviously, we all read about and you talk about a lot of the opportunities there and lot of financial, you fee advantage and particularly looking to divest things. But it doesn't seem like at least the last year so there's been too much movement there. Is there -- just curious. Are you seeing that there's -- for all the talk of it, there's maybe sellers' expectations are out of whack with kind of people like yourselves that are willing to pay? Or is it really just dealing with these large organizations, there's just a slow grind and takes forever to get things done? Or kind of why do you think you haven't seen kind of a little more activity to date?","Sean M. Healey","It's probably a mix of everything you said. I don't think we're seeing fire sales, right? So there's no great urgency on the part of most of these organizations. Many potential divestitures are discussed, and then they're not necessarily followed through with an active process. And then, finally for us, only a small subset of the firms that are being divested represent really appropriate and attractive investment prospects. ","But I think it's a real trend, and I would be surprised if we don't see a significant level of activity through the balance of this year.","Robert Lee - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","All right, great. And just one last question on the wealth management initiative. Can you talk a little bit about what type of infrastructure you've built or you think you need to build to kind of attract additional wealth managers? I mean, if you think of what you've done on the asset management side, whether it's taking over some compliance functions for some Affiliates or obviously the distribution initiatives, I mean, do you have -- what are the plans on the wealth management side? And what do you think you need to add there to kind of attract additional managers?","Sean M. Healey","Well, I would say that there's no need to build infrastructure in order to attract excellent prospects. If you think about AMG, we're coming up on our 20th anniversary as a company. And the global distribution initiative is just 5 years old, and the centralized compliance opportunity as a capability is maybe only a few years older than that. And we continue to build out additional capabilities as scale and complexity of the world create new needs or new imperatives. But we managed to do just fine. And I would say we continue -- to reflect back to an earlier question, we continue to find the very best firms are strong believers in their own growth prospects and the continuation of an excellent performance track record and a continued generation of strong organic growth from net flows. And so their primary focus is on maintaining direct equity exposure to their business and getting, of course, a measure of liquidity and a solution to their succession and transition needs. And all the while, wanting very much to have a partner that is supportive and helpful, but most importantly doesn't at all distract from or disrupt their unique operating investment culture and the great momentum that they had. So that is true still today for asset management prospects, and it's definitely true for wealth management prospects. So I know that the team is working on an array of capabilities, that they will work to put in place -- work with their wealth Affiliates to put in place over time. They'll be different from what we've done and will do in the asset management space. But we're still very early days. And I would say that over time, we continue to be very optimistic about their prospects for -- or say, broadly our prospects for continued new investment activity independent of whatever capabilities that we build. And as we build in these capabilities, we'll talk about them, but they're not being held back at all so far.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Greggory Warren with MorningStar Capital.","Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","The thing about Yacktman is it's generally a pretty solid pickup from our point of view. Could you guys walk through some of the aspects of how you came across the firm, how it came across the radar? Was this more a peer succession planning situation? Or was it a global distribution move for Yacktman? And then, could you talk a little bit more about what really made the decision for you guys because realistically this doesn't fall into 1 of the 3 buckets that you've doing deals in more recently, being alternative assets, global equities, emerging markets?","Sean M. Healey","So we knew the Yacktman team. I mean, everybody in the boutique asset management space and in the retail space, generally in the U.S. would know the Yacktman firm. And we have worked to build a relationship. I think, in this setting, they called us but it was a product of a relationship, and it very much fits within mold of our other new investments. As I said earlier, I think our global distribution capabilities were interesting and on the margin attractive. But what was most essential to the Yacktman team is to find a partner that had a long track record of successful partnerships and one that would allow them to continue to do what they're doing and help them in providing a solution to succession and transition, not only get a measure of liquidity for the senior partners but build out the equity incentive structure in the firm so that they can continue to have the outstanding franchise that they built, endure and grow over time. And it's very much like that. Would you add anything to that, Jay?","Jay C. Horgen","No, I think that's just right, Sean. I think the one obvious thing about Yacktman is that they run a more concentrated portfolio that has outperformed over long periods of time. And they're taking share away from index-sensitive funds, and so I think that's another aspect that we liked. And so that fits into the category boutiques that can generate alpha.","Sean M. Healey","Yes, and we've never said that we have an aversion to a certain product or another within the return-oriented product space. And I remember when we were on our IPO roadshow and we just made an investment in Tweedy, Browne, everybody wanted us to say that we'd never do another value manager because that wasn't fashionable back in the day. And I said then, if a clone of Tweedy, Browne walked in today, we'd happily make the investment again. And so outstanding firms that generate alpha for their clients and have great long-term organic growth track records and ongoing prospects, they're attractive to us whatever the product set.","Greggory Warren - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I think it's a great pickup overall. You'd mentioned that it was probably going to close some time in the third quarter. Have you guys seen any interest yet from clients as potentially picking up investments in the fund when it comes live?","Sean M. Healey","Just on the timing, we do expect middle of the third quarter. And we are merging the funds into the managers group of funds, so it's going to take a little longer than a typical deal. And that proxy is process is underway.","Jay C. Horgen","And then on the demand side, we have -- it's still all sort of specific rather than broad trend. But we've absolutely seen existing client relationships through global distribution where people have noticed pickup and have started to talk about it.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a follow-up. I think there's been some discourse back and forth during the call. But as you think about incremental growths on the Affiliates on the flow level, is it accretive or dilutive to your earnings growth for the company?","Sean M. Healey","I'm not sure I'm tracking your question. The organic growth from net flows is terrific and more of it is better, and I like that we don't have to pay for it. So it's all good. I think we must be missing the thrust of your question though, Bill.","William R. Katz - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I think there's some concern from investors as you look at the equity-based earnings level of the company whereas you have great ownership, the organic growth hasn't been as robust as in some of the minority stakes. And I've gotten that question quite a bit. So just like curious, if you look about -- and I think it goes to EBITDA to AUM contribution discussion earlier. Just as you think about growth from whether AQR or Brandywine or BlueMountain I should say or from Tweedy  or Third Avenue, as you think about the incremental growth, is that accretive to cash earnings -- Economic earnings leverage? Or is it more of a volume versus margin discussion at this point?","Sean M. Healey","Well, there's no question that it's all accretive. So our peer companies that are getting flows into lower fee products like fixed income and passive products, I'm sure they're still happy to get them. And for us, all of our flows are into return-oriented products where we're getting higher levels of fee, including for alternative products, the opportunity for performance fees. That said, of course, as we've discussed even on this call, we own less of the -- in the main deal alternative firms. I would observed that one of the firms that continues to be extraordinarily successful and was MorningStar's International-Stock Manager of the Year is Tweedy, Browne where our ownership and their fee levels is at the higher ends, so each dollar of new money into Tweedy is extremely valuable to us. But it doesn't mean that the flows into alternative firms isn't also extremely valuable, including with the  added possibility of performance fees. So we are quite pleased with the product sets that we have, including the addition of new Affiliates with new products. We think that it is -- I would step back and say our business right now is really hitting on all cylinders. We're generating industry-leading organic growth and as well we have an extraordinarily attractive new investment opportunity set where we're executing -- we have been executing over a long period of time. And we're quite confident in our prospects for continued growth and accretion. And as you know, none of that contribution from new investments is included in our guidance. And so looking ahead, we're quite cognizant of the need to continue to execute and the degree to which we are all, as asset managers, dependent on the markets being at least benign if not positive. But we feel very good about our business prospects.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the floor back over to Mr. Healey for closing comments.","Sean M. Healey","Thank you, again, for joining us this morning. As you've heard, we're pleased with our results for the quarter and confident in our prospects for continued strong growth ahead. We look forward to speaking with you again in July.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jeff Parker, Vice President, Investor Relations for AMG. Thank you. You may begin.","Jeffrey Parker","Thank you for joining AMG to discuss our results for the third quarter of 2018.","In this conference call, certain matters discussed will constitute forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those projected due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those referenced in the Company's Form 10-K and other filings we make with the SEC from time to time. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during the call.","AMG will provide on the Investor Relations section of its website, at www.amg.com, a replay of the call, a copy of our announcement of our results for the quarter, a reconciliation of any non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of any estimates of the Company's economic earnings per share for future periods that are announced on this call and an investor presentation. AMG encourages investors to consult the Investor Relations section of its website regularly for updated information.","With us on the line to discuss the Company's results for the quarter are Nate Dalton, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Jay Horgen, Chief Financial Officer.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Nate.","Nate Dalton","Thanks, Jeff, and good morning everyone. Against the challenging industry backdrop, AMG generated solid results in the third quarter of 2018, including positive net client cash flows of approximately $1 billion and economic earnings per share of $3.45. Our results reflect the diversity of our global business and our strategic position in attractive, return-oriented products, where we continue to see significant client demand for our affiliate strategies and the distinctive investment return streams they create.","In terms of third quarter flow, we saw continued strong demand for alternatives, which included another quarter of very significant illiquid product fundraising from institutional clients, partially offset by softness in liquid alternatives in the retail channel, where investors tend to be more sensitive to short-term performance. The ongoing strength of our alternative products was partially offset by net outflows from equity strategies, driven primarily by emerging markets products and U.S. equity retail outflows.","At the highest level, we were pleased with our positive organic growth in the third quarter, despite industry headwinds. We benefited from having built a diverse global business and we're pleased to see a very broad array of product types. Affiliates and geographies contributed significantly to our flow composition, as we saw strong sales across Baring Asia, BlueMountain, Capula, EIG, Pantheon, and PFM within our alternative category. [Indiscernible] Frontier and Harding Loevner were notable contributors within our equities category.","Now, looking ahead, I want to address the current market environment and how we have built and continue to position our business. Obviously, it's been a volatile period. Global and U.S. equity markets have declined roughly 10% month to date as of Friday. And frankly that understates some of the underlying volatility we've been seeing. Anecdotal evidence points to some de-risking in this environment and you can see that reflected in this month's retail flow data.","In the short run, this obviously creates challenges in various segments of the asset management industry. But in terms of AMG, we've been evolving the business in anticipation of more volatile and fundamentals-driven market, with the highest quality active managers proving their worth. Volatile markets underscore the need for investors to diversify their equity and fixed income exposure, especially when markets are at elevated levels. Finally, within both traditional and alternative categories, volatile markets create environment with the best active managers, like our affiliates, who can significantly outperform their benchmarks in simple passive products.","Looking ahead, I would focus on three aspects of our business and strategic position. One, the diversity of the business we've built over the years. Two, the opportunities for the best active managers to outperform in this environment. And three, the quality of our affiliates and the distinctive return streams they produce.","First, on the diversity of our business. Over the last decade, we have deliberately doubled the proportion of our business in alternatives from approximately 20% in the beginning of 2008 to approximately 40% of assets under management today, spread across a very diverse set of high quality alternative products, while increasing our exposure to growing parts of client portfolios at the highly active alpha end of the barbell.","This evolution has come from both investments in new affiliates, as well as product innovation and development by us and our affiliates. Our alternatives business now has approximately $320 billion in assets under management, making AMG one of the largest alternative managers with one of the broadest and most diverse ranges of liquid and illiquid alternative strategies, managed by leading investors, including AQR, Baring Asia, BlueMountain, Capula, EIG, First Quadrant, Pantheon, PFM, Systematica, ValueAct and Winton.","In addition, our substantial exposure to uncorrelated alternative strategies should increase the stability and resilience of our business across market cycles, while most importantly, proving attractive to clients, so increasing the long-term organic growth potential of our business.","Second, turning to the opportunity for active management. In general, we have found that volatility is good for active managers, as opposed to steadily rising indices driven by [capital flows] [ph]. Simply put, a shift to a more fundamentals-driven markets provides a more favorable environment for the highest quality active managers, such as our affiliates to distinguish themselves. You can see this in the data from our recently updated study called the Boutique Premium, which we'll be reissuing shortly. The broad findings remain the same as when we first published the paper in 2015.","Primarily, the boutiques outperformed both non-boutiques and market indices over most long-term periods. Importantly, the data also shows that the outperformance advantage of boutique was most significant during more volatile periods in the market. This stands to reason as the elements that drive superior alpha generation by boutiques in the first place, including investment-led entrepreneurial culture, meaningful equity ownership by the investment professionals and the long duration alignment with clients and partners all support a long-term perspective, which encourages these firms and our investment team to maintain their investment processes through volatile periods.","Now, turning to the third theme, quality and expanding high quality products. Our affiliates have outstanding long-term track records of investment performance in attractive return-related areas. As you know, especially for institutions, medium to long term performance over a three, five, or even longer period is important in determining manager selection.","Our global equities and alternative strategies, both liquid and illiquid, have excellent long-term investment performance records. For example, approximately 70% of our global equities assets and over 85% of our liquid alternative strategies are ahead of benchmark over the last five years. While volatile environments contain challenges, they also bring opportunities and we and our affiliates have been innovating and developing new products with diverse, distinctive return stream, which is of course critically important to match evolving client needs.","Today, we continue to work closely with our affiliates to invest together in those products, packages, and distribution capabilities, we believe will provide the highest growth potential.","Now, we haven't just diversified products, but also clients. We've taken a business that was mostly U.S. clients and successfully expanded our client base, both through our affiliate business development teams, as well as through our global distribution platform, where we first opened an office in Australia, then expanded into the Middle East, Europe and parts of Asia, including Hong Kong, and now Japan.","And today, our global business represents a balanced mix between U.S. and non-U.S. clients. In the third quarter, we again saw the benefits of diversity in our global distribution strategy, as we generated positive net flows across each of our institutional coverage regions.","Looking ahead, while there may be short-term volatility, our unique distribution strategy, which combines the focused distribution resources at each of our affiliates with a leveragable scope and scale of AMG's global distribution platforms is increasingly effective, as leading clients worldwide and the intermediaries that serve them are consolidating their relationships with external managers and looking for more effective relationship and even partnership with a smaller universe of investment management firms.","Now, in addition to these elements of organic growth in our existing business, we have another proprietary growth engine. AMG's business model provides a significant opportunity to generate increased earnings growth, as well as product diversification through accretive investments in new affiliates. AMG's equity ownership succession solution is very attractive to asset management boutiques that value their independence, want a permanent solution and access to the scale distribution platforms we've built. Every boutique will inevitably have to address their firm\u2019s succession issue and we continue to actively develop our proprietary relationships with leading boutiques and while the pace of activity is inherently based on the dynamics of each prospective affiliate, we're making meaningful progress with our pipeline, while we remain focused on high quality new prospects and disciplined on pricing and alignment, particularly at this stage of the market cycle.","While maintaining the financial flexibility to invest in accretive new affiliates and continuing to execute on the other elements of our growth strategy, we also remain committed to consistently returning capital to our shareholders. As Jay will discuss further in a moment, we demonstrated this disciplined approach to capital allocation again in the third quarter.","Looking ahead, we are very confident in our ability to continue to enhance the quality, diversity and earnings power of our business and generate outstanding long-term shareholder value. Through our unique business model, we offer a diverse array of excellent, focused specialist managers, along with the scale and resources of a global asset management franchise, combined with a 25-year track record of deploying the cash flow generated by our business to create shareholder value.","With that, I'll turn it to Jay to discuss our results in more detail.","Jay Horgen","Thank you, Nate, and good morning. As Nate discussed, we were pleased with our third quarter results, which included positive organic growth against the backdrop of industry headwinds. As we enter the fourth quarter, we believe AMG is well positioned for an evolving macro environment, as heightened volatility and risk aversion creates opportunities for the highest quality active managers, such as our affiliates, to distinguish themselves.","The scale and diversity of our business across asset classes, client channels and geographies; the quality of our alpha-oriented product set and the unique structure of our partnerships with affiliates together enhance the stability of our cash flows and given our business strength and resilience, we are able to execute on our growth strategy throughout market cycle.","Before turning to the quarter, As Jeff mentioned, we have posted the investor presentation on our website this morning under Investor Relations, quarterly results. Going forward, we will be providing this updated presentation simultaneous with our earnings release, so that we can refer to certain information during our call.","I would like to call your attention to the incremental information we have provided this quarter in response to investor feedback. On page 9, we've included aggregate investment performance for global and U.S. equity products, as well as the liquid and illiquid products, which we believe best represents our long-term track records for these categories. I will be referring to this information in just a moment. In addition, on page 17 of the presentation, given that we are including selected composites for each product category through the first three quarters of 2018, I will no longer restate this information in my prepared remarks.","Now turning to the details for the quarter. Starting with alternatives, which account for 39% of our AUM, we had a strong quarter of organic growth with $4.5 billion of net flows and saw meaningful positive contributions from our illiquid product set, partially offset by outflows in our liquid alternatives in the retail channel. Focusing on illiquids, which include strategies, such as global and regional private equity, co-investments, credit, real assets, infrastructure and real estate, we had excellent level of funding in the third quarter, which drove our flows.","We continue to expect more fundraisings from flagship funds and scalable product line extensions as we look forward. As you can see on page 9 of our investor presentation, AMG's aggregate performance in illiquid is very strong with 92% of our recent funds outperforming industry benchmarks on a net IRR basis and 79% outperforming on a net multiple basis.","In our liquid alternative category, encompassing our multi-strategy, fixed income and equity relative value and systematic diversified strategies, while we experienced net outflows in the retail channel where clients tend to be more sensitive to short-term performance, we saw positive overall institutional flows into liquid alternatives across a broad array of products.","And while AMG's aggregate performance in liquid alternatives was challenged in the quarter year-to-date, our long-term investment performance remained strong, with 71% and 86% of our assets under management outperforming their benchmarks over a three and five-year period, respectively.","Before I leave alternatives, as Nate discussed, October's sharp reversal on equity markets highlights the importance of diversification and the benefits of alternatives in client portfolios. We have seen this diversity play out for us as our alternative strategies are generating meaningfully better performance in equities in October with the alternative portion of our market composite, as of Friday, down only 2% relative to the broader market equity markets, which were down approximately 10%.","Now turning to equities. In the global equities category, we saw net outflows of $2 billion in the quarter, primarily from emerging markets and global retail products. AMG continues to have strong long-term aggregate performance in this category with approximately 70% of our assets under management ahead of benchmark on a five-year basis.","In U.S. equities, we reported net outflows of $1.7 billion and while negative overall, we continue to see pockets of ongoing opportunity, while at the same time we are seeing lower levels of redemption. While AMG's performance in U.S. equities continues to be challenged relative to benchmarks over a three and five-year period, we believe the continued shift to a more fundamentals-driven market environment will improve relative performance.","Now turning to the multi-asset and other category, which accounts for 13% of our AUM and encompasses multi-asset and balanced mandates within our wealth management business, as well as a number of specialty fixed income and multi-asset products. Here, we posted another positive quarter with $0.1 billion in net flows, as demand trends remain in place for our wealth management business. While we have seen some weakness in our legacy fixed income products, our new products in this category are generating good momentum, especially within systematic fixed income.","Finally, turning to our quarterly flows by distribution channel, we saw significant strength within institutional, which represents 58% of our AUM, where we had $5.7 billion in net flows, driven by alternatives, especially from our illiquid fund raises. In the retail channel, which represents 28% of our AUM, we had net outflows of $4.9 billion, where we saw weakness in liquid alternatives, driven by recent performance combined with continued outflows in U.S. equities. Finally, in the high net worth channel, which represents 14% of our AUM, we reported positive net flows of $0.1 billion where the underlying demand trends remain in place.","Now turning to our financials. As you saw in the release, economic earnings per share increased 1% to $3.45 for the third quarter, which included net performance fees of $0.03. On a GAAP basis, we reported earnings per share of $2.34. For the third quarter, aggregate fees were flat at $1.3 billion from a year ago, while the ratio of aggregate fees to average assets under management declined year-over-year from 64 basis point to 61 basis point, which was driven in part by a lower level of performance fees and changes in the composition of our AUM.","Adjusted EBITDA decreased 7% to $237.8 million from a year ago, primarily due to lower other income, a couple of non-recurring expenses and investments that we made together with our affiliates in product development and distribution. Relative to EBITDA, economic net income decreased 4% to $184 million from a year ago, reflecting lower interest expense and a lower tax rate, while economic earnings per share grew 1% to $3.45, given lower year-over-year share count due to repurchase activity.","Turning to more specific modeling items. For the third quarter, the ratio of adjusted EBITDA to average assets under management was 11.4 basis points, or 11.3 basis points, excluding performance fees. Looking ahead, we expect adjusted EBITDA to average assets under management to be 12.4 basis points in the fourth quarter, reflecting a net performance fee assumption of approximately $0.40, as well as continued investment in product development and distribution capability.","Our share of interest expense was $19.6 million for the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, we expect our share of interest expense to remain at approximately $19 million. Our share of reported amortization and impairments was $44.9 million for the third quarter, including $22.2 million from affiliates accounted for under the equity method. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect our share of reported amortization and impairments to be approximately $42 million.","Turning to taxes. With regard to our tax rate in the third quarter, our effective GAAP tax rate was 27% and our cash tax rate was 19.9%. In the fourth quarter, while we expect our GAAP tax rate to be approximately 26%, we expect our cash tax rate to be impacted by a one-time benefit in the fourth quarter in the range of $20 million to $25 million, primarily from the final disposition of Ivory. Excluding the non-recurring item, we expect our cash tax rate to be approximately 19% going forward. Intangible-related deferred taxes were $12.2 million in the third quarter. For the fourth quarter, we expect intangible-related deferred taxes to be approximately $13 million, excluding this non-recurring item.","Other economic items was $2 million for the third quarter. For modeling purposes, we expect other economic items to be approximately $1 million per quarter. Our adjusted weighted average share count for the third quarter was 53.2 million and we expect it to be approximately 52.6 million for the fourth quarter and we now expect our adjusted weighted average share count for the full year to be approximately 53.7 million.","Turning to our balance sheet. In the third quarter, we paid a $0.30 per share dividend and we repurchased 113 million shares. Looking to the fourth quarter, while we expect to repurchase approximately 100 million, the amount and timing will depend on market conditions and potential new investments.","Taking a step back over the past decade, we prioritize flexibility as well as the reduction of balance sheet leverage, which gives us ample capacity. Given that capacity today, we are well positioned to both deploy capital through a full market cycle as we execute on our growth initiatives and deliver on our commitment to consistently return capital to shareholders.","Now we'll be happy to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Carrier","Thanks guys. Maybe first question, just on the alternatives. So clearly, from a flow standpoint, you guys have been doing well. It seems like on the performance in -- whether it's you guys or the industry, things have been a bit more muted. But yes, just wanted to get your sense of when we think about -- when we see the good growth coming in alternatives, how does that like impact the outlook in terms of like E&I. So whether it's ownership and how that can potentially impact fee rate or even performance fees when you're in an environment where it's obviously weaker and then maybe the long-term trend?","Nate Dalton","Great. So thanks for the question. It's Nate and I'll start and then ask Jay to pick up the second half. So I think the most important thing when you think about our alternatives business, if you will, is it really breaks into a number of different categories. So in the materials we've posted on the website, we've broken into four groups. So there is a private equity -- and they behave differently and we're having different experiences within them, which I think points to the benefits of the diversification that we've built. So, for example, we have a private equity and real asset, which includes infrastructure and private client and other things.","And that business is behaving one way, which is right now there's incredible amount of demand, there is a really good sort of product development going on, the take-up through our distribution and through our affiliates own distribution is fantastic. And so that part of the business, and both Jay and I talked about how that's a part of our flow profile right now. But that's something we also just see continuing to grow and importantly, diversify as well. And when you talk about how that flows through, obviously the performance fee, or carry piece of that is of course growing, but it's certainly something that grows out into the -- kind of starts two, three years out and grows kind of thing. So that's kind of one part of the book.","Then in the more -- what we talk about sort of more liquid, we have sort of a fixed income and kind of relative equity, relative value book and that's a business line that generally had -- industrywide has had kind of more muted returns for a while, but I think in these volatile environments that's performing reasonably well. I think the multi-strat business, not an entirely different story, which is, it's been kind of muted returns and clearly how that will perform going forward.","And then we've a systematic diversified business, which you've heard us talk about as having kind of more challenged performance for a while now and then -- but in the current environment, again, it's the kind of thing that you would expect, at least has the opportunity, because it contains so many kind of uncorrelated positive expected return streams to have the opportunity to perform.","So I think we're very bullish about the fact that we both diversified the equity business, including all these, as you heard us talk about, but then also the diversity we've built within this, which over time should provide stability to a bunch of different long-term business, including the flow profile, as well as earnings profile. I don't know, Jay, if you want to --","Jay Horgen","I'll just pick up and talk about the E&I impact. And, starting with -- a calendar year -- any one calendar year, it can be hard to predict, in part because of the performance fee, opportunity in that calendar year. But if you think about it just in -- over time, the E&I impact of raising more alternatives is generally good positive thing, the management fee typically is higher. Performance fee opportunity, as Nate said, in the private equity vehicles that tend to build over time, and we're seeing that happen for us. Remember, we are on MiFID I, so we only report that when it crystallizes. So we are seeing the mix shift longer term be a positive E&I benefit to us. But again, in any one period, It's a little harder, because it depends on which one, what's the ownership level and what the performance fee is, but I think the best outlook for us is that this private equity and alternative build will play out in our E&I over time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler with Credit ","Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Craig Siegenthaler","Hey, good morning, Nate, Jay. I just wanted to start with a big picture question -- business model question, which is actually sort of three parts. So I'll jump back in the queue after this one, but just given the evolving industry backdrop, what do you view as the main benefits now of the multi-boutique model? Also how has AMG's business model evolved over the last five years? And more importantly, can you remind us the different ways you can leverage the benefits of scale for your affiliates?","Nate Dalton","Good morning. Thank you very much for that question. I'm glad you asked, because I think -- first, I'm going to speak mostly to our business rather than multi-boutiques or maybe wholly to our business as opposed to other multi-boutiques, because I really do think our business is different in some fundamental ways. And so let me start there, which is if you think about AMG today across our affiliates, we have incredible level of diversity and we talked about this in the script -- incredible level of diversity. That diversity is of distinctive return streams. So each of our affiliates is independently producing these return streams. And we believe there is a level of excellence to that and we talked about that in terms of some of the performance thing. So you have diverse, distinct, excellent manufacturing.","But then the thing that I think is different about our business is, we've been able to achieve that diversity and the scale without having to combine or compromise affiliate cultures, right? So each of our affiliates is a truly distinct business, which we think is really important from the standpoint of the manufacturing return streams. That is a place where generally, on the active side, scale is not a benefit. So diverse, distinctive, excellent manufacturing, we've achieved that scale without having to combine or compromise cultures. And then again, really important thing to understand is we can continue to add to that scale significantly without having to compromise cultures. So it's not just, we have a business model that allows us to manage that diversity today, but because of the way we've built it we're able to continue to add to that scale without, again, combining or compromising cultures.","And I don't think there is another business that manages that level of diversity and scale without compromising cultures. Others may be as large asset bases, but not with that same level of diversity, really distinct diversity underneath with different cultures. So I think that's kind of a very important point I would hope people internalize.","The second piece, which I would go to, which I think is really more your third question, but also picks up some of the evolution. And the real challenge for us and I think for other multi-boutiques is how do you bring, or how do we bring that diverse, excellent scale to bear effectively for clients and intermediaries. So I think that's the challenge. And here I'd make a couple of points.","So, first, each of our affiliates very effectively bring their products or services to some market segments in some geographies very effectively by themselves. Right? And that's -- sort of you're looking backwards. That's what's -- in part what's attracted us to them in the first place and you've heard us talk a little bit about what we look for in high quality going forward as well.","So each affiliate does it very effectively themselves. But, there are lots of ways to leverage our scope and scale to more effectively bring the products to different geographies and market segments. And we, obviously, for more than a decade now, we've been building out our global distribution platform, we think a in a pretty differentiated way. That is an example where we can leverage our scale in a very flexible way for the benefits of our -- that we've got proven success now again, so we've been building those for over a decade.","I do think, and this goes to your last five years point that I do think we are making investments, not just in building out regional distribution, but also in packaging and distribution, operational capabilities as well. And we've talked about that on some calls in a couple of different ways. So one is, I think on the last call, we spent some time talking about how we're doing that in bringing illiquid products into DC and retail and we talked about working within affiliate to build a 40 Act fund or to build UCIT. This past quarter we closed, and there the dollars were not -- the dollars were modest, but we closed our first kind of Feeder Fund, sold into -- by one of our affiliates, sold into a large broker dealer in the U.S.","So we're building those capabilities. And these are just examples. I mean, we talked about Japan a bunch last quarter. These are examples of how we are continuing to extend what we've done with our global distribution platforms for the benefits of our affiliates. And again, we're doing it in a very flexible way that allows us to leverage the scale without interfering with those unique cultures. And again, I think we do that at a significant scale, which allows us to get to the level of diversity that we talked about before.","Maybe I'll add -- maybe I'll add one more to it, which again goes to what have we been doing recently and how will we take this forward, which is, you've heard us talk for a while about this trend of clients and intermediaries trying to consolidate relationships and that's much more efficient for them as they're trying to manage their business. And I think, again, because of the diversity and scale we're at place, where if we do this well, they can get access to all of this manufacturing in a very efficient way. And this is something that we've been working on for a while.","So the example I'd add is, this past quarter, we entered into a memorandum of understanding with a large European financial institution to take the next step in doing that, because that was just bringing our affiliate products to market using our manufacturing, combined with their packaging and distribution.","Obviously, we have to support the distribution as well. I don't want to make too big a deal out of this, because it's not really going to start -- we don't think products will start coming on line until kind of Q1 2019, but it's an example of we are continuing to work to find more and more effective ways to bring all of that kind of excellent, diverse scale, again, truly diverse, not just different product themes, but really people who maintain their own very independent cultures, bring all that to bear for our affiliates. And so I think for us that's the competitive advantage of our business model, which is the ability to gather all of that excellent diverse manufacturing and then add to it by being able to bring some of the benefits of scale to bear.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Alexander Blostein","Thanks. Hey, good morning guys. I was wondering if you could comment on the buyback and capital return priorities here. So, it's a bit light, I guess relative to the pace you guys have bought back stock in the first part of the year. Why the pullback? Jay, I think I heard you say another $100-ish-million in Q4. Given the valuation of the stock and no near-term deals, it feels like we would expect a little more from you guys. So, just some color on that would be helpful.","Jay Horgen","Thanks, Alex. So, yes, you characterize it as a pullback, but I don't think it's a pullback at all. In fact, the last eight quarters, I think we've probably averaged about $100 million. So it seems right in the zone of where we've been. In fact, it's a little more than -- the $113 million is a little more than $100 million. But just taking a step back, just making a couple of comments here, we're mindful of the market volatility, right -- market for our stock, but also market volatility. We also -- as you heard Nate say, we're investing in both new initiatives, but also we're optimistic about our new investment pipeline, and that was in my prepared remarks, I think we're being mindful of that. We are committed to -- always committed to a disciplined allocation of capital, which really includes balancing these growth initiatives with capital return. And again, it's against the backdrop of an appropriate leverage ratio, so that we can invest through a cycle. So I don't think anything is different, but we have always been committed to a capital return strategy that balances all of those initiatives.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Katz with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.","Bill Katz","Okay, thank you very much for taking the question. And just staying on that capital management theme for a second as well. I just maybe broaden it out. Can you step back a little bit and talk a little bit about how your capital management is evolving against a couple of things. Number one, just sort of the shifting of the sort of asset management ecosystem, and is it still sort of credible to continue to go after sort of mid-sized players at this point in time? Number one. And then just sort of given the -- what looks to be pretty elevated multiples in the private market, how are you thinking about that versus buyback right here? Thank you.","Nate Dalton","Maybe I'll start just on the part of both this question and a little bit the prior, which is how we're thinking about the M&A environment, because I do think -- I don't disagree with some of the dynamics, but implicit in your question was both just what kinds of firms we are looking at and then also how we are thinking about the pricing. So maybe it would be useful to just level-set on that one. And so, look, we've been running this basic model and approach for now almost exactly 25 years, which is being -- try to build a business where we are the best institutional partner to these excellent boutique firms and I don't think that strategy changes. And I also think, generally, the firms we are partnering with are not trying to do a trade or whatever, but the firms are trying to partner with the ones that are really trying to pick a permanent institutional partner, right. So that's -- I don't think that's changing at all.","Now, of course, we're being disciplined and here I agree with part of what was in your question, which is -- your commentary on some prices that have been paid. And, look, when we're looking at new investments, we are disciplined across a bunch of different dimensions, right. We're very -- we're disciplined across the quality of the business and we talked a little bit about that last quarter, but that has a bunch of different component parts to it, but we're very disciplined about the quality of the business that we're looking at. We're very disciplined about can we get the right long-term alignment with the principles of the business. And, of course, we're very disciplined on pricing. And so -- and also implicit in both this question and I think a little bit the prior, when we're talking about this discipline, we're also measuring this, as Jay said in the prior answer, we're measuring this against the opportunities to invest in our business, either in the operations of our business or the shares of our business. So I think we're looking at all of those. When we say discipline, I think we're putting all those things into it.","All of that said, we think there continues to be an outstanding secular opportunity to partner with the best boutique firms and, look, as we always say, the timing of investment is driven by the dynamics, and as I just said, most of these firms don't have to do anything at any sort of point of time, but also -- nether do we. And so, look, we're making good progress in these things we're looking at and -- but look, fundamentally, I agree with the part of your question, which is looking at some of the prices, I think there are definitely questions there.","So maybe I'll add just one more thing and I don't know, obviously, whether the volatility we're experiencing continues or not. But the other thing I'll say is, I think our experience has been in prior volatile periods, volatile times are good for us as a competitor in looking at making new investments, because the strength, scale, track record, importantly, as I said 25 years, are more important than ever as prospective affiliates focus on the partner that they're bringing on board as a potentially permanent partner. And so that's I think the way I would characterize it today. And so, I think put aside one quarter here or there, I think the secular opportunity for us is to continue to invest in just great manufacturing businesses, great boutique affiliates, I think is strong as ever.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Shutler with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Chris Shutler","Hey guys, good morning. I think Nate in the prepared remarks, as well as in the press release you continue to use the word proprietary a lot when talking about the pipeline, but we've seen a number of deals, particularly in the oil space and others are using the -- I think the phrase permanent capital partner as well in talking about their strategy. So would love to get any comments there and confidence in how proprietary the pipeline really is.","Nate Dalton","Yes. So, look, I think I'd say a couple of things there. So, first, we do have a proprietary effort. I think you should also assume we're looking at all of the transactions that are in the marketplace as they go and I'd probably just refer to my prior answer, which is, look, some of those businesses don't make any sense for us as they are predicated, for example, on bringing together overlapping capabilities or whatever in that kind of one category, sort of the cost cutting consolidation kinds of things.","But the other -- we are remaining disciplined across all of those dimensions I talked about and there may be or have been firms where you look at them and you say, well, that meets that discipline on one of those dimensions, but not on other of the dimensions. And so, we are staying disciplined.","On the permanence point, I think -- and I don't want to comment specifically about any one model here or there, but on the permanence point, I think it's on -- they are unproven models, and I think here I would point you to the fact we've been running effectively this business of being permanent institutional partners to great boutiques for 25 years through full cycles. And I think some of those models may not have thought through all the different elements of that. And so, again -- but again, I'm not commenting on any one here or there, but I think that is certainly something we see.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Dan Fannon","Thanks, good morning. My question is around flows and just kind of the outlook. First off, appreciate the increased disclosure around performance. But I guess, as we think about October, the de-risking I think you mentioned, can you talk about any change in client behavior and in particular, if you could address AQR, which is I think a focus for a lot of investors, given its size and contribution to you in terms of -- we've seen a slowdown in retail and how we should think about that for larger component of institutional and whether you as a firm in aggregate can still post -- you can still post inflows if AQR is in fact in a bit of a struggling period?","Nate Dalton","Yes, so let me start here. And then maybe I'll ask Jay to pick up some of the pieces of it. But, look, on your specific question, I would just say, look at the diversity of the business that we've built and AQR is certainly an important part of our business, a very important part of our business, but it's a part of our business. And so, yes, I'll just point to the quarter we just had, but let me address specifically your fourth quarter comment, which is I'll make a couple observations.","So, first, at a high level, the trends remain intact, right. So we continue to see good illiquid fundraising, especially in institutional, some retail and we do see continuing challenging retail liquid outflows. I think those trends will remain intact. As I said, I do think the volatility that we're experiencing and have recently experienced will have -- is having a short-term effect on some clients, so slower decision processes. I think that stands to reason, it shouldn't be surprising. And then I would just remind folks, I think that kind of Q4 is just generally a seasonally weak quarter. With tax [law selling] any of the kind of Q4, Q1 effects we've talked about before on single-year and multi-lock vehicles.","But in terms of the overall positioning and I'll come back to the first point on AQR, in terms of overall positioning, the affiliate performance, and Jay talked about, this is good. The pace of innovation is really good, both new strategies and extensions of existing strategies. The pace of activity in distribution, packaging, geographies, channels is really good. And I think we're increasingly effective at bringing affiliates into the markets, channels and into places that are looking for more efficient ways to get access to all this manufacturing. So I think all of those trends remain in play. I don't know if Jay \u2013 ","Jay Horgen","I was just going to pick up on the one component of the conversation, which is just how does it translate into earnings and in contribution. And I think here, Nate already said it, diversity is really important. It's always been important to us and I want to make sure we're not confusing a period of time where we have a little bit of soft performance fee outlook in the calendar year that we're in, as opposed to the long term.","So as it relates to the earnings profile, we do see AQR, but a number of other large affiliates continuing to contribute at a really high level to us and in any one year, where we have a lower performance fee contribution, it really in no way diminishes the long-term value of that performance fee stream. So I think on an earnings basis, it might get conflated, but really AQR is strong, so are our number of other larger affiliates. and, of course, we're in this period of time where we're seeing a lot of follow through from the illiquid private equity style and that's just building a future sort of pipeline of carry and additional earnings into the future.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Lee with KBW. Please proceed with your question.","Robert Lee","Thanks, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe Nate, Jay, I'd like to go back to the M&A topic a little bit. So as you think about the investment landscape, what's maybe changed, whether it's in terms of size or scope or capabilities of the prospective affiliates you are looking at, maybe over the last couple of years. I mean, not to pick on, say, Ivory, but a relatively small firm, came as part of, I guess, a multi-boutique acquisition, in a way. But, how do you think about kind of the size or type or scalability of the affiliates you're interested in versus maybe what you used to look at or would be willing to do several years ago?","Nate Dalton","Thanks for the question. So we talked a little bit, I think, on our last call about this. How do we -- what do we mean by when we say high quality and I think you've captured many of the elements, which are, we're looking for firms that we think have the ability to grow in this environment and the environments we expect to come. Some of that is the orientation of the principles of the firm, right, what are they trying to achieve.","Some of it is, what can they achieve on their own, and some of it is what can we do together. And so, I think it is, we are looking for more complete firms, I'll say it that way, in terms of orientation to grow and evolve the capability set that allow them to grow and evolve. But we're also still attracted to firms that are really doing one thing, they're doing it very, very well, but we have the opportunity, and this is the part that I think has evolved a bit over the past couple of years. We have the ability to work with that firm in ways that are additive to the whole. And so, I think we talk about high quality as either that kind of more complete firm or something that together we can grow and evolve and it's additive to the whole, whether it's client dialog or what have you as well.","And so, I think this also relates a bit to the prior question, which is, well, how does that manifest, or what does that mean. And so we have a set of proprietary relationships. Our pipeline includes conversations that we've been having. In some cases, the better part of a quarter century. And we're building relationships, maintaining relationships, evaluating these firms, and we're looking at them through the screen of the evolving landscape that we're seeing.","One other point that I'll make here is, as we've been growing our distribution platforms, as we've been having dialogs with intermediaries and clients who are already, or might use multiple affiliates, we're getting better and better at certainly the near side of the demand characteristics we should be looking for. But we think also strategically understanding what these intermediaries, or what these end-users are looking for as they're trying to solve their evolving challenges over time, and that just makes us better as we're looking on the front end for prospective new affiliates and this is something that we're still in the early stages of, but we are getting better and better at all the time.","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Bedell","Great, thanks, good morning folks. Maybe, Jay, just to circle back on the coming quarter, in the fourth quarter, can you talk a little bit about the performance to-date? I know the [alternatives] are doing relatively well, we're measuring about negative 7% on the mutual fund side and I know that's overstating the downside, given your own mix, but maybe if you could talk about it on a firmwide basis. And then on the fee rate, I think your guidance included the $40 million -- I'm sorry, $0.40 of performance fees. Is that -- if I'm calculating it right, is that about a stable fee rate ex the performance fees around [$11 million -- $11.4 million, $11.5 million].","Jay Horgen","Thanks, Brian. So I'll take your last one first, because that's an easy one. Yes it's $11.3 million, [$11.4 million] , so that's stable to the last quarter's, that's an easy one. Maybe I'll take a step back and kind of wrap altogether the guidance that we gave and also include kind of where we are on marks through last Friday. So I mentioned in my prepared remarks there are -- the portion -- the market deposit for the portion that's our alternative book is down about 2%.","For equities, it's approaching [10%]. That blend with multi-asset in there as well is about 5.5%. So, yes, it's much better than the 7%, and I think it speaks to the diversity and I suspect we're doing better than some of our peers or maybe most of our peers in that regard. Obviously that will have an impact on the fourth quarter, but it has more of an impact on a full year basis, as we've already begun the fourth quarter.","The guidance specifically on performance fees, maybe I'll step back for a moment and just talk about guidance from our last call to this call on performance fees, which has changed a bit. And specifically, it's around the beta-sensitive products, they were tracking to a much higher potential contribution for the year for us. And in the last call, we also mentioned that certain of our less correlated products, including many of the systematic products, were at or below high watermark and were not expected to give us a contribution in 2018.","Interestingly, given the significant equity market pullback and the increased volatility in October, we've seen a sharp reversal of these trends, affecting our fourth quarter performance fee opportunity. On the one hand, we've reduced our expectation for the beta sensitive performance fees. But on the other hand, we are more optimistic about the improvement in investment performance at our less correlated products. So we may be too conservative here with the $0.40. This all happened in the last two weeks, but I think we are seeing those trends, it will take a little more time for our less correlated products to -- now that they've improved significantly, it will take some time for them to really generate more performance fee. So we see the outlook for 2019 much improved in that regard. And there may be enough performance in the fourth quarter where this number is conservative.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Davitt with Autonomous Research. Please proceed with your question.","Patrick Davitt","Hey, good morning. Some other managers have been highlighting still very strong institutional demand for global and emerging market strategies through the [ROW] we saw and even into October. Curious if you're seeing a similar trend, and within that vein, as value has started to outperform, are you seeing increased demand for value equity in the U.S.?","Nate Dalton","Yes, let me take that. So I do think we've been seeing good demand trends generally. So the sort of the high level point of the dimension is, generally our impression is sort of remaining intact, which includes demand trends for global equities. I think on the EM side, I don't know, I mean, it's hard for me to see that we have a narrower product set there, but -- and so I think our judgment is much more [U.S.] and correct to us. I think the point you make on value is a really good one and I'm glad you raised it, which is included among our affiliates are some just world-class value equity managers.","And so -- and again, it's been a long time, right, that value growth disparity and we can talk of course about the various reasons for it, but we really believe that if we get to, or if we are in a more fundamentally driven market that the value measure we have, we'll have the opportunity to outperform significantly and also open up and take on new flow, because I think the challenge -- I am just generalizing it, but the challenge for many of them was finding enough good opportunities to put capital to work. And so, we've had, either actually closed or just -- people who are not really marketing the product, the challenge was they had to put their existing client assets to work first and had reasonable high cash levels as well.","And so, whether you look at like a Yacktman, who I think is the Number 1 performing -- I think two of their funds are, [one and two] years, I think is Number 1, Number 2 performing funds in that category, or the Tweedy, Browne funds that are now top quartile.","I mean like we have just great value managers there. And so if that market evolution -- we're much more value heavy certainly on our U.S. equity side, but even including our global category. And so if that evolution is happening that absolutely plays well for us and we've seen it in -- certainly -- and these are all just early days and all that -- been seen it in flowing outflows in a little bit elevated sales. And so, yes, absolutely that will be a very positive trend for us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Carrier with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Carrier","Thanks guys. Just one other one, and this is more just on the modeling, when you think about the outlook. When I think about the industry trends, mostly on the organic growth, obviously it's been more of a headwind. You guys, from an asset mix are relatively well positioned. But when you think about some of the things that you can offer to the affiliates, are there other maybe big areas to focus on to maybe improve the scale or improve the efficiencies, but still maintain the independence of the investment teams in the investment strategies. Just wanted to hear your take, just given that the -- maybe the top line or the flow growth is different than it has been over the last, say, 20 years.","Nate Dalton","Yes. So, look, I think there is absolutely more we can do to bring our affiliate -- the excellent distinctive return streams managed by our affiliates that kind of diversity at scale without interfering with culture that I was talking about before. There's absolutely more we can be doing, I would say a lot more we can be doing in partnership with them to bring those return streams to market. But I also don't think it's like a switch. I think this is an evolution that we've been on for more than -- as I said, it's more than a decade, it's 12 or 13 years now, kind of deliberately building out, paying attention to the pace of change, the level of investment, the returns we get on those investments, but deliberately building out the -- we've called them global distribution platforms, but it's institutional distribution platforms, they can be retail distribution platforms.","Again, we opened Japan, which I think we are very optimistic about, we opened in partnership with another one of our affiliates, Pantheon. Other affiliates are going to that market together with us. And each market is different, each market has its own characteristics and we need to be doing it in a way that again, in your question and what I said before, in a way that doesn't interfere with the thing that makes these firms special in the first place, which is their ability to produce these distinctive return streams.","Now we're having an ever-increasing pace of conversations with our affiliates on how do they use the capacity of those return streams, how do they use the capacity of their investment processes, and at the same time, we are having more and more of those conversations with large pools of capital and large intermediaries. I kind of quickly referenced in an offhand way, we did enter into a memorandum of understanding, first one for us, with a distribution partner, European financial institution. Now that would be a new extension.","Now it will start launching product, we believe in 2019. But our operations teams and their operations teams are working on it. Our distribution people and their distribution people, both in the affiliate level and at AMG are working on making this really successful the way for them to access the scale and diversity. And for some subset of our affiliates and for some subsets of their products, this could be a really exciting opportunity. But we're having lots and lots of those conversations, this just happens to be the first one that's gotten to this stage. But they also require us to do the work ahead of time in terms of selection and then we have to make sure we execute in excellent fashion. So all of that goes, I think there is lots we can do.","On the efficiency side, look, I do think there are things that we can do there as well and we have done some, also for a very long time. So for example, we have a very well developed legal and compliance program where we have, again for more than a decade. I think we started it roughly around the same time we started building our global distribution platforms, in part because we have to do a good job facing off with each of the regulatory regimes in all of these different places we're bringing our affiliates to. And so, we have been doing things like that. We've been doing things like joint purchasing in areas where we make sense, but we do all of that with an eye toward how do we bring the benefits of scale to bear, but only where they don't interfere with the thing that makes our affiliates so special, which is that diversity and autonomy and independence as part of -- with AMG as a permanent institutional partner. So being able to bring all that scale to bear. So there's lots of things like that that we do as well.","But, look, at the end of the day, your question captures the challenge, which is, first, each of these firms does a great job bringing their products and services to some markets and some geographies and some channels in an excellent fashion themselves. And they are uneven, right. Some will do more of that themselves, some will do less of it, and we've been building deliberately distribution platforms and others, because this is a business about how do we help them grow distribution platforms to knit carefully to what they all do in a way that serves the range of affiliates we have, the range of products and capabilities we have and how we bring that to bear, again, very effectively for clients and intermediaries, the people who are going to use us [indiscernible], and that's where we have an increasing amount of our focus.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Alexander Blostein","Hey guys, just a quick follow-up on performance fees. Jay, can you remind us what percentage of AUM is subject to high watermark, kind of where that bucket stands today as we start thinking about next year? And then when it comes to the illiquids, understand the timing difference, but since you guys have been realizing quite a bit in the last couple of quarters, obviously it shows up in your AUM. When should we expect the strategies to contribute to performance fees?","Jay Horgen","Yes, so let me take the last one first. So we have been in a kind of an 18 month pretty significant fundraise cycle for us. A number of our affiliates, not all, but a number of them, we've partnered with in the last, say, five years. And when we made those partnerships, we had a lower share of the prior funds contribution. So when you look forward this 18 month period, it usually takes three, four, in some cases five years, but three and four years to get through the investment period.","At that time you'll see additional performance fees come through that., I mean, I think for now it looks to be in that 2020 range, maybe before for some of the bespoke and more single strategy or single separate account type mandate. So starting to see some next year, see it building into 2020 and certainly 2021 and it's going to be pretty significant, just given the fund raises that we just gone through and frankly, looking forward, we see that fundraising cycle continue and we way undershot the amount and the duration of that. So we continue to see that very strong.","Going to the performance fee question that you had asked. Look, I gave you sort of the qualitative answer. I think quantitatively, we don't think the right way to look at it is some percentage of AUM. It really does depend on lots of different factors, including our share of that affiliate, the sort of magnitude of outperformance in certain cases. So when we think about it, we bucket-ize it by categories. Earlier this year the systematic sort of category was under high watermark, I said that in my earlier remarks, that was really the only category that had that issue that has changed. We are going to add around high watermark and that's sort of the case in all categories. So we do see the potential for contribution, especially in '19 from all categories.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our time allowed for questions. I will turn the floor back to Mr. Dalton for any final comments.","Nate Dalton","Thank you again for joining us this morning. We were pleased with our results for the quarter and we're very confident in our ability to create long-term shareholder value. And with that, we look forward to speaking with you again in January. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."]}}
